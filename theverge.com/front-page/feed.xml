    <title>Dell sued over Alienware laptop’s ‘unprecedented upgradeability’ claims  </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B1ikxe"&gt;Dell is being sued in California over its claims that its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18167444/alienware-area-51m-desktop-laptop-features-price-release-date-ces-2019"&gt;Alienware Area-51m R1 laptop&lt;/a&gt; would offer “unprecedented upgradeability,” &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/dell-hit-with-fraud-case-over-alienware-area-51m-upgrade-claims"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Alienware customer Robert Felter is accusing the company of running a “false and misleading” marketing campaign, in which it promised that the laptop’s core components, including the CPU and GPU, could be swapped out for more powerful models. A year later, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256786/alienware-area-gaming-laptops-dell-spec-boost-intel-10th-gen-nvidia-gpu"&gt;Area-51m R1’s successor was announced&lt;/a&gt; with new components not available as upgrades for the original model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEBaXH"&gt;“Consumers were misled by Dell’s false and misleading marketing campaign and paid a significant premium for the Area 51M R1 under the incorrect belief that this ‘unprecedented upgradeability’ would save them money in the long run by allowing them to upgrade their laptop’s Core Components rather than having to purchase an entirely new upgraded laptop,” the suit alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gR5mMS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Consumers were misled by Dell’s false and misleading marketing campaign”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4TwhOJ"&gt;Dell announced the Alienware Area 51-m R1 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18167444/alienware-area-51m-desktop-laptop-features-price-release-date-ces-2019"&gt;at CES 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The laptop offered a variety of 8th and 9th Gen Intel CPU options (including the i7-8700, i7-9700K, or i9-9900K processors) and graphics cards including Nvidia’s RTX 2070 and 2080. However, when the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256786/alienware-area-gaming-laptops-dell-spec-boost-intel-10th-gen-nvidia-gpu"&gt;Area-51m R2&lt;/a&gt; was announced the following May, it offered 10th Gen Intel CPUs and new GPUs including the RTX 2070 Super and RTX 2080 Super &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256845/alienware-area-51m-r1-r2-specs-upgradable-parts-gpu-dgff-limited"&gt;not available as upgrades&lt;/a&gt; for the R1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhUIwm"&gt;If you go back and look at the specific promises Dell made when it announced the original laptop, it doesn’t seem to have &lt;em&gt;technically &lt;/em&gt;broken any of them. It said the laptop would only support Intel CPUs that used its Z390 chipset, which was compatible with the 8th and 9th-generation processors in the original R1 laptop. However, when Dell announced the R2, the new 10th-generation Intel CPUs used a new 400-series chipset. Considering it was Intel’s decision to change its chipset, this decision was arguably out of Dell’s hands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vedrmJ"&gt;Meanwhile, when it comes to upgrades for the laptop’s graphics card, Dell told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; at the time of the R1’s announcement that it’d “like to be able to say yes [to new GPU upgrades]; right now, we have no idea.” Effectively, customers could upgrade a lower end version of the laptop to a higher-end model, but only within the same generation of components. That left customers who bought the top-end model out of luck when a new generation of components rolled around.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Dell’s marketing promised “unprecedented upgradeability” for the laptop. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aGDDNm"&gt;The suit alleges that Dell should have been aware that Intel and Nvidia’s unannounced products wouldn’t work with the laptop. It claims Dell works closely with both companies, and that it should know the specs of their products prior to them becoming public. “Yet, despite being in possession of such designs, and with the full knowledge that the design of the Area 51M R1 could not accommodate future NVIDIA and INTEL chipsets, Dell launched a global campaign to mislead the public that the Area 51M R1 was upgradeable,” it says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQLslY"&gt;The question now is whether that means Dell’s claims about “unprecedented upgradeability” (which are &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/laptops/area-51m-r1/spd/alienware-17-area51m-laptop?AID=8900246&amp;amp;cjevent=d7a6593bc76011eb821a014e0a180512&amp;amp;cjdata=MXxZfDB8WXwxNjA2ODI1MDcwOTk1&amp;amp;gacd=9694607-23736398-5750457-266319267-127795103&amp;amp;dgc=af&amp;amp;VEN1=12839518-8900246-tomshardware-gb-1382540981155333000-Future%20Publishing%20Limited&amp;amp;dclid=CM2a8YP-hPECFYVmGwod6g8JJw&amp;amp;nclid=sCnLdWKocO4tlIbByYhQWxGscbEIKLu2GjmkogdKVjrVGC0eNRCJWg4hSIUGJ4t1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;still live&lt;/a&gt; on its website) were misleading. “Dell’s advertisement to the public didn’t place any restrictions on the upgradeability of the laptop,” Felter’s lawyer David W. Kani told &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;. “They also never disclosed that those with the highest spec CPU and/or GPU that their device would not be upgradeable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EGQR2Y"&gt;Dell declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt; on the lawsuit, and did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. In the filing, Felter is seeking damages, relief, and attorneys fees for himself and other affected customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple apparently has a spatial audio event right after today’s WWDC keynote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/97C8gYA5zEOmOk-udEa7arBQExM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69415126/DSCF2672.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RbWUnT"&gt;Apple appears to have planned a dedicated event on Apple Music’s upcoming spatial audio feature for later today. According to a video that &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/06/apple-music-event-june7-after-wwdc/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; says&lt;/a&gt; was uploaded to &lt;em&gt;Apple Music &lt;/em&gt;as a teaser&lt;em&gt; — &lt;/em&gt;it’s since been removed — Apple will broadcast a special event called “Introducing Spatial Audio.” The event doesn’t appear on the Worldwide Developers Conference schedule but is set for 3PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rzXx0I"&gt;That is, of course, immediately after the presumed conclusion of Apple’s much anticipated 1PM ET keynote to kick off this year’s online WWDC, where the company is expected to announce its annual updates to each of its operating systems. Later in the afternoon at 5PM ET Apple will give its usual “State of the Union” presentation, which is more focused on developers than the opening keynote and addresses various technical aspects of the company’s platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xvwrXDo5W-2ZX2-IMMxKqj_xOTQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22642181/apple_music_june_7_post.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gwhGpC"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440090/apple-music-lossless-audio-dolby-atmos-support-audio"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; spatial audio for Apple Music last month alongside the addition of lossless files to the streaming service. Spatial audio will work with AirPods, built-in speakers on Apple devices, and third-party headphones, and should provide more immersive Dolby Atmos mixes compared to regular stereo audio. Apple previously said the feature would launch in June, so a mention of the release date at the WWDC keynote wouldn’t have been surprising, but it seems the company wants to give it a little more time in the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="323wVv"&gt;For more on what to expect at WWDC today, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22457534/apple-wwdc-2021-rumors-ios-15-new-macbook-pro-what-to-expect"&gt;here’s our preview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk tweets that Tesla’s Plaid Plus is ‘canceled’ because ‘Plaid is just so good’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JXGNVgE7v_bajt3ryy3xTyzXiUA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69414090/twarren_08202017_1939_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gyiy13"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk tweeted Sunday that the automaker’s Model S Plaid Plus is “canceled,” since the basic Plaid is “just so good.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TE9jpr"&gt;Tesla has been teasing its Model S Plaid since 2019, and Musk said late last month that delivery for the vehicle — which  will have top speeds of 200 mph and range between 390 and 412 miles— would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/29/22459617/musk-tweets-model-s-tesla-plaid-delivery-delayed-again-june-10th"&gt;pushed to June 10th&lt;/a&gt; as it needed “one more week of tweak.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KafvAo"&gt;He also tweeted Sunday that the Plaid could go from zero to 60 mph in under two seconds (a statement he’s made previously). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yPivSE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;0 to 60mph in under 2 secs. Quickest production car ever made of any kind. Has to be felt to be believed.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1401642134583791624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4hzqrw"&gt;The Plaid Plus was supposed to have range of more than 520 miles, but its specs on Tesla’s website Sunday are greyed out, although the site still says “Plaid Plus available in mid-2022.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sw-AFk5o2g1eEu9_jbLAncACJYg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22641300/plaid_greyed_out.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Tesla/screencap&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Plaid Plus doesn’t appear to be an option on Tesla’s website&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vezkBI"&gt;The Plaid Model S made its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/12/20862105/tesla-model-s-plaid-laguna-seca-nurburgring-porsche-taycan"&gt;debut at Laguna Seca raceway in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, where it lapped the course in 1 minute and 36 seconds. Tesla later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451723/tesla-plaid-model-s-available-2021-specs-price-battery-day"&gt;showed off the Model S Plaid as part of its Battery Day presentation&lt;/a&gt; in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1EVDN"&gt;While it’s possible Musk was joking on Twitter about the Plaid Plus being canceled (maybe to boost confidence in the regular Plaid model?) it seems unlikely, since he’s already tangled with the Securities and Exchange Commission for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18295240/elon-musk-sec-tweets-judge-nyc-ruling"&gt;past tweets&lt;/a&gt; about Tesla business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1B6pr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N4fPW1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Juno probe will get close to Jupiter’s moon Ganymede on Monday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z-PLZPd9REZ4DB7_5-lZZEKfYFI=/183x0:1617x956/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69414006/ganymede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;These images of Ganymede were constructed from imagery from NASA’s Voyager 1 and 2 and Galileo spacecraft | USGS Astrogeology Science Center/ Wheaton/ NASA/ JPL-Caltech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gmKaQO"&gt;On Monday NASA’s Juno space probe, which has been orbiting Jupiter since 2016, will get a close-up look at Jupiter’s biggest moon &lt;a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/moons/jupiter-moons/ganymede/in-depth/"&gt;Ganymede&lt;/a&gt;, the agency said in a &lt;a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/nasas-juno-to-get-a-close-look-at-jupiters-moon-ganymede"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;. It will be the closest NASA has gotten to the largest moon in the solar system for more than 20 years— &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/18632-galileo-spacecraft.html"&gt;Galileo cruised by Ganymede&lt;/a&gt; in 2000— coming within 645 miles of its surface. The information Juno gathers will give insight into the moon’s composition and ice shell, as well as provide data for future missions to Jupiter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEhX8n"&gt;“Juno carries a suite of sensitive instruments capable of seeing Ganymede in ways never before possible,” said principal investigator Scott Bolton of the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio. “By flying so close, we will bring the exploration of Ganymede into the 21st century, both complementing future missions with our unique sensors and helping prepare for the next generation of missions to the Jovian system.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTker7"&gt;Those missions include &lt;a href="https://europa.nasa.gov/"&gt;NASA’s Europa Clipper&lt;/a&gt; (launch date still TBD) and the European Space Agency’s &lt;a href="https://sci.esa.int/web/juice"&gt;JUpiter ICy moons Explorer&lt;/a&gt; [JUICE] mission, slated to launch next year and arrive at Jupiter in 2029 (and kudos to the ESA for going the extra mile on that acronym). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2KssE0"&gt;Ganymede is bigger than Mercury and is the only moon in the solar system with its own magnetosphere, which NASA describes as “a bubble-shaped region of charged particles” that surrounds it. The &lt;a href="https://www.missionjuno.swri.edu/junocam"&gt;JunoCam&lt;/a&gt;, which has taken many of the most striking photos of Jupiter during its mission will only be able to snap about five images during the flyby, since Ganymede will appear and fade from view all within a 25-minute window. Three hours before Juno gets to its closest point near Ganymede, its science instruments will begin collecting data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="89OoXt"&gt;“Literally every second counts,” said Matt Johnson, Juno mission manager at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. “On Monday, we are going to race past Ganymede at almost 12 miles per second (19 kilometers per second).” And less than 24 hours later, Juno will make its 33rd science pass of Jupiter, he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oob4FG"&gt;Juno is expected to get closest to Ganymede at about 1:35PM ET on Monday. You can track where Juno is now with NASA’s &lt;a href="https://deeq9fypw3lao.cloudfront.net/apps/juno-embed/"&gt;Eyes on the Solar System interactive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter may be close to launching Super Follows, as new research shows what it could look like </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R7KYSvxW3YRanDCMBj4NgpmNU74=/0x92:1842x1320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69413687/Screen_Shot_2021_02_25_at_1.11.21_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A mockup of what Twitter Super Follows could look like | Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tv6uOu"&gt;Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers"&gt;announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; it was working on a Super Follows feature that would allow some users to charge followers and give them access to extra content. On Sunday, app researcher Jane Manchun Wong tweeted screenshots of what she says it will look like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J48vGm"&gt;According to Wong’s research, which is typically very &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/15/22437690/twitter-blue-subscription-service-299-undo-tweets"&gt;accurate&lt;/a&gt;, the Super Follows program will be limited to Twitter users with at least 10,000 followers, who have posted at least 25 tweets within the past 30 days, and are at least 18 years old. As Twitter has referenced, one of the main features of Super Follows will be bonus content, such as exclusive tweets for Super Followers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yEG7nN"&gt;Wong also discovered a list of content categories that Super Follows users would choose from to describe their content (such as “sports” or “podcasting”), and notes that “adult content” and “OnlyFans” are listed as “content platforms” along with Facebook, Substack, Patreon, Twitch, and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yJHtjy"&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nk1ctK"&gt;Twitter declined to comment about Wong’s latest research on Sunday. But It’s previously described the Patreon-like Super Follows feature as a kind of subscription, providing an example where a Super Follows user charged $4.99 per month for users to get access to “perks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttkEpv"&gt;It’s the latest direct payments feature Twitter has introduced in recent weeks; in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423583/twitter-tip-jar-feature-sending-money-venmo-cashapp"&gt;May it began testing Tip Jar&lt;/a&gt;, which lets users make one-time payments to creators directly on Twitter by clicking a dollar bill icon on their Twitter profile. Twitter doesn’t take a cut of Tip Jar donations, which supports several payment options including Cash App, PayPal, and Venmo. It’s not clear how payments would be structured for Super Follows, but it seems likely Twitter would take a percentage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqIiMQ"&gt;Twitter’s product team has been busy this year, introducing several new features including its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22464291/twitter-blue-subscription-service-canada-australia-undo-reader-mode"&gt;Twitter Blue subscription service&lt;/a&gt; which is testing in Canada and Australia. It’s also reopened, then closed, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22464077/twitter-reopens-verification-applications-badge-after-pause"&gt;reopened again its verification&lt;/a&gt; program, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420586/twitter-offensive-tweet-warning-prompt-updated-success-rate"&gt;updated its warnings&lt;/a&gt; for potentially offensive tweets, improved its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421574/twitter-crop-issue-bigger-images-rollout"&gt;photo cropping algorithm&lt;/a&gt; to allow “taller” images to fully display in users’ feeds, added the ability for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434936/twitter-dm-search-android-expanding"&gt;Android users to search&lt;/a&gt; their direct messages, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22417852/twitter-buying-scroll-subscription-service-news-revue-newsletter"&gt;acquired Scroll&lt;/a&gt;, the $5-per-month subscription service that removes ads from participating websites.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple heads into developer conference under more scrutiny than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5_f6blu4byEVOq4Ae1XSs1u-Jmo=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69413334/wwdc_scrutiny.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z1fpLh"&gt;Apple needs a distraction, and it needs one fast. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Kv4Hd"&gt;On Monday, the company will hold its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/apple-wwdc"&gt;WWDC 2021&lt;/a&gt;) during one of the most fraught moments for developer relations in Apple history. While Apple emerged from the Epic v. Apple trial &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22452035/epic-apple-antitrust-trial-final-arguments"&gt;in a seemingly strong legal position&lt;/a&gt;, its reputation took a body blow. Evidence revealed the company &lt;em&gt;doesn’t&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368651/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-ban-lawsuit-epic-games-payments"&gt;“treat every developer the same”&lt;/a&gt; — it cut special deals with big companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348108/apple-amazon-prime-video-app-store-special-treatment-fee-subscriptions"&gt;like Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and Hulu and made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421290/microsoft-apple-xcloud-ios-shadow-cloud-gaming-removal-app-store"&gt;arbitrary&lt;/a&gt;, cutthroat decisions to lock competition out and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375128/apple-imessage-android-ecosystem-lock-in-epic-games-filings-app-store-dispute"&gt;lock users in&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zUWB7"&gt;Developers have known or suspected these things for years, and at first, online reactions seemed muted. This is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/31/18647249/wwdc-apple-parental-control-app-store-mdm-spotify-moderation-developers-2019"&gt;third year&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21293813/apple-app-store-policies-hey-30-percent-developers-the-trial-by-franz-kafka"&gt;in a row&lt;/a&gt; that the shadow of antitrust regulation has hung over WWDC, after all, and so far the company has largely emerged unscathed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="d9ZWem"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;“We treat every developer the same.”&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/BsxsXhMiRB"&gt;https://t.co/BsxsXhMiRB&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/XGA2J1hV6b"&gt;pic.twitter.com/XGA2J1hV6b&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Paul Haddad (@tapbot_paul) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tapbot_paul/status/1390305227174252547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2IBSWl"&gt;But Apple watchers were hearing something else in the company’s testimony during the trial, something even devout developers couldn’t ignore: Apple was building its case on the idea that Apple, &lt;em&gt;not developers&lt;/em&gt;, was solely responsible for the success of the iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oObTNI"&gt;Some of those developers are now supremely unhappy. So it would be fortunate if Apple has a new MacBook Pro waiting for them, one that could swing the conversation at WWDC away from difficult questions about whether the App Store is fair.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Marco Arment’s tweets on May 11th slam Apple for shitting on developers" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dbCNShZc48KHH-OOILMvXMa5YXw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22639655/marco_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Tweets by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1392101013243432960" target="_blank"&gt;Marco Arment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;By May 11th, developers had noted the tone of Apple’s testimony &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1392101013243432960" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;was clear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RKlzG7"&gt;On May 21st, Tim Cook himself made Apple’s position crystal-clear: “I view that we are creating the entire amount of commerce on the store,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22448023/epic-apple-fortnite-antitrust-lawsuit-judge-tim-cook-app-store-questions"&gt;Cook told Judge Rogers&lt;/a&gt;, when she questioned whether Apple didn’t necessarily deserve all the credit for keeping users around. Later, Cook insisted Apple would get paid no matter what gets decided in court: “We would have to come up with an alternate way of collecting our commission,” he told the judge, if alternative app payment mechanisms become a reality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyimkW"&gt;We’ve seen rent-seeking behavior from Apple in the past: remember when it forced Hey, WordPress and others to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21397424/apple-wordpress-apology-iap-free-ios-app"&gt;add in-app purchases to their &lt;em&gt;free&lt;/em&gt; apps&lt;/a&gt;, many of whom &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap"&gt;were too scared to speak up?&lt;/a&gt; “These apps do not offer in-app purchase — and, consequently, have not contributed any revenue to the App Store over the last eight years,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation#kmmNsE"&gt;the company told&lt;/a&gt; Hey developer Basecamp, as if paying rent was the only value that Basecamp had ever brought to the iPhone. Now, we’re learning that entitled perspective goes all the way to the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="It7IaP"&gt;I thought Nick Heer &lt;a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/epic-v-apple-ends/"&gt;put it well:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="3ErNWV"&gt;If you thought before that Apple was an overly controlling corporate giant that squeezed money at every possible opportunity, its executives’ testimony reinforced that. Even if you are comfortable with Apple’s business case, Tim Cook’s cold remarks must have shaken some of that confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jexU4b"&gt;And this past Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/06/apple-developers-grow-app-store-ecosystem-billings-and-sales-by-24-percent-in-2020/"&gt;when Apple issued&lt;/a&gt; what his fellow podcast hosts &lt;a href="https://atp.fm/433"&gt;called a “self-serving puff piece,”&lt;/a&gt; prominent iOS developer Marco Arment apparently decided he’d been shaken enough. “[T]o bully and gaslight developers into thinking that we need to be kissing Apple’s feet for permitting us to add billions of dollars of value to their platform is not only greedy, stingy, and morally reprehensible, but deeply insulting,” writes Arment, in a fiery new blog post titled “&lt;a href="https://marco.org/2021/06/03/developer-relations"&gt;Developer relations&lt;/a&gt;” that’s sweeping through Apple’s dev community just days ahead of the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5usCD"&gt;“It isn’t the App Store that has enabled all of the commerce on iOS,” Arment challenges Cook: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="c2vDav"&gt;It’s the entire world of computing and modern society, created by a symbiotic ecosystem in which Apple played one part alongside many others. The world was already moving in this direction, and had Apple not played its part, someone else would’ve. The App Store is merely one platform’s forced distribution gateway, “facilitating” the commerce no more and no less than a web browser, an ISP or cellular carrier, a server-hosting company, or a credit-card processor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6iK953"&gt;This is the part where Apple would argue that the App Store is far more — it’s designed to be a safe, curated, trustworthy experience where you can download apps without fear, which takes investment and a lot of work. But as we learned during the trial, the head of Apple’s own FEAR (Fraud Engineering Algorithms and Risk) team believed that Apple’s App Review program was a joke, “more like the pretty lady who greets you with a lei at the Hawaiian airport than the drug sniffing dog.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d3Kgs3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Is no one reviewing these apps? Is no one minding the store? This is insane!!!!!!!” - Phil Schiller, 2012&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IjXxPw"&gt;Internal emails also revealed Apple’s own executives couldn’t believe some of the things App Review let into the public sphere, and yet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;obvious scams continue to flourish&lt;/a&gt; today. While Apple now says its teams &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/app-store-stopped-over-1-5-billion-in-suspect-transactions-in-2020/"&gt;stop billions of dollars in fraud&lt;/a&gt; and employ a range of automated tools to detect malicious apps, it also admitted that it only has 500 people reviewing the 1.8 million apps on the store. (500 is not a lot of people to moderate a platform run by the most profitable company in the world, one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220873/apple-2020-app-store-revenue-60-billion-dollars"&gt;made an estimated $64 billion last year&lt;/a&gt; from the App Store alone.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVvWJt"&gt;One of Epic’s key arguments during the trial &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22414402/epic-expert-apple-app-store-fortnite-court-profit"&gt;was that the App Store is &lt;em&gt;ludicrously&lt;/em&gt; profitable&lt;/a&gt;, with margins so high (78 percent) they seem like the “Apple tax” that Apple’s long been accused of creating. And while Apple initially said it would refute that figure during the trial, the company instead &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business#:~:text=4%5D%20the%20app%20store%20is%20wildly%20profitable%2C%20but%20apple%20won%E2%80%99t%20admit%20it"&gt;repeatedly insisted it didn’t know&lt;/a&gt; how much profit the App Store actually makes. The best it could do was lay out a laundry list of things it doesn’t count against its App Store budget and presumably pays for out of the goodness of its heart, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440629/apple-app-store-physical-purchases-400-billion-50-million-wwdc"&gt;the $50 million a year it spends on WWDC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHllMm"&gt;Which brings us to Monday’s developer conference, and how Apple might salvage this mess. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1392101898191245314"&gt;Like Arment&lt;/a&gt;, I don’t think Apple will suddenly announce that developers can use whichever payment processors they like, or even allow them to steer their customers to ways to pay outside Apple’s ecosystem. There’s also next to no chance Apple will reduce its cut. For one thing, the company’s been &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; clear about its stance on each of these throughout the trial, and it’s not going to give up until the lawsuit is over (and even then, not until after rounds of appeals.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYHqaG"&gt;Besides, Apple may not feel the need for anything that drastic. While a number of prominent Apple developers and bloggers have gone loud and coverage of the trial may have made Apple slightly less of a media darling — “&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/26/opinion/apple-app-store-fortnite-lawsuit.html"&gt;The Apple Tax is Rotten&lt;/a&gt;,” declared Farhad Manjoo at the New York Times — there are plenty of developers who are simply happy to have a business at all. Having surveyed over 380 software developers ahead of WWDC, Creative Strategies principal analyst Ben Bajarin tells me that smaller developers tend to be satisfied with Apple as a whole, and over 90 percent of developers surveyed so far say they’re likely to keep developing for Apple’s platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KdaBlp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A few observations from preliminary results from our Apple software developers study. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. Small developers (those making well less than $1m a year) seem to have much higher positive sentiment toward Apple/App Store than those developers who are larger. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Uk1U5gecUu"&gt;https://t.co/Uk1U5gecUu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ben Bajarin (@BenBajarin) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BenBajarin/status/1400539719490965507?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IsFxu9"&gt;“There are still pain points, everyone wants Apple to do better, but there’s this demographic that recognizes Apple provides them value, allows them to do the thing they want to do by being a small indie developer,” he says. While many survey respondents complained about the app review process and a lack of clear communication from Apple, and the “vast majority” said Apple could be doing more about scams, even the more vocal developers plan to stay. “You listen to these very vocal developers who are unhappy...  if a viable alternative existed for them, they’d switch, but Apple’s platform and ecosystem is just such a good ecosystem for them. They won’t go to Android, they won’t go to Windows, because they won’t make the same amount of money,” Bajarin says. There’s no viable alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8Agoro"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Where are developers gonna go?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UPdq6M"&gt;Prominent dev&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith"&gt; Steve Troughton-Smith&lt;/a&gt; feels similarly, when I ask him what Apple needs to do this year to win developers over: “the realistic [answer] is ‘nothing’ — where are developers gonna go? They gotta stick with the App Store if they want to make money on mobile, and there really aren’t other options.” He says the majority of developers “don’t know or care about the trial, and they’re happy to build apps within the sandbox that don’t try to push the boundaries or run into existential issues — which is totally fine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0Xcyp"&gt;“But I think we’ve lost a decade of innovation at the fringe because of Apple’s nannying, and it gets harder to ignore as Apple is now reaching into apps and trying to dictate their business models,” he adds, referencing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506995/apple-forced-in-app-purchase-protonmail-ceo-wordpress-iap"&gt;Apple’s forced in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt; as one example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mo6qqy"&gt;Apple columnist and podcaster &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jsnell"&gt;Jason Snell&lt;/a&gt; agrees that Apple “denigrated their developers” during the trial, but also doesn’t expect them to fix that at WWDC: “Short of changing long-held App Store policies, like allowing linking to web sites for alternate payment methods, I’m not sure what they can do other than power through their next round of OS updates and hope developers get caught up in what’s new and forget what Apple said about the role of third-party developers on the stand,” he tells me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLUj0S"&gt;But I’m betting Apple has another way to take our minds off developer concerns, a plan that’s worked for Apple in the past — a shiny new piece of hardware that’ll make the company’s “pros” excited to work on what’s next. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TwnxEvriVAZ44lI1EUnbjLhKA3A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22407714/Apple_wwdc21_newsroom_article_tile_033021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A hint at AR glasses, or just someone who likes what they see on this Mac?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dtE24G"&gt;Maybe it’ll be a preview of Apple’s long-awaited AR glasses. That would certainly dominate the headlines and be the talk of the show all week and beyond. While the rumor mill isn’t expecting a product to arrive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346564/apple-mixed-vr-virtual-augmented-reality-headset-light-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;until 2022 at the earliest&lt;/a&gt;, Tim Cook has been talking up the potential of AR for years, calling it “profound,” “huge,” a “core technology,” “as big an idea as the smartphone,” and most recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22367715/tim-cook-augmented-reality-apple-car-hints-interview"&gt;calling the tech “critically important”&lt;/a&gt; to Apple’s future. The company’s own WWDC teaser image above definitely makes me think about augmented reality, that’s for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlqpYi"&gt;But a safer bet is that, for the third time in the post-Steve Jobs era, Apple will use WWDC to remind its “pro” users that it knows how to build a Mac at the intersection of power and flexibility. “Can’t innovate anymore, my ass,” said Apple exec Phil Schiller at WWDC 2013, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/10/4412350/apple-new-mac-pro-wwdc-2013"&gt;introducing the radically redesigned cylindrical Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; with a quote designed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/13/4423844/cant-innovate-anymore-my-ass-apple"&gt;to distract from the actual criticism&lt;/a&gt; the company was facing that year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="phil schiller mac pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dui-NzKt5E3I83PJn08iYsvBpuo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14361890/Screen_Shot_2013-06-12_at_4.06.55_PM.1419979641.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phil Schiller, announcing the 2013 Mac Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ezcra9"&gt;He also claimed that the 2013 Mac Pro was “without a doubt the future of the pro desktop” and while that turned out to be so embarrassingly wrong that Apple wound up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/4/15175994/apple-mac-pro-failure-admission"&gt;publicly admitting that 2013 Mac was a mistake&lt;/a&gt;, the company pulled the same move at WWDC 2019 with its new, improved, and actually-upgradable &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/6/5/18652409/apple-mac-pro-design-comparison-cheese-grater-upgrade-old-vs-new-trash-can"&gt;cheese grater Mac Pro&lt;/a&gt; to show — once again — that it’s listening to its most vocal audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUaKBv"&gt;2021 gives Apple a new opportunity. Five years ago, Apple killed off the beloved MacBook Pro with Retina Display, trading its pro-friendly SD card slot, full-size HDMI and USB ports and deep, familiar keyboard for a new machine with a gimmicky Touch Bar and a set of USB-C / Thunderbolt 3 ports that required dongles to plug practically anything into the machine. Developers were disappointed by its lack of RAM, too. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/apple-microsoft-macbook-pro-surface-studio-creative-professionals/"&gt;“Apple’s new MacBook Pro isn’t for pros,”&lt;/a&gt; I wrote at the time. My colleague Vlad: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/7/13548052/the-macbook-pro-lie"&gt;“The MacBook Pro is a lie.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMQywk"&gt;Yet the biggest issue with the new MacBook Pro turned out to be its ultra-thin “butterfly keyboard,” a design so susceptible to dust that it inspired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18284042/apple-macbook-keyboard-apology-issues-bad-design"&gt;its own public apology from Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/22/18634932/apple-macbook-pro-butterfly-keyboard-repair-reassure-worrying"&gt;multiple recall / repair programs&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344397/apple-macbook-butterfly-keyboard-switches-defective-class-action-lawsuit-certified"&gt;certified class-action lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;. We called it one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/27/21270299/apple-butterfly-keyboard-hardware-design-macbook-pro-physical-key-button"&gt;worst buttons ever made&lt;/a&gt;, and breathed a sigh of relief when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features"&gt;2019’s MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; phased it out for good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vmIX5T"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple knows its most important critics love a high-end Mac&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="08e0FQ"&gt;But 2019’s MacBook Pro mostly just fixed 2016’s mistakes — and where pros are concerned, 2020’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;13-inch MacBook Pro with Apple’s new M1 chip&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t quite get there. It is essentially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21559228/apple-new-macbook-air-pro-difference-arm-m1-fan-thermal-performance"&gt; an M1 MacBook Air with an added fan&lt;/a&gt;, the same two ports and the same maximum 16GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfHpeV"&gt;At WWDC 2021, Apple can show that it’s listening again, and by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s account, it will: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22457534/apple-wwdc-2021-rumors-ios-15-new-macbook-pro-what-to-expect"&gt;we’re expecting to see&lt;/a&gt; a new 16-inch MacBook Pro that brings back the SD card slot and HDMI port, heralds the return of Apple’s beloved trip-friendly MagSafe connector, trades the annoying Touch Bar for physical function keys, and supports up to 64GB of RAM. They’re also expected to include double the high-performance CPU cores and at &lt;em&gt;least&lt;/em&gt; double the GPU cores of the Apple M1 chips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;that already managed to upend our concept of laptop performance&lt;/a&gt; late last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IjcOTq"&gt;It sounds like Apple may be giving its professional users exactly what they’ve asked for in a new laptop, for the first time in many years, and many of those pros are the same developers attending WWDC and building for iOS. A shiny distraction won’t help Apple win at trial, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404493/amy-klobuchar-interview-antitrust-book-hearings-big-tech"&gt;or stave off Amy Klobuchar&lt;/a&gt;, but it could certainly help change the tone of developer conversations this week at WWDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UwCoYe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zllFV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Roadrunner, Black Widow, Reminiscence</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Anthony Bourdain" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1-qP2aniZOzOuPc9L3W-I_fFtSc=/0x31:3000x2031/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69413330/620646350.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A trailer for the new documentary about the late Anthony Bourdain, &lt;em&gt;Roadrunner&lt;/em&gt;, is among this week’s titles. | Photo by Mike Pont/WireImage&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ouZPx"&gt;It hit me this morning that there is no new episode of &lt;em&gt;Mare of Easttown&lt;/em&gt; on this evening and I felt a little sad, but wow what a finale. Emmys for Kate Winslet and Julianne Nicholson, please (and be sure to read Sophie Gilbert’s &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/05/mare-easttown-hbo-finale/619055/"&gt;excellent analysis in &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; of the way women and mothers were centered in this very good series). I did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; correctly predict who the killer was (but ICYMI, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StephenKing/status/1399097288677638152?s=20"&gt;Stephen King did&lt;/a&gt; and don’t click that link if you haven’t watched the finale because obvs, spoiler). All this is to say I am in the market for a new show so I just started &lt;em&gt;Hacks&lt;/em&gt; and can’t wait for the &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; premiere on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFjD4I"&gt;The (unintentional) theme(s) for this week’s trailers roundup: Memories and nostalgia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ikc4hG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oaEvk2"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ihEEjwRlghQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tU2z7U"&gt;Roadrunner &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="oRsbR4"&gt;This documentary about Anthony Bourdain, who died from suicide in 2018, is “narrated” by Bourdain himself, using a mix of &lt;a href="https://www.eater.com/22518972/anthony-bourdain-documentary-roadrunner-trailer-drops"&gt;unused and archived footage&lt;/a&gt;. The trailer, which shows snippets of Bourdain’s rise from “anonymous chef” to famous best-selling author and globetrotting TV host, is appropriately melancholy, and includes several shots that linger on Bourdain’s face as he appears deep in thought, or at least, focused elsewhere. It reminded me of the trailer for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhwktRDG_aQ&amp;amp;ab_channel=FocusFeatures"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Won’t You Be My Neighbor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the 2018 documentary about the late Fred Rogers (and got me thinking about the differences and similarities between the two men), which makes sense, since both &lt;em&gt;Roadrunner&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Neighbor&lt;/em&gt; were directed by Oscar-winner Morgan Neville. Really looking forward to this one. &lt;em&gt;Roadrunner&lt;/em&gt; comes to theaters July 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tctySJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gKnOm7IWJL8?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=5&amp;amp;start=5" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="dlHFGr"&gt;Black Widow &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Ov1T03"&gt;If it feels like we have been waiting a LONG TIME for &lt;em&gt;Black Widow, &lt;/em&gt;that’s because we have: the first trailer dropped in December of 2019. This latest trailer (teaser? I don’t even know anymore. It’s exactly one minute long) is titled “Playmaker” and has a few scenes we’ve seen in earlier trailers along with some action sequences (but no clues about who plays Taskmaster). Scarlett Johansson (obvs), Florence Pugh, David Harbour, Rachel Weisz, O-T Fagbenle, William Hurt, and Ray Winstone star in &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; which finally comes to Disney Plus (with Premier Access) and theaters on July 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NLW4Ct"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_BggT--yxf0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="9LNkCs"&gt;Reminiscence &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="QCEUgA"&gt;Hugh Jackman plays a “private investigator of the mind” who helps clients access lost memories in a dystopian future, and one day a mysterious woman walks into his office— you get the drift. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WestworldHBO/status/1241738151053398016?s=20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Westworld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; co-creator Lisa Joy wrote and directed &lt;em&gt;Reminiscence&lt;/em&gt; and the trailer has that show’s futuristic dread/“bring yourself back online” feeling, along with Thandiwe Newton in a starring role. Rebecca Ferguson and Daniel Wu also star in &lt;em&gt;Reminiscence&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters and HBO Max on August 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="U3uq4I"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7NKVThOGLXc?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="K1INhc"&gt;iCarly&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="A0vQrW"&gt;Continuing with the trend of “all shows that have even the tiniest bit of nostalgia attached to them must get a streaming reunion and/or reboot,” the show about the teens who had a web show is back with most of its original cast (Jennette McCurdy famously opted &lt;a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/jennette-mccurdy-revealed-why-she-quit-acting-icarly-reboot"&gt;not to reprise&lt;/a&gt; the role of Carly’s best friend Sam). Hearing Spencer (Jerry Trainor) say “damn it” and offer Freddie (Nathan Kress) a beer shook me a little bit, but the trailer does warn us that they’re “all grown up” (and not on Nickelodeon anymore). Miranda Cosgrove returns as Carly in the all-new &lt;em&gt;iCarly&lt;/em&gt; series, which comes to Paramount Plus June 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXGNmd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fossil doesn’t plan to upgrade its existing watches to the new Wear OS </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ya4PjtMeckQ6rkqMwOGZyg6QrC0=/0x0:920x613/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69412817/fossil_watch.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Fossil&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nvt3Ci"&gt;Fossil executives Greg McKelvey and Steve Prokup &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/health/fossil-is-planning-a-premium-google-watch-for-fall/"&gt;said in an interview with CNET&lt;/a&gt; that the company’s existing Wear OS watches won’t get upgraded to the new combined Wear software platform from Samsung and Google. Instead, Fossil is planning a premium watch that Prokup said would have “pretty major hardware upgrades,” and existing watches will probably be discounted as budget options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgL86r"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;CNET,&lt;/em&gt; Fossil’s Gen 6 watch should have features similar to upcoming watches from Google and Samsung, with faster performance, longer battery life, new chips, and LTE cellular options. “All of the software benefits that Google’s talking about and launching with the unified platform is something we’ll be building into that as well,” McKelvey said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxQjVW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;Google and Samsung announced last month&lt;/a&gt; at Google I/O that they would combine Wear OS and Samsung’s Tizen into a new platform, creating one central smartwatch OS for Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kuqLt"&gt;The Fossil execs didn’t give much insight into what buttons or crowns the company may use in its next Wear OS watch. ”I think you’re still going to see a variety of offerings across even our products, as well as manufacturers,” Prokup said in the interview, “not so much that you’re going to have a watch that ends up having four, five, six dedicated buttons or no buttons.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="is1Y3f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7qIl90"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google’s new Samsung smartwatch partnership looks a lot like giving up","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/23/22448165/google-samsung-wearable-partnership-wear-os-tizen-merge-smartwatch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cZR8Xj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter blocked in Nigeria after deleting a tweet by its president </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sZp21XpU6txa9U-OX0bUhUeWYeQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69410594/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wq5AdK"&gt;Twitter is suspended “indefinitely” in Nigeria, “for the persistent use of the platform for activities that are capable of undermining Nigeria’s corporate existence,” according to a statement (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FMICNigeria/status/1400843062641717249?s=20"&gt;threaded on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;) from the country’s minister of information and culture. The move comes days after the platform &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/04/1003506918/nigeria-suspends-twitter-after-it-deleted-a-tweet-by-the-president"&gt;removed a threatening tweet&lt;/a&gt; by president Muhammadu Buhari which Twitter said violated its “abusive behavior” policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PNfuo1"&gt;On Saturday, the office of Nigeria’s attorney general and ministry of justice said it would arrest and prosecute anyone who tried to get around the block, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/05/africa/nigeria-prosecute-twitter-users-intl/index.html"&gt;CNN reported&lt;/a&gt;, and directed government agencies to cooperate with prosecutors “to ensure the speedy prosecution of offenders without any further delay.” Several news reports said people within Nigeria &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-57368535"&gt;were using VPNs&lt;/a&gt; to try to avoid the ban and continue using Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mYudQd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Federal Government has suspended, indefinitely, the operations of the microblogging and social networking service, Twitter, in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;— Fed Min of Info &amp;amp; Cu (@FMICNigeria) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FMICNigeria/status/1400843065364029446?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MQTzgj"&gt;In Buhari’s deleted tweet, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/04/nigeria-suspends-twitter-after-presidents-tweet-was-deleted"&gt;he suggested he would punish&lt;/a&gt; secessionists. “Many of those misbehaving today are too young to be aware of the destruction and loss of lives that occurred during the Biafra war,” he wrote. “Those of us in the fields for 30 months, who went through the war, will treat them in the language they understand.” Buhari was a major general during the &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-51094093"&gt;Biafra war&lt;/a&gt;, which left more than a million people dead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emAxut"&gt;Twitter’s Public Policy team said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Policy/status/1401151115022979076?s=20"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; Saturday it was “deeply concerned” and would work to restore access in Nigeria. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/nigeria-indefinitely-suspends-twitter-operations-information-minister-2021-06-04"&gt;Reuters reported&lt;/a&gt; Saturday that Twitter’s website was not accessible on some of Nigeria’s mobile carriers, but appeared to be working sporadically on other carriers in Lagos and Abuja, two of the country’s biggest cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ICrSyl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We are deeply concerned by the blocking of Twitter in Nigeria. Access to the free and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OpenInternet?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OpenInternet&lt;/a&gt; is an essential human right in modern society.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We will work to restore access for all those in Nigeria who rely on Twitter to communicate and connect with the world. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KeepitOn?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#KeepitOn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Public Policy (@Policy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Policy/status/1401151115022979076?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="psgpRx"&gt;“Suspending Twitter in Nigeria is just one more way of stating that people’s rights do not matter just what the State wants,” Osai Ojigho, director of Amnesty International in Nigeria &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/livingtruely/status/1400887522398543881?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “This is a dangerous precedent and must be called out for what it is.” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmnestyNigeria/status/1400862127456391168?s=20"&gt;Amnesty called on Nigerian authorities&lt;/a&gt; to immediately reverse the suspension, “and other plans to gag the media, repress civic space, and undermine Nigerians’ human rights.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1n5GW2"&gt;In April, Twitter &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/establishing-twitter-s-presence-in-africa.html"&gt;opened its first office in Africa&lt;/a&gt; in Ghana, which some in Nigeria considered a snub. In its announcement, Twitter cited Ghana’s support of free speech, online freedom and the Open Internet as the reasons for its decision. Nigeria’s information minister &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/media-portrayal-nigeria-led-twitter-choose-ghana-africa-office-minister-2021-04-16/"&gt;said at the time&lt;/a&gt; that Twitter’s decision not to locate its Africa offices in Nigeria was due to misrepresentation of the country by the media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P2r6v8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/africa/nigeria/report-nigeria/"&gt;According to a 2020 report from Amnesty International&lt;/a&gt;, Nigerian authorities “used repressive laws to harass, intimidate, arrest and detain human rights defenders, activists, media workers and perceived critics. Non-state actors also subjected journalists to intimidation, harassment and beatings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUYyqc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 5th, 4:44PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds that the Nigerian government plans to arrest and prosecute people who try to get around the Twitter ban.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Justice Department has charged a Latvian woman it says helped develop Trickbot malware</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cCNku2R9vsTWIh253P7XdCvDmOg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69411518/acastro_170621_1777_0006_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y3oO9u"&gt;The US Department of Justice has charged a Latvian woman for her role in allegedly developing the Trickbot malware, which was responsible for infecting millions of computers, targeting schools, hospitals, public utilities, and governments, the agency said &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/latvian-national-charged-alleged-role-transnational-cybercrime-organization"&gt;in a news release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3106W"&gt;The DOJ alleges that Alla Witte was part of a criminal organization known as the Trickbot Group that operated in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Suriname. She allegedly helped develop the malware which was used to enable ransomware demands and payments. Victims would receive a notice that their computers were encrypted, the DOJ said, and were directed to buy special software through a bitcoin address linked to the Trickbot Group to have their files decrypted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IrBJGL"&gt;According to the DOJ, the Trickbot malware was designed to capture online banking login credentials to gain access to other personal information including credit card numbers, emails, passwords, Social Security numbers, and addresses. The group allegedly used stolen personal information “to gain access to online bank accounts, execute unauthorized electronic funds transfers and launder the money through U.S. and foreign beneficiary accounts,” the DOJ said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TG3bzV"&gt;Federal law enforcement agencies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540026/cyberattack-ransomware-hospitals-russia-covid"&gt;warned hospitals and healthcare providers&lt;/a&gt; last October of a credible ransomware threat by attackers using Trickbot &lt;a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts/aa20-302a"&gt;to deploy ransomware such as Ryuk and Conti&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfNZMV"&gt;Witte was arrested February 6th in Miami. She is charged with 19 counts including conspiracy to commit computer fraud and aggravated identity theft, conspiracy to commit wire and bank fraud affecting a financial institution, aggravated identity theft, and conspiracy to commit money laundering. &lt;/p&gt;
