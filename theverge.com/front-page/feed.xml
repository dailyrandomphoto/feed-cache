    <title>It’s game over for Arizona’s controversial App Store bill</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The legislation disappeared before a scheduled vote last week, and now it’s likely done for the year&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="bkMQgy"&gt;Arizona House Bill 2005, a hotly contested piece of legislation that would have imposed developer-friendly changes to Apple and Google’s mobile app stores, is now on death’s door. The &lt;a href="https://www.azleg.gov/legtext/55leg/1R/proposed/H.2005COBB.pdf"&gt;bill&lt;/a&gt;, which would have allowed alternative payment systems on Android and iOS that bypass the stores’ 30 percent cuts, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22349302/arizona-hb2005-bill-vote-skipped-senate-apple-google-ios-android-app-store"&gt;mysteriously disappeared last week&lt;/a&gt; prior to a scheduled vote that could have sent it straight to the governor’s desk to be signed into law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBIRDW"&gt;The bill had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22309284/arizona-app-store-bill-2005-apple-30-percent-cut-bypass-legislation"&gt;just won a landmark victory in the Arizona House of Representatives&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, and the state Senate was officially set to begin its vote at 3PM local time. HB2005 was the first bill on the agenda, yet it never came up. Now, it turns out that the Senate decided to pull the bill at the last minute, and its sponsor tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that its fate is effectively sealed for the rest of the year. Arizona will wrap up its congressional session next month with no plans to hear HB2005 again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73lQ9d"&gt;That’s bad news for the bill’s proponents, which include a coalition of app makers and prominent Apple critics that have been outspoken in recent months on the need for regulations on mobile app distribution. The fight is being led by the Coalition for App Fairness (CAF), an industry group consisting of Apple critics and competitors like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;maker Epic Games and Spotify, that has taken the fight against alleged app store monopolies to the local stage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mOVBtO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These bills are part of a far-reaching push to enact state-level app store regulations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gCBpiZ"&gt;The CAF has begun lobbying state legislatures to introduce bills in more than a half-dozen states at this point, to varying degrees of success. HB2005 was its most promising campaign yet, after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286234/apple-app-store-north-dakota-bill-sb-2333-failed-vote"&gt;failure in North Dakota last month&lt;/a&gt; sank one of the first legitimate app store bills to go to vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHBsWI"&gt;The primary goal of these bills is to allow developers to bypass Apple and Google’s 30 percent app store commission, while much loftier aims include forcing Apple to allow entire alternative app marketplaces on iOS and making it illegal for tech companies to retaliate against developers for trying to bypass the app store policies. Apple has decried such bills by saying they threaten to “destroy the iPhone as you know it” by opening it up to security risks and undermining the revenue stream it says helps enforce App Store reviews and other benefits, though the company has only ever spoken publicly about such legislation through submitted testimony. Without Arizona, the movement is that much weaker. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="3I4ZjZ"&gt;So who killed HB2005? We don’t really know, but a clearer picture is beginning to emerge. At the very least, congressional members have now been willing to say publicly that Big Tech lobbying had a noticeable effect on the bill just before it went up for a vote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9CrNP"&gt;State Rep. Regina Cobb, the bill’s sponsor and a Republican representing the state’s fifth district, claims Apple and Google “hired almost every lobbyist in town” and named six specific lobbyists who, she says, caused Senate members who’d previously agreed to vote to waver. “We thought we had the votes before we went to the committee yesterday, and then we heard that the votes weren’t there and they weren’t going to take the time to put it up,” Cobb said of the Senate Commerce Committee’s decision to pull the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5nTLK"&gt;That lines up with what Commerce Committee Chair J.D. Mesnard, a Republican who represents Arizona’s District 17, &lt;a href="https://prospect.org/power/big-tech-lobbyists-take-down-arizonas-app-store-bill/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The American Prospect &lt;/em&gt;on Friday of last week&lt;/a&gt;: he pulled the bill because he felt it would fail. “I polled the committee members and there just wasn’t enough support for it,” Mesnard said in an interview with the &lt;em&gt;Prospect&lt;/em&gt;. “A number of members were conflicted on it, others were just opposed. There was some support for it, but it definitely was coming up short.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14vlSr"&gt;Cobb says she doesn’t think anything illegal or nefarious occurred, just lobbying as usual — unlike outspoken Apple critic and Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson, who publicly accused powerful corporations of making illicit deals, colluding with the chamber’s Democrats (some of whom opposed the bill) and Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HFavHv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple and Google “hired almost every lobbyist in town”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a1GDH0"&gt;“The big show turned out to be a no show,” Hansson &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1374842497000673289"&gt;wrote on Twitter on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; of last week. “The bill was killed in mid-air while on the agenda with a backroom deal. Apple has hired the governor’s former chief of staff, and word is that he brokered a deal to prevent this from even being heard.” Although &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has heard a similar allegation from multiple sources with knowledge of the situation, no one, save Hansson, felt comfortable offering an explanation on the record. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57ujSy"&gt;The seeming death of HB2005 and the confusion and mystery surrounding it underscore both the immense power of tech titans like Apple and Google and also the rough legislative road ahead for similar bills in Illinois, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and other states around the country. The clear takeaway is that although these bills are the result of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/14/technology/north-dakota-tech-apps.html"&gt;successful lobbying efforts&lt;/a&gt; from the CAF and its partners, the Silicon Valley lobbying that has arisen to counter these bills has proven just as savvy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5swZGE"&gt;“There’s a legitimate issue here. It’s undeniable [Apple and Google] have gatekeeper power and hold sway over the app stores, and there’s just nowhere else to go. You have to go through one of these companies to get your app before consumers,” says Pat Garofalo, the director of state and local policy at the nonprofit American Economic Liberties Project, which has voiced support for the bills. “It makes perfect sense there are lots of forces — whether they be small, medium, or large — arrayed on both sides of this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JrxQZJ"&gt;Cobb admits she took up the cause after being approached by the CAF and that having other big tech companies as the opposition didn’t help because it added extreme pressure to the impending vote and caused a number of congressional members on both sides to express doubt and confusion about the bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5fdApK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I realized once you start taking on Apple and Google this way you’re going to be hit pretty hard.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7YbD0G"&gt;“I realized once you start taking on Apple and Google this way you’re going to be hit pretty hard,” Cobb said. She said she had multiple meetings with Apple, including with longtime Apple veteran Tim Powderly, the director of federal government affairs at the company. She says the conversations were cordial, but that Apple was very intent on finding a compromise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZWKnn"&gt;Apple declined to comment for this story. Google did not respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="PrEzO1"&gt;Regardless of why the bill was pulled, the outcome is the same: Arizona HB2005 won’t be changing how Apple and Google operate their mobile app stores because its chances of ever becoming law are slim to none. “Unless it is brought as a striker, it will need to be re introduced next year,” Cobb told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in a follow-up email on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3MaB8H"&gt;A striker, formally known as a “strike everything amendment,” is a controversial legislative maneuver that aims to replace the entire text of a bill in an attempt to reopen debate on it and push it forward without having to abide by standard deadlines. Cobb said such a move is unlikely at this point because strikers “often get negative publicity and they’re not always successful,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PaT9br"&gt;While Cobb says she isn’t intimidated by Apple or Google, she also tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; she’s not likely to keep pushing unless she thinks she’ll succeed. “I’m trying to decide how much political capital I want to put into this.” Failing that, Arizona’s Congress will meet again the following January — but the state’s attempt at regulating Apple and Google’s app stores is effectively over for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HtKclx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This idea is out there, now this is sort of in the zeitgeist.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yggVg0"&gt;The CAF says it will continue the fight, even though it’s now seen two legislative defeats in its app store lobbying efforts, the first a more aggressive bill that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286234/apple-app-store-north-dakota-bill-sb-2333-failed-vote"&gt;failed to garner enough votes in the North Dakota House last month&lt;/a&gt;. “The legislative session is not over. We will continue to push for solutions that will increase choice, support app developers and small businesses and put a stop to monopolistic practices,” said Meghan DiMuzio, the CAF’s executive director, in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CBxbTg"&gt;Garofalo of the American Economic Liberties Project thinks it’s likely one of these state bills will succeed at one point, especially in the absence of meaningful federal regulation or antitrust enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VLYVc3"&gt;“This idea is out there, now this is sort of in the zeitgeist,” he said. “I do think a state will do this, and there are really good reasons for a state to do it.” All it will take, he adds, is a group of lawmakers that “hears the right arguments, gets the upside, and decides to do it.” At that point, the primary thing standing in the way will be the lobbying efforts of tech companies that stand to benefit when these bills fail. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify Mixes are new personalized playlists based on your favorite artists and genres</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ul8bri7iwxxvP1cRKrHz60hErCo=/77x0:902x550/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69053177/SPOTIFY_US_FOR_THE_RECORD_PR_ASSET_032521_V2_CF_01_1440x550.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A selection of the new mixes Spotify will generate for you.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ex6kQE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-03-31/introducing-new-spotify-mixes-personalized-playlists-featuring-your-favorite-artists-genres-and-decades/"&gt;Spotify Mixes&lt;/a&gt; are a new family of personalized playlists populated with songs you already like and then supplemented with additional songs Spotify thinks you’ll like, based upon your favorite artists, genres, or music decades. The new Mixes are rolling out globally starting today for both free and premium Spotify subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrrVOZ"&gt;The music streaming service already offers a similar feature in the form of Daily Mixes, which appear in the same “Made for You” section. However, the problem with Daily Mixes is that it can be a little hard to work out the unifying theme of each playlist based on their vague names like “Daily Mix 1” and “Daily Mix 2.” Sometimes you can work it out from the included songs, but other times it can be more mysterious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xrCZAp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Example playlists include “Pop Mix” and “2000s Mix”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5WIIKZ"&gt;In contrast, the names of the new Spotify Mixes are much clearer. A marketing image released by Spotify show playlists with names like “Pop Mix,” “2000s Mix,” and “Drake Mix.” Hopefully it’ll make it easy to know what kind of music you’ll find in each playlist without having to look at its track list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDWPiU"&gt;According to Spotify, each Mix category will include multiple playlists, and they’ll update “frequently” to stop your listening from getting stale. Once available, you should be able to find them within “Search” in the “Made For You” hub.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fiat made a ‘Hey Google’ car</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/02qpgORzLdMTMC_AK4mfE2bQu20=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69053147/500L_1_2.max_2000x2000.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ‘Hey, Google’ logo appears above the front wheel arches of the new Fiat 500 vehicles&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google / Fiat&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tNUUen"&gt;As vehicles are increasingly defined by their digital features, tech companies are seeking out ever-closer partnerships with carmakers. A &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/assistant/fiat-500-family-hey-google/"&gt;new collaboration&lt;/a&gt; between Google and Fiat, though, is the most extreme we’ve seen yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXHyun"&gt;Three new special edition Fiat 500s — the Fiat 500, 500X crossover, and 500L MPV — have been branded with Google livery that extends from using the tech giant’s corporate colors in the cars’ seat upholstery to placing “Hey Google” badges above their front wheel arches. Having this sort of branding &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; a car is not unusual, but this is the first time we’ve seen a tech company’s logo appear on a vehicle’s &lt;em&gt;exterior&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8GlbX"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.media.stellantis.com/it-it/fiat/press/nuova-famiglia-500-hey-google-stile-500-e-tecnologia-google-fiat"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; from the Italian automaker (translated by Google, of course) boasts that the vehicles demonstrate “where Google technology meets &lt;em&gt;coolness” &lt;/em&gt;and offer “the perfect mix of iconic design, freshness and &lt;em&gt;coolness&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(yes, they keep on italicizing &lt;em&gt;coolness&lt;/em&gt; for some reason). You’ll have to be the judge of that, though:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1_OrRXFsQv5AeGQXnU-_9M3Z8vU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410229/09_500_Hey_Google.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Fiat&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the new standard Fiat 500. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5cbRmf0XMsC6BqpDdi-dkvZVW4E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410234/05_500L_Hey_Google.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Fiat&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A close-up of the Hey Google logo that appears above the front wheel arches. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LvGZDzIx564SQ21BRM_tGua1Apw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410231/14_500_Hey_Google.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Fiat&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The seats have a special “molecule” design resembling the swirling dots used in Hey Google animations. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OOx65vTnCYffo_9jH_vzs9Min8k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410236/07_500_Hey_Google.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Fiat&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;And the head rests have Hey Google tags.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div id="cwN5Se"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10421615"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fbIdtf"&gt;All three vehicles come with 7-inch touchscreens with Google Assistant built in, naturally, but offer some unique features thanks to integration with Fiat’s Mopar Connect service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TC09pP"&gt;These will let users monitor and control certain aspects of their car remotely through Google’s digital assistant on their phone or Google Nest Hub. They can check on the car’s fuel level, see if it’s locked, switch on its emergency lights, or even find the closest Fiat service station. Alerts can also be sent to the owner if the car exceeds a certain speed or leaves a certain geographic area. (Though not all these features will be available globally.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lEsg8cRGIcdGhGqJ3m_k_LbcDiA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410247/Fiat.max_1000x1000.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Owners can use Google Assistant and Fiat’s Mopar Connect service to control the car remotely. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FRPV1i"&gt;The real flair in this partnership, though, comes from the design changes to the Fiat. We’ve already noted the Google upholstery and exterior badges, but even the car’s B-pillars match the company’s colors and tags on the seats are branded with the Hey Google logo. &lt;a href="https://www.msn.com/en-gb/cars/news/fiat-500-hey-google-series-launched-%E2%80%93-complete-with-google-goodie-bag/ar-BB1f9rlL#"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Motoring Research&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the cars also come with a Google goodie bag, which includes a Google Hub, branded tote bag, and matching key cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DfsQtB"&gt;The new Fiat 500s will be available in 10 European nations, including the UK, France, Spain, Germany, Italy, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Poland. According to &lt;a href="https://www.autoexpress.co.uk/fiat/500/354626/new-fiat-500-hey-google-special-editions-revealed"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AutoExpress&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, prices in the UK start at £16,005 ($22,046) for the hatchback and £18,655 ($25,695) for the cabriolet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVVUbZ"&gt;If you’re dying for more information, you can also watch this 20 minute segment from Fiat unveiling the cars: &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4h0CDt"&gt;Microsoft has started testing a new version of its Edge browser on Xbox consoles. The software giant provided access to the Chromium version of Edge to Xbox Insiders &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22318050/microsoft-edge-xbox-chromium-browser-testing"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, offering an early look at the improved browsing capabilities coming to the Xbox One and Xbox Series X / S. I’ve had a chance to try out this early version over the past few days, and I’ve been able to test Discord, Stadia, and other web services running inside Edge on the Xbox. It’s like having the full version of Edge from PC running on your TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hy8Kj4"&gt;The Xbox version of Edge looks almost identical to the one you can find on PC or Mac right now. It even includes features like vertical tabs and Collections. Like Edge on PC and mobile, the Xbox version also syncs all your settings, favorites, tabs, and web history. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/txuhj8xX0w1InqAN3lWUQlnpFk0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410205/Xbox_Series_X___Xbox_Series_X_2021_03_31_11_23_32.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Microsoft Edge Chromium browser running on Xbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qBec3Q"&gt;Extension support is the only big feature that’s really missing right now. I’m not sure if this is a general restriction with the Xbox version, or whether Microsoft might implement it once this Chromium version is ready to release. Either way, if you try to add a Chrome or Edge extension it will fail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v7IHls"&gt;The big reason you might want to use this new version of Edge on the Xbox is for the greatly improved web compatibility. This allows services like Discord, Skype, or even Google Stadia to run on the Xbox version of Edge. Discord will let you join voice calls and participate in text channel chats, but microphone support isn’t there just yet. This is a really early version, so it’s likely that it will be supported eventually. Likewise, if you switch to another game or app, Discord calls in the Edge browser do not continue in the background. This may also change before this Edge update is broadly available, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RpFjLlOZslHt2hZ-Xx7q5ixxob0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410206/Xbox_Series_X___Xbox_Series_X_2021_03_31_11_23_54.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Stadia runs well on Edge for Xbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jvpXfG"&gt;Google Stadia works really smoothly. I’ve been able to stream multiple games using the service, and the Xbox controller is automatically detected and supported in games. I’ve also tried to use Nvidia’s GeForce Now streaming service, but Nvidia appears to be blocking the Edge user agent string, and there are no developer tools or extensions that will allow me to spoof the Chrome user agent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jRGQa"&gt;Elsewhere, I’ve also tested out Office web apps in this Xbox version of Edge. They work as reliably as you’d expect, and you can even hook up a keyboard to the Xbox and type away. Unfortunately, mouse support isn’t available in this Edge browser yet. That appears to be part of a broader restriction on Xbox apps accessing a mouse on Microsoft’s consoles, so it’s not clear if this will be fully supported in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fRBVo4"&gt;Edge on Xbox is currently based on Chromium 91, which is expected to debut on desktop versions of Edge in May. Microsoft hasn’t revealed when it plans to release this Xbox version, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CeSYX0"&gt;This Edge browser is already a big improvement over the legacy version that exists on Xbox today. Full sync support, web compatibility, and just the general interface is greatly improved. While Xbox typically gets dedicated streaming apps for most services, this Edge update will be useful for many who want to access everything the web has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei offsets US sanctions with dominance in China</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Af8fcRxm6zH8VUmG73tu2q8x2Sw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69052969/acastro_190521_1777_huawei_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JZZ9ln"&gt;Huawei has released its annual report and financial information for 2020, demonstrating the effect that US sanctions had on its business last year. The report shows that while revenue from North America and Europe has fallen significantly, stronger performance in China has allowed the company to record higher sales and net profit than a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WyCTqS"&gt;Huawei doesn’t report traditional quarterly earnings, since it’s a private company with an unusual employee ownership structure. Its annual reports tend to be the best look at how it’s actually performing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D5agUQ"&gt;The company’s revenue for 2020 was 891.4 billion yuan (~$136 billion), a 3.8-percent increase on 2019. Net profit was up 3.2 percent to 64.6 billion yuan (~$9.86 billion). 66 percent of Huawei’s sales were in China last year, up from 59 percent the previous year; revenue from the Americas, meanwhile, plunged 24.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uwbicq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Revenue from the Americas plunged 24.5 percent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QW1Imb"&gt;Huawei notes that its carrier business grew in China because of a fast local 5G rollout, which leans heavily on Huawei’s technology — competitor Nokia is notable by its absence in the market. 5G network deployment was also strong in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, according to the company. But in the Americas, the sharp decline in revenue was attributed to “investment fluctuations in some countries’ telecoms markets.” Countries like Canada chose Samsung over Huawei for their 5G rollout, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TmdBMU"&gt;An unnamed Huawei executive &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/03/31/impact-us-campaign-against-huawei/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and other publications this week that 2020 was “a really tough year” for the company. The export restrictions imposed by the US are said to have had “a huge impact to Huawei, especially for Huawei’s consumer business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CAvURX"&gt;According to Huawei, its consumer division actually grew its revenue by 3.3 percent in 2020. It’s clear, though, that the company’s smartphone sales in particular are falling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22318941/china-smartphone-market-share-oppo-huawei-vivo-apple-xiaomi-january-2021"&gt;even in China&lt;/a&gt;, largely due to a lack of manufacturing capability as Huawei relies on components it stockpiled before the sanctions took hold. And as Bloomberg &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-31/huawei-quarterly-sales-fell-for-first-time-after-u-s-sanctions"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;, 2020’s final quarter saw Huawei’s quarterly profits shrink year on year for the first time ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DoOS7H"&gt;“For the long run we believe this is damaging the reputation and also the competitive advantage of US industry,” the executive reportedly said, adding that Huawei is yet to see any sign that the Biden administration might relax the restrictions that were put in place under former President Trump.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is making it easier to turn off algorithmic ranking in your News Feed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r2yl7Brc29bOXiK3f7etCwbDPgQ=/0x0:624x416/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69052954/image002.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WKPmx8"&gt;Facebook is introducing a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/03/more-control-and-context-in-news-feed/"&gt;handful of new features&lt;/a&gt; that will give users greater control over their News Feed, including an easier way to turn off the feed’s algorithmic ranking and display content in the order it was posted instead.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="omj2Gn"&gt;The changes build on previous tweaks to News Feed functionality. Last October, Facebook introduced a “&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/1634545223376778"&gt;Favorites&lt;/a&gt;” tool that allows users to select up to thirty friends and pages, prioritizing their content or displaying it in a separate feed. The company also offers users the option to sort their feeds by “&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/218728138156311"&gt;most recent&lt;/a&gt;,” but buries these options in obscure menus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEnExx"&gt;Facebook is now making these “Favorites” and “Recent” filters much more prominent, putting them right at the top of the News Feed as separate tabs that users can switch between. You can see what that looks like in the screenshots below: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0_cMebgRygLoasdRdPThfvRZWHo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410181/image002.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The News Feed filter bar will let users swap between algorithmic, chronological, and “favorites” filters. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6kHq7B"&gt;This filter bar is launching globally on Facebook’s Android app today and coming to iOS “in the coming weeks.” It’s not clear if it will be available on the web version of Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bB52j2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The filter bar will disappear if you don’t regularly use it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nDIav9"&gt;But there’s a big caveat: the filter bar isn’t a &lt;em&gt;permanent&lt;/em&gt; addition to Facebook’s user interface. The company told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the feature will disappear if users don’t access the Favorites tool for seven days. They will then have to find their favorites through the preferences menu for the News Feed and the filter bar will return. Similarly, the “most recent” tab will also disappear if not regularly accessed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sWZjxY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nick Clegg doesn’t think Facebook is polarizing","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22359026/facebook-nick-clegg-newsfeed-medium-decoder"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Pt7Hao"&gt;In addition to the filter bar, Facebook is introducing a new tool that lets users limit who can comment on their posts (this can be restricted to friends or just to tagged people and pages) and expanding the content covered by its “Why am I seeing this?” feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndM2vF"&gt;This latter tool was introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/1/18290195/facebooks-news-feed-why-am-i-seeing-this-post-ad-context-interaction"&gt;last April&lt;/a&gt; and lets users click on posts suggested by Facebook’s algorithms to see why it was recommended to them. These explanations will now cover suggested posts from pages or people that users &lt;em&gt;don’t &lt;/em&gt;follow, showing how posts’ related topics, interactions, and location led to them being suggested. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wJEh3Qs8h8Scl6bd7wiYIp0SkPg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410185/image003.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Why am I seeing this?” will offer more information about why posts were suggested to users. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lHedTH"&gt;These changes are relatively minor, but overall give people more control over Facebook’s often opaque algorithms. The changes suggest that the world’s largest social network is keen to deflect criticism over choices made by its algorithmic systems. This is not surprising considering that the company has repeatedly come under fire over studies that show these automated systems amplify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313013/far-right-news-misinformation-facebook-us-2020-election-nyu-study-engagement"&gt;misinformation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21270659/facebook-division-news-feed-algorithms"&gt;extremist&lt;/a&gt; content in an apparent bid to drive up user engagement — a metric that rules Facebook’s design choices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWqu2x"&gt;Such criticisms have been levied against the site for years, but have become increasingly sharp in recent months as legislators and the company’s own Oversight Board mull &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22335801/algorithms-artificial-intelligence-facebook-instagram-recommendations"&gt;more intrusive regulation&lt;/a&gt; of Facebook’s algorithms. With this in mind, it’s makes sense for the company to give its users the ability to opt-out of algorithmic sorting altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8XaJN"&gt;But as is often the case with Facebook, the company seems hesitant to commit to changes that might undermine its own engagement stats. If the filter bar disappears after seven days of inactivity, it invites an obvious question: is Facebook really serious about letting users choose what they see on the site, or does it just want to give the appearance of control?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nick Clegg doesn’t think Facebook is polarizing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dES1k9KREYm4qDNx2O3BVp7FZWw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69052930/VRG_ILLO_4499_Decoder_Nick_Clegg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Facebook’s VP of global affairs on the platform’s new changes, with Casey Newton&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="gx9QYV"&gt;There is no shortage of criticisms that get leveled at Facebook: it’s spreading misinformation and hate speech, it’s too polarizing, it’s responsible for fraying the very fabric of society. The list goes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uk70yQ"&gt;This morning, Facebook’s VP of global affairs, Nick Clegg, published &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@nickclegg/you-and-the-algorithm-it-takes-two-to-tango-7722b19aa1c2"&gt;a lengthy Medium post&lt;/a&gt; addressing some of these criticisms and unveiled some changes the company is making to give users more control over their experience. Specifically, the company is going to allow Facebook users to customize their feeds and how the algorithm presents content from other Facebook users to them. “People should be able to better understand how the ranking algorithms work and why they make particular decisions, and they should have more control over the content that is shown to them,” Clegg writes. “You should be able to talk back to the algorithm and consciously adjust or ignore the predictions it makes—to alter your personal algorithm in the cold light of day, through breathing spaces built into the design of the platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9DVGIZ"&gt;There’s a lot to discuss there. And to help us unpack the post, Clegg sat down with &lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt; editor and &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; contributing editor Casey Newton yesterday for a special episode of &lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4l4WA"&gt;In particular, Clegg does not think Facebook is designed to reward provocative content, which is a new rebuttal to the company’s critics (and likely a surprise to anyone who’s paid attention to their Facebook feeds). “The reality is, it’s not in Facebook’s interest – financially or reputationally – to continually turn up the temperature and push users towards ever more extreme content,” Clegg writes in his post. “Bear in mind, the vast majority of Facebook’s revenue is from advertising. Advertisers don’t want their brands and products displayed next to extreme or hateful content – a point that many made explicitly last summer during a high-profile boycott by a number of household-name brands.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSCXME"&gt;Fundamentally, Clegg’s argument is that the Facebook backlash isn’t rooted in fact or science, and that if it gets carried away, we’re never going to get to the better version of the internet that a lot of us want, and he’s trying to reset the debates on Facebook’s terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXUcbY"&gt;We’ll leave it to you to decide how successful he is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wE84XT"&gt;Okay, Casey Newton with Nick Clegg, VP of global affairs at Facebook. Here we go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZVjTT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WmpMAV"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP8460342416" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rft3T2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is a lightly edited excerpt from their conversation. This post will be updated with a full transcript of the interview on Friday, April 2nd. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Xme6t"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most of us, we’re not math majors or computer science majors. And so there is some sort of fear and uncertainty about what’s going on in the background. One of the things that Facebook is now doing is giving us some new ways to change up what we see in the News Feed. So what are some of these new controls?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKXTey"&gt;So some of the controls are old. We’ve had them for a while, but we’re just going to make them a lot more prominent. So for instance, you could always switch to a chronological feed. But candidly, it wasn’t easy for people to find. So we’re now going to have a feed filter bar. When you scroll to the top of your feed, it’ll be there. It’ll always be there, and you can toggle between the feed as it currently exists, to have it chronologically ordered, or crucially, and this is new, so that you can create your own new feed of favorites — of favorite groups, friends, posts, and so on. And you’ll be able to curate that, if you like, for yourself and toggle between those three — the feed as it is, the chronological feed, and your new favorites feed — in a much, much more effortless way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGTy9Y"&gt;It’ll be much more visible. It’ll be visible there when you scroll to the top of your feed. There are other new controls as well, which I’m announcing this week. You’ll be able to curate with much greater granularity than before who can comment on your posts. And that is something which wasn’t available before. And we’re also going to extend something which has existed for ads, for instance, and for connected content. Namely, why am I seeing this? So you can go to the three dots and you can see, “Why am I seeing this ad?” We’re now going to extend that to suggested content. So when something’s suggested to you, that cooking video, you can go on the three dots, and you can see why you’re seeing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="beeDGx"&gt;So I think, collectively, it’s a start. I’m not going to pretend that those changes in and of themselves will lift all the questions that people have about how social media operates and how they interact with Facebook. But I do feel that they are significant steps in a better direction, putting users more in charge, being more open and transparent about things, and we will follow up with a number of additional steps, greater transparency, greater controls in the months to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgiHlK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that also a suggestion that maybe this is the beginning of this feed filter bar that you’re introducing, that that might have more filters that come to it over time? Is the idea that users will have more and more control over how the stuff they see is ranked?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfJNQH"&gt;Yeah. Look, in an ideal world, you just want to push ever more forcefully in the direction where people can personalize their feeds. And if people want to see more or see less of particular forms of content, from particular pages or groups, there is also, conceptually, at least the possibility of exploring whether people can or can’t, if you like, turn the dial up or down on particular classes of content. That’s exactly the kind of work that we want to do. Now, exactly how granular, exactly which dials apply to which kinds of content, all of that still needs to be filled in. But that is very much the direction we’re going.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNafGV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So the conventional wisdom about how the feed works now, I think for a lot of folks, and certainly of the folks who are most critical of Facebook, is that it rewards the most polarizing and outrageous content. And this is something that you really take on in this piece and push back against. I suspect if there’s one sentence in your piece that most people will take issue with, it’s when you write, “Facebook’s systems are not designed to reward provocative content.” At the same time, when we look at lists of pages that get the most engagement, it does tend to be pages that seem to be pushing really polarizing content. So how do you reconcile this at Facebook?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsTRXs"&gt;Well, firstly, I of course accept that we need to just provide more and more data and more evidence about what is the specific content that is popular on News Feed. And then of course, although Facebook’s critics often talk about sensational content dominating News Feed, of course we want to show, as I think we can, that many of the most popular posts on News Feed are lighthearted. They’re feel-good stories. We want to show people that the overwhelming majority of the posts people see on News Feed are about pets, babies, vacations, and similar. Not incendiary topics. In fact, I think on Monday, one most popular posts in the US was a mother bear with three or four baby cubs crossing a road. I saw it myself. It’s lovely. I strongly recommend that you look at it. And I think we can, and we will, do more to substantiate that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruSS5s"&gt;But beyond that, I do think, and I do try to grapple with this as thoroughly, as is possible in a 5,000-word piece. Firstly, the signals that are used in the ranking process are far more complex, are far more sophisticated, and have far more checks and balances in it than are implied by this cardboard cutout caricature that somehow we’re just spoon-feeding people incendiary, sensational stuff. And I’m happy to go into the details if you like, but thousands of signals are used, literally from the device that you use to the groups that you’re members of and so on. We survey evidence. We’re using more and more survey evidence. We’ll be doing more of that in the future as well to ask people what they find most meaningful. There’s been a big shift in recent years anyway to reward content that is more meaningful, your connections with your families and friends, rather than stuff that is just crudely engaging — pages from politicians and personalities and celebrities and sports pages and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yg3fc6"&gt;So that shift has already been underway. But in terms of incentives, this is the bit that  maybe we have not been articulate enough about. Firstly, the people who pay our lunch don’t like the content next to incendiary, unpleasant material. And if you needed any further proof of that, this last summer, a number of major advertisers boycotted Facebook because they felt we weren’t doing enough on hate speech. We were getting much better at reducing the prevalence of hate speech. The prevalence of hate speech is now down to, what? 0.07, 0.08 percent of content on Facebook. So every 10,000 pieces of content you see, seven or eight might be bad. I wish it was down to zero. I don’t think we’ll ever get it down to zero. So we have a massive incentive to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1bmkx"&gt;But also if you think about it, if you’re building a product which you want to survive for the long term, where your people in 10 years, in 15 years, in 20 years to still be using these products, there’s really no incentive for the company to give people the kind of sugar rush of artificially polarizing content, which might keep them on board for 10 or 20 minutes extra. Now, we want to solve for 10 or 20 years, not for 10 or 20 extra minutes. And so I don’t think our incentives are pointed in the direction that many people assume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="1g57Ir"&gt;That all being said, it is of course true... any sub editor of a newspaper will tell you. It’s why tabloids have unused striking imagery and cage--rattling language on their front pages since time immemorial. Of course there are emotions of fear, of anger, of jealousy, of rage, which of course provoke emotional responses. They’ve done so in all media, in all time. And so of course emotive content provokes an emotive reaction amongst people. We can’t reprogram human nature, and we don’t want to deny that, which is why our CrowdTangle tool actually elaborates on that and shows how things have been engaged. But as you know, there is a world of difference between that which is most engaged with — in other words, where comments and shares are most common — and actually the content that most people see. And that’s quite, quite different. Actually, if you look at what most human beings, if you look at eyeballs, rather than comments and shares, you get a quite different picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0IJG3E"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden plans to connect every American to broadband in new infrastructure package</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Remarks On COVID-19 Response And State Of Vaccinations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZHfYvrL6_QTWaDdNBiVnzaspBSE=/0x0:6102x4068/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69052849/1232006796.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jWegYF"&gt;President Biden plans to announce a sweeping infrastructure plan Wednesday that includes $100 billion to connect every American to high-speed broadband internet over the next eight years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBZ5Uy"&gt;Biden is scheduled &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/03/30/biden-infrastructure-plan-478627"&gt;to unveil his $2 trillion&lt;/a&gt; “American Jobs Plan” in Pittsburgh later on Wednesday. The long-awaited infrastructure and jobs package contains funding for broadband expansion, semiconductor manufacturing, and slew of other interests like public transportation and helping consumers purchase electric vehicles. On a call with reporters Tuesday, an administration official said that the package would be paid for by changes to the corporate tax rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hQwY2S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Biden’s $100 billion figure for broadband expansion trumps most other efforts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hqMIV7"&gt;Biden’s $100 billion figure for broadband expansion trumps most other efforts to finish connecting every household in the US to the internet. Earlier this month, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Rep. James E. Clyburn (D-SC) &lt;a href="https://www.klobuchar.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/news-releases?ID=C3C8F0E4-61D4-46FE-A28A-F81A09620A5D"&gt;announced their own bill&lt;/a&gt; that would invest $94 billion to close the digital divide. In previous years, the Federal Communications Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21117306/iowa-caucus-rural-broadband-access-election-campaign-sanders-warren"&gt;has put together more than&lt;/a&gt; $20 billion to reward cooperatives, satellite operators, and other telecoms who launch broadband projects in unserved areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7z9He4"&gt;Biden’s package also calls for 100 percent broadband coverage by the end of the decade and prioritizes networks affiliated with local governments, nonprofits and cooperatives and promises funding for projects on tribal lands. Biden’s broadband plan also seeks to encourage adoption by reducing the cost of internet service long term. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJjxlt"&gt;“While the President recognizes that individual subsidies to cover internet costs may be needed in the short term, he believes continually providing subsidies to cover the cost of overpriced internet service is not the right long-term solution for consumers or taxpayers,” a fact sheet for the package reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uWiE4"&gt;The package also provides tax incentives and rebates to encourage consumers to purchase electric vehicles along with a plan to electrify the federal fleet, including United States Postal Service trucks. Over $50 billion is set aside for investment in domestic semiconductor manufacturing, a particularly vital issue in light of recent shortages. In February, Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298376/biden-sign-semiconductor-shortage-executive-order-apple-amd-playstation"&gt;signed an executive order&lt;/a&gt; calling for government reviews into the semiconductor supply chain following a massive chip shortage created by the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zpsE8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWrGeI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Meet’s free ‘unlimited’ calls will continue until June</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ln-lzMw5941MNSsCjaPpTIduOg4=/352x469:3849x2800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69052780/ExvvZezWUAQGw_G.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Meet.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p9TSLm"&gt;Google will not introduce a 60 minute call limit on free Google Meet users at the end of March, the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleWorkspace/status/1376957338733674499"&gt;announced in a tweet&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, it will now be begin on June 30th. Until then, anyone using the service’s free version will be able to host calls up to 24 hours in length, which Google refers to as “unlimited.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVZlQj"&gt;This is the second time Google has pushed back the introduction of call limits since opening up the service to free users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21240509/google-meet-video-conferencing-free-gmail"&gt;last April&lt;/a&gt;. A 60 minute limit had originally been due to come into effect at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/26/21457293/google-meet-limit-meeting-free-plans-september-zoom"&gt;end of September&lt;/a&gt;, but that deadline was later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21494189/google-meet-limit-calls-minutes-march-2021"&gt;pushed back to March&lt;/a&gt; when it became clear that many of us wouldn’t be able to celebrate the holidays in person with our loved ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kGoZas"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re continuing unlimited &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoogleMeet?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GoogleMeet&lt;/a&gt; calls (up to 24 hours) in the free version through June 2021 for Gmail accounts → &lt;a href="https://t.co/fqBTmoNPBW"&gt;https://t.co/fqBTmoNPBW&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Ax0fmbRvqr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Ax0fmbRvqr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Google Workspace (@GoogleWorkspace) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleWorkspace/status/1376957338733674499?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kyv3Yi"&gt;Google hasn’t explicitly said why it’s extending its deadline this time, but the continued pandemic restrictions in place around the world probably have something to do with it. I think I speak for everyone when I say I hope Google won’t have a reason to extend its deadline again come June. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Even LinkedIn is making a Clubhouse clone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Linkedin Launches 24 Hours Stories" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B6Sjz_CFn2qTvGQNzKO9mVPHZik=/3x0:2912x1939/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69051839/1229184687.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Lorenzo Di Cola/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zLdmBl"&gt;It feels like just about every big tech company is working on a Clubhouse-like social audio feature — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323767/twitter-spaces-april-release-date-plan"&gt;Twitter’s Spaces feature is rolling out now&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276645/facebook-clubhouse-social-audio-app-develop"&gt;Facebook is reportedly building one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356993/spotify-locker-room-clubhouse-launch-acquisition"&gt;Spotify is making one&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315866/mark-cuban-fireside-app-podcast-platform-clubhouse"&gt;Mark Cuban has one&lt;/a&gt;, even &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/26/slack-wants-to-be-more-than-a-text-based-messaging-platform/"&gt;Slack is getting in the game&lt;/a&gt;. But now, the idea of the shared audio space, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21325678/venture-capitalists-vc-media-silicon-valley-clubhouse-tech-journalists"&gt;started on Clubhouse largely as an exclusive club&lt;/a&gt; for tech venture capitalists and elites, has come full circle. Professional social network LinkedIn is working on an audio networking feature of its own, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/30/linkedin-confirms-its-working-on-a-clubhouse-rival-too/"&gt;the company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oL61Uk"&gt;“We’re doing some early tests to create a unique audio experience connected to your professional identity,” LinkedIn said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. “And, we’re looking at how we can bring audio to other parts of LinkedIn such as events and groups, to give our members even more ways to connect to their community.” LinkedIn shared the same statement with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; after we first published this article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEi6hf"&gt;LinkedIn said the feature will begin beta testing soon. Below is a mockup of what the feature might look like, which LinkedIn shared with &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch. &lt;/em&gt;Like Clubhouse and Twitter Spaces, it features a stage of speakers front and center and a list of people in the audience lower down the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GvsKbeXQWIsDNv9am8X_ST_HeW0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22409358/Concept_Mock.LinkedIn.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WLlCnL"&gt;LinkedIn has already been working to make itself a destination for creators with tools like a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/linkedin-adds-creator-mode-to-help-more-of-its-users-turn-influencers-11617129192"&gt;new Creator mode&lt;/a&gt; that denote you as a LinkedIn content creator on your profile. A Clubhouse-like feature actually seems like a natural fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pnTH8B"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Anti-Asian hate is spilling over to LinkedIn","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358649/anti-asian-hate-violence-linkedin-content-moderation-atlanta-shooting"},{"title":"LinkedIn is testing Snapchat-like stories because that’s the world we live in now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21156247/linkedin-testing-instagram-stories-feature-social-network-resumes-why"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ETn1AW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 30th, 10:05PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added that LinkedIn shared a statement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
