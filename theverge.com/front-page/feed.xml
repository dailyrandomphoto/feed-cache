    <title>Itch.io is waiving all sales fees today for ‘Creator Day’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I6H527X15a0-jViGBhO8NkPJ1y8=/275x0:2540x1510/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69287986/Screen_Shot_2021_05_14_at_9.26.22_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zbhGdJ"&gt;Indie game storefront &lt;a href="http://Itch.io"&gt;Itch.io&lt;/a&gt; is waiving sales fees on everything today, May 14th, as part of the company’s first &lt;a href="https://itch.io/blog/252069/announcing-the-first-itchio-creator-day"&gt;Creator Day&lt;/a&gt;. Anyone selling things on the diverse storefront (which includes everything from indie games to music to entire magazines) will be able to keep “100 percent of sales after taxes and payment processor fees.” It’s similar to Bandcamp’s monthly creator program &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188143/bandcamp-waives-sales-fees-artists-affected-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;Bandcamp Fridays&lt;/a&gt; (although Itch.io hasn’t said on what schedule it’ll run the promotion in the future).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwNe5R"&gt;Itch.io is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/29/18118217/itchio-steam-leaf-corcoran-pc-games-indie"&gt;beloved by creators&lt;/a&gt; for being relatively easy to use and generally more transparent than other bigger game storefronts like Steam. It also takes a smaller cut than most other online game platforms: Itch.io traditionally only asks for 10 percent of what creators earn on its storefront in comparison to Apple’s App Store and Steam, which typically start with a 30 percent cut (you can read about other platform fees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;in our handy guide&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0P5fw"&gt;Content standards are also a bit looser on Itch.io, which might be the other reason you’ve heard about the storefront recently. Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22395997/epic-games-store-pc-apps-windows-store-brave-discord-itch"&gt;started offering Itch.io’s desktop client&lt;/a&gt; in April as a free download in its storefront (yes a store inside a store, it’s odd). As part of the ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic Games v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, Apple attempted to use the fact that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425759/epic-apple-trial-app-store-itch-io-offensive-sexualized-unspeakable-games-day-5"&gt;Itch.io features experimental and often sexually explicit content&lt;/a&gt; as justification for why Epic shouldn’t be allowed to offer its app store as an alternative to Apple’s. Of course Epic has no responsibility to moderate games sold on an entirely separate platform just because they offer that store as a download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hv7AwY"&gt;Online marketplace drama aside, Itch.io is absolutely worth a browse, especially today. The games can be a bit NSFW and even unfinished, and there’s almost certainly stuff you won’t want to play, read, or listen to, but it’s also on the cutting edge. Whether you realize it or not, the next big thing (or your next favorite game) could already be hanging out on &lt;a href="http://Itch.io"&gt;Itch.io&lt;/a&gt;, made by someone on their free time. And if you buy that game today, they’ll get to keep more of the proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g94oMx"&gt;Itchi.io’s Creator Day runs all of May 14th and ends at 11:59PM PT / 2:59 AM ET (May 15th).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvX4BN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="NXmO8B"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKDtL1"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, Nilay and Dieter talk with &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; senior reporter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/adi-robertson"&gt;Adi Robertson&lt;/a&gt; about the second week of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic Games v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; trial, which involved a lot of arguing over the definition of a game and whether a banana should wear clothing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hulilM"&gt;Both Nilay and &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; writer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/monica-chin"&gt;Monica Chin&lt;/a&gt; have tried to use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"&gt;Starlink&lt;/a&gt;, Elon Musk’s space-based ISP. The results have been middling — and infuriating if you think too much about why everybody is so excited for Starlink in the first place. Plus, Monica has the details on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423545/intel-tiger-lake-h-mobile-processors-11th-gen-laptops"&gt;Intel’s newest Tiger Lake-H processors&lt;/a&gt; and the many, many laptops that are about to use it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart confirms it is indeed still selling Pokémon cards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Walmart DTD 555" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kJ4O4rdunWA3AnLF7uQkXSod2w4=/2x0:554x368/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69287642/walmart555.1419973090.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Walmart DTD 555&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1PfR9J"&gt;Contrary to published reports, Walmart confirmed in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Friday that it has not suspended the sale of any trading cards, including the Pokémon cards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433236/target-halts-sale-pokemon-mlb-nba-nfl-trading-cards-may-14"&gt;that Target recently took off its shelves&lt;/a&gt;. There have been &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-05-13-pokemon-cards-pulled-from-target-and-walmart-due-to-safety-concerns"&gt;reports on social media&lt;/a&gt; of people seeing signs at Walmart stores indicating that the retailer would also no longer be selling the cards in stores, but it appears that’s not official policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1DLyxi"&gt;There’s been a bit of a mania around Pokémon cards, and trading cards in general lately, with card rating companies being buried in “an avalanche of cardboard” as collectors try to up the value of their cards with an official grade. Apparently, the collectors’ market has people excited about buying new cards: the Pokémon Company has been rushing to produce more new cards, and there have been &lt;a href="https://www.fox6now.com/news/fight-over-trading-cards-outside-brookfield-target"&gt;fights in parking lots&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thegamer.com/man-arrested-after-failed-pokemon-card-heist-no-team-rocket-members-involved/"&gt;elaborate heists&lt;/a&gt;. Unsurprisingly, &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/pokemon-card-opening-day-celebration-video-logan-paul-elite-box-2021-2"&gt;Logan Paul is involved&lt;/a&gt;, hyping up the value in the collectors’ market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0yS1Y"&gt;It’s gotten to the point where Target decided to call it quits, posting signs informing customers that Pokémon, MLB, NFL, and NBA cards would no longer be sold in stores. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Thursday, Target said that the temporary suspension was done “out of an abundance of caution” for the safety of its employees and customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zA8Vr"&gt;Walmart did say that it had, in fact, seen increased demand for the cards, and that it was “determining what, if any, changes are needed” to meet it, while still keeping everybody safe. So far, it’s unclear if the situation will change for Walmart and other retailers, now that people have one fewer store to buy their cards from.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Whale hugs, ‘active sea serpents,’ and the wild world of whale sex </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Northern Right whale" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/luI0npye8sJPGQLpGzs1tnKaf68=/9x0:5091x3388/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69287370/639203570.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ebccv0"&gt;Adorable drone footage came out last week showing two right whales touching bellies and wrapping their flippers around each other — appearing to “hug.” It was a moment rarely caught on camera. Scientists still aren’t exactly sure what that behavior really means, but the moment is a window into the dramatic world of whale sex and conservation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZGeBdY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lZvO4pp6Alo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OhVKPN"&gt;The video that’s been released to the public was just one snippet of a series of footage from two drones that was captured on February 28th in Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts. The team documenting what happened that day included veterinarian and senior scientist Michael Moore from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), National Geographic photographer Brian Skerry, and Amy Knowlton from the New England Aquarium. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;spoke with Moore about what he saw that day, and why the video they captured is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AINbNB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcL600"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were you researching when your team caught this moment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGrI4H"&gt;We’ve had a longtime interest in the health of North American right whales because they need to be healthy to be able to reproduce and make babies. The focus of so much of the conservation efforts for the endangered species or declining endangered species has been on reducing mortality. Mortality is really important stuff, obviously. But if you stop the mortalities, but you don’t enable them to have a better reproductive life, then the trend isn’t going to reverse. So you need babies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="rZqmgf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You need babies.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KMoqLy"&gt;As a veterinarian, I’m always interested in the condition of an animal. How does it look? For a wild animal, that means getting informative photographs because you can’t get hands on them. You can’t listen to them with a stethoscope. And so we’ve been working with colleagues since the late ‘90s to look at the body condition and the growth rate of North Atlantic right whales using aerial photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DdulUb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you walk me through the moments leading up to the event?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1rdki"&gt;Essentially, our routine is to line up the stars in terms of weather, people, and whales. It was early in the season, so the information wasn’t that solid and the weather wasn’t that good, but we did have a good day. We hopped on the boat and out we went. We work with folks with the aquarium who are really good whale observers to help us find the whales, and Brian Skerry was also with us getting footage, stills, for his work in the magazine business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BuPzCH"&gt;We’d scoot around the bay looking for groups of whales, and we found some. Once we felt that we knew what was going on and settled down, we launched the drones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gyygYw"&gt;The behavioral event that we documented there is called a surface active group; that’s where right whales come together and they spend time at and near the surface together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dccHx6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did you see the whales doing? Is what you captured considered a hug? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1CPlQ"&gt;The word “belly-to-belly” is the word that has been used in the database of behaviors by the New England aquarium to standardize, “Okay, at this point in time, these animals are lying side by side and their bellies were touching each other.” So belly-to-belly is a neutral term that adequately describes what that video shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nLydnX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“belly-to-belly”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dSmxTs"&gt;Were they hugging? I mean, we didn’t ever say they &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; hugging. But we asked the question because I think it’s a reasonable question. I guess hugging has an operational definition and an implication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnFsCb"&gt;So, operationally, a hug is where two mammals — I don’t know, maybe only humans can hug, it all depends on how you define things — wrap their arms around each other. You know, the flippers of a right whale are homologous to the arms of a human. So physically, yeah, they were hugging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TzmX3Z"&gt;If you include the concept of affection in the definition of a hug, then we don’t know whether they were hugging or not. We don’t know if they were showing affection or not. We can hypothesize that they were; it would be hard to test that hypothesis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrQ3CR"&gt;The hardcore scientists do believe that behaviors that humans demonstrate are unique to humans. Certainly it’s easier to interrogate two humans who have been hugging and ask them whether they were showing affection. You can’t do that for whales, so we really don’t know what they were doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZPVZbj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They need a whole lot more love”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nI2ppY"&gt;One of the reasons why I wanted that video to be widely seen was there was an aesthetic in that video that certainly had some emotional qualities. And given the extent to which the right whale species has been devastated by anthropogenic trauma, a little bit of anthropomorphism, if that were to build some sympathy and empathy for these animals, is something that I’m totally prepared to indulge in. These animals need every piece of help they can get from the human race. They need a whole lot more love from many humans than they’re currently getting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6iB52g"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;North Atlantic right whales are considered &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.iucn.org/news/species/202007/almost-a-third-lemurs-and-north-atlantic-right-whale-now-critically-endangered-iucn-red-list"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;critically endangered, and “one step from extinction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.” What threats are the whales facing from humans? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Editor’s note: the rest of the interview contains some graphic descriptions of both whale injuries and whale sex. Also, “sea serpents.”]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gunvcm"&gt;I’ve spent a fair amount of time looking at dead right whales on beaches to diagnose why they died, and the two primary causes of death we document are entanglements with fishing gear and collisions with ships. Collisions with ships generally break down into either being cut up like a loaf of bread with a spinning propeller, or they get hit by a blunt part of the ship, and then they get bruised and broken bones. That’s unfortunate and totally inappropriate, and needs to stop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAWrJn"&gt;The entanglement process varies in terms of the size of the animal. The bigger and stronger they are, the more likely they are to successfully avoid drowning because they have enough power to swim up to the surface and break the gear away so they can breathe. If you’re entangled fatally, you’re probably going to take six months to die. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XY02VV"&gt;I don’t care if it’s a wild animal or if it’s a human, it shouldn’t happen. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Northern right whale, &lt;/em&gt;Eubalaena glacialis&lt;em&gt;. Watching Northern right whales in the Bay of Fundy, New Brunswick, Canada.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5Pvfdn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It must have been a welcome break for you to see healthy whales.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZqUtt"&gt;One of the motivations for us to share that video was that there’s been so much bad news about right whales. It was time to have something that was beautiful — and intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wRPPcc"&gt;These surface active groups can involve copulation. We don’t know if any baby right whales were conceived that day. The two in that video were male so obviously not in that instance. But there were females around and there were active penises in the video and so on so forth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EIWX8"&gt;So it’s as close as one comes to seeing some hope that these animals have a chance of recovering through sexual activity, which is good. Right whale reproduction is actually pretty extraordinary. I don’t know if you want to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGNhFL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I do now. Were you able to actually capture reproduction from that group of whales that day? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIPZIh"&gt;I don’t know, to answer your question briefly. In the surface active groups, there are quite often observations of what we call “sea serpents.” And you can imagine what they really are: these long, flexible, snaky things. A right whale penis is about 12 feet long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ms2bIb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We did see penises waving around in the water”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YUjP6H"&gt;We did see penises waving around in the water. But we didn’t actually record any finishes in the right place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruMF3U"&gt;Male right whales have the largest testicles of any living mammal. And that is because males have evolved to compete with each other, not physically or violently in any way, for access to the female, but purely by sheer volume. At times, we have had photographs in the past where not one but two finished in the &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Simultaneous-copulation-of-two-male-right-whales-with-a-female-in-the-Bay-of-Fundy-11_fig1_236892818"&gt;right place at the same time&lt;/a&gt;. Because essentially, they try to flush each other out by having more volume than anybody else. I’m trying to be sensitive to this because it’s just a complicated topic. &lt;em&gt;Chuckles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xao9h1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did the two whales that were captured in that belly-to-belly moment have “active sea serpents”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNN3t2"&gt;Actually what I recall was the active sea serpents were coming up from further down in the water column so they were from other whales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EPoM2f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since your conservation research focuses on reproduction, is there anything that conservationists can do to encourage that behavior?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6pgqR"&gt;The behavior will happen when they’re ready to get pregnant, when they’re receptive. The receptiveness of these animals, I think, depends upon their health. If they are fit and fat and ready to commit to get pregnant, they’ll do it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Right Whales Spotted Close To Shore On Cape Cod Bay" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ASuXsin5BZwmuNd8MrfefO83rjs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22514472/472571336.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DUXBURY, MA: An aerial view of a right whale erupting from the blowhole while feeding off the shores of Duxbury Beach. There were groups of the North Atlantic right whales swimming offshore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2uXhca"&gt;So, what we have to do as conservationists is to enhance their health, not just stop killing them. How do we do that? We reduce these stressors that are reducing their health. Vessel collision and entanglement aren’t just mortality factors. They’re are also sub-lethal stressors. The sub-lethal stressors involved with vessels are sub-lethal collisions, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22166314/covid-19-pandemic-ocean-noise-pollution"&gt;noise that they make when they go by causing a reduction in the abilities of the animals to communicate with each other&lt;/a&gt;. Every entanglement is another detriment to their health. They may just brush against [fishing gear] and get a small scar and that really wasn’t a big deal. They may be entangled for weeks or months, and then they’ll get out of it. During that time, they’ve been towing gear and traps and rope around. It’s been traumatizing to their skin, to their blubber. The drag will increase their energy output, they need to feed more. They’ll probably lose weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PaUMmz"&gt;So, what can we do to encourage that behavior? Get them into a situation where they are healthy enough to want to indulge in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFlqve"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything else you want people to know about right whales? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uiLwk"&gt;Anything they need to know about right whales they can read in my book that comes out in October, &lt;a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/W/bo113867120.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are all Whalers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Famicom Detective Club brings more great crime drama to the Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dLMjFWCHA095inMjZheCwh3VyLc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69287135/Switch_FDCgsb_SCRN_03_bmp_jpgcopy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p76AUx"&gt;There’s something about the Nintendo Switch that makes it a great fit for murder mystery stories. Just like a good novel, these are games best enjoyed while curled up in a comfy chair with a warm drink, ideally when it’s dark and rainy outside. That’s one of the reasons why games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/12/18306762/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy-remastered-review-xbox-ps4-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21166865/murder-by-numbers-review-nitendo-switch-steam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Murder By Numbers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are best enjoyed on Nintendo’s tablet, which lets you play wherever you want. It’s also what makes the &lt;em&gt;Famicom Detective Club&lt;/em&gt; series so interesting — a pair of long-lost titles from the ‘80s that have been given a fresh new life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KaP6CM"&gt;There are two titles launching today: &lt;em&gt;The Missing Heir&lt;/em&gt; and a prequel called &lt;em&gt;The Girl Who Stands Behind&lt;/em&gt;. Though they look new, these games were first released in 1988 and 1989, respectively. Each game has been given a modern makeover, with beautiful character portraits and detailed backdrops with just a hint of animation to make them feel alive. It’s a big step up from the original games, which were dominated by plain black menus and comparatively simple pixel art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VuVFNJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10500084"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nX9zZt"&gt;The Switch release also marks the English-language debut for the &lt;em&gt;Famicom Detective Club&lt;/em&gt; series. So far I’ve played through the first, &lt;em&gt;The Missing Heir&lt;/em&gt;, and it stands up surprisingly well for a 30-year-old game. It’s a typical setup for a murder mystery. After the matriarch of a rich family in a small Japanese town dies, the family’s butler hires you to investigate. It’s a story involving feuding siblings vying for control of a company, the titular missing heir who has the rights to a big inheritance, and even some superstitious villagers who believe the family is cursed. Oh, and to make matters even more challenging, your character is also suffering from amnesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jymmtS"&gt;It’s not a particularly original story, but it’s full of some great twists and turns, including more than one unexpected death. It plays out sort of like a less goofy version of the &lt;em&gt;Ace Attorney&lt;/em&gt; series, albeit without the courtroom drama. &lt;em&gt;Famicom Detective Club&lt;/em&gt; is probably best described as a visual novel, which means most of your time is spent talking to characters to gather hints. There’s also some light detective work where you can scan the environment for clues. You don’t necessarily get those big “ah ha!” moments that happen in other detective games, but &lt;em&gt;The Missing Heir&lt;/em&gt; makes up for this with a story that’s packed with mysteries, making it hard to put down.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i7nIR0Ab--_bvX-Jp9vRynww8To=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22514367/Switch_FDCmh_SCRN_04_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OYH14P"&gt;It’s mostly pretty straightforward: at any given moment there are only a few characters to talk to and one or two locations to explore. But this is also where the game starts to show its age. One of the more annoying aspects involves asking people the same questions multiple times in order to get new information. It gets tedious after a while, and there were a few times in the game where I found myself stuck, unable to find the trigger that pushed the story forward. There’s no hint system to help you along, either. That said, there are some nice quality-of-life features, like a robust notebook detailing all of the characters and a “previously on” story update every time you start playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQWFma"&gt;Perhaps the most remarkable thing about these games is that they barely feel dated at all. If it didn’t have “Famicom” in the title, I might think they were new crime dramas from Nintendo that just so happened to be set in the 1980s. What &lt;em&gt;Famicom Detective Club&lt;/em&gt; lacks in innovation it makes up for with everything else: gorgeous art, captivating writing, and more than enough mystery to keep you glued to your Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKYboU"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Famicom Detective Club: The Missing Heir &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt; The Girl Who Stands Behind&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; launch today on the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s Graduation Gift Guide 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C09GcY7_Ro5vm5n-plyAf1eCsKQ=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69287104/The_Verge_Graduation_Gift_Guide_2021.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Great gift ideas for those graduating into college and adulthood&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mDXDvd"&gt;It’s been a hard year for everyone, but it’s been especially grueling for high school seniors. Having to deal with classes, exams, and college applications and choices is difficult at the best of times but having to do most — or all — of it remotely during a plague year will stress even the most laid-back of students. So it stands to reason that this year’s grads deserve some extra-special gifts to make up for it all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHCSKk"&gt;This year, we’ve tried to put together a list of devices and other products that will make it easier for graduates to start on their new adventure: Macs, Chromebooks, and Windows PCs; earbuds and speakers; and stuff to help with cooking, gaming, and sleeping. Take a look and see if any of these are right for any graduates whom you may want to present with a congratulatory gift.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What to expect from Google I/O 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/olreDybsyCByu0E35VLRnzSiHd0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69286957/acastro_180130_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="91ZKxL"&gt;Google I/O, the company’s big developer conference, is back after being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188669/google-i-o-canceled-2020-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;canceled last year&lt;/a&gt; due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The keynote kicks off on Tuesday, May 18th, at 1PM ET / 10AM PT, and it will likely be packed with news about Google products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DPZcpc"&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://events.google.com/io/session/88b34a4e-6170-4f18-a321-4260fb559e60?lng=en"&gt;keynote’s official description&lt;/a&gt;, Google is unsurprisingly coy about what might be announced: “Tune in to find out about how we’re furthering our mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” But we can make a few educated guesses about what could be shown off at the event. Read on to find out what to expect from the big show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GSRDwk"&gt;We’ll likely learn a lot more about Android 12&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rYAORE3XLC6IBTuna27zSt12muA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22311867/VRG_1777_Android_12_005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HqJANM"&gt;Google often uses its Google I/O keynotes to exhaustively detail its next major version of Android, and we expect the same for this year’s release, Android 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ILdPV"&gt;Google has already released a few &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288084/android-12-developer-preview-available-google-pixel"&gt;developer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395383/android-12-developer-preview-3-haptics-camera-sensors-beta-release-date-features"&gt;previews&lt;/a&gt; of Android 12, which have mostly brought &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289976/android-12-developer-preview-roundup-notifications-redesign-tweaks-emergency-sos"&gt;a lot of small tweaks&lt;/a&gt; and developer-focused features. But at I/O, Google will likely reveal some of Android 12’s biggest user-facing features — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291296/android-12-developer-preview-ui-changes-widget-stacks-lock-screen-notifications"&gt;some significant UI changes&lt;/a&gt; that are rumored to be in the works, like stacked widgets and a new lock screen with larger clock text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sS3JCO"&gt;Android 12 seems poised to be a big upgrade, and Google will likely share a whole lot about it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vJJ1AR"&gt;Major Google services should get some spotlight, too&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7SJsRp"&gt;Google also likes to use I/O to showcase major updates to its services and software, and this year’s event will likely be no different. In previous years, we’ve seen Google use I/O to announce things like Google Maps’ incognito mode, new Assistant voices, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/8/17332070/google-assistant-makes-phone-call-demo-duplex-io-2018"&gt;Google Duplex demo&lt;/a&gt;, where the Google Assistant called a hair salon to book an appointment. Google could plan to take the wraps off some similarly exciting new features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gSDBwx"&gt;Maybe Google will announce the Pixel Buds A-Series for real this time&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WMN8ff"&gt;We already know the company is working on a new model of its Pixel Buds true wireless headphones — thanks in large part to a couple of huge leaks from Google itself — and perhaps they’ll make their debut (again) at I/O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WytV4x"&gt;Here’s the timeline of what’s been revealed so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="UQTbko"&gt;In March, two devices that seem very likely to be new Buds appeared &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/23/new-google-pixel-buds-incoming-fcc/"&gt;in Federal Communications Commission filings&lt;/a&gt; — a sign that can indicate that a product will go on sale sometime soon&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2nZxZ7"&gt;In April, Google included an image of an unreleased pair of olive green &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22370608/google-pixel-buds-a-photo-leak"&gt;Pixel Buds in an email&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="w8OFnW"&gt;Earlier this month, Google tweeted an announcement for the &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/04/google-pixel-buds-a-series-tweet/"&gt;“Pixel Buds A-Series”&lt;/a&gt; from the Android Twitter account before quickly removing the post&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/04/google-pixel-buds-a-series-tweet/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s official tweet about the “Pixel Buds A-Series,” before it was deleted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c0KAeC"&gt;These leaks don’t tell us all that much about the buds, but the “A-Series” moniker seems to indicate they’ll be a more affordable model of the company’s true wireless headphones, similar to how the lower-cost Pixel models are identified with “A” names like the Pixel 4A. And speaking of “A” phones...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Oj17Ru"&gt;We likely won’t see the Pixel 5A, even though it has already been announced&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="khJVai"&gt;Google officially announced the Pixel 5A 5G &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375780/google-announces-pixel-5a-5g-denying-rumors-cancelled"&gt;in April&lt;/a&gt; in reaction to a rumor that the phone had been canceled, but we probably won’t see more of it at Google I/O this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="atufvT"&gt;When Google announced the upcoming phone, the company said “it will be available later this year in the U.S. and Japan and announced in line with when last year’s a-series phone was introduced.” The Pixel 4A, 4A 5G, and Pixel 5 were all announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352032/google-pixel-5-4a-5g-price-release-date-specs"&gt;in early August last year&lt;/a&gt;, so it seems like we might be waiting until some time around then to see an official reveal of Google’s next midrange phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yNJ623"&gt;Google could share details about its custom processor for Pixels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0Guv6z"&gt;Google is rumored to be developing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364543/google-pixel-6-custom-in-house-processor-gs101-whitechapel-arm-report"&gt;custom-designed system on a chip&lt;/a&gt; (SoC) for upcoming Pixel phones, the company’s first, and perhaps Google will discuss some of what that sea change could mean for Android developers and prospective Pixel buyers at I/O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58VE1E"&gt;The so-called “GS101” chip may have a “3 cluster setup with a TPU (Tensor Processing Unit),” which could improve performance for machine learning applications and might also include an integrated Titan M security chip, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-6-custom-system-on-chip/#update1"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And we might first see the chip on board two new Pixel phones that debut this fall, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/02/pixel-6-google-gs101-whitechapel/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1z5d7"&gt;A Google-designed SoC could bring some major performance benefits to the company’s Pixel lineup, like what Apple sees with its custom A-series chips in iPhones. But there’s also a good chance that Google keeps this rumored chip under wraps until it unveils devices that actually have it on board, so don’t set your expectations too high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="70XLrz"&gt;And Google could always surprise us&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OPQkel"&gt;Although Google has a reputation for being unable to keep its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21450764/google-pixel-5-design-specs-leak-hardware-software-camera"&gt;biggest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21459849/google-chromecast-new-remote-home-depot-early-sale-pre-release-leak"&gt;products&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/18/20868935/google-pixel-4-xl-rumors-leaks-specs-details-colors-cameras-soli"&gt;secret&lt;/a&gt;, there’s always the possibility that the company has some totally new and surprising things in store for this year’s I/O. Keep it locked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; during the event to stay up to date on the latest. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Starlink review: broadband dreams fall to Earth</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K4qkijzwKoDcc2gPScwJCFISAQY=/0x45:2040x1405/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69286758/npatel_20210512_4552_0030.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starlink’s Dishy McDishface satellite dish.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;SpaceX’s satellite internet service is a technological marvel — when it works&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="aFwt5S"&gt;The problem with reality is that it is very irritating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6jcWQi"&gt;In our imaginations, we might dream of a satellite internet system that delivers lightning-fast broadband speeds from space, freeing us from the dreary earthbound experience of cable monopolies and wireless data caps. We might envision an ISP that smashes through the plodding local politics of digging fiber trenches by literally achieving escape velocity and delivering fast, reliable internet from the heavens above. A system that will work on moving trucks, RVs, and even boats. Space-based internet access that will change everything because there is nothing technology cannot achieve in our minds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CoOQZx"&gt;Starlink, a new satellite internet service from SpaceX, is a spectacular technical achievement that might one day do all of these things. But right now it is also very much a beta product that is unreliable, inconsistent, and foiled by even the merest suggestion of trees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aE0Yky"&gt;Reality, it must be emphasized, is very irritating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Starlink dish pointing at the sky" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JOLhpZwlHAXMgiCIF0l9zFON2F0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22512176/npatel_20210512_4552_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Starlink dish automatically orients itself to find satellites in orbit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="4JuGj8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has not written a story about broadband access or telecom policy in recent memory without a chorus of commenters responding that Starlink would fix it in some way. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22418074/broadband-gap-america-map-county-microsoft-data"&gt;Access gap&lt;/a&gt;? Starlink. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365753/wow-wideopenwest-internet-cable-data-cap-pizza-excuse"&gt;Data caps&lt;/a&gt;? Starlink. Wackadoo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336872/hbo-max-data-cap-att-net-neutrality-california-zero-rating-streaming"&gt;net neutrality bullshit&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;em&gt;Starlink will fix it&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbkPh1"&gt;I completely understand where this is coming from: most Americans live &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;under the shadow&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/1/8321437/maps-show-why-internet-is-more-expensive-us-europe-competition"&gt;regional cable monopolies&lt;/a&gt; that dominate the broadband market with high prices, sadistic data policies, and poor customer support. If you do have the choice of a second internet provider, it is often based on older technology and offers much slower speeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e3w2bU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499072"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UlpxmT"&gt;In rural America, the situation is even worse: a combination of bad policy and greed means &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22418074/broadband-gap-america-map-county-microsoft-data"&gt;there are huge swaths of the country&lt;/a&gt; where people aren’t even connecting at 25Mbps down, the pathetic standard for “broadband speed” used by the federal government. Where I live in rural New York state, the best available data suggests that only 43 percent of people connect at 25Mbps or above. That is ridiculous, especially since wireless carriers, in particular, have begged for lax regulatory oversight against the promise of delivering rural broadband over LTE and now 5G. They have mostly failed to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MRJLM"&gt;The idea of ordering a $499 dish with a $99 monthly fee that can deliver Starlink’s current goal of 100Mbps down and 20Mbps up would indeed be a dream come true — especially since Starlink has set a long-term goal of 1Gbps down. It represents &lt;em&gt;competition&lt;/em&gt;, something the American broadband market sorely lacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Q6dzp"&gt;In that context, Starlink also represents something else: the American telecom policy establishment’s long-standing, almost religious belief that consumers are best served by something called “facility-based competition.” Starlink is a new &lt;em&gt;facility&lt;/em&gt; for accessing the internet, one that does not rely on existing infrastructure. “&lt;em&gt;Facility-based competition&lt;/em&gt;,” telecom lobbyists feverishly whisper while handing out their dirty, sweat-stained checks in Congress. “&lt;em&gt;That is the American way.&lt;/em&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wAKWlo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;American broadband policy stinks, and we all pay too much money for slow speeds and terrible customer service&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0vEPf"&gt;Of course, the only thing a decades-long commitment to “facility-based competition” has brought to most Americans is… &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;a total lack of competition&lt;/a&gt;. Reality, as I have said, is quite irritating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVl3Et"&gt;(By contrast, in Europe, where the prevailing philosophy is called “service-based competition,” large incumbent providers are required to lease fiber access to competitors and there is a thriving market for internet access with much lower prices for much faster speeds. If the United States were in Europe, it &lt;a href="https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/internet-costs-compared-worldwide"&gt;would have the most expensive broadband in the region&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkeDnQ"&gt;Anyway, American broadband policy stinks, and we all pay too much money for slow speeds and terrible customer service. It is no wonder people are delirious with excitement about Starlink, which promises to provide access from a constellation of thousands of tiny satellites blanketing the Earth, using a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOmdQnIlnRo"&gt;cutting-edge phased array antenna in the dish&lt;/a&gt; to quickly track the satellites moving across the sky. When it is fully deployed, Starlink claims it will operate the world’s largest satellite constellation, managed by a new &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/jybmgn/we_are_the_starlink_team_ask_us_anything/gd3tkll/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;automated orbital guidance&lt;/a&gt; system and an automated collision avoidance system, which has already been involved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374262/oneweb-spacex-satellites-dodged-potential-collision-orbit-space-force"&gt;in a controversial close call&lt;/a&gt;. (Starlink has also run into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/3/20847243/spacex-starlink-satellite-european-space-agency-aeolus-conjunction-space-debris"&gt;communications problems&lt;/a&gt; with other satellite operators.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBrNZ6"&gt;Starlink is a lot of very bold engineering advancements packaged up in a $499 consumer product; the whole thing is &lt;a href="https://advanced-television.com/2020/09/17/phased-array-antennas-are-satellites-holy-grail/"&gt;far more advanced&lt;/a&gt; than previous satellite internet systems, which are slow, heavily data-capped, and very expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="uB7eIu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Starlink is a lot of very bold engineering advancements packaged up for $499&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="StuQkm"&gt;The Starlink coverage map divides the globe into a honeycomb-like hexagonal grid; the satellites launched so far mostly provide service in the northern part of North America. The whole thing is still in beta, so access is limited — even if you’re in a coverage area, there are only so many available slots in each part of the grid, so as not to stress the system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKBh3n"&gt;Luckily, my area has not yet filled its allotment yet, so I was able to simply sign up on the website, and my kit arrived about a week later. &lt;em&gt;Let’s smash the system&lt;/em&gt;, I thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZUwfO"&gt;Then I learned about trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Starlink dish in the back of a truck" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cwnxCHLPkdEBX-h3UUeUplumeXo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22512179/npatel_20210512_4552_0022.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dish is small and light enough that you can easily move it to different locations, but you’re not guaranteed service anywhere but the address where you signed up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ATGj3I"&gt;Inside the large gray Starlink box, you’ll find four items: the dish itself, which is connected to a 100-foot power-over-Ethernet (PoE) cable; a short black metal tripod stand for the dish; the main black Starlink power adapter; and a small silver Wi-Fi router with its own white PoE cable. The fundamental setup is incredibly simple: you plug both Ethernet cables into the power adapter, plug that into the wall, and you’re done. The printed instructions in the box are just pictograms, like Ikea for space internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="rwGOri"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10499096"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G1hsfh"&gt;All of the hardware is nicely designed — even though it’s in beta, it feels close to a consumer product already, with a sense of style that goes well beyond the hospital equipment vibes of most satellite gear. The dish itself (officially named “Dishy McDishface”) is made of white plastic, with a matte white texture on its face. Two buttons on the mounting pole click into the included tripod mount, and that’s that. There are motors that rotate and tilt the dish to align it automatically; no fiddling required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFSe19"&gt;(One design oversight: the cable is permanently attached to the dish, so if it gets damaged — it’s outside, after all — you’re likely looking at replacing the entire dish, not just the cable.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RB2suC"&gt;Although the Starlink kit ships with a short tripod and the sparse online instructions refer to it being “knee-high,” the dish really needs to be mounted as high up as you can get it. Starlink requires near-perfect line of sight to its satellites, which are often fairly low in the sky. Trees, buildings, and even poles will easily obstruct the signal, so if you’ve got tall trees blocking the horizon there’s really no choice but to get up and over them. Starlink beta testers have gone to &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/mxluoi/dishy_up_16_feet_above_my_chimney_and_giving/"&gt;hilarious and wonderful DIY lengths&lt;/a&gt; to solve this problem. (If there is one unreservedly excellent thing about Starlink, it is the community of beta testers, who are all the sort of clear-eyed we’ll-figure-it-out nerds that lend early tech products an air of infectious discovery and enthusiasm. I love you, Starlink people.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLPwfS"&gt;I am going to emphasize the line-of-sight requirement, since it is crucial to understanding what Starlink can and cannot do right now, and it’s an important reality check on what it might be able to do in the future. Like the similarly over-hyped mmWave 5G, Starlink is remarkably delicate. Even &lt;em&gt;a single tree&lt;/em&gt; blocking the dish’s line of sight to the horizon will degrade and interrupt your Starlink signal. Whatever satellite internet dreams you may have will run crashing into this reality until you can literally rise above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRa7Et"&gt;Starlink’s website makes all of this &lt;a href="https://www.starlink.com/faq"&gt;crystal clear&lt;/a&gt;. “If any object such as a tree, chimney, pole, etc. interrupts the path of the beam, even briefly, your internet service will be interrupted,” says Starlink. “The best guidance we can give is to install your Starlink at the highest elevation possible where it is safe to do so, with a clear view of the sky. Users who live in areas with lots of tall trees, buildings, etc. may not be good candidates for early use of Starlink.” (I encourage you to square the advice to mount the dish as high as possible with the Starlink team’s further recommendation to bring ol’ Dishy &lt;em&gt;inside&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/jybmgn/we_are_the_starlink_team_ask_us_anything/gd3y11d/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;in high wind conditions&lt;/a&gt;. Keep that ladder handy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Starlink app showing obstructions blocking the dish’s view of the satellites" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dKCQAKSpbAczQj98v1fjA3kKTTA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513070/Image_from_iOS__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Starlink app showing obstructions blocking the dish’s view of the satellites.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Starlink’s entire field of view is open sky except for the top of a house and the trees behind it, as seen from the app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Db8bDwwJh9UNIuTWYZPOxl6YLU0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22514331/IMG_1896.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;My Starlink’s entire field of view is open sky except for the top of my house and the trees behind it, as seen from the app.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F64e54"&gt;Why am I hammering this point home? Because Starlink’s solution to the line-of-sight issue is to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405779/fcc-approves-spacex-starlink-lower-orbits-against-amazon-rival-objections"&gt;put more satellites into space&lt;/a&gt;, and, well, that’s not necessarily great. While Starlink has an army of devoted heart-eyed fans, it has an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/29/18642577/spacex-starlink-satellite-constellation-astronomy-light-pollution"&gt;equal number of critics&lt;/a&gt; in the scientific community who note that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21043229/spacex-starlink-satellite-mega-constellation-concerns-astronomy-space-traffic"&gt;blanketing the sky&lt;/a&gt; with tiny satellites will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21190273/spacex-starlink-satellite-internet-constellation-astronomy-coating"&gt;interfere with astronomers&lt;/a&gt; the world over. Starlink satellites are already &lt;a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/awestruck-north-texans-mistake-parade-of-starlink-satellites-for-ufos/2626719/"&gt;bright enough to confuse people&lt;/a&gt;, and their potential to interfere with telescopes is well-documented. (No, you &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/spacexs-dark-satellites-are-still-too-bright-for-astronomers/"&gt;cannot just paint them black&lt;/a&gt; because the idea is to &lt;em&gt;look at space&lt;/em&gt;, not thousands of little black satellites.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPZMWp"&gt;It is a pretty damning indictment of broadband policy in the United States that a lot of people are so desperate for competitive options that they’re like “&lt;a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/10/starlink-already-threatens-optical-astronomy-now-radio-astronomers-are-worried"&gt;fuck telescopes&lt;/a&gt;.” But here we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UcoeP"&gt;Anyway, once you’ve got everything set up, the Starlink dish sweeps across the sky keeping track with the satellites, so finding a single open spot isn’t enough. You need a wide swath of open sky — Starlink suggests a cone of about 100 degrees, with a minimum elevation of 25 degrees above the horizon. So: low and wide. The app will tell you where and how the view to the satellite is obstructed, by how much, and how many hours a day it will affect your signal. I have my dish 60 feet away from my house with clear views of the sky, and it is still obstructed for two hours a day because of the very top of my house and the trees behind it. If this wasn’t a short-term review, I would certainly have it mounted on a pole on top of the structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqG23A"&gt;Once you’ve got your dish in a good spot and figured out how to get the cable into your house (another moment when having it permanently attached to the dish is less than ideal, since this will generally require drilling and snaking the cable through a wall), you plug it all in and wait. The dish will rotate around to find a signal and then download the satellite schedule so it can keep itself aligned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G90hpJ"&gt;While that’s happening, the Wi-Fi router will boot itself up (it’s a wee bit slow) and eventually offer you a generic Starlink network. Connect to that, open the Starlink app, and you’ll be given the chance to rename that network and set a Wi-Fi password. And that’s it. It is remarkably simple and easy for a deeply advanced satellite internet system; there is nothing else to configure or otherwise worry about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="exp8mU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Starlink is remarkably easy to set up for such a deeply advanced satellite internet system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AY3DPc"&gt;The included dual-band Wi-Fi 5 router is extremely bare-bones: it has one additional Ethernet port that can support a switch and exactly no listed specifications or software options at all. If you don’t want to use Starlink’s Wi-Fi router, you don’t have to — if your preferred Wi-Fi router supports static routes, you can plug it into the Starlink power box and apparently &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/jqhoqz/starlink_app_works_fine_behind_own_router/gby79x1/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;use that instead&lt;/a&gt;. (I did not test this because my partner is a literal divorce lawyer, and I was not eager to tell her the Wi-Fi network she relies upon for work would be intermittently brought to a halt by the presence of trees.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="LKIFTN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10499094"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="V581M2"&gt;Once you’re all set up and plugged in, there’s not much to say. Starlink offers a moderately fast, very inconsistent broadband connection. I definitely saw speeds that exceeded the promised 100Mbps down, topping out at 222Mbps down and 24Mbps up. But my &lt;em&gt;usual&lt;/em&gt; speeds hovered between 30 and 90 down, &lt;a href="https://www.speedtest.net/insights/blog/starlink-q1-2021/"&gt;matching what others have&lt;/a&gt; reported, and the connection slowed down and dropped out with surprising frequency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGpbXH"&gt;If Starlink could offer consistently fast speeds, it would be competitive with the fastest package I can get from my rural cable provider, which tops out at $200 / mo for 325 / 25 but is still not attractively priced compared to the services available in more populated areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VD20cY"&gt;In my week of testing, Starlink was perfectly fine for anything that buffers — I was able to stream Netflix and Disney Plus in 4K and jump around YouTube videos without significant issues — but doing something faster-paced, like quickly scrolling through TikTok videos, would run into delays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehOOg0"&gt;Services that require a sustained, real-time connection, like Slack, Zoom, or gaming, simply weren’t usable for me, even when I was seeing the fastest speeds. I had high hopes that I could spend several days working over Starlink, and after just a few lost Slack messages and Zoom calls where my video dropped to low resolution and then froze entirely, I gave up. Many Starlink beta testers similar report experiences — consistent dropouts of a few seconds, every few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p7Tl3W"&gt;Starlink’s latency also swings from fine — Zoom did not exhibit any delay when it worked — to pretty bad. My feeling is that the connection dropouts are going to be worse for gaming than latency, so I didn’t spend any time testing gaming latency, but Starlink itself measures ping times for &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Go&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; in its app, and I rarely saw those numbers dip below 50ms, mostly hovering around 85-115ms. Those aren’t numbers you’d want to game with, unless you like losing. (Some Starlink testers have been able to play games and even use Stadia, but that seems both inconsistent and heavily dependent on satellite coverage in your area.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FJfgka"&gt;There are no data caps right now, but Starlink is clearly &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/jybmgn/we_are_the_starlink_team_ask_us_anything/gd3x2l8/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;thinking about it&lt;/a&gt;, using the same “preventing abuse” language as any other broadband provider. If you are dreaming of signing up for Starlink as a way to tell your local cable monopoly to kick rocks, well, consider what might happen when Starlink is your space-based internet access monopoly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hO0W8g"&gt;Look, I know you’re hyped up about Starlink. I feel you. I also wish I could tweet a photo of Dishy in my yard to every telecom CEO in the game and tell them to try harder. But &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has long had a hard rule against reviewing products based on &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; because the sad truth is that most tech products never, ever live up to their potential. And Starlink, judged on its capabilities &lt;em&gt;right now&lt;/em&gt;, is simply not a real competitor to the long, long coax wire running from my house to the local cable company fiber plant. It’s not even a great competitor to my data-capped-and-throttled “unlimited” AT&amp;amp;T 5G service because I can reasonably work from home on that connection and I really can’t with Starlink. And in the end, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Starlink/comments/jybmgn/we_are_the_starlink_team_ask_us_anything/gd40ijs/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;Starlink’s traffic has to run over fiber in the ground&lt;/a&gt; anyway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ooMTlL"&gt;It feels like we should all be more honest about what this thing can do, what we hope it can do in the future, and why our existing networks aren’t doing that already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rUWOj1DaeL5aC4jXF15mmihD6zs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22512181/npatel_20210512_4552_0048.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dish needs a completely unobstructed view of the sky to work properly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="hbJdOz"&gt;Let’s end this three ways. First, the team at Starlink should be legitimately proud of having shipped this ridiculously complex system, where they’ve gotten it to thus far, and where it might go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exsc6l"&gt;Starlink is a truly remarkable feat of engineering, and the sheer force of will required to make it work as a simple consumer product shines through. It is, however, in everyone’s best interest to consider the trade-offs of having done all this work and putting all these satellites in orbit &lt;em&gt;simply to get internet access&lt;/em&gt;. Astronomers and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/12/science/space-junk-climate-change.html"&gt;scientists are &lt;em&gt;very mad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about this. Starlink should talk to them more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSnU4U"&gt;Second, all the people dreaming of Starlink upsetting cable monopolies and reinventing broadband need to seriously reset their expectations. At &lt;em&gt;best&lt;/em&gt;, Starlink currently offers reasonably fast access with inconsistent connectivity, huge latency swings, and a significant uptick in time spent considering whether you can just get out the chainsaw and solve the tree problem yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="5sYmU1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That Starlink even exists is a direct indictment of American broadband policy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LNnpa7"&gt;Maybe this will change as the company launches more satellites. Maybe it will eventually work better in areas that are dominated by tall trees. Maybe one day it will not drop out in wind and heavy rain. I didn’t give Starlink a formal review score because the whole thing is openly in beta and the company isn’t making many promises about reliability. But even when it’s final, you’re still looking at a service whose near-term, best-case scenario is being competitive with a solid LTE connection. I am no fan of cable companies and wireless carriers, but it’s simply true that my cable broadband and 5G service are both faster and more reliable than Starlink, and they will almost certainly remain that way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="b6y4Cu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10493160"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R3iWDJ"&gt;And lastly, if you are a telecom executive or regulator in the United States, you have no choice but to see Starlink, its execution, and the unrestrained excitement and hype around it as a direct indictment of your rhetoric and efforts to properly connect this country to the internet over the past two decades. Dishy McDishface is a sign that reads YOU FUCKED UP AND EVERYONE HATES YOU. Read the sign. This is your fault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G7hAIK"&gt;As a whole, the American telecom policy industrial complex has utterly failed to put fiber in the ground and signals in the air at fair prices and with good customer support. So much so that a total science project of an internet access system — which involves huge tradeoffs for scientific research and &lt;em&gt;doesn’t work if there are trees in the way —&lt;/em&gt; has captured the attention and imagination of millions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rm2NfW"&gt;Broadband on the ground is so wrapped up in the lumbering bullshit of monopolistic regulatory capture that it seems easier and more effective to literally launch rockets and try building a network in the sky. Starlink isn’t the happy end result of a commitment to “facility-based competition.” It is thousands of middle fingers pointing at us from the air. It is what happens when there is an &lt;em&gt;utter lack of competition&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="F4p64T"&gt;Reality, as they say, bites.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s second-gen Pencil is $20 off at Woot</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nS6yAp"&gt;The second-generation Apple Pencil, released in 2018, that can magnetically attach to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18062612/apple-ipad-pro-review-2018-screen-usb-c-pencil-price-features"&gt;iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; tablets that feature USB-C ports &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13142085?sid=VergeDeals&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-pencil-2nd-generation-3%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_1_1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $20 off at Woot&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a relatively small discount on its usual $129 price, but it seems like the best deal on the stylus happening right now. Compared to the infamous first iteration that can only recharge by plugging into a Lightning port, endangering itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9872746/apple-bad-hardware-design-iphone-case-pencil-magic-mouse"&gt;while also looking very silly&lt;/a&gt;, this one charges wirelessly through the side of the iPad Pro or Air. It also supports gesture controls on the side of the Apple Pencil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uf6y92"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500002"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t9Nxyd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; was the biggest game released last week, and you can already get a &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=Verge+Deals%2C+4%2F10%2F21&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fsteam-resident-evil-village-resident-evil-8-steam-key-global%2Fgames-federation" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hearty $15 discount&lt;/a&gt; on the Steam PC version through digital storefront Eneba. If you want to dive into the first-person horror title and, you know, see the tall lady, head to Eneba, click “Buy Now” on the page, then use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;VILLAGEMAYWKND &lt;/strong&gt;to get the game for around $45.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Kg85QM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10492101"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="djNitp"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t5GxIw"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Pro wireless earbuds are at a great price right now at Woot. Normally $200, you can get the black, violet, or silver-colored earbuds &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-13142092?sid=Verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds-pro-wireless-earbuds-4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $30 off&lt;/a&gt; that price. These come with a one-year warranty through Samsung. In &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s review, Chris Welch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;said the Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt; “strike a great mix in terms of sound quality, active noise cancellation, and comfort” compared to the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E5aNSY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ys4OG5"&gt;The Lectrofan white noise machine is one of my favorite pieces of technology that I bring on every trip away. The black model is $33.38 at Amazon, down from its usual $50 price (via &lt;a href="https://9to5toys.com/2021/05/13/lectrofan-white-noise-machine-deal/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Toys&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). If you’re someone who has relied on white noise apps on the phone, I highly suggest trying this instead. The Lectrofan doesn’t have any moving parts, unlike some other white noise machines. Instead, it has 20 built-in fan and white noise variations that don’t have an obvious loop cycle, so you probably won’t be able to hear where the cycle ends and begins again, which is a nitpick I have with many free white noise apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GlOvXQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10199974"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Where to preorder the new black and red DualSense controllers for the PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X9GmpiMABYz85aZ-TfDNfrEYa2A=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69286642/51176194136_6b76edb34d_h.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The new DualSense controller comes in two iterations: Midnight Black and Cosmic Red (pictured). | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OmuplY"&gt;With the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt;, Sony opted for a less traditional color scheme, one that ditched the classic jet-black exterior found on earlier PlayStation consoles in favor of a black-and-white finish. For some, the new exterior was an acquired taste, as was the matching aesthetic found on the accompanying DualSense controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cCG7Rz"&gt;On Thursday, however, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22433966/sony-black-red-dualsense-controllers-playstation-5-ps5"&gt;announced two new color schemes&lt;/a&gt; for the DualSense — at least for those lucky enough to have landed a PS5 console amid the ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428322/sony-ps5-supply-constraints-2022-hiroki-totoki"&gt;supply shortages&lt;/a&gt;. Dubbed “midnight black” and “cosmic red,” both controllers offer the same features as the standard DualSense, including a built-in microphone, haptic feedback, and adaptive triggers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21562206/ps5-dualsense-controller-review-games-features-vibrations"&gt;designed to make games more immersive&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IhMwO"&gt; Right now, both are currently available for preorder ahead of their launch on June 18th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="24HsU8"&gt;Where to buy the midnight black DualSense controller&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7xnWaI"&gt;Like the standard DualSense controller, the midnight black DualSense will retail for $69.99 at launch. It’s currently available for preorder at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094WL86N5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740477354355271725" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/accessory/dualsense-wireless-controller-midnight-black.3006392" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Direct&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which will ship the controller a week ahead of other retailers on June 11th. It’s not an exact match for previous DualShock controllers — the two-tone design features multiple shades of black and subtle gray detailing — but it’s far closer than the current DualSense, which opts for a white-and-black build. If you’ve wrapped your PS5 in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306874/dbrand-ps5-darkplates-matte-black-hands-on-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dbrand’s Darkplates&lt;/a&gt;, well now you can have a matching controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rLQI4s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Q5loI9"&gt;Where to buy the cosmic red DualSense controller&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qK2uFS"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/05/13/two-new-dualsense-wireless-controller-colors-hit-shelves-starting-next-month/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;According to Sony&lt;/a&gt;, the color palette found on the cosmic red DualSense controller is modeled after the various shades of red scattered throughout the cosmos. That added interstellar inspiration will cost you, however, as the cosmic red edition runs a bit pricier at $74.99. It features a two-tone design like the midnight black DualSense, and it’s currently available for preorder at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094WN6SY2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740477635406853038" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/accessories/accessory/dualsense-wireless-controller-cosmic-red.3006393" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Direct&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ekZqMS"&gt;Like the midnight black model, the red-and-black edition is also slated to ship via PlayStation Direct on June 11th, a week ahead of other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fn4XMZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499071"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="kAOCHR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Sony has 25 PS5 games in the works, including characters you’ve never seen","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432601/sony-playstation-studios-ps5-games-25-new-ip-interview"},{"title":"Here’s every game coming to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21538464/ps5-xbox-series-x-launch-games-list-new-release-holiday-2020-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
