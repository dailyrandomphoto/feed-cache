    <title>Fairphone 4 review: the price of sustainability </title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A modular smartphone that (mostly) feels like a modern device&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="7LpNJK"&gt;It’s been hard to fault Fairphone’s sustainable credentials over the years, whether it’s the company’s lengthy support periods, easy repairability, or ethically sourced materials. But when it comes to the devices themselves, previous Fairphones have struggled to be competitive with similarly priced smartphones. They lacked modern features, used outdated designs, and generally had more quirks than you’d expect to get from a modern phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FW4E1n"&gt;The Fairphone 4 is a big step forward. It’s every bit as sustainable, with a modular repairable design that Fairphone now offers a five-year warranty for. But more important is that it &lt;em&gt;feels&lt;/em&gt; much more like a modern smartphone. The huge top and bottom bezels of the Fairphone 3 have been stripped away, and there are also modern conveniences like an IP54 rating for dust and water resistance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xAHhFB"&gt;With a starting price of €579 / £499 (around $669, though Fairphone has no plans to sell the Fairphone 4 in the states) for the 6GB RAM / 128GB storage model, the Fairphone 4 costs a premium compared to its competitors. It’s also getting a much more limited Europe-only release, with no plans for a US launch. But if you only need a smartphone to do basic smartphone stuff, and you’re prepared to pay a premium over other similarly capable competitors, I think the Fairphone 4 is up to the task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdxhIV"&gt;The Fairphone 4 is available to pre-order now, and devices will start shipping on October 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="232Djm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10796788"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9iX5Fu"&gt;Compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/27/20834741/fairphone-3-release-date-news-specs-features"&gt;Fairphone 3&lt;/a&gt; that preceded it, it’s hard to believe the Fairphone 4 has been produced by the same manufacturer. The chunky and dated top and bottom bezels from the previous phone are gone, replaced with a sheet of Gorilla Glass 5 that stretches right from the top of the Fairphone 4 to the bottom. It feels like Fairphone has caught up with the rest of the smartphone industry, even if that’s because the rate of smartphone evolution has slowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0Uo8jf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s a choice of 6 or 8GB of RAM&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UsbqHK"&gt;Yes, the bezels are still sizable by modern standards, but they’re small enough that the phone is able to have a large 6.3-inch display without feeling too ungainly. It’s LCD rather than OLED, and viewing angles aren’t amazing, but I was happy with how it looked after I turned off its overkill image enhancement options in its Settings app and tweaked the color temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78jwf6"&gt;There are two versions of the Fairphone 4 available: one with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage (the model I’ve been using for this review) and a step-up version with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, which retails for €649 / £569. Both are otherwise identical and feature the same cameras, 3,905 mAh battery, and Qualcomm Snapdragon 750G processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w9r_np83cVAcREEdcoDAHzcrKGY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908020/jporter_071021__4794_0254.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The back is easily removable to access the phone’s internals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-GkClOpsb8buLEeQecJ_pB3cufI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908019/jporter_071021__4794_0257.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Small philips head screws keep the phone’s components in place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TSDWKt"&gt;More important than the specs are what the internals of the Fairphone 4 are actually made of. In here, there’s Fairtrade-certified gold, ethically sourced aluminum and tungsten, and recycled tin, rare earth minerals and plastics. Fairphone also aims to turn these materials into a phone as ethically as possible, thanks to initiatives that aim to improve working conditions for the miners and factory workers involved in the phone’s supply chain. Each phone is also “e-waste neutral,” Fairphone claims, since the company will recycle either a phone or an equivalent amount of e-waste with each sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wRJxMJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The phone’s SIM card is inserted under its removable battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9QCyXk"&gt;Flip over the Fairphone 4, and you’ll see its back (made out of 100 percent recycled plastic), which can be easily removed without any tools to reveal the phone’s removable battery and the Phillips head screws that can be used to easily remove everything from its rear cameras to its USB-C port and loudspeaker. You’ll need to take this rear panel off to insert a SIM card underneath the battery during setup, a process which handily doesn’t require the use of a SIM tool — convenient given there isn’t one included in the box (though Fairphone tells me this may differ between release markets).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0B1mm"&gt;iFixit is yet to pass its official judgment on the repairability of the Fairphone 4, but the company’s previous phones are the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FFairphone%2B3%2BTeardown%2F125573&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22716194%2Ffairphone-4-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;only&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FTeardown%2FFairphone%2B2%2BTeardown%2F52523&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22716194%2Ffairphone-4-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; devices to have gotten perfect 10s from the repair specialists. As well as being easy to remove, the parts should also be easy to replace since Fairphone plans to have replacements available until at least 2027 (as a benchmark, the company still has some spare parts left for the almost six-year-old Fairphone 2). A five-year warranty should also keep the repair costs down over the life of the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8pOcEpqMpHU_kovXO_HlG3lv5e4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908018/jporter_071021__4794_0235.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fair enough.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qbyeuzjHv9vjpwKGVEm972FVp_I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908022/jporter_071021__4794_0204.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The rear of the phone, with its triangular camera bump.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4LNK8p"&gt;On the software side, the Fairphone 4 ships with Android 11, but the company hopes to provide at least two major Android updates, or four if it can manage it. It’s done a good job at delivering on these promises with previous phones… eventually. Earlier this year, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349953/fairphone-2-android-9-update-sustainable-long-term-support"&gt;finally released Android 9 for the Fairphone 2&lt;/a&gt;. Impressive given the Fairphone 2 was five years old at the time, less impressive given it came almost three years after Android 9’s original release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4_Vg3R8uiFKzdQE2YS5JZCjAj50=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908021/jporter_071021__4794_0224.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone’s side-mounted fingerprint sensor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nHDj42"&gt;As you might expect from a phone that can ship without a SIM tool, the Fairphone 4 doesn’t come with anything in the way of accessories in the box as standard. There’s no charging brick, no included headphones, and no USB-C charging cable in the box. There’s also no miniature included screwdriver like we saw with the Fairphone 3. It may have been a cute indicator of its repairability credentials, but including it didn’t make much sense if you’re trying to minimize unnecessary accessories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugpMFN"&gt;On the right of the phone, there’s a side-mounted fingerprint sensor that doubles as a power button, which I prefer to rear-mounted sensors even if they’re not as convenient as under-display models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WdRgb"&gt;There’s no headphone jack next to the Fairphone 4’s USB-C port, which isn’t exactly surprising given it’s a smartphone released in 2021, but is a little more disappointing given Fairphone’s focus on being as consumer-friendly as possible. The team tells me the tradeoff was made to allow for the phone to have an IP54 rating for dust and water resistance. That means the phone should survive being used in the rain, but not full submersion, and it’s not an insubstantial achievement given the back of this modular phone can literally be unclipped without any tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EPt_lSvFDXxAg75ux_n1KXIq-DQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910248/IMG_20211002_125707.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trust me, this phone can survive a bit of rain.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9w7Cvv"&gt;As it turns out, I ended up using the Fairphone 4 to take photos during an exceptionally rainy walk while vacationing in the Welsh countryside, so I feel pretty confident saying that the company’s claims about the phone being rainproof are accurate. Here’s a selfie of me on the walk if you want to get an idea of just how rainy I’m talking about (it should also give you an indicator of how the phone’s 25-megapixel selfie camera performs).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYVSZG"&gt;It’s great to see Fairphone using a more capable 7-series Snapdragon processor compared to the 6-series one used in the Fairphone 3. For the most part, the Snapdragon 750G keeps up with the demands I placed on the phone in everyday usage, but it wasn’t perfect. Waking up Google Assistant with a swipe up from the corner of the screen to ask a query took a beat longer than I’m normally used to, and there were sometimes hitches in the YouTube app when switching videos between normal and full-screen viewing. It’s capable rather than slick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ybh4yM"&gt;But while overall performance is OK, the phone isn’t without its quirks. The most frustrating issue I found is that the Fairphone 4 isn’t great at palm rejection, so when you’re holding it one-handed and reach your thumb across, it’ll confuse your palm for an intentional tap. The Fairphone 4 also seemed to spend more time connected to 3G networks than other smartphones I’ve used, even in areas where I normally get a 4G signal. Other times, however, it happily connected to 5G networks. A strange quirk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y2LBahIIZUVpap1RqKYBPHzQbY8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908014/jporter_071021__4794_0229.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That camera bump again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J0svpruwvdaJqFZTRZsrPIPU0_w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908012/jporter_071021__4794_0226.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A USB-C port but no headphone jack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gGDD3W"&gt;I had no problems with battery life during my time with the Fairphone 4 and generally averaged around four and five hours of screen on time per charge. For me, this typically translated to putting the phone on to charge with between 10 and 50 percent of charge left in the tank at the end of the day. On one day of traveling, I used the Fairphone 4 for several hours of podcast and music listening via wireless headphones, a few hours of social media scrolling, and then for two hours of navigation while wirelessly connected via Android Auto, and I still had 10 percent of battery left when I put it on charge at 11PM that night. The phone supports 20W fast charging, which Fairphone says should refill half its battery in half an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YUzqsf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Battery life is good&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xo0YDR"&gt;Performance is acceptable, battery life is good, and the phone’s screen is perfectly fine. But the only area of the Fairphone 4 that I think could be a real dealbreaker for some people is its camera, which, despite being based around a pair of 48-megapixel sensors (one for the main camera and one for the ultrawide), produces mediocre shots, even in broad daylight. It’s nice to have the versatility of dual cameras, which are a first for a Fairphone, but it’s a shame that the images they capture are disappointing in anything other than broad daylight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvmljv"&gt;I think the images in the gallery below speak for themselves. They often look uncomfortably grainy, and there’s a smudginess to most shots that had me searching through the camera app’s settings to make sure I didn’t have a weird setting turned on. But perhaps worse than the quality of the photos themselves is just how slow and laggy the camera app is. Even in daylight, tapping the shutter can cause a painstaking couple of moments before the camera is able to focus and take a photo, and it’s even worse at night. The Fairphone 4 is the only time I’ve regretted using a review phone for vacation snaps because I regret not coming home with nicer photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JTsaEi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10796861"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="NlmfCY"&gt;If you’re spending money on a Fairphone 4, your money isn’t being spent on performance. It’s being spent on that five-year warranty, the promise of years of software support, and the security of knowing that, when 2026 rolls around, you’ll still be able to buy a new battery and pop it into the back of the phone without having to learn what a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FGuide%2FiPhone%2BSE%2B2020%2BBattery%2BReplacement%2F133814&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22716194%2Ffairphone-4-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pentalobe screw&lt;/a&gt; is. And, of course, you’re paying to ensure that all these parts have been made from as responsibly sourced materials as possible in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0TLVrB"&gt;Whether it’s Fairtrade or organic food or sustainably produced clothing, there’s the expectation that you’ll have to pay a price premium for ethically-produced goods, and that’s exactly the case with the Fairphone 4. Although it starts at €579, its performance, especially when it comes to its cameras, is arguably closer to phones that cost less than half as much, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;Moto G Power&lt;/a&gt; (which retails for the equivalent of roughly €170) or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22408041/motorola-moto-g-play-2021-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;Moto G Play&lt;/a&gt; (around €140). And it’s not at all competitive with smartphones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt; (€539 for 128GB) or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22586815/oneplus-nord-2-5g-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus Nord 2&lt;/a&gt; (€399), which are closer in price but still cheaper than the Fairphone 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Uw1WgG"&gt;But if you’re the kind of person that can live with the budget phones listed above, if you just need a smartphone for daily use and aren’t concerned about having the best camera or most premium-feeling device, then I think you’re the kind of person who can live with the Fairphone 4. It’s a decent €200 phone that happens to be priced at €579. That’s the price of sustainability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="dLfyCn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10796800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Instagram to introduce “take a break” feature and “nudge” teens away from harmful content</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q9zamHgA9yifo6KNVEpzgV6eW6A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69977627/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Instagram to introduce new features to nudge teams away from harmful content | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qiXWV4"&gt;Instagram will introduce new measures to nudge teenagers away from harmful content and encourage them to “take a break,” from the platform, Facebook vice president of global affairs Nick Clegg said on Sunday. Clegg made the remarks on &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/politics/2021/10/10/dana-bash-presses-nick-clegg-is-that-acceptable.cnn"&gt;CNN’s State of the Union&lt;/a&gt; show less than a week after whistleblower Frances Haugen testified before Congress about internal research that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;showed Instagram can have a negative effect on the mental health of young people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50IxCc"&gt;“We’re going to introduce something which I think will make a considerable difference, which is where our systems see that a teenagers is looking at the same content over and over again, and it’s content which may not be conducive to their well being, we will nudge them to look at other content,” Clegg said. He added that in addition to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696039/facebook-instagram-kids-app-pause-development-criticism"&gt;pausing plans for an Instagram Kids&lt;/a&gt; platform and giving parents optional controls to supervise teens, the company planned to introduce a feature “called ‘take a break,’ where we will be prompting teens to just simply take a break from using Instagram.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rmTmf0"&gt;Clegg didn’t provide a timeline for either feature. In response to an email from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;seeking further details, a Facebook spokesperson said the features are “not testing yet but will soon.” The spokesperson pointed to a &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/pausing-instagram-kids"&gt;September 27th blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Instagram head Adam Mosseri which mentioned the company was “exploring” the features: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="se8uqp"&gt;We announced &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/using-research-to-improve-your-experience"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt; that we’re exploring two new ideas: encouraging people to look at other topics if they’re dwelling on content that might contribute to negative social comparison, and a feature tentatively called “Take a Break,” where people could put their account on pause and take a moment to consider whether the time they’re spending is meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OUBM15"&gt;CNN host Dana Bash asked Clegg whether Facebook’s algorithm amplified or spread pro-insurrection voices ahead of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;riot at the US Capitol building on January 6th&lt;/a&gt;. Clegg said he couldn’t give a yes or no answer to the question. Haugen is &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/10/06/tech/facebook-whistleblower-january-6-select-committee/index.html"&gt;reportedly going meet with the committee&lt;/a&gt; investigating the January 6th attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MV1SLW"&gt;Clegg did say that Facebook’s algorithms “should be held to account, if necessary, by regulation so that people can match what our systems say they’re supposed to do from what actually happens.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvEts1"&gt;Facebook has been under intense criticism for the past several weeks, following reporting from the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;based on internal documents that Haugen provided. A former product manager at Facebook, Haugen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;testified before Congress&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday at a hearing focused on the company’s internal research that showed &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;Instagram can be toxic, particularly for teen girls&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook CEO Mark &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113961365418581"&gt;Zuckerberg disputed&lt;/a&gt; Haugen’s account, saying it was illogical for a company that relies on advertisers to push content that makes people angry to turn a profit.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blue Origin postpones William Shatner’s space flight by a day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2018 Creative Arts Emmy Awards - Day 1 - Arrivals" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nZBM1JKdnNPxRlLXrBDM7ZGOZgQ=/4x0:4197x2795/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69977202/1029659286.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;William Shatner is heading to space on October 13th | Photo by Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fEIWgA"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ spaceflight company Blue Origin said Sunday it will postpone the flight that is slated to fly William Shatner to space due to forecasted high winds at its launch site. The flight of the company’s New Shepard spacecraft is now scheduled for 9:30AM ET on October 13th, a day later than originally planned. It’s targeted to lift off from Blue Origin’s Launch Site One in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRwFsp"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/new-shepard-ns-18-mission-updates"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; on Blue Origin’s website said New Shepard NS-18 has met all mission requirements, and the astronauts have started their training. “Weather is the only gating factor for the launch window,” according to the statement, which is signed with the company motto “Gradatim Ferociter” (Latin for “step by step, ferociously”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teKdip"&gt;The company officially announced last week that Shatner, best known as Captain James T. Kirk from &lt;em&gt;Star Trek, &lt;/em&gt;will join the crew of New Shepard for its second crewed flight. Shatner, 90, will be the oldest person to fly to space. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22582735/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-launch-landing"&gt;New Shepard’s first crewed flight&lt;/a&gt; in July brought Bezos, his brother Mark, aviator Wally Funk, and teenager Oliver Daeman to space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMs9L8"&gt;Shatner will be joined by Chris Boshuizen, a former NASA engineer and co-founder of satellite company Planet Labs, Glen de Vries, the co-founder of software company Medidata and vice chair of life sciences at a French software company, and Audrey Powers, Blue Origin’s vice president of mission and flight operations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Star Trek: Discovery, Doctor Who: Flux, Blade Runner: Black Lotus, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FxRR1uvAuJLwxtMqUF5xdc-AQwI=/103x0:1149x697/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69977124/star_trek_discovery.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sonequa Martin-Green stars as Captain Michael Burnham in Star Trek: Discovery | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JIPT9WC6Vsk" target="_blank"&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C6WMUo"&gt;Before it premiered, Jason Sudeikis &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2021/07/22/jason-sudeikis-ted-lasso-season-2-star-wars-fans/7979429002/"&gt;described&lt;/a&gt; season two of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; as the show’s &lt;em&gt;Empire Strikes Back&lt;/em&gt; season, and sure enough, the entire season focused on fathers and sons, and after the season finale we have a pretty clear “enemy” all set up for season three. I know season two was not as universally liked as its freshman season, but &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; dug into some thorny issues about men and sports and mental health that few other shows attempt, and still managed to make me smile pretty much every week. I’ll miss this show until its return next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xyMPUM"&gt;I’ve also managed to binge-watch &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt; on Netflix— an interesting if not quite fully-baked examination of organized religion— and am still hanging in there with &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt; which has gotten quite spicy thanks mainly to Julianna Margulies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttURCn"&gt;The theme of this week’s trailers: titles with colons in them. A couple of these dropped Saturday during New York Comic Con; look for a recap of this year’s event Monday on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UyMB2p"&gt;Here’s this week’s roundup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iGOGHq"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JIPT9WC6Vsk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ct93N6"&gt;Star Trek: Discovery &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DJBho9"&gt;The fourth season of&lt;em&gt; Discovery&lt;/em&gt; finds Michael Burnham in the captain’s chair of the ship (yesss), and she and the crew are facing “a threat unlike any they’ve ever encountered,” according to the promo copy. This time it’s a massive anomaly threatening the entire galaxy, Federation planet or not. Sonequa Martin-Green, Anthony Rapp, Mary Wiseman, Wilson Cruz, David Ajala, and Doug Jones return in season four, and the trailer gives us a few glimpses of guest stars David Cronenberg, Oded Fehr, and Tig Notaro. &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt; boldly goes (sorry) to Paramount Plus on November 18th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvjFeH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MOcaQC"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrGBqKqb3gg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="r2tt9R"&gt;Doctor Who: Flux&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4ytUuh"&gt;Just getting it out of the way early: No, we don’t get a hint of who the next Doctor will be. This is &lt;em&gt;barely&lt;/em&gt; even a teaser at 19 seconds long, but we do get a fair bit of information about season 13. Doctor Who (Jodie Whittaker) tells us “we don’t have much time” and cautions that “the flux is coming” and bringing with it various enemies from across the universe, for “the fight of our lives.” This is Whittaker’s final season as the titular Doctor and we don’t have to wait too long for new episodes;&lt;em&gt; Doctor Who: Flux&lt;/em&gt; comes to BBC America on October 31st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="arbmRQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eUu3lK_Z8VM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KvOtoX"&gt;Blade Runner: Black Lotus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="f8UbCr"&gt;The new anime series based in the Blade Runner universe is set in Los Angeles in 2032, so about halfway between &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner &lt;/em&gt;(set in 2019) and &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner 2049&lt;/em&gt;. We got a teaser a few months ago, but in the full trailer we get a look at Elle, a replicant wondering why her dreams are getting worse (“what did you do to us?” she asks), and by the end she’s decided “I’m going to kill them all,” but we don’t know who the “them” are. The animation in the trailer is really stunning, particularly the scenes of seedy future LA. &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner: Black Lotus &lt;/em&gt;is coming to Crunchyroll and Adult Swim on November 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PJxkoR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBYsSos0xhY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BHCKvr"&gt;Dune&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="jUHMy0"&gt;After multiple pandemic-related &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22551728/dune-movie-release-date-delayed-again-warner-bros"&gt;delays&lt;/a&gt; and a few teasers and trailers, we get one last &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;trailer before its debut. In addition to a reminder that “fear is the mind-killer,” we get a look at some of the movie’s massive battle sequences (look, ornithopters!) We’re all ready. Let’s go. &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; comes to theaters and HBO Max on October 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xh96lM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WJomaOzgKpc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6zdiMi"&gt;Hanna&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KJy7bA"&gt;An action series about a woman turned into a super soldier by a shady government program is so relevant to my interests it’s almost comical and yet I haven’t watched &lt;em&gt;Hanna&lt;/em&gt;. Its third season comes to Amazon Prime Video on November 24th, so I’ve got time to watch seasons one and two before then. Esme Creed-Miles stars along with Dermot Mulroney, Mireille Enos, and Aine Rose Daly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to change your default browser in Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j8IAO-yddsFROKJiSFhQjwQcl7Q=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69969424/Screenshot__84_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cb5cUv"&gt;If you’ve updated your PC from Windows 10 to Windows 11, you may have noticed that when you click on a link for a website, a PDF document, or a variety of other file types, you will now be sent to Microsoft’s Edge browser. In its new version of Windows, Microsoft seems to have become especially aggressive in pushing its own apps over the apps that had been installed as defaults before the upgrade. In other words, Edge suddenly became your default browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6FBt5H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Microsoft is making it harder to switch default browsers in Windows 11","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22630319/microsoft-windows-11-default-browser-changes"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8h8sJa"&gt;Normally, the first time you go into another browser that is not Edge — say, Google Chrome — the not-Edge browser will ask if you’d like to make it the default instead. However, the process for changing your defaults in Windows 11 has become more complicated than it was in Windows 10. So you may not get that handy request — or if you do, it may land you on a complicated-looking page headed “App &amp;gt; Default apps.” Either way, here’s how to switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IXoc02"&gt;Switch default browsers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPB00S"&gt;If you don’t want Edge to be your default browser, and your favorite browser isn’t offering to make the change for you — or if it did offer but instead sent you to the “Default apps” page — here’s how to switch the default. For this example, I’m using Google Chrome, but this should work with any browser that you have installed on your system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="GQSVmd"&gt;Select Settings &amp;gt; Apps &amp;gt; Default apps&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PKk51R"&gt;Under “Set defaults for applications,” either scroll down to where your preferred browser is listed or type the name in the “Search apps” field. Click on the app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Switching browsers means associating each file type with your new browser." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bDDskYt1jzHp3HLJw6aXzow1X2k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908532/Screenshot__5_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Switching browsers means associating each file type with your new browser.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="BRZ48p"&gt;You’ll see a list of browser-related files, and under each file name, the app with which it is currently associated. In Windows 11, you can’t simply change your default browser with a single click — you have to change the assigned browser for every specific file type. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MCDLub"&gt;Look for the file types assigned to Edge, such as .HTM, .HTML, HTTP, HTTPS, and perhaps .PDF (unless you have a PDF reader you prefer). Click on the ones you want to change. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When you first click on a file type, Windows may try to discourage any changes." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JeVLc0rLMFwg4s4a8cFnjJJPU0w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908534/Screenshot__6_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you first click on a file type, Windows may try to discourage any changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="6e8TOE"&gt;You may get a “Before you switch” pop-up urging you to try Microsoft Edge — go ahead and click on “Switch anyway.” You’ll get a pop-up with a “Keep using this app” selection on top and your other installed browsers below. Go ahead and select the one you want to use. (Be aware that there may be some file types that won’t offer your browser as an alternative.)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can change each file type for an appropriate installed app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GSqQpQeceV5bNmVJAzIzEy2Q6zI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22908535/Screenshot__8_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can change each file type for an appropriate installed app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="10SILw"&gt;Note: by the time you read this, some browsers may have instituted a system for letting you more easily switch your default browser. For example, when this was written, the first time I opened Firefox, it asked if I wanted it to become the default. I let it go ahead, and when I went to the “Default apps” section of setup, I found that Firefox was now set as the default for .HTM, .HTML, .HTTP, and .HTTPS files. Edge was still listed for .PDF, .SHTML, .SVG, .XHT, and .XHTML files. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Firefox default wizard switches some — but not all — of the browser file settings." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aOxLw8O3ehIDvA7Wfp9CIs56Yy4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22910128/Screenshot__92_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Firefox default wizard switches some — but not all — of the browser file settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="45S2Ao"&gt;One more thing: if you do open Edge for any reason, you will get the expected pop-up urging you to return to “recommended browser settings.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5F9mA7"&gt;That won’t solve everything&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QXShIl"&gt;But wait — there’s more. Even after you switch your browser default to something other than Edge, you’re still going to get Edge as the favored browser for a number of Windows apps. For example, bring up Windows 11’s new Widget pane (by clicking on the Widgets icon in your taskbar, the one that looks like a two-paned window), and click on one of the news items that appear there — and the link will open Edge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqLu97"&gt;If you find that irritating, there may be an app for that. In order to open Edge-specific links, you need to do the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="eamg7s"&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Apps &amp;gt; Default Apps.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VY8eCQ"&gt;Scroll down to the bottom until you see “Choose defaults by link type.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ntL2zm"&gt;Click on that and then in the search box labeled “Set defaults for link types,” type “Edge.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EqSQxy"&gt;Under the label “Microsoft-Edge, you’ll see “Microsoft Edge.” Click on that, and you’ll see any other browsers that you can use to open those specialized links.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="F300zK"&gt;Interestingly, if you install Chrome or Firefox, you won’t see them as choices. But if you install the Brave browser, you &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; see it as an option — and if you select that, then whenever you click on a news link in the Widget pane, it will come up in Brave.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can set the Brave browser to open widget links." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HFKfj0oIvaoVtculNxl-nRcJ45g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22914500/Screenshot__10_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can set the Brave browser to open widget links.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YbkyaH"&gt;Another possibility is a tool called &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://github.com/da2x/EdgeDeflector/releases__;!!FCkwbCh4Gg!KHujXED3SAH_FmrceqCzfq5hw3Xh54E0ZdSm2Q5xOfzrPpANG2SsodlCDiWcWe09xHc-FNSm%24"&gt;EdgeDeflector&lt;/a&gt; that was originally created to intercept any links in Windows 10 that were Edge-specific and rewrite them on the fly so that they can be opened by the default web browser. I did a little browsing and read that its latest version, v1.2.3.0, would work with Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42C5rv"&gt;I installed and &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.daniel.priv.no/tools/edgedeflector/post-install.html__;!!FCkwbCh4Gg!KHujXED3SAH_FmrceqCzfq5hw3Xh54E0ZdSm2Q5xOfzrPpANG2SsodlCDiWcWe09xGOdR8WW%24"&gt;followed the directions for setup&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, while that worked for most links, when I clicked on a link from the news sources in the Widgets pane, it didn’t quite work — the link opened in Chrome, but none of the graphics came through. I’d keep an eye on this app, though...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eY2vh8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 8th, 2021, 1:10PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; What happens when some browsers offer to switch your defaults has been clarified.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QM9NWC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 10th, 2021, 10:30AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to include directions for allowing the Brave browser to open certain specialized Windows links.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SNL’s take on the Facebook whistleblower hearing reminds us of the good old MySpace days</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OwXL28eMOBiKwEylxuqNtGvbcO0=/221x0:1613x928/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69976641/tom_from_myspace_snl.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwUkFly-xQU&amp;amp;ab_channel=SaturdayNightLive" target="_blank"&gt;NBC/SNL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SE2ZfP"&gt;Last week Saturday Night Live poked fun at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707112/snl-says-what-we-were-all-thinking-billionaire-star-trek-bezos-musk-branson-spacex-blue-origin"&gt;Jeff Bezos and the billionaire space race&lt;/a&gt;, and this week it took aim at the senators who conducted this week’s Facebook whistleblower hearing, portraying them as mostly confused by the social media platform, and the memes they found online (or “mem-ays” as Aidy Bryant’s Ted Cruz pronounces it).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxzsJS"&gt;Cecily Strong reprises her role as Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who asks Heidi Gardner’s Frances Haugen about an&lt;em&gt; Animorphs&lt;/em&gt; post, and Kyle Mooney as Sen. John Kennedy asks about Facebook’s algorithm: “do you have it with you now?” while proudly showing off his Jitterbug flip phone (aw).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mIVJE0"&gt;Bryant as Sen. Cruz asks whether posts that say “Ted Cruz sucks” should be flagged as misinformation, to which “Haugen” answers that it’s not really misinformation, just one person’s opinion. “Wellll, more than one person,” Bryant’s Cruz replies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1Z2ml"&gt;The biggest laugh of the sketch came when the “hearing” introduced a video statement from “the OG social media king” — Pete Davidson as Tom Anderson of MySpace. “Remember me? I was harmless! I’m not doing any of that weird algorithm stuff— we barely maintained the website,” he said, inviting people to “come on by and check out your friend’s band from 20 years ago.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDslOp"&gt;We did not know how good we had it, Tom. (And yes &lt;a href="http://myspace.com"&gt;MySpace&lt;/a&gt; is still around, no, I could not remember my username).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SGGOky"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="da" dir="ltr"&gt;The OG social media king &lt;a href="https://t.co/2OQm1LXGq0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/2OQm1LXGq0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Saturday Night Live - SNL (@nbcsnl) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nbcsnl/status/1447050032071458819?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fUnuAS"&gt;The real Haugen, a former Facebook product manager at Facebook, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;testified before Congress&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday about a trove of internal documents she provided to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;. The hearing was focused on Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;internal research that showed Instagram can have a negative effect on young people&lt;/a&gt;. Haugen said during the hearing that Facebook’s need for engagement in order to sell ads meant it kept users on the site even when the company knew the users were engaging with harmful content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2YeJS"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10113961365418581"&gt;post on his own Facebook&lt;/a&gt; page. CEO Mark Zuckerberg disputed that characterization, calling it “illogical” that the company would push content that makes people angry just to turn a profit. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Musk says Tesla will begin production at its German Gigafactory by the end of the year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Open House at the Tesla Gigafactory" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_8BH34KylkpUPLWfqhbXBNac9FM=/0x64:4230x2884/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69976451/1235786773.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QNsfg3"&gt;Elon Musk said during an open house at Tesla’s new Gigafactory near Berlin this weekend that the company is aiming to  begin production of its Model Y cars there before the end of the year. And the CEO added he’s hoping the plant will be producing between 5,000 and 10,000 vehicles weekly by the end of 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-08/musk-s-plane-takes-off-to-berlin-ahead-of-tesla-plant-party"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. But Tesla is still waiting for final approval for the plant, as &lt;a href="https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20211009-tesla-holds-giga-fest-at-disputed-german-factory"&gt;local authorities evaluate&lt;/a&gt; its environmental impact on the area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6LWCO"&gt;Tesla held a “&lt;a href="https://giga-fest.com/faq/"&gt;Giga-Fest&lt;/a&gt;” county fair style event in Gruenheide near the Gigafactory on Saturday, which included music, rides, and food trucks along with tours of the new plant for local residents. Tesla’s German Gigafactory is in the final phases of construction, after being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/17/21140666/tesla-gigafactory-4-berlin-gruenheide-environmental-protest-pause"&gt;delayed&lt;/a&gt; several times by &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/08/business/tesla-german-gigafactory-delay.html"&gt;complaints&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146770/tesla-berlin-gigafactory-tree-felling-work-continues-environmental-concerns"&gt;environmental groups in the area&lt;/a&gt; concerned about the factory’s water use and disruption to wildlife. Musk said Saturday that Tesla would plant more trees than it cut down during construction and use as little water as possible at the factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXEtVC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/12/20961812/elon-musk-berlin-tesla-ceo-fourth-gigafactory-construction"&gt;Musk first announced in 2019&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla would locate its European &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2018/11/30/18118451/tesla-gigafactory-nevada-video-elon-musk-jobs-model-3"&gt;Gigafactory&lt;/a&gt;— which he’s referred to as a “machine that builds the machine”— in Germany. The company said it aims to produce as many as 500,000 cars a year and have 12,000 employees at the plant. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 6 leak teases Magic Eraser feature, plus five years of Android security updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 (top) and Pixel 6 Pro (bottom)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pJ3qw9qBEwqt_izogsA4VR5JuMQ=/0x1364:4500x4364/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69974319/Google_Pixel_6_Pro_Google_Pixel_6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Google Pixel 6 (top) and Pixel 6 Pro (bottom) | Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fA13dV"&gt;New leaks from a marketing site appear to confirm that the camera for the Pixel 6 will have a new Magic Eraser feature, and the devices will apparently get five years of Android security updates (h/t &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/09/pixel-6-magic-eraser-camera-features/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5 Google)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAMizQ"&gt;According to reliable leaker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1446843190892453889?s=21"&gt;Evan Blass, the Carphone Warehouse website&lt;/a&gt; was showing images of Google marketing materials for the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro (the images have since been taken down, but you can view the earlier versions of the Carphone Warehouse pages on the Wayback Machine &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211009124417/https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/google/pixel6-river-content.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211009124928/https://www.carphonewarehouse.com/google/pixel6-pro-river-content.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Screenshots show the description for the previously leaked Magic Eraser, which will apparently be linked to Google Photos:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="AW8juw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Magic Eraser makes distractions disappear with a few taps. Remove strangers and unwanted objects in Google Photos, so the people and places that you capture remain the true stars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UQqO77"&gt;Much of what is in the latest photos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714141/google-pixel-6-pro-marketing-images-leak-evleaks-wireless-charger-face-unlock"&gt;has been leaked&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;confirmed already&lt;/a&gt;; the Pixel 6 camera will have a 50MP main sensor and a 12MP ultrawide lens, and the Pixel 6 Pro will have a 48MP telephoto lens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="H22CiN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"This is the Pixel 6","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cczVQ3"&gt;And as &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/google-pixel-6-pro-five-years-android-updates-134435892.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget &lt;/em&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt;, some of the copy on the leaked images (in the tiny, tiny fine print) references “Android security updates for at least five years from when the device first became available on the Google Store in the US.” That would mean Pixel 6 devices would have protection into 2026. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmPZaA"&gt;Google did get ahead of some of this year’s leaks with early announcements about the Pixel 6 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686534/google-pixel-6-pro-leak-display-screen-video"&gt;the Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, including hints about its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676099/google-pixel-6-tensor-processor-rumor-arm-cortex-x1-core-mystery-strange"&gt;Tensor processor&lt;/a&gt;. The company will hold its traditional &lt;a href="https://pixelevent.withgoogle.com/"&gt;autumn hardware event&lt;/a&gt; on October 19th, where it will “officially introduce” the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boeing Starliner test flight delayed until 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Boeing Orbital Flight Test-2 Prelaunch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P1ARKh_uUMVX0k1z08p2l3HfReY=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69974010/1234298178.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A test flight for Boeing’s Starliner has been pushed back to 2022 | NASA/Joel Kowsky&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ItzWo7"&gt;NASA has officially &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2021/10/08/nasa-boeing-update-starliner-orbital-flight-test-2-status/"&gt;pushed back the launch&lt;/a&gt; of its Orbital Flight-Test 2 until next year, as it continues to work on an oxidizer isolation valve issue on Boeing’s Starliner spacecraft, the agency announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9jtAp5"&gt;The agency said in a &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/commercialcrew/2021/10/08/nasa-boeing-update-starliner-orbital-flight-test-2-status/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that it’s continuing to assess potential launch windows for the mission: “The team currently is working toward opportunities in the first half of 2022 pending hardware readiness, the rocket manifest and space station availability,” according to the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kVHnkI"&gt;Steve Stitch, manager of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program, added that it was “a complex issue,” affecting parts of the spacecraft that aren’t easy to access, which has required “a methodical approach and sound engineering to effectively examine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SyPsZU"&gt;Boeing’s Starliner is one of two vehicles designed to take passengers to and from the International Space Station as part of NASA’s Commercial Crew Program; SpaceX’s Crew Dragon is the other. NASA required each company to launch an uncrewed test flight, followed by a crewed test flight as part of the process. So far, Starliner has only conducted one uncrewed flight, but it suffered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21127127/boeing-starliner-spacecraft-nasa-safety-software-glitch-catastrophic"&gt;software problems&lt;/a&gt; before it could reach the ISS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6EqYt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22595730/boeing-starliner-astronaut-capsule-launch-nasa-oft2"&gt;Boeing had hoped to fly the Starliner&lt;/a&gt; without passengers over the summer in a second attempt at an uncrewed flight, but hours before liftoff the company found the problems with some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607683/boeing-starliner-technical-issue-nasa-launch-postponed"&gt;spacecraft’s propulsion valves&lt;/a&gt; and NASA scrubbed the launch&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPVFXA"&gt;Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712701/nasa-boeing-starliner-astronaut-assignment-nicole-mann-josh-cassada-spacex-dragon"&gt;NASA announced it was reassigning two astronauts&lt;/a&gt; who were supposed to fly on upcoming Starliner flights to an upcoming SpaceX flight instead. Nicole Mann and Josh Cassada will fly on the fifth crewed SpaceX mission to the International Space Station, currently scheduled for autumn 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk cites ‘last minute concerns’ in delay of Tesla software rollout</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IIKEcfb1JjTROcqo5jSI5UXGKyA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69973360/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tesla has delayed the latest rollout of its so-called “Full Self-Driving” software | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QhjOKD"&gt;Tesla has delayed the rollout of its Full Self-Driving (FSD) Beta 10.2 software rollout because of last-minute concerns, CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1446752265012908032"&gt;Elon Musk tweeted&lt;/a&gt; early Saturday. He apologized for the delay, saying the release would likely happen Sunday or Monday. He didn’t elaborate on what the “concerns” were.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g5kbkY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A few last minute concerns about this build. Release likely on Sunday or Monday. Sorry for the delay.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1446752265012908032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jp6gGh"&gt;The software was supposed to roll out Friday to about 1,000 Tesla owners with perfect safety scores of 100 —as determined by the automaker— with a gradual rollout for those with scores at 99 and below after that, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1446104772092772352?s=20"&gt;according to Musk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZWVld"&gt;Tesla has been testing the beta version of its FSD software for about a year, and despite the head of the National Transportation Safety Board &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/19/22682272/ntsb-official-tesla-safety-elon-musk-full-self-driving"&gt;expressing serious concerns about the software’s safety&lt;/a&gt;, the carmaker began expanding FSD access to more drivers last month. Before a Tesla driver gets access to FSD, however, the company &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/safety-score"&gt;determines their “safety score,”&lt;/a&gt; using criteria that evaluate “the likelihood that your driving could result in a future collision.” The score is tabulated using data collected by sensors in the driver’s Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dF5V6n"&gt;The company has required owners who opt in to the FSD beta to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22696463/tesla-fsd-beta-nda-video-clips-controversy-full-self-driving"&gt;sign non-disclosure agreements&lt;/a&gt;, and asked that they refrain from sharing video clips online of the system’s mistakes. To reiterate: the FSD software doesn’t make Teslas fully autonomous; Musk himself has said he thinks the “feature complete” version of the software will only be “&lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/01/13/tesla-full-self-driving-feature-complete-soon-elon-musk/#:~:text=When%20Musk%20talks%20about%20a,features%20with%20city%20driving%20capability.&amp;amp;text=So%20feature-complete%20means%20it's,it%20would%20still%20be%20supervised."&gt;likely&lt;/a&gt;” to drive someone from their home to work without human intervention and will still require supervision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXoFAT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WaK7dl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
