    <title>Android 12 review: it’s mostly about the looks</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;There are a just a few noteworthy features in this design-focused update&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="RFWcqP"&gt;The most exciting thing about a big Android update is getting to try all of the new show-stopping features that’ll change the way you’ll use your phone. Android 12, which releases in a few weeks on Pixel phones (3 and up) and just a select few other devices later this year, is interesting because, well, it doesn’t have a bunch of those. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LNR8tG"&gt;I’ve been using Android 12 on the Pixel 3 since the first developer preview, and on the Pixel 4A 5G more recently during the latest release candidate. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22473033"&gt;Google announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it released the Android 12 source on Android Open Source Project (AOSP), but instead of releasing it broadly as it has in years past, Pixel owners will need to wait a few more weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2PpWGW"&gt;For the most part, it’s still Android. You can easily get by on the new update without using the smattering of new features that Google buried in the settings, though it’s worth seeking out a few of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qP2yYF"&gt;The most obvious change, which is also the biggest incentive for most people to download Android 12, is Google’s new Material You design. The company says it’s the biggest design change in Android’s history. I agree that it’s significant, since it basically makes stock Android look like a really good custom launcher. There’s more color and more fun shapes throughout, and weirdest of all, widgets are officially a thing again. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12 beta running on a Pixel 4A 5G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/syqR5csqL5OvtnWiQlcg836QUgk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899749/cfaulkner_211004_4791_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android 12’s design can look as loud or subdued as you’d like, and it doesn’t force you to use widgets if you don’t want to.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4D1oA-9Sk5eto1gI4hZ7wE68xUs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899745/cfaulkner_211004_4791_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This sun-shaped clock is probably the best widget Google has created yet. Let’s hope it has more up its sleeve.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nNSmS3"&gt;The core design improvements in Android 12 further smooth over some of the operating system’s edges — quite literally. The animations you’ll see when you power on your device, turn it off, or plug in a charger all look refined and fluid. Notification pop-ups, items in the pull-down quick settings menu, the volume interface, and more have nice, rounded edges, nesting elegantly within the equally rounded corners of the displays on Pixel phones. In some cases, though, the refreshed design comes at the cost of information density. Power users might feel like they’re using a Fisher Price phone, particularly when it comes to how the pull-down menu looks, but others may not mind as much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJ1HsW"&gt;I’d say that the fit and finish of Android 12 is more polished than any other version at launch, except for a rather annoying bug with its at-a-glance widget at the top of the homescreen, which wouldn’t display the weather or other important calendar or traffic info during the beta, nor can it be fully turned off. Its menu had toggle switches with no descriptions next to them, and it was an eyesore. If Google fixes this in the final release, we’ll note that in the review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="06DIkP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10788908"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3L5Zou"&gt;Google’s goal with Material You is to unify the look of all of its disparate devices, including smart displays, phones, and anything else running Google software that has a screen. But for Android 12, the big visual overhaul is about giving you just a little more flexibility in making your phone feel more like your own. Leading the charge are many of Google’s long-forgotten widgets that have received a glow-up for Android 12. In case you are just now waking up after a five-year slumber, widgets are cool again, and even iOS has them. Having a colorful, sun-shaped clock and the “Your memories’’ widget from Google Photos on my homescreen looks great, and I’m really eager to see if more companies than just Google think it’s worth investing in making or updating widgets. Though I’ll admit, I’m a little scared to hold my breath here. A lot of the widgets, particularly third-party media players, still look like they haven’t gotten attention for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40KuPY"&gt;But even before we know if there will eventually be a rush of widgets vying for a spot on my homescreen, I think Google missed the obvious opportunity to adapt Apple’s widget stacks feature in iOS. Single-purpose widgets take up a lot of precious space, and with something like widget stacks, which lets you stack two or more widgets on top of each other and scroll through them as needed, it’d be possible to have both a functional homescreen and a good-looking one. Maybe next time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bi26o0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21426066/android-11-review-features-bubbles-priority-notifications-updates-pixel-oneplus"&gt;Android 11&lt;/a&gt; introduced support for custom themes, letting you adjust the font type, app icon shape, and color scheme. Android 12 has pared down the customization to focus just on what color you want to appear on some of the menus, buttons, widgets, and tiles on the quick settings pull-down menu, including the native media player seen within the notifications pane. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R8pOA7CobN5Kt2tkQIjgSrHw6jQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899747/cfaulkner_211004_4791_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The wallpapers &amp;amp; style menu gives you a few more customization options in Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k0NJXI"&gt;You’ll find the “wallpapers &amp;amp; style” option by long-pressing on the homescreen, and from there you can choose a color from a palette that’s automatically generated from your wallpaper. I really love this. Though, if you just want to keep it simple, you can pick from one of four pastels that look different depending on whether you have light or dark mode activated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUVdv8"&gt;Another small but nifty feature in this setting is “Themed Icons,” which attempts to dip all of your app icons in your preferred color for a more consistent look. In practice, many of Google’s apps played nicely with this feature during the beta, but not a single third-party app that I had installed did. Perhaps it’s intentional on Google’s part, opting to let non-Google apps pop with more color on your homescreen. Or maybe it’s that app makers may not want to voluntarily make their app icons less identifiable at a glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9eo3td"&gt;Before I get to some of the other improvements that I’m glad to have in Android 12, I need to mention that I haven’t gotten over Google’s omission of the power menu, one of Android 11’s most well-executed ideas. By holding the power button, it used to let you easily access your Google Pay wallet, smart home gadgets, and power settings, all from one screen. Now, holding the power button will trigger the Google Assistant. You’ll find smart home device toggles and Google Pay relocated to the bottom right and left corners of the lock screen, mimicking the respective locations of the flashlight and camera buttons on iPhones. Alternatively, you can find them in the quick settings pull-down, if that’s easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Phone displaying Android 11 Beta" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z81yOA-WqcpnG4Rr8T06Tdpt-R8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20026246/dbohn_200608_4059_0011.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android 11 nailed the now-defunct power menu (seen here).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xMjEC4sw9caaDsSQzGZbB2kRkSs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899842/android12gp.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Those same controls have been relocated to the bottom corners of the Android 12 lock screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TGoPRF"&gt;You may not lament the power menu’s disappearance, but I think the big issue is that Google keeps changing how you access these increasingly vital functions. It’d just be great if Google could try to improve on its ideas without completely ditching them after one iteration of Android. It still lets people choose whether they want to experience Android with or without gestures, so why not also let them choose where they want to access mobile payments and smart home device controls? &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KmzdL9qkWrGlZ6oQ_6FXsZhTrSA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899801/android12screens.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From left to right, the broken At a Glance homescreen widget, the new-look pull-down menu, and the new scrolling screenshot feature in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L6gx6H"&gt;Outside of that, there are several tweaks that are additive to the Android experience, even if Apple or other Android OEMs beat Google to the punch. Regardless, it’s great that Google &lt;em&gt;finally &lt;/em&gt;added scrolling screenshots to the Pixel’s feature set. This lets you take screen grabs that span further down the page. Android 12 also debuts indicators that appear at the top of your phone when the camera or microphone are in use, just like the feature that appeared in iOS 14. There are even new quick setting tiles you can add to quickly be able to turn off the camera and / or microphone on the system level. Those tiles are going to get a lot of use from people, I expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmecPC"&gt;Also, when an app asks for your location, you can now specify in most cases whether you want to give the app approximate or precise location info, like in iOS. This year’s Android update also brings a one-handed mode that’s identical to Apple’s. Once it’s active within the gestures menu, just swipe your finger down on the bottom edge of the display to pull things within reach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12 beta running on a Pixel 4A 5G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UwL_vtbWg9LJfXDXUSBPWYZD5WU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899752/cfaulkner_211004_4791_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new privacy dashboard is accessible within the system settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12 beta running on Pixel 4A 5G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NweM3wh1-Ci0u6lLU4AqYibn2iU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899753/cfaulkner_211004_4791_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Quick Tap feature was available on the Pixel 4A that I tested, but not the Pixel 3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fMelXE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22634128/privacy-android-12-dashboard-apps-sensors"&gt;Android 12’s new Privacy Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; is worth checking out, too, since it keeps tabs on how often your apps are pinging for your location, requesting to access your call logs, or are tapping into your camera and microphone. Even if this isn’t something that you plan on monitoring often, it’s great that Google built more transparency than ever into the OS, showing what kind of access your apps have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="kGs6Da"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10788875"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j2VMbZ"&gt;If that didn’t seem to you like an overwhelming amount of features, you’re right. As my colleague Chaim Gartenberg mentioned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;in this year’s iOS 15 review&lt;/a&gt;, these big updates are becoming smaller and subtler. After more than a decade of polish, these operating systems are no longer in need of vast reworkings every calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HXi0CA89bAI0Kd6NcEmEITEWEnc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899854/Screenshot_20211004_102048.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How some games will look with the Game dashboard feature switched on. It gives you the option to take screenshots, record footage, toggle do not disturb, as well as see frames per second.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RpauYp"&gt;More features will come, though. Google will probably follow up with a few “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21002753/pixel-feature-drop-updates-robocall-screening-portrait-mode-duo-video-call"&gt;feature drops&lt;/a&gt;’’ in 2022. And, if they’re anything like previous ones, they’ll make owning a Pixel phone feel like an even more rewarding experience. Looking forward, there are rumors that Android 12.1 might bring more changes, particularly, multitasking improvements for foldable phones, a sector that Google itself may be joining soon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12 beta running on a Pixel 4A 5G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tdo6XeiVBGQ2Q8mFGhn7DCxrU5w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899751/cfaulkner_211004_4791_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of the stock wallpapers look incredible when used with the new Material You widgets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12 beta running on a Pixel 4A 5G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ltViEPolTZLhUVKceL2-RgE_Vg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899748/cfaulkner_211004_4791_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s possible to go with a more understated look, too, with icon colors to match.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mJcpzy"&gt;In reviewing a new Android update, I thought about how these changes and features will impact all Android phones. But the thing is, right now Android 12 is really only good news for Pixel users, and it might be that way for a while. This update is rolling out today to the Pixel 3 and up, and we’ll be adding the other manufacturers offering support once Google confirms it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZougoE"&gt;According to this &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/10/android-12-is-live-in-aosp.html"&gt;Android Developers page&lt;/a&gt;, Google says Android 12 is coming to “Pixel in the next few weeks and Samsung Galaxy, OnePlus, Oppo, Realme, Tecno, Vivo, and Xiaomi devices later this year.” We’ll update this review once Google shares specifics on the models that will receive Android 12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9a8ODL"&gt;Each of those phones use their own custom Android wrapper with its own design ID. So, while many of Android 12’s new features should make the jump, it’s possible that Google’s big Material You design push may not appear, at least with the same amount of customization that you’d find on Pixel, on every other phone that gets the update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="QCQlln"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10789089"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Android 12 beta running on a Pixel 4A 5G" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bflhjZyYlhhq9_kTXsLfZ2Pl4HE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899754/cfaulkner_211004_4791_00010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finally, Google is using more of the Pixel’s always-on display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xbUkpj"&gt;Samsung is a big manufacturer missing from the list of devices getting Android 12 today. Though, it has already committed to bringing the software to its Galaxy S21 lineup from earlier this year in the form of its OneUI 4 update. A hands-on with the beta software &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/one-ui-4-beta-features-overview/"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows that Samsung’s take on Android 12 doesn’t seem to have the same pizzazz as Google’s treatment on Pixel phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="kcGiJI"&gt;Android 12 isn’t an update that’s trying to change how you use your phone — not that it needed to be. Instead of just tacking on dozens of new features, Google just wanted to shake things up in the design department for the sake of it. It’s an upheaval of some of Android’s smallest details. It amounts to a more customizable experience, which in turn lets your phone look and feel more unique. If that gets you excited, you probably won’t regret installing. But I wouldn’t buy a Pixel just to experience Android 12. And if you can’t get the update today, I wouldn’t fret too much until more features are added.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 will be coming to Pixel phones in the ‘next few weeks’</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WAmjlA"&gt;Google’s latest major Android update, Android 12, isn’t available to the general public just yet, but it’s getting closer. The company wrote on its &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/10/android-12-is-live-in-aosp.html"&gt;Android Developers site&lt;/a&gt; that it pushed the source to Android Open Source Project (AOSP) and is “officially” releasing the update. Despite Android 12 being technically available, you won’t find it appearing as an update on your Pixel phone for the “next few weeks,” according to the post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QyOrt"&gt;When it does launch, it’ll come to the Pixel 3, Pixel 3A, Pixel 4, Pixel 4A, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;Pixel 4A 5G&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt; phones (wow, Google sure makes a lot of these now). It’s the software that you’ll see on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; when those launch later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaC2XP"&gt;According to Google, it’ll also come to Samsung Galaxy, OnePlus, Oppo, Realme, Tecno, Vivo, and Xiaomi devices later in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jo7JaI"&gt;In case you’re curious what’s what with Android 12, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22472761"&gt;I’ve got a review of the software&lt;/a&gt;, which I tested extensively on both a Pixel 3 and Pixel 4A 5G. It’s an update that is mostly focused on tweaking the way Android looks with Google’s new Material You design language. There are other features worth trying, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22634128/privacy-android-12-dashboard-apps-sensors"&gt;including a new privacy dashboard&lt;/a&gt; that offers up more transparency on how your apps access your location, microphone, and camera, but overall, it’s not an update that aims to drastically alter how you use your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5vAPn"&gt;If you need an extra hand with downloading and installing the update when it comes, we’ll be putting up a step-by-step guide for doing that on your Pixel or other supported phone, so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="yQnrks"&gt;Just as Facebook’s Antigone Davis was live on CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;defending the company over a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;whistleblower’s accusations&lt;/a&gt; and its handling of research data &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701445/facebook-instagram-mental-health-research-pdfs-documents"&gt;suggesting Instagram is harmful to teens&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s entire network of services suddenly went offline. On Twitter, Facebook communications exec Andy Stone &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1445058088436908045"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, “We’re aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products. We’re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible, and we apologize for any inconvenience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmqBiE"&gt;A peek at &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/facebook/"&gt;Down Detector&lt;/a&gt; (or your Twitter feed) reveals the problems are widespread. While it’s unclear exactly why the platforms are unreachable for so many people, their DNS records show that, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702876/slack-is-down-outage-morning-disruption-work-chat"&gt;like last week’s Slack outage&lt;/a&gt;, the problem is apparently DNS (&lt;a href="https://imgur.com/WmRbmf5"&gt;it’s always DNS&lt;/a&gt;). Cloudflare senior vice president Dane Knecht &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dok2001/status/1445056572703625218"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook’s border gateway protocol routes — &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;BGP&lt;/a&gt; helps networks pick the best path to deliver internet traffic — have been “withdrawn from the internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x5968t"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re aware that some people are having trouble accessing Facebook app. We’re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible, and we apologize for any inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;— Facebook App (@facebookapp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/facebookapp/status/1445060225468297216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="Jijz8O"&gt;&lt;a href="http://Instagram.com"&gt;Instagram.com&lt;/a&gt; is flashing a 5xx Server Error message, while the Facebook site merely tells us that something went wrong. The problem also appears to be affecting its virtual reality arm, Oculus. Users can load games they already have installed and the browser works, but social features or installing new games does not. The outage is thorough enough that it’s affecting Workplace from Facebook customers and, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1445058298034614278?s=21"&gt;according to Jane Manchun Wong&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook’s internal sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgO9qf"&gt;There’s no word yet from Facebook about what may be causing the problem or when those sites, including Messenger and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WhatsApp/status/1445060216161116168"&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;, will be operational again, but we will update this article with more information when it’s available.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix launches ‘Play Something’ for Android users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o1zLWLwHvMmE_E0gZ817eEfTT70=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948609/Play_Something_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jsdBgm"&gt;Netflix is officially bringing its shuffle feature to its Android mobile users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hB9wjV"&gt;The company originally began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407467/netflix-play-something-shuffle-feature-launch-tv-movie"&gt;testing the Play Something feature&lt;/a&gt; back in April, but it’s officially launching the feature globally on Android today. The tool — which lets Netflix choose something for you to watch — is now available on TV and Android mobile devices, but it’s not supported on iOS just yet. Netflix said that it will begin testing the shuffle function on iOS in the coming months, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cFlB09"&gt;Separately, Netflix is also launching its Fast Laughs feature — which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311418/netflix-tiktok-clips-funny-movies-tv-shows-streaming-big-mouth-seinfeld"&gt;rolled out on iOS&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year — on Android mobile devices today in select markets, including the US, Australia, Canada, Ireland, India, Malaysia, Philippines, and the UK. The tool works like a highlight reel of funny clips from its series and films. It’s a little like TikTok but specifically for Netflix funnies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ceVKgL"&gt;Lastly, Netflix said Monday that it’s bringing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295236/netflix-downloads-for-you-recomendations-streaming"&gt;Downloads for You&lt;/a&gt; tool to iOS in the coming month. Originally launched earlier this year on Android, the opt-in feature automatically downloads stuff to watch offline based on your viewing history. It’s a neat feature to have toggled on if, say, you plan to travel and don’t want to forget to download content for offline viewing before your trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bxju2m"&gt;The Play Something button launching today on Android, meanwhile, can be found on mobile devices on the navigation bar at the bottom of the screen or roughly around the 17th row on the homepage. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use Google’s budget feature on Android so you don’t overspend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FbPOvwu5O66nh4k60ryUXgFZhbw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67661713/jbareham_181010_2989_0296.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qnCBiu"&gt;Google has provided a budgeting feature in its Play Store that allows Android users to establish a monthly maximum they want to spend on digital content. This applies to apps, games, movies, TV shows, music, ebooks, and so on. As you get close to reaching your budget limit, you’ll see an alert that you’re nearing it — or have gone over the amount you specified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GrHNS5"&gt;You access it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qpmLYU"&gt;Open the Play Store on your Android device, tap on your personal icon on the upper right side, and select “Payments &amp;amp; subscriptions.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ibqrH5"&gt;From there, select “Budget &amp;amp; history.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BTRG2W"&gt;You’ll see the amount you spent during the current month. Choose the “Set budget” option and enter the amount you’re comfortable spending on your apps, music, movies, TV shows, and ebooks for a month. Then hit “Save.” Your budget can always be adjusted or removed altogether from this same screen. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Choose an amount for your budget." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/64XbKwh8Woe-_LFqcBHLDLzmxiw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899906/Screenshot_20211004_110750.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose an amount for your budget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can remove or edit the budget anytime." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L1vHScBBWTV_5EbRSt2fr3-XI8s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899908/Screenshot_20211004_110832.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can remove or edit the budget anytime.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="biBi74"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/9281767?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=3364261"&gt;As Google notes&lt;/a&gt;, setting a budget won’t actually do anything to prevent purchases or subscriptions on your Google Play account once you’ve exceeded it. This feature is meant to be an easy reference for tracking your spending that you can take advantage of; it doesn’t implement hard restrictions like &lt;a href="https://families.google.com/familylink/"&gt;Google’s Family Link&lt;/a&gt; parental controls can. One other thing to know is that you can only set budgets using the currency of the country where your Google Play profile is linked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8WQRo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 20th, 2020, 2:37PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on April 17th, 2019, and has been updated to reflect the fact that the feature is available to all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eO4wzo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 2021, 11:25AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect changes in the Android interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volvo announces plans to go public in bid to accelerate shift to electric cars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fRGTR7LndinbJDayzQ5PJ4MSbro=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948413/ahawkins_201221_4352_6471.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LNSCwN"&gt;Volvo, the Swedish luxury car maker owned by China’s Geely, &lt;a href="https://www.media.volvocars.com/global/en-gb/media/pressreleases/287174/volvo-cars-announces-its-intention-to-launch-an-initial-public-offering-and-list-on-nasdaq-stockholm"&gt;announced its plan&lt;/a&gt; for an initial public offering as it seeks to raise more cash to accelerate its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22308851/volvo-electric-cars-only-2030-online-sales"&gt;transition to a fully electric car company.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ir54Rk"&gt;The announcement follows the news last week that Polestar, the electric car company that is a joint venture between Volvo and Geely, would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696139/polestar-spac-public-value-ev-startup-volvo-geely"&gt;going public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC&lt;/a&gt;. That deal values Polestar at roughly $20 billion, despite selling only two models — a hybrid luxury coupe and an all-electric fastback sedan. Volvo is choosing a more traditional route by proceeding with an IPO in Stockholm that could value the company at upwards of $25 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Deb6LN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Volvo said it aims to raise about 25 billion kronor, equivalent to $2.86 billion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XhJuqE"&gt;Volvo said it aims to raise about 25 billion kronor, equivalent to $2.86 billion, by issuing new shares. The aim is to use this money to speed up plans to phase out the sale of gas-powered cars in its bid to become an EV-only company by 2030. It also represents a dramatic comeback for Volvo, which was sold to Geely by a beleaguered Ford for just $1.8 billion in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zka7fx"&gt;Volvo launched its first fully electric car, the XC40 Recharge, last year. The SUV has a roughly 200-mile range and can charge its batteries to 80 percent capacity in 40 minutes. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195499/volvo-xc40-recharge-ev-suv-first-drive-specs-price"&gt;our time with the car&lt;/a&gt;, we found it to be an “impressive blend of Swedish ingenuity, crossover utility, and electric performance. The follow-up, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22307699/volvo-c40-recharge-electric-vehicle-ev-specs"&gt;C40 Recharge&lt;/a&gt;, will be available later this year, while an electric XC90 SUV won’t be revealed until 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8N0xTd"&gt;The listing would offer investors a chance to bet on the auto industry’s transition to fully electric vehicles at a time of rising concerns about tailpipe emissions and a crackdown by governments around the world on the production of gas cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8B3dmW"&gt;Geely, which is the largest privately owned automaker in China, will sell some of its shares in Volvo as part of the IPO, though it hasn’t said how many nor how it could affect the company’s overall stake in the automaker. Earlier this year, the company backed off a plan to fully merge Volvo with Geely’s auto division. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A surgically implanted brain stimulation device could help treat severe depression</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Deus Ex Brain" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qjmQVNESA4pogOKATHRzS9lwfSo=/0x2:640x429/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948357/Deus_Ex_brain.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WtvAn7"&gt;Sarah had no options left. Over five years, she’d tried every possible treatment for her severe depression, and nothing had helped. “My daily life had become so restricted and impoverished by depression that I felt tortured by each day,” the 36-year-old said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Yy6Nj"&gt;But after undergoing an experimental procedure that implanted a device into her brain, she felt her depression lift for the first time in years. “It was like my lens on the world changed,” Sarah, who is remaining anonymous because of the stigma around depression, said during a press briefing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBaWGC"&gt;Sarah was the patient in a proof-of-concept trial of a new approach to treating severe, treatment-resistant depression, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01480-w"&gt;published today&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. The findings open up another possible strategy for helping people with the disorder. The study only involved Sarah, and it’s still not clear how well it might work in other people. The lessons from the trial, though, helped the researchers understand more about the nature of depression and could apply to other efforts to treat the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ThGd44"&gt;“We identified through this trial some fundamental properties about the brain,” said study author Katherine Scangos, a psychiatrist at the University of California San Francisco Weill Institute for Neurosciences, during the press briefing. “We think these findings about the brain will be available for the general public, and will help us develop new personalized depression treatments.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zE6n4C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“depression is caused by faulty circuits”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ICyAE2"&gt;The trial used a technique called deep brain stimulation, where electrodes implanted within the brain deliver electrical impulses in an attempt to change or regulate abnormal brain activity. It’s common for conditions like epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease. Research over the past decade has shown that it can sometimes help with depression, but the findings have been &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/zapping-peoples-brains-didnt-cure-their-depression-until-it-did/558032/"&gt;inconsistent&lt;/a&gt;. Most previous efforts delivered stimulation to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5871707/"&gt;individual regions&lt;/a&gt; of the brain thought to be involved in depression. This study, though, was targeted at regions that were part of specific brain &lt;em&gt;circuits &lt;/em&gt;— interconnected parts of the brain that are responsible for specific functions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BjCE4s"&gt;“What we are increasingly realizing now is that depression is caused by faulty circuits,” Scangos says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuLzLq"&gt;In addition, the circuits involved might be different for each person. So in this trial, the study team personalized the treatment approach to the specific patient’s depression. They mapped out the type of brain activity that occurred when Sarah’s depression symptoms flared. Then, they surgically implanted a device that could detect that brain activity and send stimulation to the circuit where the activity was happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMbHqU"&gt;For Sarah, the procedure was highly effective. Her scores on depression rating scales dropped the morning after the device was turned on. And perhaps more importantly, she felt dramatic changes in her mood. During her first time getting the stimulation, she laughed out loud in the lab. “And everyone in the room went, ‘Oh my god,’ because that’s the first time I spontaneously laughed and smiled, where it wasn’t faked, in five years,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAgicW"&gt;Sarah’s depression circuit flares up hundreds of times a day, and each time, the implanted device delivers a brief stimulating pulse. In total, she gets around 30 minutes of stimulation each day, Scangos says. Sarah can’t feel the pulses, but she said she does have a general idea of when they’re happening throughout the day. “There’s a sense of alertness and energy or positivity that I’ll feel,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eAferA"&gt;Despite the overwhelming success for Sarah, this trial was just a first demonstration of this approach. The device used in the trial isn’t authorized to treat depression — it was originally designed to treat epilepsy and was used in the trial under an investigational device exemption from the FDA. “We have a lot of work ahead of us as a field to validate this result to see if it’s actually something that will be enduring as a treatment option,” said Edward Chang, an author on the study and the chairman of the department of neurosurgery at UCSF. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d1q15y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a lot of these approaches we consider a last resort”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DmX9bR"&gt;If it proves to work for other people, it would likely be used only after trying all other options, Chang says. Surgery — especially brain surgery — is always a risk. For patients with Parkinson’s and epilepsy, patients who go that route have generally tried every other treatment. “For now, a lot of these approaches we consider a last resort,” Chang said. It’s an expensive approach, as well — the device used in this study typically costs &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/11/16/245468383/new-medical-device-treats-epilepsy-with-a-well-timed-zap"&gt;between $35,000 and $40,000&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9PAaf"&gt;But even just this demonstration could help push our general understanding of depression forward. The team was able to identify circuitry in the brain involved in at least one person’s depressive symptoms, and that circuitry could be shared by other patients. Having foundational information about depression circuits could help develop non-surgical strategies that target similar areas. “Having this information and knowledge we think is going to go far beyond this application,” Chang said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4C388"&gt;Sarah thinks her success could also help cut through some of the stigma around depression. Going through the study helped Sarah reframe her relationship with the disease, she said. For her whole life, she said she’d internalized some of the idea that she should be able to feel better if she picked herself up and tried hard enough. “We tried every treatment possible, and I had such a positive attitude through all of it, and none of it worked. And it just reinforced the depression, and made me feel like I was the world’s worst patient, and that was my own personal moral failing,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxsYFF"&gt;The trial changed that and helped the constant refrain from her doctors — that her depression was a disease in her brain — fully sink in. “By the end of this I went, ‘Oh my god, this is no different than someone with Parkinson’s,’” Sarah said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbWUnV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Music will launch free background listening starting in Canada</title>

  &lt;p id="s4Gq5M"&gt;YouTube Music is lifting one of its most annoying limitations — but only in Canada. Today, YouTube announced that beginning November 3rd, customers in Canada will be able to continue listening to their music in the background while doing other tasks on their phone or when the screen is off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RS57Pp"&gt;Background listening will support both the standard ad-supported, personalized radio mixes and any uploaded content you’ve added to your account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmqOhT"&gt;This is the first time that YouTube Music has offered the feature without requiring that customers step up to a Premium subscription to get it. As for when listeners in other countries can expect to get the same convenience, for now, YouTube is only saying to “stay tuned for additional information and expansion plans.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2L8hAg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Music lovers rejoice!  Background listening is coming to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/youtubemusic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@YouTubeMusic&lt;/a&gt; app, and    will be the first to enjoy this new feature starting Nov 3! Get radio-like listening with your screen off and don’t stop the music!     &lt;a href="https://t.co/GPwRMcVhp1"&gt;https://t.co/GPwRMcVhp1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Google Canada (@googlecanada) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/googlecanada/status/1445025116614709255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WjtsgN"&gt;Free background listening is table stakes among YouTube Music’s competitors, including Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, Tidal, and others, so this is an area where YouTube lags its rivals. Hopefully, that expansion will get underway sooner than later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhDtOY"&gt;Even if background playback comes to the free tier, YouTube Music Premium still has other benefits: offline downloads is the big one, but you also get to listen without any ads and seamlessly switch between regular audio and music videos. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some must-have Nintendo Switch games are $20 off at several retailers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OP-wdeSftWgDpWegiGTX6IdzBPg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948046/MHRISE_Gathering_Hub_Canteen.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZlBczm"&gt;This is a big week for the Nintendo Switch. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22690483/metroid-dread-nintendo-switch-oled-console-hands-on-preview"&gt;Switch with an OLED screen and &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; launch Friday, October 8th. Whether you’re a Switch veteran, or you’re prepping for your first console with the $350 OLED model, there are some excellent deals on must-have, cartridge-based titles you should know about. &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt; are each $20 off. Amazon is the only retailer honoring this deal for all three games, but Best Buy and Walmart are hosting some deals, too. &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; is $20 off, but only at GameStop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KSEqI"&gt;All of these are noteworthy deals because they’re rarely discounted games. Nintendo sometimes hosts price cuts, but only for a select batch of games — many of which have been available since the Switch launched a handful of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MRMOxx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10660223"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="MDXV7k"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10241211"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="6aOgty"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10283625"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="0EdGQj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10415477"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ga2waH"&gt;Outside of Nintendo’s world, the Apple AirPods Pro are back down to one of their lowest prices yet. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZPC9QD4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling these wireless earbuds for $179&lt;/a&gt;, down from their normal $249 price. It’s not tough to find a decent deal on this model, but it rarely goes below this price point, outside of Black Friday, at least. In case you didn’t know, these high-end AirPods have active noise cancellation, excellent sound quality, and their case can charge via Lightning or wirelessly on a Qi charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4EcugC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wEebVp"&gt;If over-ear headphones are more your style, the Beats Studio 3 noise-canceling headphones in a few colorways are steeply discounted at Amazon. Originally $350, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio3-Wireless-Over%E2%80%91Ear-Headphones/dp/B085296FLT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some of the color options are available today for $170&lt;/a&gt;. This model released in 2017, and just like the first AirPods, they feature the W1 wireless chip that makes connecting to (and switching between) Apple devices a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
