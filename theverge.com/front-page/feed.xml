    <title>Moderna vaccine gets sign-off from independent FDA committee </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EdgcqK"&gt;An independent committee of experts recommended that the Food and Drug Administration authorize the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine for people 18 and older. This is the second COVID-19 vaccine to go before the committee — the first, made by Pfizer and BioNTech, was authorized last week. The agency is expected to issue an authorization for Moderna’s vaccine within a day or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AzuIhK"&gt;“This is a really opportune time for us to move science forward,” said Hayley Gans, a committee member and professor of pediatrics at Stanford University Medical Center, during the committee’s deliberations. The evidence available for benefits of the vaccine outweighs any issues, she said. “That really supports us being able to, with the pandemic in the background, really move forward, and finally provide a safe and effective way to get to herd immunity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPQdxL"&gt;The FDA’s review of the vaccine ahead of the meeting confirmed that it’s safe and 94 percent effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19, all but guaranteeing a vote of confidence. The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC), which met to discuss the data, spent the day discussing the additional questions remaining around the vaccine and how Moderna should handle vaccinations in the placebo group of its clinical trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CN9nRu"&gt;Moderna said during its presentation that the company plans to offer vaccines to people in the placebo arm quickly. Pfizer and BioNTech, on the other hand, plan to wait for participants in the placebo group to become eligible under their vaccine prioritization plans before telling them of their placebo status. Moderna would vaccinate this group with doses set aside for the clinical trial, which the company argues means study participants aren’t cutting in line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Vfhve"&gt;Telling the placebo group that they did, in fact, receive a placebo limits the ability to continue to study the vaccine in a blinded clinical trial — which worries the VRBPAC, which would want to collect data for as long as possible. The pharmaceutical companies, though, both said they think they have a responsibility to offer vaccines to the placebo group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Zm1sJ"&gt;The committee also pointed to a handful of issues the clinical trials still haven’t addressed. Moderna still doesn’t know, for example, if the vaccine can protect against asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 — stopping infection with the coronavirus entirely — or if it just prevents symptoms. Early data from Moderna hints that it could block asymptomatic infection. Trial participants who didn’t have symptoms were tested for the coronavirus between their first and second dose. People who took the vaccine were less likely to test positive than people in the placebo group. More answers on that question are coming in January, Moderna said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dil9kx"&gt;Moderna is still analyzing data collected after it submitted the vaccine for authorization. There were 450 more cases of disease reported in the trial after that submission, and that will add to the understanding of the vaccine’s efficacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GELek"&gt;As this vaccine and the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine are distributed throughout the country, the pharmaceutical companies and federal agencies will track how well they work and how safe they are in the real world. Already, regulators are finding effects that weren’t seen in clinical trials — a handful of &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/16/health/covid-pfizer-vaccine-allergic-reaction.html"&gt;allergic reactions&lt;/a&gt; and cases of anaphylaxis were reported in the US and United Kingdom in people vaccinated with the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine, for example. The FDA is investigating the US incidents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j38Bo1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3mS4K"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0JZZh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pbswyc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LSeAwh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAhwtn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is now testing its Clubhouse-like voice chat rooms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot showing the interface for joining a Space" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cBlhvPFHEjfvsexzxbCcEXGiitA=/0x6:1123x755/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68544274/IMG_0335.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iJZnx6"&gt;Twitter has begun testing its Spaces feature, the voice-based chat rooms &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570150/twitter-spaces-clubhouse-voice-rooms-testing"&gt;it first announced last month&lt;/a&gt;. In the thread announcing the test, the company said a very small group of users would be given the ability to create Spaces, but that in theory anyone could join them — though who would be allowed into any given space depends on the user who created it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P91Gwb"&gt;Twitter outlined last month how the first people to be given access to Spaces would be women and people from other marginalized communities, groups who are more likely than others to be subjected to abuse and harassment when trying to engage in conversations in regular, comment-based discussions on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pDeiSP"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;aye we’re live! what up y’all, we're the team behind Spaces––a small experiment focused on the intimacy of the human voice &lt;/p&gt;— Spaces (@TwitterSpaces) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1339639767089238019?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EnVdaw"&gt;Moderation seems to be a big focus of Spaces. Creators can control who can or cannot speak in the Space, and there are reporting and blocking features included in the first version. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the Spaces interface for a listener" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yfz8xwggONqUcWtcPp7JaspAgmc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22180498/IMG_0337.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Spaces interface for a listener.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vN08Ux"&gt;Other features that are being tested include emoji reactions, being able to share tweets in a Space, and a “very early version” of live voice transcription. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the reaction feature in a Space" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6N2kZDedYz7abWhcXG3YsFEjjh0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22180483/IMG_0339.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Users in a space can react with certain emojis, which will show over their profile picture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xqXPlx"&gt;At the moment, it seems like joining a Space only works from the Twitter mobile app — trying to join from the web just takes you to a “page not found” error. Strangely enough, joining one requires having Periscope integration enabled. That’s the live-streaming service that Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176842/twitter-periscope-shut-down-live-video-streaming-apps-2021"&gt;just announced it was shutting down&lt;/a&gt;, so it remains to be seen how Twitter plans to handle the technical backend of its voice chats once Periscope does disappear. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this LA Times report about how toxic jet fumes can seep into the air on planes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Airplane landing (SHUTTERSTOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yu-y5fmVUd5JFaMIu5xf9ekryaY=/1x0:1000x666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68544244/shutterstock_1236434.1419979666.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Shutterstock&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lry8Oa"&gt;A stunning new &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/toxic-chemicals-planes-covid-19-travel-woes/"&gt;report from the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; details how toxic jet engine fumes can leak into airplanes’ air supplies, sickening passengers and crew — and the airline industry has known this was a problem for several decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2JtCP"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reports that one pilot told colleagues the situation was “the tobacco and asbestos of aviation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Gp9Wpz"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; analysis of NASA safety reports from January 2018 to December 2019 identified 362 fume events that airline crew members reported to the agency, with nearly 400 pilots, flight attendants and passengers receiving medical attention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="06Q8vP"&gt;“Fume events” occur when heated jet engine oil leaks into the air supply, causing toxic gases inside the plane. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLmGOt"&gt;Airlines and airplane makers are aware that fume events have potentially serious problems. People can get quite sick when breathing in these fumes, according to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; report, but they haven’t taken measures to prevent the problem even though the technology exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="57X0jE"&gt;Airlines have been asking Boeing to install air sensors for years. But the company decided against developing the technology. Senior Boeing engineers worried that data from sensors would prove damaging in lawsuits by sick passengers and crew members, according to internal emails and sworn depositions obtained by The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcx1Ou"&gt;An internal Boeing memo described it as a “risk” to give air sensors to even one airline, according to a deposition of a Boeing executive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nyiOIn"&gt;The fumes tend to smell like dirty socks or a gym locker, according to people who have experienced it. And while not everyone gets sick, the fumes can give people flu-like symptoms, including vomiting and chills, and they have been linked in some cases to more serious neurological problems. Airlines aren’t required to report fume events, the article notes, and the Federal Aviation Administration “has no plans” to require air filters or air sensors in planes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OGakln"&gt;A lot of us aren’t flying due to the pandemic and may be feeling a bit wistful about eventually being able to travel again. But before you book those tickets, go read &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/projects/toxic-chemicals-planes-covid-19-travel-woes/"&gt;Kiera Feldman’s incredible investigation&lt;/a&gt; into jet fuel fumes aboard airplanes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VnQ05Z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHnW7p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google to shut down Android Things, a smart home OS that never took off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dhQPG1EqqFKmtrGbK0mQzOkpTas=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68544194/acastro_180413_1777_android_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cmh3tA"&gt;Google plans to &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/things/faq"&gt;shut down&lt;/a&gt; Android Things, a stripped-down version of Android designed for smart home devices. The OS never really got off the ground, so this isn’t all that much of a loss, but it is yet another entry in Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20977968/google-graveyard-products-shut-down-dead-not-supported-discontinues-spring-cleaning"&gt;expansive graveyard&lt;/a&gt; of shut-down projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdf0Rk"&gt;The smart home project got its start in 2015 under the name Brillo, which was meant to provide the “underlying operating system for the internet of things.” In 2016, Google revamped Brillo and relaunched the initiative as Android Things, which was likewise meant to run on products like connected speakers, security cameras, and routers. By relying on Android, the OS was supposed to be familiar to developers and easy to get started with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k7BGWl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The system will shut down in January 2022&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sRWWuT"&gt;Then nothing happened. In 2018, some initial smart speakers and smart displays came out using the underlying OS. It seems no other companies were interested, because in February 2019, Google announced it was “refocusing” Android Things to cater specifically to smart speakers and smart displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vnQFsa"&gt;Nearly two years later, and Android Things is now on track to be shut down. The Android Things Console, which lets developers push updates to their devices, will stop accepting new non-commercial projects starting January 5th, 2021. A year later, on January 5th, 2022, “the console will be turned down completely and all project data will be permanently deleted.” That essentially means developers have a year to wind down any Android Things projects they already have set up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orgTmT"&gt;It’s an inglorious ending for a project that, over five years, barely made a dent in the landscape, particularly as smart home devices began to boom in popularity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8lPNq"&gt;In case you’re interested, here’s the story of Android Things, told across all four headlines it made on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NPpgsm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Android Things is Google’s new OS for smart devices","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/13/13924996/android-things-announced-smart-home-iot-operating-system"},{"title":"Google says Android Things is finally ready for smart devices","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/7/17320414/android-things-1-release-commercial-devices-google-io-2018"},{"title":"Google’s Android Things is not much of a thing anymore","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/12/18222324/android-things-refocused-smart-speakers-displays"},{"title":"Google to shut down Android Things, a smart home OS that never took off","url":"https://www.theverge.com/e/21951588"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0XB43N"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>COVID-19 vaccine monitoring program limited to English speakers  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Broward Health Medical Center Administers First Of Its Covid Vaccinations To Healthcare Workers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AmPpN4FnxaotlPIloRDDABY0euI=/0x92:3000x2092/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68544131/1291821134.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zbDbSD"&gt;A text message program designed to track side effects in COVID-19 vaccine recipients is currently only available in English, which could limit the data it is able to collect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8o8ex"&gt;The program, called v-safe, is one way the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will follow up with people who take the vaccine. It was rolled out with the first wave of vaccinations last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="huipgA"&gt;“When you’re talking about technology, literacy and language are usually second tier,” says Jorge Rodriguez, a health technology equity researcher at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. “Version one is English-speaking, and the Spanish version will come later, the Mandarin version will come later.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6kwK6"&gt;The CDC plans to roll out a Spanish version of v-safe “fairly shortly,” Tom Shimabukuro, a member of the Vaccine Safety Team on the COVID-19 Vaccine Task Force, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The agency also plans to offer v-safe in simplified Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese, but Shimabukuro did not have a timeline for when that might be available. “They’re all in the process of undergoing a translation from English to these other languages,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_t8fsHha7kcg1FeYMTn5wDtKmlE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22180421/v_safe_how_to_01_get_started__2x.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CDC&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The CDC’s v-safe program is currently only available in English.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7xDb6B"&gt;The agency’s information toolkit around the COVID-19 vaccines, which includes fact sheets for the health care workers who are part of the first wave of vaccinations, is also still only available in English. Translations of the kit into other languages are in progress — Spanish first, and then other languages, the CDC says. The lag is a concern for the approximately &lt;a href="https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/limited-english-proficient-population-united-states-2011#13"&gt;25 million people&lt;/a&gt; in the United States who speak limited English. Information about vaccines must be available for people with low literacy and broadly translated, said David Curry, executive director of the New York University and Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia-affiliated Center for Vaccine Ethics and Policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xqZGlc"&gt;“We energetically urge and are confident that CDC will extend a special effort to enhance these materials,” he said in a public comment made during the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices meeting, held on December 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdKDfe"&gt;Until those translations are complete, the agency’s vaccination information and the v-safe program may not be easily accessible for non-English speakers. Even after translation, people who speak languages other than those that v-safe plans to include may not be able to participate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPEtxs"&gt;The portion of vaccine recipients not covered by these languages might not be enormous, but it overlaps with groups that tend to already be underserved by the health care system. Non-English speakers tend to have worse health outcomes overall, and they’ve had worse &lt;a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200331.77927/full/"&gt;outcomes&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/hospitals-have-left-many-covid19-patients-who-dont-speak-english-alone-confused-and-without-proper-care"&gt;from&lt;/a&gt; COVID-19 as well. “Given the disparities that we’ve seen in terms of outcomes in the pandemic, for this specific vaccination campaign, it’s even more critical to really get the information out in various languages,” Rodriguez says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="OFqkX0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Non-English speakers tend to have worse health outcomes overall&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JxA3lt"&gt;Pharmaceutical companies and federal agencies made a notable effort to enroll diverse populations in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trials. Dropping some of that focus during vaccine follow-ups like v-safe could stall that work. “You do wonder how much you will lose on the progress made in those trials by having this be one of your primary ways to collect data on symptoms and follow up after the vaccine,” Rodriguez says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YihTE8"&gt;V-safe is only one of a number of ways the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will monitor the safety of the COVID-19 vaccines. Other systems include the two-decade-old Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), where doctors and individuals can report any reactions that they think could be linked to a vaccine. It’s a spontaneous surveillance system — the federal agencies depend on people sending in reports, Shimabukuro says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4cfX1"&gt;V-safe, in contrast, is the agency’s active surveillance program and the way the CDC is reaching out to people and asking them about their experience with a vaccine. It’ll capture a different set of information than VAERS, including information from people who had no or minimal side effects. By starting with English, and only including a handful of other languages later on, that data could be limited, Rodriguez says. “You’re setting yourself up for disparities in vaccination tracking,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BAMZwg"&gt;The CDC’s information page on v-safe is already available in multiple languages, which is a good start, Rodriguez says. Translating the page &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/safety/vsafe.html"&gt;only changes&lt;/a&gt; the text on the page, not the information in the images of the app in action. “It’s going to exclude a good chunk of the population, and that’s the same underserved group that may have low literacy, which is often essential workers, who may have had worse health outcomes during the pandemic,” Rodriguez says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwZZBS"&gt;That’s why it’s important to have multiple ways to collect data on vaccination outcomes. “I’m a big fan of technology,” he says. “But we have to acknowledge its limitations and capture some of this information in other ways to make sure the sample you’re getting is really representative of the population.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dgYDM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is launching its new verification process on January 20th</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Svlkv2"&gt;Twitter’s revamped verification process is &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2020/our-plans-to-relaunch-verification-and-whats-next.html"&gt;launching on January 20th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, bringing back the ability to request a blue checkmark after Twitter pressed pause on the formal application process for more than three years. The &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/about-twitter-verified-accounts"&gt;new policy&lt;/a&gt; was refined with input from tens of thousands of user responses after Twitter confirmed in November it would be relaunching verification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UbDY7I"&gt;Some of the new changes include more lax profile information requirements to be eligible for verification, more granular and defined categories for verification badges, and new guidelines around when a verified account may lose its blue checkmark if inactive or if found in violation of Twitter’s policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vFbDmC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;thank you to everyone who shared feedback - we got over 22,000 responses to our survey which helped us make significant changes to the policy you see today&lt;/p&gt;— B (@iamb) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iamb/status/1339649561996918785?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k9P9uT"&gt;At some point next year, Twitter plans to introduce a way to label accounts that are either automated or once belonging to a person who has died. “We are not planning to automatically remove the verified badge from inactive accounts of people who are no longer living, and are working on building a way to memorialize these accounts in 2021,” reads Twitter’s blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GiPVO8"&gt;Twitter says “this will also come with an updated policy for memorialization and a new application flow to request the memorialization of an account,” while automated accounts will at some point in the future be differentiated from human-run ones “to make it easier for people to know what’s a bot and what’s not.” Twitter isn’t yet disclosing what these labels will look like or how proactively it will enforce its label requirement on bot accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vTseaL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter is planning new labels for automated and memorial accounts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gPxRtK"&gt;For human-run accounts, the company says as long as the account holder makes changes before January 20th to bring the account in line with its new verification requirements, there’s no risk of losing an existing badge. Those include ensuring an account has a verified email address or phone number, a profile image, and a display name. The company also plans to inform individuals at risk of losing their badge what they need to change to keep it before it takes action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kondGk"&gt;Twitter is reserving the right to remove verification. “Under our policy, we may also remove verification from accounts that are found to be in severe or repeated violation of the Twitter Rules. We will continue to evaluate such accounts on a case-by-case basis, and will make improvements in 2021 on the relationship between enforcement of our rules and verification,” the blog post continues. “As always, everyone on Twitter is subject to the Twitter Rules, and you can read more about our range of enforcement actions here.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiQnAl"&gt;For users who want to apply to be verified, Twitter will launch a new “self-serve application process” within the app that will let applicants select a category for verification and confirming their identity. Twitter says it will use both human review and an automated system to wade through requests starting on January 20th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tenet is a complete misfire </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gyV7g36ptM374JnFiTBi0rX1kRg=/231x124:1209x776/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68544016/Screen_Shot_2020_12_17_at_3.20.15_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Warner Bros.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ilGjLJ"&gt;Christopher Nolan’s success is the sort of paradox that would be at the center of a Christopher Nolan movie. His films — often characterized as puzzle boxes — are meticulous works that walk the line between indulgent labyrinths and satisfying spectacle. They’re brainier than any superhero movie would dare to be, but they still find comparable success. This blue chip status has made Nolan the patron saint of guys who say, “I like movies that make you &lt;em&gt;think,” &lt;/em&gt;even if said thinking is just a question with an extremely clear answer — like “Was the Joker right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vou2ij"&gt;Nolan’s films occupy a unique space in pop culture. The director of &lt;em&gt;The Dark Knight&lt;/em&gt; is one of the only filmmakers in Hollywood who is able to make an original nonfranchise film and have it be as big as &lt;em&gt;The Dark Knight&lt;/em&gt;. This makes it fascinating when a movie like &lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;comes along because &lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;is a complete misfire that underlines how charmed the director’s career has been. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z0Ke2i"&gt;Laid out on paper, though? &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; sounds awesome. The film follows a man known only as The Protagonist (John David Washington), a CIA agent who finds himself on the hunt for an arms dealer with an unusual weapon: bullets that fire backward through time. It’s called “inversion,” and with the right hardware, it can be done to anything, including cars and people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwYM4V"&gt;Inversion is the hinge on which &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt;’s mind-bending twists pivot. Unfortunately, it’s quite poorly explained (“Don’t try to understand it,” one character says, helpfully), and while it leads to some &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; action — an early fight scene between an “inverted” character and a “normal” one absolutely rules — the obfuscated plot robs the movie’s showstoppers of badly needed momentum. These scenes are few and far between, anchored by characters who are more puzzle pieces than people. There’s very little to hold on to as you hope for &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; good to pop up in the movie’s 2.5-hour runtime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7nU4AG"&gt;Some bright spots: Robert Pattinson, who plays the Protagonist’s handler, Neil, is tremendously fun to watch, even if he’s not in the film much. (He’ll make a great Batman.) Likewise, Elizabeth Debicki is terrific as a player in the movie’s espionage plot, but she’s mostly reduced to a damsel in distress. And the whole thing is set in remarkably drab locales; the film goes &lt;em&gt;so many &lt;/em&gt;places but loves none of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bT2d3n"&gt;That’s perhaps the biggest disappointment of &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt;: it wants to be an unusually clever spy film, but Nolan isn’t terribly invested in the fun of spy movies. You know: cool outfits, flashy gear, people pushed to their absolute limit and managing to wear it incredibly well. And because the mechanics of the film’s plot require a lot of explanation just to follow what people are doing in a scene, it’s very easy to miss &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; they’re doing it. This is a shame because the reason for all this time-warping and subterfuge is actually compelling as hell!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUM7aZ"&gt;Just so we’re clear: I am &lt;em&gt;pretty good&lt;/em&gt; at watching movies. I’ve put in my 10,000 hours, per Malcolm Gladwell’s absolutely airtight metrics, and that makes me an expert. Yet, I was still confused by the time the credits rolled. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing. One of the beautiful things about movies is how they can immerse us in stories that are bigger than us that defy easy comprehension. What unmoors me is the nature of my confusion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gojs7b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;is a film that explicitly encourages you to feel a thing and not think about it, but it  doesn’t offer any emotional anchors. It’s a disorientation that comes when you don’t feel you’re in the hands of someone with complete control over the narrative. You might be able to call some twists before they happen, but even if you do, it’s no more satisfying than a coin toss. Sure, you may have been right. But unless you had money on it, does it matter?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGxFCc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;is an absolute mess of a movie that stumbles doing all of the things I like about Christopher Nolan films. Directors are allowed missteps, obviously — this one is even pretty humanizing — but the whole situation is complicated by the circumstances surrounding the film’s release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MnM9p2"&gt;For months, &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; was Hollywood’s last holdout, delayed three times in the hopes that it might somehow have a blockbuster release even as the COVID-19 pandemic showed absolutely no signs of abating and other studios pushed their releases into 2021. That means, in some ways, &lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;was seen as a foregone conclusion. It was an ambitious film from Christopher Nolan, the guy who turned a cerebral romp like &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt; into legitimately popular culture; &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; would offer the pleasures and profits his filmography is known for, with a fiercely loyal following buoying ticket sales even amid a pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4k9I1"&gt;But now we know how the story ends. &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; is now available to buy on-demand, and it earned very little at the box office when it was released over Labor Day weekend — even as it kept movie theaters open and hemorrhaging money. The movie business leveraged all of its goodwill and hype in the service of Keeping Movies Alive by worsening a public health emergency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13L2GX"&gt;The quality of the movie does not change the immoral nature of a release strategy like this, but knowing Hollywood wanted me to risk getting terribly sick to see this goddamn mess? It’s insulting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New colors for the Galaxy S21 revealed in leaked renders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ILfqckS7PBJHh8BH58EZVZMDSE=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68544014/video_image_53PZcZnf_.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="00IONF"&gt;Samsung’s new Galaxy S21 line will come in several new colors, according to leaked press renders &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120106.html"&gt;acquired by &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Based on the images, the new colors will include light purple / violet, gray, black, white, and rosy pink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yIKuWd"&gt;Some of the colors will be limited to specific phones in the S21 line, &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-specs-and-features-of-samsungs-galaxy-s21-smartphones/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung will also apparently add the word “Phantom” to the front of each color, maybe to reflect their more muted look. It’s rumored that the base 6.2-inch S21 will be available in phantom violet, phantom pink, phantom gray, and phantom white. Meanwhile the 6.7-inch S21 Plus will offer phantom gray, phantom black, and phantom violet. Finally, the high-end 6.8-inch S21 Ultra will come in just two colors, phantom black and phantom silver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7iNVNv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10239755"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HKhEU2"&gt;The camera bump for these new phones appears to be part of the metal rail that runs along the edge, and it will feature metallic finishes that pair with the new colors. &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; also dug up some &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120114.html"&gt;renders of the S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; that give a pretty good look at the back of the device, which appears to be loaded with cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BtRoS2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10239876"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6T0ttn"&gt;Along with the leaked images, both &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt; say that the S21 Ultra will offer S Pen support. We received confirmation that the S Pen would be expanding beyond the Note based on &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-defies-one-size-fits-all-mobile-experiences/"&gt;a blog Samsung shared&lt;/a&gt;, but now we have a slightly better idea where it will head first. It’s rumored that the S Pen will be sold separately, and Samsung will reportedly offer a case it can be slotted into for phones that don’t feature the Note’s S Pen slot. Even with the rumored change, Samsung says the Galaxy Note will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22177972/galaxy-note-21-still-happening-yonhap"&gt;sticking around for now&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDT22A"&gt;We essentially now have a full picture of what Samsung’s new Galaxy line will bring in January. To highlight just a few features &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/11/14/exclusive-specs-and-features-of-samsungs-galaxy-s21-smartphones/"&gt;A&lt;em&gt;ndroid Police &lt;/em&gt;has collected&lt;/a&gt;, there’ll be 5G and Wi-Fi 6 support across the line, a range of battery sizes from 4,000mAh to 5,000mAh, and a new Snapdragon 888 or Exynos 2100 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BRceB"&gt;Samsung’s event, where these new Galaxy phones and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180111/galaxy-buds-pro-360-view-samsung-wireless"&gt;leaked new Galaxy Buds&lt;/a&gt; will likely make an appearance, is set for January (with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167208/samsung-galaxy-s21-january-14th-launch-india-plus-ultra-s-pen"&gt;a rumored January 14th launch&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tL2uym"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tK0LbEtEShHQh97Hs1ENU1d_fQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/bking_200322_3945_0023.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the most affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Sometimes, there just isn’t a deal happening. In that case, we’ve mentioned how much the most recent sale price was for, so you know when to take the plunge. But most of the time, there’s some sort of deal going on, be it on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think is worth telling you about, you’ll find it mentioned with any and all context you need to hear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rFr0TF"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="iPad 2020 review: here we go again, again|95745" data-volume-uuid="d243cb26d" data-volume-id="95745" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-699" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the tablet with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="T559mJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new 2020 iPad isn’t enough for Zoom school","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;Currently, you can get the base iPad with 128GB of storage for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J61NFNR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$380 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, carrying forth the same 7.9-inch display and design from previous iterations with refreshed internal specs within. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad. Apple makes a 64GB and 256GB model of the iPad mini with Wi-Fi support, set at $400 and $500, respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="X7SsrD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple’s new iPad mini is a terrific small tablet with no competition","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QD0sMe"&gt;Sales on this model are a little rarer, but you can buy the 64GB iPad Mini in gold for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PQ8VVG4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$350 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, or for $394 at &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1468029-REG%2Fapple_muqy2ll_a_7_9_ipad_mini_early.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18282956/apple-ipad-air-2019-review-ios-features-specs-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Air (2019 &amp;amp; 2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to last year’s 10.5-inch display and features thinner bezels around the display and has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, which is located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;

The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. However, the model that also supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzykEb"&gt;If you’re looking for the latest iPad model, B&amp;amp;H Photo has select colors on sale. You can get the 64GB configuration in &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594485-REG%2Fapple_myfn2ll_a_10_9_ipad_air_wi_fi.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Silver for only $569&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594484-REG%2Fapple_myfm2ll_a_10_9_ipad_airwi_fi_64gb.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Space Gray model for $579&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="oBFocq"&gt;If you don’t mind the last generation model, Best Buy is discounting the 3rd Gen 2019 iPad Air by &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724958762425958680" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$70 off for the 64GB model&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $430. Or, you can get a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724958787565478388" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model, which is down to $600&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the one that came in 2018, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less-expensive models, this one ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also has Face ID to unlock instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor and has a high refresh display. The iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, and that comes through in the price. &lt;/p&gt;

Each size supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec model going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge orders Tim Cook and Craig Federighi to testify in Epic’s Fortnite case</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q5ZZTi"&gt;The latest development in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;ongoing lawsuit between Epic Games and Apple&lt;/a&gt; over the iPhone maker’s App Store policies and its removal of the iOS version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;is a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F488521365%2FApple-Versus-Epic-Federighi-Must-Testify%23from_embed&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F17%2F22187339%2Fepic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-testimony-tim-cook-craig-federighi#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new order&lt;/a&gt; from Judge Thomas Hixson outlining rules for Apple CEO Tim Cook and software engineering chief Craig Federighi’s testimony in the case. The court order, spotted on Thursday by &lt;a href="https://www.imore.com/apple-must-hand-over-craig-federighi-documents-epic-games-lawsuit-court-rules?utm_source=im_tw&amp;amp;utm_medium=tw_card&amp;amp;utm_content=72410&amp;amp;utm_campaign=social"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iMore&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/20/12/17/judge-orders-tim-cook-and-craig-federighi-to-testify-in-epic-case"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, gives us our first glimpse into how Apple’s executive leadership may be involved in the ongoing antitrust lawsuit, which is scheduled to go to trial as early as July of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AuKda0"&gt;The order, issued on Wednesday following a December 15th hearing, says Apple will not be able to limit Cook’s testimony to four hours, as the company had sought. Only after Apple provides the necessary documents requested by Epic’s lawyers on the App Store’s operations can the length of testimony be determined, the order states. Hixon also shot down a request from Apple to replace Federighi with one of his lieutenants, Erik Neuenschwander.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qU9Y2q"&gt;“The Court rules for Plaintiffs and orders Apple to make Federighi a document custodian instead of Neuenschwander. First, Plaintiffs have shown that Federighi is a higher-level decision maker whose documents are more likely to go to the heart of Apple’s business justification defense,” reads the order. “Second, if Plaintiffs have guessed wrong, and Federighi’s documents are not as relevant as Neuenschwander’s are, that hurts Plaintiffs. Assuming the requests are relevant and proportional, it is up to Plaintiffs to decide what discovery they want to take to prove their claims, and if they make bad choices, that’s their problem.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BoQxdL"&gt;The case is still in the preliminary stages, and much of the public back-and-forth criticism from Apple and Epic that erupted in August has quieted as both sides’ lawyers have begun preparing for the next stages of the lawsuit. An upcoming deadline for new filings is set for January 6th, 2021 with a hearing two days later. &lt;/p&gt;
