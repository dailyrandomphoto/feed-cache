    <title>Android 101: how to free up space on your phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s_tKj4Zu4bODR5smc6AEbt_v0Lw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70027682/acastro_180413_1777_android_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IzRTjs"&gt;It can happen all too easily, especially if you’ve got an Android phone with less than 128GB of storage: one day, you try to install a cool new game or an intriguing new app, and you can’t. You’ve run out of space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uoqml5"&gt;Don’t panic. If you’re not ready to buy a new phone, and your phone doesn’t have a handy microSD slot for some extra storage, you can probably still pick up a decent amount of free space with some simple house cleaning. Here are some suggestions on how to get back some of that storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eiWtyM"&gt;Note: These were tested using a Pixel 3 phone running Android 12. Depending on your phone’s make and operating system, your directions may vary slightly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GnNVLi"&gt;Use Android’s “Free up space” tool&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xuRMFJ"&gt;Android has a built-in tool to help you increase the amount of useable storage on your phone. It’s easy to find:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="TKpz8N"&gt;Go to your phone’s settings, and select “Storage.” You’ll see information on how much space is in use and a list of file categories.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kyOaXr"&gt;Tap on the “Free up space” button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DD4kWK"&gt;You’ll be moved to Google’s Files app — specifically, to its “Clean” feature, which offers suggestions on how to free up space by getting rid of junk files, deleted screenshots, large photos, backed-up media, and unused apps; there may be other suggestions as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap on the “Free up space” button to help clean up your phone’s storage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MtE_I-qwQ4dYONX_tSzTN2bQ9ao=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944616/Screenshot_20211021_101947.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Free up space” button can help clean up your phone’s storage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Files app can offer a number of ways to clear out old files." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RCGLmGszvbcKznMaBGpRZ5D21dI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944618/Screenshot_20211021_102518.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Files app can offer a number of ways to clear out old files.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gCo26D"&gt;There are other handy tools in the “Storage” section. For example, you can find out how much space each of your apps takes up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xxSLLB"&gt;In Storage, tap on Apps. You’ll get a list of all your apps, along with how much space each is taking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vMLIW5"&gt;Tap on the app name. You can now see the app size, how much of the available storage is being used by user data, and how much space is being used by the cache. Two buttons let you either “Clear storage” or “Clear cache.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In Storage &amp;amp;gt; Apps, you can see how much space apps take up." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q5vRn88E-Mh0tgJh57uGkq-__kw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944644/Screenshot_20211021_103604.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In Storage &amp;gt; Apps, you can see how much space apps take up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s a good idea to clear your cache to save space." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rURyrDAFS7hX86azSGySFMopMJg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944647/Screenshot_20211021_103415__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a good idea to clear your cache to save space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MuovL5"&gt;(Note for newbies: it is usually safe to clear the cache. However, before you hit “Clear storage,” check to see what your user data is. You don’t want to accidentally delete any important media or documents.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HyaVI"&gt;Finally, there is a hidden toggle for a feature called “Smart Storage,” which gives your phone permission to automatically remove backed-up photos after 60 days. It will also automatically remove backed-up photos and videos if the storage on your device has less than 25 percent space left. You turn it on (or off) via Google’s Files app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zTA1bh"&gt;Open the Files app and tap the three parallel lines in the upper left corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="X5eehG"&gt;Select Settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CFCEX5"&gt;Look for the Smart Storage setting and toggle it on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to the Settings for the Files app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fCLizfkd2YJew9Jum2uJfYX15Tg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944706/Screenshot_20211021_110015.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to the Settings for the Files app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Toggle Smart Storage on." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Unp5i_gHMXB4-8zdvf9rgl8gLaA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944708/Screenshot_20211021_105955.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toggle Smart Storage on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DVu23o"&gt;Check your apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LfqXSH"&gt;A good way to save space is to make sure you’re not clogging up the works with apps that you haven’t used in months. It’s all too easy to download an app, try it out, and then let it sit while you go on to other things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dU6ZS4"&gt;If you’re curious about how long it’s been since you’ve used certain apps, here’s how to find out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="hulp9E"&gt;Tap on your Play Store app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QEVczG"&gt;Tap on your personal icon in the upper right corner and select “Manage apps &amp;amp; device.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PAFbZt"&gt;Select the Manage tab. On the line below that, the Installed button should be highlighted; if it isn’t, tap on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cDSWR8"&gt;To the right of the Apps heading, you’ll see the sorting icon. Tap on that and select “Least used.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BSQKva"&gt;Now, you can see the apps that you’ve only used occasionally (if at all) on top of the list. You won’t necessarily want to get rid of them — sometimes an app is fine to have around just in case — but you might catch some that you really don’t need anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Files app helps you manage all the apps on your phone." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/avt6qS7iG2hmSSYxa3QIksBQtfI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944742/Screenshot_20211021_111012.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Files app helps you manage all the apps on your phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can sort your apps by the least used." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zYuGF4Ymka3C3_OyTyJpETLH3DI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944744/Screenshot_20211021_111215.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can sort your apps by the least used.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xb0HvW"&gt;Store your photos online&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XMjVh5"&gt;Photos and videos can be some of the most space-hogging items on your phone. Luckily, if you’ve got an Android phone, you’re probably already uploading your photos to Google Photos — and can therefore take them off your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOb173"&gt;First, check to make sure you &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; backing up your photos to your Google account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Uc7FJR"&gt;Open the Photos app. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6oS59e"&gt;Tap on your personal icon in the upper right corner. If you’re backing up your photos, you should see a “Backup complete” entry in the drop-down menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wt5x8P"&gt;If you’re not backing up your photos, then select “Photos settings” &amp;gt; “Back up &amp;amp; sync.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gUql0a"&gt;Make sure that the “Back up &amp;amp; sync” toggle on top of the page is set to “On.” You should also check which account is listed under “Backup Account.” If you have more than one account, you can switch to whichever you want to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If your phone is not backing up your photos, go to Settings &amp;amp;gt; Back up &amp;amp;amp; sync. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yTz95_E-c2wHG6cVWa8nd64KsTg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945196/Screenshot_20211021_112556.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If your phone is not backing up your photos, go to Settings &amp;gt; Back up &amp;amp; sync. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Toggle “Back up &amp;amp;amp; sync” on." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fqDamRNGTmSfAsAVqlXSkeWfLuU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945198/Screenshot_20211021_112627.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toggle “Back up &amp;amp; sync” on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dZTR3V"&gt;There are other options as well. For example, you can choose the quality of the photos you want to upload and whether you want the phone to upload photos when you’re using cellular data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFP21g"&gt;Now that you’re sure your photos are being backed up, you can delete them from your phone. It’s very likely that there is already a notice on top of the Photo app’s front page offering to free up memory from your device; if not, it’s easy to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ceuxav"&gt;In the “Photo settings” menu, tap on “Free up device storage.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JMW25G"&gt;You’ll get a window saying how much memory and how many items will be removed. Select the “Free up XX” at the bottom of the page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll be told how much space you’ll free up." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hyHqVsxGVY2994HzZxSEkf0s0F8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945214/Screenshot_20211021_113030.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll be told how much space you’ll free up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Keeping your photos in the cloud will save space on your phone." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RGYWF6Z2DNaB-LmPOeXnMjD5JQQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945215/Screenshot_20211021_134620.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Keeping your photos in the cloud will save space on your phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TliatA"&gt;Still running out of space? Then, unfortunately — or luckily, if you’re looking for a good excuse — it may be time to start thinking about a new phone, one with more storage space and perhaps that also offers you the chance to offload your data onto a micro-SD card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dt8xtE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 21st, 2021, 2:15PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on August 9th, 2019, and has been updated to account for changes in Android.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘Driverless’ Tesla crash in Texas wasn’t actually driverless, NTSB says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xl3-hCrsb_gAZ1VkSHIL22lLMZ8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70027558/EzRSmWwVUAQVVNj__1_.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/MattKHOU/status/1383821809053683721/photo/1" target="_blank"&gt;Matt Dougherty/KHOU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WmluZv"&gt;The driver and passenger seats were both occupied in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/18/22390612/two-people-killed-fiery-tesla-crash-no-driver"&gt;Tesla Model S that crashed into a tree outside of Houston on April 17th&lt;/a&gt;, killing both occupants, according to the National Transportation Safety Board. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Dk4k3"&gt;The crash made news when local investigators on the scene initially reported that neither body recovered from the Telsa was behind the wheel. Mark Herman, a constable from Harris County Precinct 4, &lt;a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/tesla-spring-crash-fire/285-c28a4993-5b5f-43f4-a924-e39638390647"&gt;told KHOU&lt;/a&gt; that one of the men killed was in the front passenger seat of the car, while the other was in the back seat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iy202e"&gt;“They are 100 percent certain that no one was in the driver seat driving that vehicle at the time of impact. They are positive,” Herman told KHOU.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AyldHH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391890/tesla-driverless-crash-texas-nhtsa-investigation"&gt;Federal investigators quickly swooped in&lt;/a&gt; to determine the accuracy of the claim. NTSB, which investigates civilian transportation crashes, sent two officials to Texas to examine the crash, with a particular focus on “the vehicle’s operation and the post-crash fire.” Tesla also sent representatives from the company to inspect the crash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1LNrZi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Almost immediately, the claim that no one was behind the wheel seemed to fall apart&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jGJupe"&gt;Almost immediately, the claim that no one was behind the wheel seemed to fall apart. Tesla CEO Elon Musk claimed that “data logs recovered so far” indicated that Autopilot was not engaged, nor had the vehicle owner purchased the company’s “Full Self-Driving” option that may have allowed the use of Autopilot on local roads. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404677/tesla-texas-crash-driver-seat-earnings-musk"&gt;And the company’s own inspectors determined&lt;/a&gt; that the steering wheel was “deformed,” leading them to conclude there was someone in the driver’s seat at the time of the crash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCDQ6Q"&gt;Also, security camera footage from the vehicle owner’s home captured him entering the driver’s side door, while his companion got in on the passenger side. And NTSB crash investigators tested whether Tesla’s Autopilot would work on the part of the road, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429198/tesla-ntsb-texas-crash-driverless-preliminary-report"&gt;concluding&lt;/a&gt; that adaptive cruise control could be engaged but not Tesla’s Autosteer feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5VI9Gc"&gt;Now, the agency has released a &lt;a href="https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/HWY21FH007.aspx"&gt;new preliminary report&lt;/a&gt; further refuting the claim that the driver seat was unoccupied at the time of the crash. According to the document:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="JTwCj4"&gt;With the assistance of the [event data recorder] module manufacturer, the NTSB Recorders Laboratory repaired and downloaded the fire-damaged EDR. Data from the module indicate that both the driver and the passenger seats were occupied, and that the seat belts were buckled when the EDR recorded the crash. The data also indicate that the driver was applying the accelerator in the time leading up to the crash; application of the accelerator pedal was found to be as high as 98.8 percent. The highest speed recorded by the EDR in the 5 seconds leading up to the crash was 67 mph.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gEluJU"&gt;NTSB said that its investigation was still in the preliminary stage and that “no conclusions about how the crash happened should be drawn from the information in this investigative update.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o9j0yv"&gt;The fears of a driverless Tesla crash are certainly justified. Tesla owners have shown that Autopilot can be used on roads without lane markings, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397546/tesla-autopilot-consumer-report-test-no-driver"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; recently conducted a test&lt;/a&gt; proving that Tesla’s vehicles can easily be tricked into thinking there is someone behind the wheel, even when there’s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZPIGF"&gt;Tesla finds itself under more scrutiny than ever, with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the middle of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724171/nhtsa-tesla-letters-fsd-beta-autopilot-recall-emergency-vehicles"&gt;investigation into a dozen incidents&lt;/a&gt; in which Teslas with Autopilot have crashed into emergency vehicles. And two prominent Senate Democrats have urged federal regulators to take “corrective actions” against Tesla to prevent further misuse of the company’s advanced driver assist feature. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Locke and Key’s second season is darker but loses the magic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ejyuc1y4qcVuPx5UqLLyS6V3KQg=/5x0:3596x2394/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70027482/LOCKE_201_Unit_01644RC.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amanda Matlovich / Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="slQvXy"&gt;Netflix’s show about teens fighting demons with magical keys is back, but &lt;em&gt;Locke and Key&lt;/em&gt;’s second season makes some big changes. The pace is faster, the tone is darker, and with that, it loses some of the magic that made the show so interesting in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3TZGj6"&gt;Things don’t start out so dark, though. At the outset of &lt;em&gt;Locke and Key&lt;/em&gt;’s second season, things are going well for the Locke family. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126612/netflix-locke-and-key-new-series-riverdale-haunting-of-hill-house-review"&gt;After dealing with the death of their father and surviving a fight with a demon in season 1&lt;/a&gt;, they’re able to spend the summer relaxing with friends and their keys. It’s one of the rare times in the series we see magic used for having fun; Kinsey (Emilia Jones) is relaxing inside her own head (literally), and younger brother Bodie (Jackson Robert Scott) is using a new super-strength key to rearrange old furniture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FqcvFT"&gt;It’s playful and surreal — but it doesn’t last for long. Eventually, the demon makes its return, and the rest of the season feels like a race as the Locke kids try to defeat it. The new season is certainly darker than its predecessor, and it delves a little more into the history of magic in this world. But it also moves too fast for its own good. Whereas season 1 was about introducing mystery, the sophomore effort is more like a drawn-out superhero battle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hiAyEd"&gt;For those just catching up, &lt;em&gt;Locke and Key&lt;/em&gt; is a live-action adaptation of a comic series by Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodríguez, which follows the Locke family as they move back into their ancestral home, called Keyhouse, in New England. It’s a sprawling mansion with an extremely cool secret: it’s full of hidden magical keys, each with strange powers. One makes it possible to enter someone’s mind as if it were a real, physical place; another lets you open a door to anywhere you can picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AlErgM"&gt;The Locke children — which include Kinsey, Bodie, and older brother Tyler (Connor Jessup) — hear these keys whisper to them and steadily accumulate an arsenal of supernatural abilities. The keys themselves are made from a strange metal that comes from a hidden portal (stay with me here), which &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; happens to be home to demons that can occasionally crossover to our world. The first season mostly involved one such creature, named Dodge, trying to get the keys from the Lockes for all kinds of nefarious purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bITITK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j6bsSANYz14?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UcC9JR"&gt;At the outset of season 2, everyone thinks Dodge has been defeated, but — as the twist at the end of the first season revealed — it’s actually just in a different body, thanks to one of those helpful keys. In the first season, Dodge was primarily depicted as a terrifying woman (Laysla De Oliveira) but also occasionally took on the role of an unassuming high school boy Gabe (Griffin Gluck), who &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; happens to be Kinsey’s boyfriend. While everyone thinks Dodge is gone, Gabe is hatching a plan to create an army of demons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OcyDOx"&gt;While the basic premise is the same — i.e., the kids need to defeat Dodge — the two seasons play out very differently. The first felt like a mashup of the teen drama of &lt;em&gt;Riverdale&lt;/em&gt; and the dark, family mysteries from something like &lt;em&gt;The Haunting of Hill House&lt;/em&gt;. You slowly learned the secrets of the keys and how they impacted the Lockes and their closest friends. Season 2 gets into that a little bit, particularly with some flashbacks that shed light on the early days of Keyhouse and details on how, exactly, the keys were made. But mostly, it feels like a race: Gabe rushing to create his army and the kids trying to stop him. It’s chaotic. And the fast pace means the show gets away from the best parts of the story, namely all of the deep, dark secrets involving the keys and the portal to the demon world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ue0djC"&gt;Even the newly introduced keys seem off. Instead of opening up new possibilities for storytelling — like the key that turns you into a ghost so you can talk to dead relatives — they feel more like superpowers. One gives you super strength; another is essentially a living chain that can be used as a weapon. Quite handy for dealing with demon teens but not as interesting as delving into someone’s subconscious. It also doesn’t help that the new villain is nowhere near as intimidating as the original. De Oliveira’s take on Dodge was ruthless and menacing, an impeccably dressed monster you definitely didn’t want to mess with. But Gabe has a very different vibe: less scary, more a pompous jerk you want to punch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="locke and key" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lXAGvhwG3PmEnKQmZwyR2rh9MSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944709/LOCKE_207_Unit_03076RC.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amanda Matlovich / Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ezUMe7"&gt;There are some cool ideas here. As the kids get older, they start reckoning with the reality that they’ll forget about magic as soon as they turn 18. And then are some very dark, horror-like moments that are reminiscent of the books; one particularly terrifying scene involves living mannequins inside of a demon’s mind, and there’s at least one shockingly grisly murder. But most of these moments are fleeting or frustratingly underdeveloped, like a story thread involving a history teacher who knows a little too much about the Lockes that never really goes anywhere. For the most part, all of these interesting moments are reduced to clear and obvious steps leading to the final confrontation at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YjqQn4"&gt;It’s disappointing to see the show shift away from its most intriguing elements, and unfortunately, it doesn’t seem like things will change. Season 3 of &lt;em&gt;Locke and Key&lt;/em&gt; has already wrapped filming, and based on the way the current season ends, there’s going to be yet another big bad to fight. Hopefully, it brings some secrets along for the ride.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJYK8O"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Locke and Key &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;season 2 streams on Netflix on October 22nd.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mythic Quest has been renewed for a third and fourth season on Apple TV Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZesWIdHd6kd8wvk5PDQMwHjrSGw=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70027359/Apple_TV_Mythic_Quest_key_art.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6LIYC1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt; has been &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2021/10/apple-tv-doubles-down-on-mythic-quest-renewing-acclaimed-workplace-comedy-for-seasons-three-and-four/"&gt;renewed for a third and fourth season&lt;/a&gt; on Apple TV Plus, Apple announced today, marking the biggest commitment yet to one of its streaming originals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6HkIjX"&gt;The show stars Rob McElhenney (who co-created the series) as Ian Grimm, the ambitious and self-centered creative director of a popular fictional video game, along with Charlotte Nicdao as Poppy Li, the lead engineer and co-creative director who works — and often fights — with Grimm over the direction of the titular &lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt; game. The show’s ensemble cast also features Murray Abraham, Danny Pudi, Imani Hakim, Ashly Burch, Jessie Ennis, and David Hornsby as members of the game’s development, creative, and testing teams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MAJnul"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;BREAKING: Big announcement from Sir Anthony Hopkins and Jason Sudeikis (and Ron something) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MythicQuest?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MythicQuest&lt;/a&gt; is returning for Seasons 3 &amp;amp; 4 &lt;a href="https://t.co/OugCaIWwjv"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OugCaIWwjv&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Apple TV (@AppleTV) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppleTV/status/1451243133031915521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gd876H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt;’s first season debuted on Apple TV Plus in February 2020, but Apple had already ordered the second season before the show even aired. Since then, the series has become one of Apple TV Plus’ biggest hits and, with today’s announcement, will be the first Apple-created show to be ordered for a fourth season so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aR1o4A"&gt;Apple’s announcement didn’t put an exact timing for &lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt;’s third season beyond a “2022” date, although the company did note that it would arrive “before Ted Lasso season three.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s driving data storage system hacked by Dutch investigators </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2KViZV9NcMeUgVHgFG-zlOk4GWw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70027174/acastro_180524_1777_tesla_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pp2iiW"&gt;A team of Dutch forensic researchers have decrypted Tesla’s data storage system, providing access to a trove of information that could be useful in crash investigations. (The news was first reported by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B2tOTV"&gt;It’s no secret that Tesla records information about its customers’ driving behavior, both to improve its advanced driver assistance system, Autopilot, and also in the event of a crash, to provide to investigators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXcYeU"&gt;But researchers at the &lt;a href="https://www.forensischinstituut.nl/actueel/nieuws/2021/10/21/opgeslagen-data-in-autos-bevatten-een-schat-aan-informatie-voor-strafrechtelijke-onderzoeken"&gt;Netherlands Forensic Institute (NFI) discovered&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla’s vehicles store far more detailed data than previously known, including speed, accelerator pedal position, steering wheel angle, and brake usage. Some of this data can be stored for up to a year, the institute said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AqRfIV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;speed, accelerator pedal position, steering wheel angle, and brake usage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dgfmhX"&gt;The team was investigating a crash involving a Tesla with Autopilot in use that had rear-ended another vehicle after it braked unexpectedly. Rather than seek the data from Tesla, the Dutch investigators chose to “reverse engineer” the company’s data logs in order to “objectively” assess them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mIxi4O"&gt;“These data contain a wealth of information for forensic investigators and traffic accident analysts and can help with a criminal investigation after a fatal traffic accident or an accident with injury,” Francis Hoogendijk, a digital investigator at the NFI, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjCdSa"&gt;The NFI said that even though Tesla has complied with data requests from the government in the past, the company also left out a lot of data that could have proven useful. “Tesla however only supplies a specific subset of signals, only the ones requested, for a specific timeframe, whereas the log files contain all the recorded signals,” the NFI’s report said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OQlEMR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The news of the hack could have implications for US investigators&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jNlYFS"&gt;The news of the hack could have implications for US investigators who are probing a dozen incidents of crashes involving Tesla vehicles and emergency vehicles while Autopilot is in use. A spokesperson for the National Traffics Highway Safety Administration did not immediately reply to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4jxAWm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Tesla and Waymo are tackling a major problem for self-driving cars: data","url":"https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2018/4/19/17204044/tesla-waymo-self-driving-car-data-simulation"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pJnDBp"&gt;Tesla encrypts its data to protect it from rival manufacturers. Tesla owners can request their own data from the company, including camera footage, in the event of a crash. Tesla also runs Autopilot in something it calls &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/19/13341194/tesla-autopilot-shadow-mode-autonomous-regulations"&gt;“shadow mode”&lt;/a&gt; that allows the company to gather statistical data on false positives and false negatives. In shadow mode, the car isn’t taking any action, but it registers when it would have taken action — which allows the company’s engineering team to see if the autonomous mode would have avoided crashes when they take place.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OGFsiB"&gt;The Dutch team said it was helpful to have a broader scope of data from Tesla’s vehicles, especially as cars become more like other digital products with the ability to log and store important information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hEhSv"&gt;“It would be good if this data would become available more often for forensic investigations,” Hoogendijk said. “Now that we know what kind of data can be obtained from a Tesla, certain data can be requested even more specifically for the purpose of finding the truth after an accident.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SotKOT"&gt;Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment. The company dissolved its press office and hasn’t responded to media inquiries in over two years. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s futuristic Zephyr mask is available today, starting at $99.99</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Zephyr" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LAqlogDyI9dvfzvaA6onGLbVROo=/1x0:4378x2918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70027119/zephyrhero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Zephyr is apparently light enough to accompany you on a jog, assuming you want some extra attention.&lt;/em&gt; | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pPqGQJ"&gt;Razer’s Zephyr face mask is available to the public after several months of tweaking features and beta testing with Razer super fans. You can purchase it starting tonight at 11PM ET / 8PM PT from &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgear-accessories%2Frazer-zephyr%2Fbuy&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer.com&lt;/a&gt; in two configurations. The most basic kit for $99.99 includes the mask, a carrying tote, a USB-C charging cable, anti-fog spray, and three sets of replaceable N95 filters that will cover you for nine days of use. If you want more filters included with your purchase, a $149.99 version includes everything mentioned above, plus 33 sets of filters for 99 days of filtered use. You can purchase filters by themselves in sets of 10 for $29.99, which will get you 30 days of use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhU72f"&gt;The Zephyr is a completely different kind of product for Razer and could be one of its most important yet. The brand is known mostly for its gaming accessories and PC components that serve to entertain, but the Zephyr mask is aimed at keeping people healthier (while no less lit up with RGB LEDs). It made for a slightly perplexing — but nevertheless big — reception for CES 2021 since the company has historically shown off gaming-related concepts like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/6/14196190/razer-project-valerie-video-photos-ces-2017"&gt;three-screened laptop&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/7/5285130/razer-reveals-project-christine-the-concept-gaming-pc-even-a-toddler"&gt;gorgeous, modular desktop concept&lt;/a&gt;, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Zephyr" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k_1HmiixTb3AAymExwknzWxCi-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22942593/zephyrsmoke.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer says that if you spend a prolonged period of time in a higher-risk setting, like an indoor location, change the Zephyr’s filters as soon as possible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7DvjmH"&gt;Some saw the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22221344/razer-project-hazel-n95-respirator-mask-coronavirus-chroma-rgb-concept"&gt;Zephyr’s announcement in January&lt;/a&gt; as a play to capitalize on a global crisis. It didn’t help Razer’s case that it didn’t initially have any certification to prove that the mask would be safe to use in a pandemic — and it still doesn’t. The mask is FDA-registered, which basically means that the FDA is aware that this product exists, not that the agency is backing the Zephyr’s effectiveness. Razer says it isn’t a medical device or personal protective equipment (PPE), and it hasn’t been specifically tested against COVID-19. The company hasn’t shared whether it’s seeking further approval. It’s being marketed now as an air purifier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFeD7A"&gt;It says its filters are N95-grade and have 99 percent BFE (bacteria filtration efficiency). It claims that the mask can filter 99 percent of air particles that are 0.3 microns in size. Notably, the company says that it offers this level of protection for air that you breathe in, as well as for air that you breathe out. As for whether that means it can block COVID-19 particles, &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/factcheck/2020/06/11/fact-check-n-95-filters-not-too-large-stop-covid-19-particles/5343537002/"&gt;the answer is a little complicated&lt;/a&gt;. The virus particles are smaller than 0.3 microns, but that post linked from &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt; says they usually bond to much larger molecules, like water. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9L6eM"&gt;To install the filters, you simply remove the magnetically attached caps of the two air valves and slot in a filter with the black section facing the mask. There’s one more filter that gets inserted underneath the see-through plastic window. Each set of N95-grade filters can be used for up to 72 hours before they’re no longer effective at filtration. Razer says that if you spend a prolonged period of time in a high-risk environment, such as an indoor location, you should replace the filters as soon as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Zephyr" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVZVCCv2KuHAbJGZEwqOaDxw6kE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22942600/zephyrfilter.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The two circular N95-grade filters fit between the Zephyr’s fans and their magnetic caps. There’s another filter to change just beneath the see-through plastic window.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ACU9AO"&gt;The Zephyr has style and features not usually seen with your average face mask. It looks like a futuristic gas mask, with Razer’s Chroma RGB lining the edges of the air intake and exhausts where you’ll install the N95 filters. The LEDs are mostly for show, but they’re also being touted as an accessibility feature since they, working in tandem with its see-through window covering the mouth, could theoretically make it possible to lip-read and to catch more non-verbal cues that masks can cover up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XufmBf"&gt;For those who feel like they aren’t getting enough air flow, the Zephyr feature fans near the filters that are intended to make it easier to breathe. A button on the mask can turn on the fans and toggle between two speeds: 4200 and 6200 revolutions per minute. There’s a third air chamber located near the bottom of the mouth area, but it’s passive and doesn’t feature a fan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLo1fi"&gt;The Zephyr has a dual strap design that it says can fit all head sizes, with one strap fitting around your neck and a strap with a fastening mechanism that secures around the back of your head. Both straps, as well as the pieces that touch your nose and chin on the front, feature silicone. The silicone components that touch your face can be removed for easy cleaning. Though, Razer warns against wiping the inner side of the plastic window, as it could mess up the anti-fog coating that makes it easier to see your mouth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Zephyr" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-YrqPDfX7A1LiSmF4NTNKoz4Yco=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22942609/zephyrback.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="10cDZP"&gt;Razer initially promised to install amplifiers and speakers in the Zephyr to give your voice a boost, but unfortunately, that feature didn’t make it into this first-gen product. According to Razer, it said that eliminating the feature allowed the Zephyr to shed some weight, add bigger air valves, and for its battery to last longer. However, it doesn’t rule out that the feature may appear in future iterations of the Zephyr. This was disappointing news to people like my partner, who is a teacher. The idea of not having to scream through a mask all day seemed, to her, like a killer app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CsDjI"&gt;The Zephyr can be operated entirely by its built-in buttons, but it also supports Bluetooth connectivity to control its RGB lights via the Zephyr app for Android and iOS. Its built-in battery is supposed to last up to eight hours per charge, but that’s if you aren’t using any RGB lights and have the fans set to their lowest setting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2hBNp"&gt;Many people — myself included — appreciate the anonymity provided by normal face masks, so the idea of wearing the Zephyr every day seems like an attention-grabbing exercise that I wouldn’t enjoy. Not to mention that owning the Zephyr is costly out of the gate and will get even more expensive as you need to buy more filters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dR1oXD"&gt;We’ll be covering the Zephyr more soon, but even sooner, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22702324/on-the-verge-event-date-tickets-guests-creators"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;health tech reporter Nicole Wetsman and I will take the stage at On The Verge&lt;/a&gt; on October 23rd to demo the Zephyr and ask Razer a bunch of questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYqvP6"&gt;Have any questions about the mask? Let us know in the comments below.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Kraken V3 headsets offer a redesigned look with refined sound</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Kraken V3 HyperSense" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FjQvxEItKOzgIbXcEJlNV7MU1ng=/1x0:6529x4352/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70027124/krakenv3hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The middle-of-the-road Kraken 3 HyperSense is shown here. It costs $129.99 and plugs into devices via its USB-A plug.&lt;/em&gt; | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LY2T3d"&gt;Razer has announced the Kraken V3 lineup, which has a refreshed design and new features. At the top of the offering is Razer’s wireless Kraken V3 Pro, which costs $199.99 and has built-in haptics. If wireless isn’t important to you, the Kraken V3 HyperSense for $129.99 has the same haptics feature, but with a few other tweaks. The $99.99 wired Kraken V3 doesn’t feature haptics, but it’s otherwise the same as the Kraken V3 HyperSense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHSTii"&gt;Compared to the previous generation, the V3 looks less bulky and garish. Many of Razer’s headsets have skewed toward looking more like over-ear headphones, and this one’s no exception. Some of its features are borrowed from other Razer headsets. Each Kraken V3 headset has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21345836/razer-blackshark-v2-x-budget-friendly-wired-gaming-headsets"&gt;Razer’s 50mm TriForce drivers that originated in the BlackShark V2 lineup&lt;/a&gt;, and from its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/28/17913228/razer-nari-ultimate-gaming-headset-hypersense-thx-spatial-audio"&gt;Nari headset comes the HyperSense haptic feedback&lt;/a&gt; to two of the three Kraken V3 models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MbTsaX"&gt;The most appealing Kraken V3 is the Pro. It costs $199.99 and is coming in Q4 2021, while the other two models launch today. The Pro has the most amount of features and more premium build materials, in addition to cutting the cord. It has leatherette-covered ear cups and headband (other versions have a soft fabric), and its USB-A 2.4GHz dongle works with PC, PlayStation consoles, and with the Nintendo Switch dock. This high-end variant of the Kraken V3 also works wired via its 3.5mm jack, and it charges via USB-C. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Kraken V3 Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OmfkRNRjYGeE8aO8UekgjG1yHdU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22942683/krakenv3pro.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Kraken V3 Pro charges via USB-C and has the best build materials of the three headsets announced.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dOQHYG"&gt;Compared to the other two models, the Pro’s detachable microphone is a “supercardioid” type instead of the standard cardioid mic. Supercardioid mic pickups have a narrower focus, so it could be great for picking up your voice and little else. Of course, it wouldn’t be a true Razer product without Chroma RGB support. Each of the three headsets let you customize the color that displays on the logo and the circular trim of LEDs that surround it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Nr3kW"&gt;Another big perk of the Kraken V3 Pro, in addition to the wired V3 HyperSense that costs $129.99, are the built-in haptics actuators. Razer claims that its haptics can translate sounds into vibrations in real time. Haptics company Lofelt confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it worked with Razer on these headsets, and that its L5 actuators and &lt;a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/qku6b8nf1d79/76s0L6xb9GBUdSMb3828AH/64695fe11161bd683e73ca757997e139/Elevating-Haptic-Technology-with-Lofelt-Wave.pdf"&gt;Lofelt Wave tech&lt;/a&gt; are utilized to accomplish the real-time haptics here. Given that these are actuators and not rumble motors, the sounds should feel more punchy and accentuated. I’m looking forward to trying this, given &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22440206/lofelt-vtx-ax-wave-haptic-framework-qualcomm-7-8-series-snapdragon"&gt;Lofelt’s expertise in the space&lt;/a&gt;. Razer lets you tweak the haptics with a button on the Kraken V3 Pro and V3 HyperSense. Not every game or movie scene is going to sound better with haptics, so it’ll be nice to be able to change the settings on the fly as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rM00oA"&gt;The most affordable version of the Kraken V3 is the base model that costs $99.99. It’s missing the haptics, but it features the same sound performance and design as the pricier options. It plugs in via USB-A, and you can change the color of the LEDs through Razer Synapse, as you can with the other two options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYWR7q"&gt;It has been a while since Razer revisited its Kraken lineup of headsets, but these upgrades make it seem like it was worth the wait. I look forward to trying these — particularly the Pro — and we’ll have more coverage soon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer launches its own PC components with liquid coolers, case fans, and power supplies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AkiainPeCvoF8lZDYSlcw3i3d1g=/450x0:5310x3240/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70027114/razerdesktopcomponents.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s new PC components.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e11OoO"&gt;Razer is expanding into PC components today with the launch of all-in-one (AIO) liquid coolers, case fans, and even platinum-rated power supplies. As you’d expect, all three include RGB lighting, a signature of Razer hardware. There’s even a PWM fan controller that will control up to eight fans and integrates into Razer’s Synapse software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfKtZI"&gt;The Razer Hanbo is the company’s all-in-one cooler with an addressable RGB pump cap. Razer has partnered with Asetek to create this AIO cooler, and it says the Hanbo is designed for maximum thermal performance and silent operation. The pump orientates 360 degrees, so you can place it in any case configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WAkDITPdt1ZpBeaa6yaDlxpucRY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944405/Razer_Hanbo_AIO_aRGB_360mm_Key_Visual_Updated.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s Hanbo AIO comes in 240mm and 360mm radiator sizes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mHc7U2"&gt;Razer is making both 240mm and 360mm radiator sizes available, but the company is releasing pricing information just yet. These AIOs will arrive at some point in November, and Razer says it will continue to collaborate with Asetek on new AIO coolers in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wo6Yqq"&gt;Razer’s new Kunai fans are also designed to help you cool your PC build. These case fans use hydraulic bearings and will be available in both 120mm and 140mm sizes. Razer has built an RGB ring into the front and rear, offering 18 addressable LEDs on the 120mm fan and 22 addressable LEDs on the 140mm version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Tr1lz"&gt;You’ll be able to control the Kunai fans using Razer’s Synapse software, offering up to 2,200rpm on the 120mm and up to 1,600rpm on the 140mm version. Razer is particularly proud of the static pressure in these case fans and says it has 70 percent more than the competition. You’ll be able to daisy chain these fans or control them in sequence together.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lv95xEn7I4GKSuc61SOhHGOfpVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944407/120mm_and_140mm_Hydraulic_Key_Visual_No_Floor.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s Kunai fans include an RGB ring of LEDs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RM6aBlV27Eds9QGyiD4sZn8hYyU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944408/Systems_Growth_Product_Render_008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PWM fan controller can support up to eight of Razer’s case fans.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lBb5gH"&gt;RGB case fans wouldn’t be complete without a fan controller, so Razer has also created a Pulse Width Modulator (PWM) fan controller. It will support up to eight Razer Kunai fans and integrates fully into Synapse to provide customizable fan curve controls. Razer has placed a magnet at the rear of the controller, so when you go to hide it during cable management, it will secure to any steel at the back of a typical case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R29ubb"&gt;Razer’s Kunai case fans start at $44.99, and the PWM fan controller is priced at $49.99. Both are available today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uVKuLwfIw_JKq3UIB7Ip7x8laXU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22944410/Razer_Katana_1200_Watt_Power_Supply_Key_Visual.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s Katana power supplies come with full Chroma compatibility.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="StzCvX"&gt;The final Razer PC component is a range of Katana power supplies. These platinum-rated ATX power supplies are fully modular and include a zero RPM aRGB fan with full Razer Chroma compatibility. A variety of capacities will be available from 750W to 1,200W, and there’s even a 1,600W Titanium-rated PSU if you really want to go all out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alfwAM"&gt;Razer says it’s using Japanese 105-degree rated capacitors and high-quality components for its power supplies and expects to start shipping them in early 2022 once they’ve been fully certified. Razer hasn’t announced pricing for the Katana power supplies yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sFjdId"&gt;Razer is entering a crowded market with its expansion into PC components, with players like Corsair, Cooler Master, NZXT, and Noctua all fighting to cool custom PC builds. Without knowing full pricing, it’s hard to see exactly where Razer fits in yet, but the company’s Chroma and RGB lighting compatibility will certainly be appealing to some. Let’s hope the pricing is appealing, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A professor straight up dies in the new Pokémon Legends: Arceus trailer </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yj_T95opNSAgjNUZnaNvWmCMthg=/104x0:1151x698/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026855/FCO7qGWXoAEOJsO.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HqGZl4"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; Company released a new teaser trailer for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22698264/pokemon-legends-arceus-trailer-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s causing a bit of concern. The 2-minute video features found footage of an unknown professor’s trek through a snowy wilderness as he attempts to document pokémon using a strange device he’s found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ckORIN"&gt;The professor — who will probably become the fandom’s newest zaddy because he sounds really cute — can’t contain his excitement as he stumbles on a sneeze of snorunts. But because of this man’s gleeful disregard for his own safety approaching dangerous (but oh so cute) animals in their natural habitats, it’s easy to see what happens next. The professor makes his way deep into a forest where he spots what he thinks is a zorua and zoroark. Suddenly, he’s struck by a shadow and goes silent, with the camera falling to the ground at an odd angle. The pokémon he was spying come into focus, revealing Hisuian versions of zorua and zoroark. The zorua looks concerned and sniffs at the camera for a moment before slinking away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4wx70"&gt;In the language of found footage movies, this guy is dead. Fans on social media registered shock and concern about the professor’s assumed fate, but obviously not before gushing over how cute Hisuian Zorua is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xcoCaK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;NOOOOO THE ZORUA IS SO CUTEEEE WHEN IT RUNS UP TO THE CAMERA rip that dude tho &lt;a href="https://t.co/A57GFDLPvs"&gt;https://t.co/A57GFDLPvs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— nate   (@chimeraboyz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/chimeraboyz/status/1451178230459797508?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3wAo5A"&gt;Professor Zaddy’s alleged death on camera is both shocking and not really shocking if you think about it. On the one hand, The &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; Company has crafted a very family-friendly image for its 25-year-old, billion-dollar, planet-spanning, cultural phenomena. On the other hand, this is a franchise built on the premise of what is essentially fantastical cockfighting. And if you read the Pokédex entries of any number of mon, like &lt;a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Hatterene_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Pok.C3.A9dex_entries"&gt;hatterne&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mimikyu_(Pok%C3%A9mon)#Pok.C3.A9dex_entries_2"&gt;mimikyu&lt;/a&gt;, for example, things&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;get &lt;em&gt;dark&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; universe. So a &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game trailer that mercs a professor for the crime of being overly enthusiastic about pokémon isn’t really tonally far off the mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHm1W9"&gt;A much tamer interpretation is that the shadow spirited the professor back in time to the Hisui region where the game is set, which would be a neat explanation as to why this &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game takes place in ancient times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWVv7z"&gt;We’ll find out for sure when &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Legends: Arceus&lt;/em&gt; hits the Nintendo Switch on January 28th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon warehouse workers in Staten Island are filing for a federal union election</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5IWYg7mo8m9vYmzNAa7UQA0ixtA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70026830/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon workers may get a chance to vote to form a union | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vvDGUV"&gt;Workers at Amazon’s warehouses in Staten Island, New York are preparing to file for a union election with the National Labor Relations Board on October 25th, after getting signatures on union authorization cards from more than 2,000 workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cqs2Vr"&gt;The Amazon Labor Union (ALU) is an independent group of employees that has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22408128/amazon-warehouses-unionizing-staten-island-jfk8-christian-smalls"&gt;trying to organize workers&lt;/a&gt; at four Amazon warehouses in Staten Island. It’s led by former Amazon worker Christian Smalls, who was fired in March after he helped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199942/amazon-warehouse-coronavirus-covid-new-york-protest-walkout"&gt;organize a walkout&lt;/a&gt; at the company’s JFK8 warehouse to protest unsafe working conditions during the pandemic. Amazon has said Smalls was fired for violating safety regulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQBNGb"&gt;“This is truly a remarkable historical moment for all Amazon workers all over the country,” the ALU said in a statement Thursday. “We’re not getting complacent, and we now need the support of the communities more than ever as our fight is just getting started.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbZFcI"&gt;If the union’s petition is granted approval by the NLRB, it would mean the second-ever unionization vote at an Amazon warehouse this year. In April, a union drive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama&lt;/a&gt; failed dramatically when workers voted against unionization by a margin of more than two-to-one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFkbWo"&gt;The organizing union later contested the validity of the election, citing concerns about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22445940/amazon-union-nlrb-hearing-mailbox-bessemer"&gt;a USPS mailbox installed in the Bessemer fulfillment center parking lot during the drive&lt;/a&gt;. An assessment by the NLRB in August recommended &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive"&gt;a new election for Bessemer&lt;/a&gt; warehouse workers, saying the installation of the mailbox had likely violated US labor law, although an official ruling has yet to be issued by the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lcknwE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Unionizing Amazon warehouses was never going to be easy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377142/bessemer-amazon-labor-union-loss-warehouse-rwdsu"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="q1KVrA"&gt;Still, the ALU is confident the Staten Island drive will be more successful. “Since the campaign has launched, Amazon has not wasted any time union busting,” the ALU said in its statement Thursday. “We have endured the same strategies used in Bessemer, Alabama, from signs in the bathrooms and breaks, to the same union-busting firms and consultants being brought in to walk around the workplace and divide the workers. Regardless of Amazon anti-union attempts, ALU has earned the trust of the workers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ibwMl"&gt;Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that its workers have always had the choice of whether to join a union, but that the company doesn’t think unions are the best answer for its employees. Amazon has &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/10/6/21502639/amazon-union-busting-tracking-memo-spoc"&gt;devoted significant resources&lt;/a&gt; to fight against workers organizing; in just the past few months, the NLRB has found that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345094/amazon-queens-warehouse-workers-labor-law-covid-19"&gt;Amazon threatened&lt;/a&gt; and, in some cases, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-nlrb/u-s-labor-board-claims-amazon-illegally-fired-warehouse-worker-idUSKBN28R319"&gt;fired workers&lt;/a&gt; who had &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/17/amazon-covid-chicago-nlrb-strike/"&gt;protested its handling&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19 cases at warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8sAuE"&gt;“Every day we empower people to find ways to improve their jobs, and when they do that we want to make those changes—quickly. That type of continuous improvement is harder to do quickly and nimbly with unions in the middle,“ Nantel said. “The benefits of direct relationships between managers and employees can’t be overstated—these relationships allow every employee’s voice to be heard, not just the voices of a select few.” Nantel added that the company had made “great progress in recent years and months in important areas like pay and safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjvMnj"&gt;At the height of the coronavirus pandemic last year, workers at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199942/amazon-warehouse-coronavirus-covid-new-york-protest-walkout"&gt;Amazon warehouses across the country&lt;/a&gt; raised safety concerns, saying the company didn’t notify them when workers tested positive for the virus. As part of the drive, the Amazon Labor Union is demanding higher wages, safer working conditions, more paid time off options, and longer break periods. &lt;/p&gt;
