  &lt;p id="GwUp9e"&gt;Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437681/samsung-android-11-one-ui-3-0-update-first-look-screenshots-improvements"&gt;One UI 3.0 update&lt;/a&gt; has started hitting older Samsung devices, starting with the Galaxy Note 10 and Galaxy Note 10 Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/galaxy-note-10-one-ui-3-0-stable-update-released/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The update, which brings Android 11-specific feature changes and some small visual and interface tweaks to Samsung smartphones, is only arriving on last year’s Note 10 devices in Germany, Spain, and Switzerland for now, but a wider release is expected at some point early next year if not in just a few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvdHNg"&gt;Samsung first began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505517/samsung-one-ui-3-0-s20-plus-ultra-android-11-update-t-mobile"&gt;beta testing One UI 3.0 this past fall&lt;/a&gt; following the release of Android 11, and it’s been at various stages of availability for different smartphones depending on your region. The Note 10 and Note 10 Plus versions have been available in beta since October, and in early December Samsung began its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150143/samsung-android-11-one-ui-3-update-rollout-announced"&gt;official rollout of the update&lt;/a&gt; to phones in its Galaxy S20 line, with plans to bring the update to its foldables and Samsung’s 2019 devices in the “coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDfxfq"&gt;That would imply we’ll see a One UI 3.0 release for the Z Fold, Z Fold 2, and Z Flip shortly, as well as wider availability of the update on the Note 10 line beyond Europe. We’ve reached out to Samsung to ask whether the company has a concrete timetable for this broader release outside the initial three markets. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z1H015"&gt;If you received a virtual reality gaming headset this holiday season, congratulations! Whether you’ve got the newly released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;, one of the last few units of the now discontinued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18523941/oculus-rift-s-review-vr-headset-price-specs-features"&gt;Oculus Rift S&lt;/a&gt;, or another headset like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/5/13167954/playstation-vr-review-ps4-psvr-virtual-reality-headset-controllers"&gt;PlayStation VR&lt;/a&gt;, there are a ton of video games for you to explore with your new head mount display. Here are ten games I personally enjoy and think are worth your time and money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qO0wQh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ve rounded up our favorite and most-used games, apps, and entertainment. Check out our app picks for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21951417"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21942553"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android phones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21943103"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows PCs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21952855"&gt;&lt;em&gt;M1-equipped Macs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; our favorite mobile games from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21942272"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Arcade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21934070"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Play Pass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; and our top choices for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21929534"&gt;&lt;em&gt;gaming PCs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21941056"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21929530"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox One and Series X / S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21938238"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21941004"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. We’ve also listed our favorite streaming shows on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22178393/disney-plus-hulu-espn-plus-best-shows-movies-recommendations"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disney Plus, Hulu, ESPN Plus&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22175140/best-netflix-shows-2020-streaming-recommendations-tv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Netflix&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; some &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21951428"&gt;&lt;em&gt;great sci-fi books&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163667/2020-favorite-best-podcasts-tech-culture-apple-google-stitcher-soundcloud-spotify"&gt;&lt;em&gt;exciting new podcasts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. (Note: pricing was accurate at the time of publishing but may change.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="S95nTD"&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Half-Life: Alyx screenshot" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OEIe0q_Nvi-wFs_lOwPZ7BjPDCg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19825970/COMBINE_ELEVATOR_4K.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E9ItCT"&gt;Yeah, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21188291/half-life-alyx-review-valve-index-oculus-quest-vr-shooter"&gt;it’s not &lt;em&gt;Half-Life 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But the fact that &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt; even exists is truly a blessing and is a great addition to the &lt;em&gt;Half-Life &lt;/em&gt;franchise. Set five years after the events of &lt;em&gt;Half-Life 2&lt;/em&gt;, you control Alyx, who is tasked with taking a super weapon that belongs to an alien empire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CmmBlc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Half-Life: Alyx","description":"$60 from Steam","label":"Buy now","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/546560/HalfLife_Alyx/"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="GsG26H"&gt;Star Wars: Squadrons&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Star Wars: Squadrons " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QgpkXxptJK_SjPMiMUrCHSnKGbU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21925752/SCREENS_PREV_GET_IN.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Squadrons &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uqeumg"&gt;When I was a little girl, I always wanted to pilot an X-Wing. I thought it was so cool to be soaring through space and blasting Tie Fighters out of the sky. So when EA announced that  &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Squadrons&lt;/em&gt; would have VR support, I knew I could finally fulfill my childhood dream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="baITkA"&gt;It’s a very difficult game, and you don’t need a VR headset to play. But it’s also a very rewarding game that fully immersed me when I strapped on a virtual reality headset. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1Dab6j"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Star Wars: Squadrons","description":"$40 from Electronic Arts ","label":"Buy now","url":"https://www.ea.com/games/starwars/squadrons"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="bdifR1"&gt;Real VR Fishing&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Real VR Fishing " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ggEOElGjbaH71ucwH7Cov_NBm_o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173298/ss_ffe0cd566fc17c6df7121ebc219994ff50dc9948.600x338.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Miragesoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Real VR Fishing &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4b8jGg"&gt;When I was growing up on the eastern shore of Maryland, fishing was (and is) a very popular activity in the summer. There’s something great about casting your line with a cold drink in hand while on the water, and the challenge and patience it takes to reel in a fish. Now that it is winter, I needed something to fill the void until the warmer season returns once again, and &lt;em&gt;Real VR Fishing&lt;/em&gt; does not disappoint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zGDu6c"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Real VR Fishing","description":"$20 from Oculus","label":"Buy now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F2582932495064035%2F&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="75RnRv"&gt;Void Racer: Extreme&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Void Racer: Extreme " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RGm6yjOhnFJGcEFbGKJOGW30rT4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173316/Screenshot__107_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Coplanar Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Void Racer: Extreme &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D73SEe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Void Racer: Extreme&lt;/em&gt; is a sci-fi racing game that gives me the same adrenaline rush that I get from games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/30/17179274/wipeout-omega-collection-psvr-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wipeout&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Sprint Vector&lt;/em&gt; and combines it with an aesthetic like that seen in the film &lt;em&gt;Tron&lt;/em&gt;. If you are looking for a fast-paced racing game and love sci-fi vibes, this is the game for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="q52XDq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Voice Racer: Extreme","description":"$10 from Oculus","label":"Buy now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F2874244485968712%2F%3Flocale%3Den_US&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="0v0OgC"&gt;Dreams&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dreams" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_rt7B9doB0TD0898oSZsZPyonkg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19717849/Under_a_Snowy_Moon_by_hook_line_dreamer.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Media Molecule&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dreams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7K4jS8"&gt;Sure, there are no true PS5 games released yet, but the PlayStation VR still has a solid library of PS4 titles that you can check out, including Media Molecule’s 2020 game creation title &lt;em&gt;Dreams. &lt;/em&gt;It’s not a video game in the traditional sense — it's more of a game about creating games. Dreams strongly encourages players to embrace their creative side, and you would be surprised by what type of user-generated content you can create.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tBQgQq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Dreams","description":"$20 at Amazon","label":"Buy now","url":"https://www.amazon.com/Dreams-PlayStation-4/dp/B082LW28B2"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="szgLMn"&gt;Rez Infinite&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Rez Infinite " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ajkzWWzbukWhkDYrWkF__AKcR_E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173336/frontpage_005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Enhance Experience&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rez Infinite &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3KK9Mg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rez Infinite&lt;/em&gt; is a techno-fueled shooter with sublime and trippy graphics that is truly a breathtaking experience. It’s released on practically every virtual reality gaming headset, which makes it very accessible to play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vhVobO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Rez Infinite","description":"$20 at Oculus","label":"Buy now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F2610547289060480%2F&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="7ffP28"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Rez Infinite","description":"$30 at PlayStation Store","label":"Buy now","url":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0751-CUSA05868_00-REZINFINITE00000"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="n1Latq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Rez Infinite","description":"$25 at Steam","label":"Buy now","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/636450/Rez_Infinite/"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="9FpvSu"&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Beat Saber" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zhWw9lRNkpwTrWCz3CIj1b7BPXM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13621124/30814989187_f608551022_k.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Beat Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B8yNQi"&gt;Although &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt; was originally released in 2019, this is still one of the best VR games around, and it’s one that every VR headset owner needs to experience. A rhythm game where you use lightsaber-like drumsticks to slice through musical beats? You can’t beat that. The game has also expanded to a slew of content packs, which include original songs and some licensed songs from bands like Linkin Park and BTS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xEGXpA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Beat Saber","description":"$30 at Steam","label":"Buy now","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/620980/Beat_Saber/"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="MZC878"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Beat Saber","description":"$30 at Oculus","label":"Buy now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Frift%2F1304877726278670%2F&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="JMqmBJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Beat Saber","description":"$30 at PlayStation Store","label":"Buy now","url":"https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4882-CUSA12878_00-BEATSABERFULL000"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="ko1FsC"&gt;VR Shoot Around&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="VR Shoot Around " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/91p0F6BdLAY5uKUGkY200xiM7IA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173340/ss_d72bd5e99f68d627cae81cd4726e965b8c7f6268.1920x1080.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;VR Shoot Around &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XbmRRj"&gt;Among the many things I missed this year because of the pandemic is sports. Namely, the ability to go to a basketball court and shoot some hoops. After some asking around, I heard about a really decent VR simulation title called &lt;em&gt;VR Shoot Around&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and it did not disappoint. Oh, and did I mention this game is only $5? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="S8HgMe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"VR Shoot Around","description":"$5 on Steam","label":"Buy now","url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/671740/VR_SHOOT_AROUND__Realistic_basketball_simulator/"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="EuD4NG"&gt;Trover Saves the Universe&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Trover Saves the Universe " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mRuMEE5MjQGkZGykw4z_107r5SE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22173346/PopUp_01_PC.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Squanch Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Trover Saves the Universe &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zYCqLH"&gt;Like a few games on this list, &lt;em&gt;Trover Saves the Universe&lt;/em&gt; was not released in 2020 (though it was released this year for the Oculus Quest). Developed by Squanch Games, this game is one of the goofier titles available on VR headsets. And if you are a fan of &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;you will surely get a kick out of this game — in fact, it was created by Justin Roiland, one of the co-creators of that series. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Urqy3E"&gt;Like its predecessor, &lt;em&gt;Pixel Ripped 1995&lt;/em&gt; is a love letter of sorts to the decade it is set in: the ‘90s. It’s a sequel to &lt;em&gt;Pixel Ripped 1989&lt;/em&gt; and will make anyone who grew up during the 16-bit or 32-bit era of gaming feel nostalgic. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Samsung TVs with HDR10+ will adapt to ambient lighting</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EgqdlKD9d2r80A2CBrep5ZkyiRc=/93x0:1068x650/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68596819/QLED2020.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s unclear if Samsung’s existing TVs will be updated to support the feature.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cz7oiZ"&gt;HDR10+ Adaptive is a new feature coming to the high dynamic range standard that’ll optimize TV picture quality based on a room’s ambient brightness, &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-introduces-new-hdr10plus-adaptive-feature-for-better-at-home-viewing-experience?utm_source=rss&amp;amp;utm_medium=direct"&gt;Samsung announced today&lt;/a&gt;. HDR content is typically designed to look its best in dark rooms with as little ambient light as possible, but the new feature promises to use your TV’s light sensor to react to bright environments and adjust its picture quality accordingly. Samsung says the feature will launch globally with its “upcoming QLED TV products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPTPOD"&gt;HDR10+ isn’t the first HDR standard to have introduced such a feature. At last year’s CES, Dolby announced Dolby Vision IQ, a new feature for its own HDR standard that similarly promises to optimize HDR content for the room it’s being watched in. The feature went on to appear in select TVs from LG and Panasonic over the course of the year and was &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/reviews/panasonic-hz2000-4k-oled-tv#picture-quality:~:text=Dolby%20Vision%20IQ%20takes%20the%20same,became%20our%20default%20for%20DV%20HDR."&gt;generally well-received in reviews&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qTHOAW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;HDR10+ content can be found on Amazon Prime Video&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mWfKbO"&gt;Samsung notes that HDR10+ Adaptive will work with Filmmaker Mode, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055753/filmmaker-mode-tv-samsung-philips-tp-vision-kaleidescape-uhd-alliance-ces-2020"&gt;display setting launched last year&lt;/a&gt; which turns off post-processing effects like motion smoothing to show content as accurately as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQAIL3"&gt;Compared to Dolby Vision, the HDR10+ standard isn’t quite as widely supported by TV manufacturers and streaming services. However, it has the support of Samsung, the world’s biggest TV manufacturer, and Amazon through its Amazon Prime Video streaming service. It’s no coincidence that these were the two companies that announced the standard &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/4/20/15369234/samsung-amazon-video-hdr-standard-hdr10-plus-dolby-vision-metadata"&gt;over three years ago&lt;/a&gt;. Dolby Vision, meanwhile, is supported in TVs from manufacturers like LG and Sony, and content supporting the standard can be found on streaming services like Netflix and Disney Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SVdNrL"&gt;Samsung says its upcoming QLED TVs will support HDR10+ Adaptive, but it’s unclear if its existing TVs will be updated with the new feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJ3IiW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="75TsVu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A modder has made a Nintendo 64 that’s smaller than the original’s controller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lEtrkVpycxjGdqBtAu1eLEJXr3g=/266x0:3095x1886/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68596051/Screen_Shot_2020_12_29_at_5.22.48_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: GmanModz&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4VMZZC"&gt;Taking an old console and making it as small as possible is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/8/29/21406254/nintendo-modder-custom-wii-game-cube-game-boy"&gt;a well-established tradition&lt;/a&gt; in the modding community, and there may be a new victor in the race to shrink the Nintendo 64 as far as possible (&lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/gaming/the-worlds-smallest-nintendo-n64-fits-in-your-pocket"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Input&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). GmanModz has cut down an N64 to the point where it’s smaller than a GameCube controller — and only slightly bigger than the cartridges it takes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jSb3T9P990VmOiyz3Wg3PIndG9Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22203745/Screen_Shot_2020_12_29_at_5.22.48_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: GmanModz&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The mod vs an N64 controller&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IK5wdo"&gt;Yes, cartridges. This isn’t an emulator, this is an actual Nintendo 64 that was cut, soldered, and otherwise modded to fit into a handheld package, complete with screen, battery, and controls (the joysticks are from a Nintendo Switch, chosen for their diminutive size).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWYQZi"&gt;At three and a half inches, the screen is smaller than what you’d be used to when playing an N64, and it has a resolution of 320 x 240. Making up the shell are two different plastics, with the back being more heat-resistant — an important consideration when you’re using a motherboard designed to be in a roomy home console.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A picture of a Nintendo 64 motherboard sitting inside a small case." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iyMZvkoj1yvSOBB4W5DSfjaXrHc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22203701/Screen_Shot_2020_12_29_at_4.52.24_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: GmanModz&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In order to fit it into such a small form factor, the N64’s motherboard had to have all non-essential parts cut off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FLHDuC"&gt;The modder is no stranger to making portable versions of the console: they’ve also modded it into a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vg6FyUwRzg"&gt;Game Boy Advance SP-inspired form factor&lt;/a&gt; (twice). For this mod, though, they gave themselves a challenge: don’t custom-design any boards. There are some third-party boards inside that were available on an online modding shop, but they weren’t made specifically for this build. GmanModz says that this was “to be fair” to the previous smallest N64 record holder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dapCXg"&gt;In the video showing off the project, GmanModz admits that it’s not the greatest portable Nintendo 64 experience. But that’s not really the point — the point was to make the smallest portable N64, and they apparently achieved that. “The battery life sucks, it’s uncomfortable to hold, but hey. It fits in my pocket. Does your N64?”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jfLWxk-SxUrZXK5tu_j-mpQwE6g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22203709/Screen_Shot_2020_12_29_at_4.57.28_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: GmanModz&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dB1OUN"&gt;As expected with such a small handheld, the battery only lasts about an hour and a half. But hey, if you’re gunning for &lt;a href="https://www.speedrun.com/sm64/run/yjlxg97z"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; speed run record&lt;/a&gt;, that may be all you need.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple pulls iPhone app promoting secret parties during the COVID-19 pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Promotional screen from Vybe’s now-defunct website." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CsbSWkWPIVeJZdY-MbJIZU7ukNU=/56x0:1883x1218/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68595776/Screen_Shot_2020_12_29_at_6.49.57_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Promotional screen from Vybe’s now-defunct website.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="22RH97"&gt;An iOS app called Vybe Together that promoted private parties during the COVID-19 pandemic has been removed from the Apple App Store, had its account on TikTok banned, and scrubbed most of its online presence. The app’s creators told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Apple was the one to take it off the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VsrEqQ"&gt;Vybe Together billed itself on TikTok and &lt;a href="https://archive.vn/8hzdS"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt; as a place to organize and attend underground parties, using the tagline “Get your rebel on. Get your party on.” Organizers would have to approve everyone who wanted to attend, and the ones that got approved would receive the address two hours before the event. Most of these gatherings &lt;a href="https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/travel-large-gatherings-and-quarantines#large-gatherings"&gt;would have been illegal&lt;/a&gt; under current US pandemic restrictions — which may explain why the app required you to submit a profile for approval before you were allowed on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QzVH9NHHg-wBqGNIJ-Mvvg2V7cY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22203614/Screen_Shot_2020_12_29_at_7.23.24_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshots from the iOS App Store page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4zKNy"&gt;Calling a phone number on Vybe Together’s site connected &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; with someone who identified themselves as Albin, one of the app’s co-founders. They said that the app had a few thousand users, and that a few thousand additional applicants had requested access to it since the company started putting videos on TikTok. Applying involved submitting your Instagram handle and uploading pictures of you partying to the service, presumably to make sure that you weren’t someone who was going to spill the beans about the events.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USpxbc"&gt;Vybe Together largely had a low profile before today, although it was mentioned in at least one &lt;a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/90s-theme-party-nyu-students-only-byob-rooftop-in-soho-tickets-121224360325#"&gt;EventBrite invitation&lt;/a&gt; to a New York party in September. It received wider exposure after &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reporter Taylor Lorenz &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1343994810714058753"&gt;critically tweeted&lt;/a&gt; screenshots of the website and described it as an app for “finding and promoting COVID-unsafe large, indoor house parties.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vaDIFu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;They’re currently in the midst of promoting secret NYE ragers in nyc &lt;a href="https://t.co/dEIdwX1DKn"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dEIdwX1DKn&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Taylor Lorenz (@TaylorLorenz) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1343995285869977600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 29, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LFeJXK"&gt;Vybe Together’s now-removed FAQ page acknowledged the danger of the pandemic, but it said the app was designed to promote “small gatherings” rather than “big parties.” (Smaller gatherings of people from different households can still spread the coronavirus, creating chains of infection that extend far beyond the original event, putting people who didn’t attend the party at risk.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the site’s FAQ reading “We are aware that Covid is a major health problem to the country, our communities, our friends and family. If we all could just be in isolation this could actually go away. Having large scale parties is very dangerous. That is why we don’t support that. But Vybe is a compromise, no big parties but small gatherings. We could be living, at least a little during these times with Vybe.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vtDgcG_MBxNFymFs33hVBfHOCwU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22203610/image.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kfpRif"&gt;It’s unknown whether the app substantially contributed to people holding unsafe events, although it promoted “gatherings every weekend” — including an upcoming New Year’s Eve party — in a TikTok video. The Vybe Together app had only 25 ratings before being removed, and its Instagram page has under 1,000 followers. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, TikTok said the account on that platform had only 139 followers when it was removed. The app appears to have launched previously under the name Trendies, a name mentioned on its now largely empty Instagram page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5Vl6Y"&gt;Vybe Together’s website also advertised a “Vybe House” for the 2021 Zamna Festival music event in Tulum, Mexico. The house’s pictures correspond to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.airbnb.com%2Frooms%2F44358648%3Fsource_impression_id%3Dp3_1609270823_u1tYjuKvRoT1nTcp%26guests%3D1%26adults%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F29%2F22205298%2Fapple-tiktok-vybe-together-pandemic-underground-party-app-removed#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an Airbnb listing&lt;/a&gt; for a rental called the Casa Remy Villa. However, the listing’s manager couldn’t confirm the existence of a “Vybe House” event to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We have rented the villa to some influencers,” said the owner, who had “no idea” if any renters were linked to the app. “But they know parties aren’t allowed of any kind as they are forbidden by authorities during [the] pandemic, with the risk of shutting down the property and a huge fine.” The Airbnb host also notes that the Zamna festival was recently postponed to April — not the January dates listed on its website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nWuXh0"&gt;Vybe Together’s Instagram account now contains &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CJZbzlWFfC4/"&gt;a single text post.&lt;/a&gt; “Blown out of proportion by media,” it reads. “We DO NOT CONDONE LARGE GATHERINGS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIfgmW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 29, 8:06 ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: The app’s creators have now clarified that Apple was the one to pull the app from the App Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>McConnell ties full repeal of Section 230 to push for $2,000 stimulus checks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A backlit Mitch McConnell ominously addresses reporters." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TBhWlFUOKzKG-cMmpYmgupBEGmk=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68594391/1230144952.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Rod Lamkey / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ksQvgr"&gt;On Tuesday night, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell introduced a new bill tying increased stimulus payments to a full repeal of Section 230, according to &lt;a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20438365-mcconnell-stimulus-offer"&gt;bill text obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The bill comes amid new momentum for direct $2,000 stimulus payments, and increasing pressure on party leaders to appease President Donald Trump’s escalating demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWXpMz"&gt;Democratic party leaders criticized the inclusion of Section 230 repeal as an effort to scuttle stimulus talks. “Senator McConnell knows how to make $2,000 survival checks reality and he knows how to kill them,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said in a statement Tuesday. “Will Senate Republicans go along with Sen. McConnell’s cynical gambit or will they push him to give a vote on the standalone [bill]?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xMGRI"&gt;McConnell’s bid for a full repeal of Section 230 comes amid increasingly chaotic negotiations over the level of direct payments to be included in stimulus efforts. On Sunday, President Trump signed into law Congress’ $900 billion COVID-19 relief and government spending package that would provide $600 in stimulus payments to most Americans. &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-from-the-president-122720/"&gt;In a public statement&lt;/a&gt; after signing the bill, Trump urged congressional leaders to hold a standalone vote on increasing direct payments to $2,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="6skZcg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:8777491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SI5Ixc"&gt;By Tuesday morning, many Republicans who previously opposed the increased stimulus checks flipped to supporting them alongside Democrats. In particular, both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754927/jon-ossoff-tiktok-snapchat-account-influencer-marketing"&gt;Georgia Senate runoff&lt;/a&gt; incumbents, Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), announced Tuesday that they would vote to approve the additional payments after days of sidestepping the question, creating a difficult position for McConnell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8TaJD"&gt;Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) said in a tweet Tuesday that the Senate has “got the votes” to approve the increased payments. But later that day, McConnell (R-KY) blocked a House bill that would provide $2,000 in stimulus payments to most Americans, citing the need to tackle higher payments alongside other issues &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-from-the-president-122720/"&gt;raised by President Trump&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcPfpm"&gt;In a floor statement made Tuesday, McConnell linked a handful of unrelated policy measures to the future of the increased stimulus checks; among them, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that shields tech companies like Facebook and Google from legal liability over the content users post on their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXMDZU"&gt;“During this process, the president highlighted three additional issues of national significance he would like to see Congress tackle together,” McConnell said Tuesday afternoon. “This week, the Senate will begin a process to bring these three priorities into focus.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYG9WU"&gt;Even before the bill was introduced, some lawmakers feared the majority leader would use Section 230 as a poison pill to doom the broader package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrN6LL"&gt;“That is an invitation for this entire effort to fall apart,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) said on the Senate floor Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c90SrW"&gt;In recent months, Trump has often used Section 230 as a negotiating tool to push forward other policy priorities or tie up unwanted legislation. Last week, Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197796/trump-ndaa-veto-section-230-defense-bill-facebook-twitter"&gt;vetoed the $740 billion National Defense Authorization Act&lt;/a&gt; (or NDAA), after complaints that the defense bill did not include a provision that would repeal Section 230. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) threatened Tuesday to block a Senate vote to override Trump’s NDAA veto if McConnell did not agree to open a standalone vote on $2,000 checks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLWU5E"&gt;“Big Tech must not get protections of Section 230!” Trump said in a statement Sunday. “Voter fraud must be fixed!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DKZi5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated December 29th at 5:28PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;A previous version of this article was published at 2:33PM ET under the headline “Section 230 has become a bargaining chip in ongoing stimulus talks.” The article was updated to its current form, including a new headline and timestamp, when full bill text became available.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can escape this room, but you’ll never escape Google Docs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8JsUKxpR7jx98iUokHTZ8kfkgk=/71x21:831x528/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68595059/Screen_Shot_2020_12_29_at_9.13.21_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mDFCyN"&gt;For anyone who’s been lucky enough to spend the majority of the pandemic working from home, the idea of escaping the room (or couch) that’s become a makeshift office is probably a relatable one. Enter this &lt;a href="https://news.avclub.com/escape-your-boredom-with-this-at-home-escape-room-made-1842427574"&gt;series of “escape rooms” built in Google Docs&lt;/a&gt;, that let you do just that, inside web software you’ve probably become far too familiar with. “Part 3” of the game &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AnthonyBLSmith/status/1343965296885981184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1343965296885981184%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;was finally released&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday, but you’ll never fully escape using Google Docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8VyEy"&gt;“Escape: A Game” by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AnthonyBLSmith"&gt;Anthony Smith&lt;/a&gt; is styled as a choose-your-own-adventure game set in a series of interlinked Google Docs. You “wake up” from a mysterious dream in a cabin room filling with smoke, and are tasked with getting out. “Part 2” has you do the same thing in a hotel corridor, and “Part 3,” which just released Tuesday, I won’t spoil for myself or anyone reading this. We’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21324558/google-forms-virtual-escape-rooms-librarians-games-puzzles-homeschooling"&gt;other escape room games built in Google’s software before&lt;/a&gt;, but “Escape” has an odd, creepy charm that’s hard to deny.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oo3i3AOzkaWQAJcxD_xVY5xeAHA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22203108/Screen_Shot_2020_12_29_at_12.30.11_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first of many choices in “Escape: A Game”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TXRgeM"&gt;As cool as this all is, Google Docs is not the best place to play a game. Clicking links in Docs can require multiple clicks to actually take you somewhere else, and the new tabs quickly add up. I could tell my laptop was straining under the number of tabs I had open for cross-referencing clues and dialing the in-game phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TEsiwe"&gt;What &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a nice benefit of playing in a collaborative word processor is the possibility to get help solving puzzles. Both “Part 1” and “Part 2” feature pages that pull double duty as guestbooks for people to leave their names, and help each other solve puzzles. You need to request access to edit the page for “Part 1,” but even without live edits, it’s still handy for hints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5ItmMe"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JR0gwhfHCWg?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=150&amp;amp;start=150" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pi1xj9"&gt;The actual narrative early on in “Escape” is slim, but it leaves plenty of room to fill in the weirder edges with your own connections. For instance, the entire time I played, I couldn’t shake the similarities between the game’s smoke-filled cabin, and &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;’s “Oceanview Motel.” That &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; level featured an escape room-style puzzle and functioned as a liminal space in the game that you returned to multiple times. “Escape” lacks the cool visual aesthetics of &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;, but there’s some shared heritage in their weirdness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATnO5x"&gt;I spent around an hour working through the first part of “Escape” and ended it with over 50 tabs open and a pretty weird YouTube history. I learned some facts about dentistry, grew frustrated with myself for not remembering all of the 151 original Pokémon, and became increasingly concerned that this was all a trick to get me to better understand how links work in Docs. All in all, it’s not a bad way to spend some time online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uoqKf9"&gt;“Escape: A Game” can be played for free in Google Docs. “&lt;a href="https://t.co/L5JZqy920k?amp=1"&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;,” “&lt;a href="https://t.co/TLZI1ggQfl?amp=1"&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;,” and “&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pxn3DP-w3ohhS6DqWm7WD2zRGYn7Uw-bttUFgzlCNBY/edit"&gt;Part 3&lt;/a&gt;” are available now for your puzzle-solving pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>No, NFL player Russell Okung is not being paid in Bitcoin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Carolina Panthers Training Camp" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kE4eRDFuoPvUOYzwL6ogU1bIhzo=/0x0:3196x2131/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68595057/1268340895.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Grant Halverson/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RXkw8T"&gt;“Panthers’ Russell Okung Becomes First NFL Player to Be Paid in Bitcoin,” &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/panthers-russell-okung-becomes-first-nfl-player-to-be-paid-in-bitcoin"&gt;the headline proclaimed&lt;/a&gt; — and soon, ones just like it started sprouting up across the web, with sports publications, tech publications, and mainstream media outlets alike jumping to tell how the Carolina Panthers offensive lineman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RussellOkung/status/1128149326943834113"&gt;finally fulfilled his spoken desire&lt;/a&gt; to get paid in cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67uDbi"&gt;Unfortunately, the headline isn’t true. “Not accurate,” an NFL spokesperson tells me, adding that “his people are converting some of the money into bitcoin” after he gets paid in US dollars, just like every other NFL player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gxC3xu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More like “NFL player decides to spend half his salary on Bitcoin”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8mtSAF"&gt;Okung’s own team, the Carolina Panthers, also confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that teams pay their players in US dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQuhRW"&gt;By that standard, anyone can get their salary “paid in bitcoin” anytime they want: just go buy some bitcoin with your salary after it arrives, which is probably what the company that Okung is pumping — &lt;a href="https://strike.zaphq.io/"&gt;Zap&lt;/a&gt; — is hoping you’ll do when you see he’s repping it online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ci2WqJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Do it, now. &lt;a href="https://t.co/9eAJxcBxLi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9eAJxcBxLi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— russ (@RussellOkung) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RussellOkung/status/1343941366024433665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 29, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kp8kG8"&gt;It’s not clear why Okung chose this particular startup to convert his paycheck (it does accept direct deposit), or why he’s tweeted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RussellOkung"&gt;fourteen times this afternoon&lt;/a&gt; encouraging his followers to hop on board the bitcoin and Zap train. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POH3o4"&gt;He doesn’t disclose any kind of relationship with Zap on Twitter, although Zap founder Jack Mallers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JackMallers/status/1343961558196641796"&gt;does call him a “friend.”&lt;/a&gt; (Mallers didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IybiVh"&gt;But even if Okung doesn’t have a deal of some sort with Zap, he would have some financial incentive simply by being a bitcoin investor — the more people get excited enough to buy gobs of bitcoin, the higher the price and the more his stake is worth. (Okung converted half of his $13 million salary to bitcoin, according to the &lt;em&gt;Coindesk &lt;/em&gt;report.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHgQSS"&gt;To generate that kind of excitement, it helps to have headlines like “First NFL player to be paid in Bitcoin” spread around the web. It certainly sounds more intriguing than “NFL player decides to spend 50 percent of his salary on Bitcoin,” right? It’ll be interesting to see if any of those headlines change overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jiAvHY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyUh41"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YfCBfO"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple loses early challenge in virtualization copyright claim</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WhBlzuFDWgPzYqzREkpMKgKDL4k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68594967/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bQIxyi"&gt;Apple has lost an early challenge in its lawsuit against Corellium, a security firm that offers a virtualized version of iOS for security testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="39Xlxk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20438330-20656722-0-117887"&gt;Ruling on a motion for summary judgment&lt;/a&gt; in the US District Court for Southern Florida, US District Judge Rodney Smith has dismissed Apple’s copyright infringement claim over Corellium’s software, finding that Corellium’s use of Apple code constituted fair use. Smith deferred ruling on a separate Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) charge, but the result is still a significant setback for the iPhone manufacturer’s legal case. The news was first reported &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/29/apple-corellium-lawsuit/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tUUX4"&gt;In particular, the judge found that additional features within Corellium’s tool strengthened its case for fair use, particularly the ability to modify the kernel or observe and halt processes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vvTFM"&gt;“Corellium makes several changes to iOS and incorporates its own code to create a product that serves a transformative purpose,” Smith wrote in his ruling. “Hence, Corellium’s profit motivation does not undermine its fair use defense, particularly considering the public benefit of the product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GvbcNn"&gt;Crucially, the court didn’t dismiss all of Apple’s case. Apple has alleged that Corellium circumvented its authentication server and secure boot chain, among other measures, violating the DMCA’s ban on circumventing copy protection measures. Corellium also mounted a fair use defense against the DMCA charges, but the judge did not find it compelling enough to dismiss the DMCA allegations before a full trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpF69j"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/16/20809109/apple-corellium-startup-company-lawsuit-court-virtual-iphone-software-copy"&gt;began its lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Corellium on copyright grounds in August 2019, adding alleged DMCA violations to the case &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21047275/apple-corellium-dmca-lawsuit-copyright-research-jailbreak-security-copyright"&gt;the following January&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout the case, Apple has insisted that its purpose is “not to encumber good-faith security research, but to bring an end to Corellium’s unlawful commercialization of Apple’s valuable copyrighted works.” Still, the lawsuit has been alarming to many security firms who rely on Corellium products for iOS analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82IFH4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504715/google-v-oracle-supreme-court-hearings-android-java"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Oracle v. Google&lt;/em&gt; case&lt;/a&gt; has cast a heavy shadow over the trial, and is referenced several times in the ruling as a preeminent example of successful copyright claim over software. However, the judge ultimately found the case had little bearing on the specific allegations made by Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
