    <title>Images of Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra’s optional stylus and compatible case leak early</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sdequBrQeAgmHk1V9hBD7cXTy7w=/0x0:2250x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68615395/Samsung_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_S_Pen_Cover_1609725103_0_0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A case for the S21 Ultra with space for an optional  S Pen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,120358.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="le0KRq"&gt;Images of what appears to be an S Pen stylus and carrying case for Samsung’s upcoming Galaxy S21 Ultra have leaked online, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120358.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. They show a stylus that looks similar in appearance to Samsung’s previous S Pens, as well as a phone case that’s a little wider than the handset itself to allow space for the optional accessory. &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; reports that the stylus will be sold separately from the phone for just under €40 (around $49). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBEhCB"&gt;This phone case is necessary because the S21 Ultra is rumored to support the S Pen but &lt;a href="https://winfuture.mobi/news/119995"&gt;reportedly won’t have a dedicated slot&lt;/a&gt; to store it unlike Samsung’s Note devices. The stylus is reportedly an optional accessory for the S21 Ultra, rather than something that comes in the box like with the Note phones. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qhnR3BnQbLiQ8g-kvF9TL0B_UBs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22212392/Samsung_Galaxy_S21_Ultra_S_Pen_Cover_1609725152_0_0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://winfuture.de/news,120358.html" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stylus accessory looks a lot like Samsung’s previous S Pens.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tJ1Syy"&gt;Rumors that the Galaxy S21 Ultra will work with the S Pen have been around for at least a month, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175769/samsung-stylus-galaxy-phones-s21-foldable"&gt;Samsung itself&lt;/a&gt; even hinted that support was on the way when its president of mobile TM Roh said the company would add some of the Galaxy Note’s “most well-loved features” to other devices in its lineup. At the end of last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22196897/s-pen-uwb-comfirm-galaxy-s21-ultra-fcc"&gt;an FCC filing&lt;/a&gt; all-but-confirmed that stylus support was on the way for the upcoming phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aTQQ2"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;, the S21 Ultra will support many of the same S Pen features as previous Note devices. It will reportedly have a pressure-sensitive tip, gesture controls via an accelerometer, and controls for playing and pausing videos or remotely taking photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6tt9p"&gt;Reports of stylus support coming to the S21 Ultra have coincided with rumors that Samsung was preparing to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754983/samsung-galaxy-note-21-2021-smartphone-discontinued-stylus-s21-foldable-rumor"&gt;discontinue its Note lineup&lt;/a&gt;, which counts stylus support among its defining features. However, this has reportedly been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22177972/galaxy-note-21-still-happening-yonhap"&gt;disputed by one Samsung official&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BqgnK"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra is expected to be one of three devices that’ll make up the S21 lineup, alongside the Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus. Beyond its stylus support, other reports have claimed the Galaxy S21 Ultra’s rear camera array will include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189305/samsung-s21-ultra-spec-leak-cameras"&gt;two telephoto cameras&lt;/a&gt; as well as a main 108-megapixel camera. Leaked video teasers suggest it’ll have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/12/8/22163632/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-5g-teaser-video-leak"&gt;curved screen&lt;/a&gt; (compared to flat screens for the other two S21 handsets) and redesigned camera bump compared to the previous generation S20 Ultra, and &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,120117.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; previously reported&lt;/a&gt; it’ll have a 6.8-inch 120Hz display, and a 5,000 mAh battery with support for 45W fast charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gt7Jux"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22206649/samsung-officially-confirms-galaxy-s21-event-on-january-14th"&gt;Samsung has confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that its next Unpacked launch event will take place on January 14th, during which it’s expected to announce the new Galaxy S21 range and possibly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/1/22209216/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-tile-item-tracker-leak"&gt;a new Tile competitor&lt;/a&gt; alongside the heavily leaked &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180111/galaxy-buds-pro-360-view-samsung-wireless"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google workers announce plans to unionize </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BRITAIN-IRELAND-US-INTERNET-SEXISM-COMPANY-GOOGLE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-sHyexthjNEW-xxTlsLb63y69dM=/0x0:5978x3985/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68615373/1056016730.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo credit should read TOLGA AKMEN/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AoAUZK"&gt;Google workers have announced plans to unionize with the Communications Workers of America (CWA). The Alphabet Workers Union will be open to all employees and contractors at Google’s parent company. Its goal will be to tackle ongoing issues like pay disparity, retaliation, and controversial government contracts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9KRho"&gt;“This union builds upon years of courageous organizing by Google workers,” said Nicki Anselmo, a Google program manager. “From fighting the ‘real names’ policy, to opposing Project Maven, to protesting the egregious, multi-million dollar payouts that have been given to executives who’ve committed sexual harassment, we’ve seen first-hand that Alphabet responds when we act collectively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rOKXpa"&gt;Google’s work on Project Maven, an effort to use AI to improve targeted drone strikes, sparked protests among employees who saw the work as unethical. In 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/technology/google-pentagon-project-maven.html"&gt;the company decided not to renew its contract with the Pentagon&lt;/a&gt;. The company also &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/technology/google-forced-arbitration.html"&gt;ended its forced arbitration policy&lt;/a&gt; after 20,000 workers staged a walkout to protest former executive Andy Rubin getting a $90 million exit package after he was credibly accused of sexual harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1K2pC"&gt;Now that the union effort is public, organizers will likely launch a series of campaigns to rally votes from Google workers. Prior to the announcement, about 230 Google employees and contractors had signed cards in support of the union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qMStox"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google contractors have long complained about unequal treatment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D7gOax"&gt;Google contractors have long complained about their unequal treatment compared to full-time staff. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/28/technology/google-temp-workers.html"&gt;While they make up the majority of Google’s workforce&lt;/a&gt;, they often lack the benefits of salaried employees. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20882206/google-tech-contractors-union-vote-pittsburgh-united-steelworkers"&gt;roughly 80 Google contractors in Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt; voted to join the United Steelworkers union. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GWx9u3"&gt;The Alphabet Workers Union plans to unionize with CWA Local 1400, which represents workers in Massachusetts, Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQBP25"&gt;The news comes one month after the National Labor Relations Board filed a complaint alleging &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22047383/google-spied-workers-before-firing-labor-complaint"&gt;Google illegally fired two workers who were organizing employee protests&lt;/a&gt;. The employees, Laurence Berland and Kathryn Spiers, were organizing against the company’s decision to work with IRI Consultants, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/technology/Google-union-consultant.html"&gt;a firm famous for its anti-union efforts&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGORxY"&gt;It also follows the firing of prominent AI ethicist Timnit Gebru in December. In a press release announcing the union, the Alphabet Workers Union wrote: “The firing has caused outrage from thousands of us, including Black and Brown workers who are heartbroken by the company’s actions and unsure of their future at Google.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ihVycE"&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/kickstarter-workers-vote-form-first-union-tech-industry-n1138006"&gt;employees at the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter voted to unionize with the Office and Professional Employees International Union Local 153&lt;/a&gt;, as reported by NBC. It was the first time white-collar employees in the tech industry had unionized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SoyGy6"&gt;If the union effort at Google is successful, members say they will commit one percent of their annual compensation to the union. The money will go toward paying legal fees and organizing staff. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9aHJt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange cannot be extradited to the US, British judge rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Protestors At Court Supporting Julian Assange" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/57Obg8H7zWPBMqhu9nv_OMibKA8=/0x0:4444x2963/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68615347/1201406239.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Leon Neal/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kI4ySt"&gt;A judge in the United Kingdom has denied Julian Assange’s extradition to the United States, where he faces espionage charges for his work running WikiLeaks. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/jan/04/julian-assange-cannot-be-extradited-to-us-british-judge-rules"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the ruling was delivered in a criminal court this morning, with the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/british-judge-rejects-u-s-request-to-extradite-wikileaks-julian-assange-11609758350?mod=e2tw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reporting that the judge noted that the risk of suicide is too high.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaZ8Cw"&gt;Assange will now remain in British custody pending a bail application, and the US government is free to proceed with an appeal against the decision. This particular ruling is only related to the US request for extradition under an extradition treaty between the UK and US. The full ruling is &lt;a href="https://www.judiciary.uk/judgments/usa-v-julian-assange/"&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9UZE6"&gt;Initially detained by the UK for violating his bail conditions, Assange faces hacking and espionage charges in the US related to a string of Wikileaks publications that the US Justice Department called “one of the largest compromises of classified information in the history of the United States.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bzJ6t0"&gt;The case has raised significant free speech concerns, as &lt;a href="http://www.medialaw.org/component/k2/item/4801-is-assange-entitled-to-full-first-amendment-protection?"&gt;many legal scholars&lt;/a&gt; see the government’s case as punishing the Wikileaks founder for publishing information. The extradition has also been unusually high-profile, with &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/22/protesters-gather-on-eve-of-julian-assange-extradition-hearing"&gt;a number of UK protests&lt;/a&gt; in support of Assange and opposing extradition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cDFBC1"&gt;Assange was &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/feb/19/donald-trump-offered-julian-assange-pardon-russia-hack-wikileaks"&gt;reportedly considered for a pardon&lt;/a&gt; by outgoing president Donald Trump, who benefitted from Wikileaks’ DNC releases during the 2016 campaign. However, Assange was not included in a December round of appeals, and it’s unclear whether Trump plans to intervene in the case.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft planning ‘sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MxczGH-_tBQ-WIJ1IIDzRFWYTLU=/83x0:2243x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68615341/windows10ui.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C1YHXf"&gt;Microsoft is planning a “sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows” that is designed to signal to users of the operating system that “Windows is BACK.” That’s according to a &lt;a href="https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/922184/Senior-Software-Engineer"&gt;job listing&lt;/a&gt; posted by Microsoft recently, advertising for a software engineering role in the Windows Core User Experiences team:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="LtzHK3"&gt;“On this team, you’ll work with our key platform, Surface, and OEM partners to orchestrate and deliver a sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows experiences to signal to our customers that Windows is BACK and ensure that Windows is considered the best user OS experience for customers.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TEJcY4"&gt;Microsoft quietly removed references to this “sweeping visual rejuvenation” this morning, after several Windows enthusiasts &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BartokGabi17/status/1345874056382455810"&gt;spotted&lt;/a&gt; the job listing over the weekend. While Microsoft has been promising visual overhauls of Windows 10 for years, thanks to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/11/15615812/microsoft-fluent-design-system-project-neon-features"&gt;Fluent Design system&lt;/a&gt;, rumors suggest the company is planning big user interface changes for Windows that will debut later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H56NalfLS4RgkKhRvuZHlDh1YDE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20063260/newwindows10startmenu.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The updated Windows 10 Start menu from 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="msnClx"&gt;Codenamed Sun Valley, &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-10-sun-valley-ui-october-2021-update"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Central &lt;/em&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt; on these UI changes back in October. Microsoft is planning to overhaul the Start menu, File Explorer, and built-in apps in Windows 10 to modernize them and make the UI more consistent. Some of the UI changes will also &lt;a href="https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/issues/3549"&gt;include updates&lt;/a&gt; to the sliders, buttons, and controls that are found throughout Windows and the apps that run on the OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yj2Ydu"&gt;Microsoft is also working on improving its tablet mode experience, particularly how devices like the company’s Surface line switch between mouse / trackpad usage and and touch-based interactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFP8Cg"&gt;Microsoft has been working on improving its UI consistency throughout Windows in recent years, and a lot of that will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21132826/microsoft-windows-10x-features-dual-screen-foldable-hands-on-developers"&gt;found in Windows 10X&lt;/a&gt;. The company also rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145157/microsoft-windows-10-new-icons-modern-release-update-apps"&gt;new Windows 10 icons&lt;/a&gt; nearly a year ago, followed by some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21310597/microsoft-windows-10-start-menu-design-new-alt-tab-features"&gt;minor tweaks to the Start menu&lt;/a&gt; a few months later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5bj1u"&gt;All of this work comes as Microsoft has signaled a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21358339/microsoft-windows-reorg-2020-panos-panay-windows-development"&gt;renewed interest in Windows&lt;/a&gt;. Surface chief Panos Panay took on the additional role of looking after Windows back in October, after previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21187384/microsoft-windows-10-new-file-explorer-start-menu-context-menu-teaser-video-changes"&gt;teasing some additional Windows 10 UI changes&lt;/a&gt; last year. After a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246561/microsoft-windows-10x-single-screens-windows-usage-demand-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;jump in Windows usage&lt;/a&gt; due to the pandemic, it feels like Microsoft might be more ready than ever to give its operating system the UI polish it has been promising for years.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This LG display transforms from flat to curved for immersive gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cxjRmiuB-5G6HjHBj3XGurrmgOk=/1x0:6400x4266/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68615248/44218753863586400_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Curved screens can offer a more immersive experience while gaming.&lt;/em&gt; | Image; LG Display&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wv0KBo"&gt;LG Display’s &lt;a href="http://www.lgdisplay.com/eng/prcenter/newsList"&gt;latest prototype&lt;/a&gt; is a 48-inch flexible OLED panel that can be bent for gaming or flattened for watching TV. The company has shown off similar bendable TV prototypes before, like when it demonstrated a &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-07-lg-display-is-cramming-curved-and-bendable-screens-into-every-pa.html#engadget-post-continued-contents:~:text=.%20Then%2C%20and%20this%20might%20still,general%20flight%20information%20and%20duty%2Dfree%20goods."&gt;65-inch TV meant for use inside planes&lt;/a&gt; that could bend into a curve for passengers to watch movies. This model, which is being shown off at this year’s virtual CES, features LG Display’s Cinematic Sound OLED (CSO) technology, which vibrates the screen to produce audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmqviV"&gt;The 48-inch TV could potentially offer the immersive benefits of a curved screen while gaming without forcing you to live with a curved screen’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/30/14439362/samsung-curved-tv-review-un40k6250af-mistake"&gt;many downsides&lt;/a&gt; when you just want to watch TV. You can briefly see the panel in action at the 19 second mark in LG Display’s video below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DSpm0B"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4spy-VVPI6E?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4RnRft"&gt;In terms of specs, LG Display is emphasizing the gaming capabilities of its prototype, which can bend with a radius of up to 1,000mm. It’s got a high refresh rate of 120Hz, a variable refresh rate range that goes from 40Hz to 120Hz, and a response time of 0.1 milliseconds. It’s also able to vibrate its screen to produce sound — a technique that LG Display has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/ces/2017/1/10/14222986/sony-bravia-oled-lg-display-ces-2017"&gt;previously shown off for its flat panels&lt;/a&gt; — though we imagine most gamers would probably prefer to use headphones or separate speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ySEIU"&gt;This new prototype is LG Display’s latest experiment with flexible OLEDs, which have previously included a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21054005/lg-rollable-oled-4k-tv-shipping-price-release-date-ces-2020"&gt;rollable TV&lt;/a&gt; that packs up into a compact box when not in use. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG Display is also showing off transparent OLED panels, which it thinks could be used in restaurants.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ihXdub"&gt;LG Display is also showing off a range of use cases for its transparent OLED displays at this year’s virtual CES show. These include a “Smart Bed” with a transparent OLED TV that rises out of its frame, a transparent restaurant display that allows diners to see chefs at work behind it, and train carriage windows that can also display customer information. On the consumer side, LG has also debuted a range of TVs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22203910/lg-qned-mini-led-4k-8k-lcd-tv-announced-ces-2021"&gt;featuring Mini LED display technology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Quibi reportedly in talks to sell its shows to Roku</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pl0qBr_VqgOM5mipiu2SejUaIsg=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68614488/gblackmon_200403_3960_quibi_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ziikWs"&gt;Failed mobile-first streaming service Quibi is in advanced discussions to sell the rights to its content library to Roku, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/roku-nears-deal-to-buy-rights-to-quibis-content-11609725389"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The report doesn’t indicate a potential price for the acquisition, and notes that the two parties may not reach a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gzf2ge"&gt;If it were to happen, the deal could give the Roku Channel exclusive access to Quibi’s slate of programming. None of Quibi’s shows ever really took off, but Roku may feel that the content would stand a better chance when available on the best-selling streaming devices in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Bynurc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Inside the final days of Quibi","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21559189/quibi-final-days-streaming-platform-coronavirus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="exg5Je"&gt;Quibi &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527197/quibi-streaming-service-mobile-shutting-down-end-katzenberg"&gt;announced it was shutting down&lt;/a&gt; back in October, just six months after its much-hyped launch. The service was headed by former HP CEO Meg Whitman and former Disney chairman and movie producer Jeffrey Katzenberg, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21165312/quibi-funding-investors-jeffrey-katzenberg-launch-date-price"&gt;managed to raise almost $2 billion in funding&lt;/a&gt; before the app was released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGGbMF"&gt;Katzenberg had already tried to get companies including Facebook and NBCUniversal to pick up Quibi programming ahead of its demise, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527131/quibi-shutdown-sale-streaming-jeffrey-katzenberg"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVxt62"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal, is an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company. Vox Media also has a deal with Quibi to produce a show, and there were early talks about a &lt;/em&gt;Verge&lt;em&gt; show as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung officially confirms Galaxy S21 event for January 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ajbzQ8Yvb3jHk4X3AL3VmkfYTpA=/52x0:616x376/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68613886/samsung_galaxy_s21_668_leak.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/08/exclusive-here-are-the-official-galaxy-s21-s21-and-s21-ultra-teasers/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="at34Jk"&gt;Samsung will officially be announcing its latest lineup of Galaxy flagship phones — rumored to be the Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra — on January 14th, the company confirmed through invitations to a new Galaxy Unpacked event. The tagline: “Welcome to the Everyday Epic.” The event will kick off at 7AM PT / 10AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPqWI5"&gt;The company is widely expected to announce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22202864/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-specs-leak"&gt;three new smartphones at the event&lt;/a&gt;, successors to last year’s Galaxy S20 lineup: a pair of matching S21 and S21 Plus phones (that are expected to be largely similar, except for size), and a more premium S21 Ultra model that will offer even better specs and cameras, similar to its 2020 counterpart, in addition to a curved display and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22196897/s-pen-uwb-comfirm-galaxy-s21-ultra-fcc"&gt;support for Samsung’s S-Pen stylus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ApD5hc"&gt;There’s not a lot to glean from the event teaser video you can watch at the top of this post, which appears to simply be the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/12/8/22163632/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-5g-teaser-video-leak"&gt;Galaxy S21’s camera module&lt;/a&gt; floating inside a translucent cube. But practically every detail of these new phones already seems to have leaked, including sharper animated GIFs of what those modules should look like:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S4zp2zRZ7UOWkc2_K4LUD2HHGqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154918/samsung_galaxy_s21_668_leak.gif"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

We wouldn’t be surprised if one or both appeared alongside the new phone lineup.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some T-Mobile customers’ call records may have been accessed in a recent breach</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-kXV0ACzrur5TiGSMEB2-j6Gmqc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68613397/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B5xWYh"&gt;T-Mobile suffered a security breach in December that may have exposed call-related information and phone numbers for some of its customers. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/t-mobile-data-breach-exposed-phone-numbers-call-records/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the information affected by the breach did &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; include names on customers’ accounts, physical or email addresses, financial data, credit card information, Social Security numbers, tax IDs, passwords, or PINs, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6YeCFC"&gt;T-Mobile said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it had notified “less than 0.2 percent” of its customers— which works out to about 200,000 people— that some account information may have been illegally accessed. That information “may have included phone numbers, number of lines subscribed to and in a small number of cases some call-related information collected as part of normal operation and service.” T-Mobile says it “identified this attack in early December and quickly shut down the incident.” Affected customers were notified via text message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzJhiJ"&gt;In a notice on its website, T-Mobile said its security team “shut down malicious, unauthorized access,” and it began an investigation to determine what information was involved. The company reported the situation to federal law enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwKFwg"&gt;T-Mobile has been victim to several data breaches in recent years; in 2018, hackers accessed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/24/17776836/tmobile-hack-data-breach-personal-information-two-million-customers"&gt;personal information for roughly 2 million customers&lt;/a&gt; that included names, addresses, and account numbers. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20978498/tmobile-security-disclosed-breach-prepaid-customers"&gt;2019, some of the company’s prepaid customers&lt;/a&gt; were affected by a breach that accessed names, addresses, and account numbers. And in &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fresponsibility%2Fconsumer-info%2Fpii-notice&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F3%2F22211839%2Ft-mobile-customers-call-records-hacker-security#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;March 2020, a breach&lt;/a&gt; exposed some T-Mobile customers’ financial information, Social Security numbers, and other account information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sc6JPR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1vgFX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Land, The Human Voice, and Pretend It’s a City</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LImNrcIjHKfAHPpjc04Am5F3k7w=/182x0:1445x842/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68612684/robib_wright.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Robin Wright in Land&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOw20FDNnHA&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;amp;ab_channel=FocusFeatures" target="_blank"&gt;Focus Features&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hB7lKx"&gt;The best thing I have watched in 2021 so far is the &lt;a href="https://ratatousical.com/"&gt;Ratatouille TikTok musical&lt;/a&gt;, it’s charming and the performances —by some big Broadway stars— are excellent. If you haven’t purchased your ticket yet (prices are on a pay-what-you-can scale), there’s still time; it will stream until January 4th. Ticket proceeds benefit the &lt;a href="https://actorsfund.org/"&gt;Actors Fund&lt;/a&gt;, a worthy cause. Be warned that the songs will definitely get stuck in your head, just like any good musical number does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9miaXp"&gt;In other news I just started &lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;... will report back. Saucy so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJYtgV"&gt;It’s kind of slim pickins this week for new trailers, but I found a couple of interesting ones that all happen to feature strong female protagonists, a fine tone to set for 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RxvDHa"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MClMxqD-HNA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mokhj9"&gt;Pretend It’s a City&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="YqjVrO"&gt;It’s no secret that Fran Lebowitz has &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;thoughts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; about many things, including her native New York City. Martin Scorsese directed this documentary featuring the legendary essayist doing what she does best: opining. She talks about tourists, Times Square, real estate, and notes that “it would take one subway ride for the Dalai Lama to turn into a lunatic, crazy person.” &lt;em&gt;Pretend It’s a City&lt;/em&gt; debuts on Netflix January 8th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gP687x"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G3lGM39dKuY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pCQhrc"&gt;The Human Voice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAVb8G"&gt;Director Pedro Almodovar makes his English-language debut with&lt;em&gt; The Human Voice&lt;/em&gt;, a 30-minute short film based on the Jean Cocteau one-act play of the same name. Tilda Swinton stars as a woman waiting for her ex to return to pick up his luggage (metaphor alert) but he never shows. I’m pretty much down for anything with Tilda in it. &lt;em&gt;The Human Voice&lt;/em&gt; is due for release later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eesIfK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sOw20FDNnHA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3JRoQj"&gt;Land&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zkKetR"&gt;Robin Wright directed and stars in this movie about a woman who ventures into the wilderness of the Rocky Mountains to get away from a tragedy— the trailer suggests it has to do with the loss of a child. She underestimates how brutal and difficult it will be to survive on her own and is rescued by a local hunter played by Demian Bichir. &lt;em&gt;Land&lt;/em&gt; is slated to be released in theaters February 12th (though it seems likely with everything going on that may get pushed back).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9WjXN4"&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>SolarWinds hack may be much worse than originally feared</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UFY6KYwZUR4OQ9lSCD0TsTSfkxI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68610303/acastro_170621_1777_0007_v2_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="engadget-post-contents"&gt;The Russia-linked SolarWinds hack which targeted US government agencies and private corporations may be even worse than officials first realized, with some 250 federal agencies and business now believed affected, the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/02/us/politics/russian-hacking-government.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBv42J"&gt;Microsoft has said the hackers compromised &lt;a href="https://www.solarwinds.com/securityadvisory"&gt;SolarWinds’ Orion monitoring and management software&lt;/a&gt;, allowing them to “impersonate any of the organization’s existing users and accounts, including highly privileged accounts.” The &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;reports that Russia exploited layers of the supply chain to access the agencies’ systems.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9VzH4"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reports that early warning sensors that Cyber Command and the NSA placed inside foreign networks to detect potential attacks appear to have failed in this instance. In addition, it seems likely that the US government’s attention on protecting the November elections from foreign hackers may have taken resources and focus away from the software supply chain, according to the &lt;em&gt;Times. &lt;/em&gt;And conducting the attack from within the US apparently allowed the hackers to evade detection by the Department of Homeland Security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n5crqX"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/31/microsoft-internal-solorigate-investigation-update/"&gt;said earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; it had discovered its systems were infiltrated “beyond just the presence of malicious SolarWinds code.” The hackers were able to “view source code in a number of source code repositories,” but the hacked account granting the access didn’t have permission to modify any code or systems. However, in a small bit of good news, Microsoft said it found “no evidence of access to production services or customer data,” and “no indications that our systems were used to attack others.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wn0yDw"&gt;Sen. Mark Warner (D-Virginia), ranking member on the Senate Intelligence Committee, told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; the hack looked “much, much worse” than he first feared. “The size of it keeps expanding,” he said. “It’s clear the United States government missed it.”&lt;/p&gt;
