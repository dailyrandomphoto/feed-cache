    <title>Dark Souls 3 exploit could let hackers take control of your entire computer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dark Souls 3 screenshots" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YTHWxKmMmN7Q7Zk9382B6jpxJRE=/388x0:5248x3240/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70421505/dark-souls-3-screenshot-2.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M7f1b9"&gt;A dangerous remote code execution (RCE) exploit found in &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls 3 &lt;/em&gt;could let a bad actor take control of your computer, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/dark-souls-3-players-risk-having-their-pc-bricked-if-they-play-online-1746144/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dexerto&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The vulnerability only puts PC gamers who play online at risk and may potentially affect &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls 2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774836/elden-ring-fromsoftware-hands-on-preview"&gt;the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Servers for various &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; games have since been shut down in response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnCGVy"&gt;The exploit was seen in action during &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1271478221"&gt;The__Grim__Sleeper’s Twitch stream&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls 3&lt;/em&gt; online. At the end of the stream (&lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1271478221?t=01h20m22s"&gt;1:20:22&lt;/a&gt;), The__Grim__Sleeper’s game crashes, and the robotic voice belonging to Microsoft’s text-to-speech generator suddenly starts criticizing his gameplay. The__Grim__Sleeper then reports that Microsoft PowerShell opened by itself, a sign that a hacker used the program to run a script that triggered the text-to-speech feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ERe6bV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;RCE is one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XW9R0Z"&gt;However, this likely wasn’t a malicious hacker — a &lt;a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/524597731121954816/934488192575500318/unknown.png"&gt;screenshotted post&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://discord.com/channels/81303778900316160/524597731121954816"&gt;SpeedSouls’ Discord&lt;/a&gt; may reveal the “hacker’s” actual intentions. According to the post, the “hacker” knew about the vulnerability and attempted to contact &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; developer FromSoftware about the issue. He was reportedly ignored, so he started using the hack on streamers to draw attention to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cj1Tb6"&gt;But if a bad actor discovered this problem first, the outcome could’ve been much worse. RCE is one of the most dangerous vulnerabilities, as &lt;a href="https://encyclopedia.kaspersky.com/glossary/remote-code-execution-rce/"&gt;noted by Kaspersky&lt;/a&gt;. It allows hackers to run malicious code on their victim’s computer, causing irreparable damage, and potentially stealing sensitive information while they’re at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpBRYI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/723"&gt;Blue Sentinel&lt;/a&gt;, a community-made anti-cheat mod for &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls 3&lt;/em&gt;, has since been patched to protect against the RCE vulnerability. In &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/darksouls3/comments/s9sd3w/new_remote_code_execution_vulnerability_discovered/"&gt;a post on the r/darksouls3 subreddit&lt;/a&gt;, a user explains that (hopefully) only four people know how to execute the RCE hack — two of which are Blue Sentinel developers, and the other two are people “who worked on it,” possibly referring to the individuals who helped uncover the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpZ7XD"&gt;A representative for Bandai Namco, &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls’&lt;/em&gt; publisher, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/s9wai2/it_is_now_possible_for_dark_souls_3_invaders_to/htsgybl/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;commented on a Reddit post&lt;/a&gt; in response to the issue, stating: “Thanks very much for the ping, a report on this topic was submitted to the relevant internal teams earlier today, the information is much appreciated!” &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to Bandai Namco with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="amdAag"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;PvP servers for Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls 2, and Dark Souls: Remastered have been temporarily deactivated to allow the team to investigate recent reports of an issue with online services. &lt;br&gt;Servers for Dark Souls: PtDE will join them shortly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We apologize for this inconvenience.&lt;/p&gt;— Dark Souls (@DarkSoulsGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DarkSoulsGame/status/1485210967009071108?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 23, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tHelEw"&gt;Fortunately, it seems like FromSoftware and Bandai Namco are addressing the issue. Early Sunday morning, the &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; Twitter account announced that PvP servers for &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls: Remastered, Dark Souls 2, and&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls 3 &lt;/em&gt;have been temporarily shut down “to allow the team to investigate recent reports of an issue with online services.” It adds that the servers for &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls: Prepare to Die Edition&lt;/em&gt; will also be deactivated soon. This only affects PC players — if you’re playing on PlayStation or Xbox, you can still play online. There’s no word on when servers will be back up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KqTN1n"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 23rd 10:50AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to add that the servers for &lt;/em&gt;Dark Souls: Remastered&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Dark Souls 2&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Dark Souls 3, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Dark Souls: PtDE&lt;em&gt; have been temporarily shut down.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>European Parliament approves initial proposal to ban some targeted ads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_fP9u2vJpa8b-XAdIqIg655W68I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70422751/acastro_1800724_1777_EU_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WR8eOJ"&gt;On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20220114IPR21017/digital-services-act-regulating-platforms-for-a-safer-online-space-for-users"&gt;the European Parliament voted to approve&lt;/a&gt; the initial draft of a bill that aims to curb Big Tech’s invasive advertising practices (via &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-20/facebook-google-face-tighter-ad-tracking-curbs-in-europe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The Parliament adopted the draft with 530 votes of approval, 78 against, and 80 absentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rblH9L"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_20_2348"&gt;Digital Services Act&lt;/a&gt;, which was &lt;a href="http://cnbc.com/2020/12/15/digital-markets-act-eus-new-rules-on-big-tech.html"&gt;first introduced in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, will prevent platforms, like Google, Amazon, and the Meta-owned Facebook, from using sensitive information, such as sexual orientation, race, and religion for targeted ads. It will require services to give users the ability to easily opt out of tracking, and pressures platforms to remove illegal content and products online, including hate speech or counterfeit goods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D28QhX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yes! with a huge majority, the European Parliament adopted the Digital Services Act. A big win, with support from left to right  !&lt;br&gt;Special thanks to all the colleagues that worked so hard to achieve this result. (cc &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SchaldemoseMEP?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@SchaldemoseMEP&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DSA?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DSA&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DigitalServicesAct?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DigitalServicesAct&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/1wiVfCqlw2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1wiVfCqlw2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Paul Tang (@paultang) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/paultang/status/1484183043552153607?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VY5vAF"&gt;“With a huge majority, the European Parliament adopted the Digital Services Act,” Dutch politician and Parliament member Paul Tang wrote on Twitter. “A big win, with support from left to right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqWCjg"&gt;The approved proposal also includes two rules that &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/key-eu-parliament-committee-agrees-tough-position-dsa-tech-rules-2021-12-14/"&gt;the Parliament agreed on last month&lt;/a&gt;: a ban on both targeted ads for minors and &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22351108/dark-patterns-ui-web-design-privacy"&gt;dark patterns&lt;/a&gt;, a practice that some platforms use to trick users into agreeing to share their data. Any company in violation of these policies could face fines of up to six percent of its global revenue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5QTqs5"&gt;As noted by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, the Digital Services Act still has more hurdles to overcome; negotiations with the European Council start on January 31st. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889903/democrats-targeted-advertising-facebook-google-surveillance"&gt;US Democrats introduced a similar bill last week&lt;/a&gt;, which would also ban targeted advertising if passed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yet another TV show features a character having a heart attack on a Peloton</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RkympJ5NeP1THxDzOpdSDCKorzI=/468x0:2880x1608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70422701/Screen_Shot_2022_01_21_at_18.03.12.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fitness company can’t catch a break on TV.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Showtime&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZF0vOs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers ahead for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Just Like That... &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Billions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ws5nbR"&gt;Peloton really can’t catch a break. Not only did &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893462/peloton-bikes-treadmills-production-connected-fitness"&gt;rumors it’s temporarily suspending production of its connected bikes and treadmills&lt;/a&gt; send the stock plunging on Thursday, but — in a plot twist worthy of the big screen — a &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; TV show character has been shown having a heart attack while riding a Peloton. This comes just over a month after a beloved character from &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City&lt;/em&gt; was killed off after a workout on one of the company’s bikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="1E4DbJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mr. Big’s ghost rides again to haunt Peloton&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yO8zDF"&gt;In the season six premiere of &lt;em&gt;Billions &lt;/em&gt;(available in an early release via streaming, including for &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQdhtNHcOjQ"&gt;free on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of the show’s usual Sunday night time slot), the character Wags’ Peloton ride is &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/kQdhtNHcOjQ?t=360"&gt;interrupted by EMTs who tell him he’s having a heart attack&lt;/a&gt;. (The medics were called by his bosses who were secretly getting heart rate data from an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22789248/oura-ring-3-review-sleep-tracker-fitness-tracker"&gt;Oura-like ring&lt;/a&gt; and initially suspect a different kind of late-night workout.) When he returns to the office, he even makes a reference to the now-infamous scene from last month: “I’m not going out like Mr. Big!” he triumphantly announces to his co-workers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="Iq64JI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kQdhtNHcOjQ?rel=0&amp;amp;start=297" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SdQFSZ"&gt;Mr. Big may be gone from &lt;em&gt;And Just Like That&lt;/em&gt;, but he’s been haunting Peloton. First, of course, was the fictional character’s death, which &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/10/peloton-selloff-continues-as-sex-and-the-city-reboot-adds-to-image-issues.html"&gt;hurt the company’s very real stock prices&lt;/a&gt;. Then, Peloton &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/13/22831861/peloton-and-just-like-that-big-commercial-response"&gt;tried to quickly turn the situation around&lt;/a&gt; with an ad featuring Ryan Reynolds and Mr. Big’s actor, Chris Noth. The ad directly calls out the show, explaining the health benefits of regular cycling and ending with “he’s alive.” Days later, Peloton &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/17/22841034/peloton-viral-ads-sex-and-the-city-mr-big-chris-noth-sexual-assault"&gt;scrubbed the ad from the internet&lt;/a&gt; after two women accused Noth of sexual assault.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJpj1f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billions&lt;/em&gt; using almost the same plot point as &lt;em&gt;And Just Like That&lt;/em&gt; is completely coincidental, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/21/arts/television/billions-peloton-premiere.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The scene was apparently written and shot early last year, and the line about Mr. Big was dubbed in after the fact. Even as someone who doesn’t watch &lt;em&gt;Billions&lt;/em&gt;, this serendipity is delightful — though I don’t imagine Peloton would agree. While the company hasn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893462/peloton-bikes-treadmills-production-connected-fitness"&gt;blamed Wag’s extravagant lifestyle for the heart condition&lt;/a&gt;, it did point out to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; the virtues of a good cardio workout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RWSVfF"&gt;I’m inclined to agree. I’m feeling great after the ab workout that laughing about this whole situation has given me. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp may soon let you transfer your chats from Android to iOS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8_fa6K0moCEDnL4kdB3lx_d2158=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70421195/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LltKLa"&gt;WhatsApp might be working on a feature that lets you migrate your chat history from Android to iOS, as reported by &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-messenger-beta-for-ios-22-2-74-whats-new/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; via (&lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/whatsapp-chat-history-migration-from-android-ios-preview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mtMaU"&gt;The feature was first spotted in the latest WhatsApp beta version 22.2.74 for iOS, and appears to corroborate &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-beta-for-android-2-21-20-11-whats-new/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt;s&lt;/em&gt; previous discovery in beta version 2.21.20.11 for Android&lt;/a&gt;. Both updates point towards a feature that may let you transfer your WhatsApp chats from Android to iOS using the &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apple.movetoios"&gt;Move to iOS app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uRDR8NY6aSSsqg_8fQn91Qej9S4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23187939/wa_chat_history_android_to_ios.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-messenger-beta-for-ios-22-2-74-whats-new/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WaBetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eZPKQH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; also shared a couple of screenshots that show what the feature may look like. Judging by the images, it appears WhatsApp will ask for permission before starting the transfer process, and will then instruct you to keep the app open and your phone unlocked as it migrates your chats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKe9NE"&gt;WhatsApp first started letting users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655753/migrate-iphone-whatsapp-data-chat-history-samsung-phone"&gt;migrate their chat histories from iOS to Samsung phones&lt;/a&gt; in September, and later extended the feature to support chat transfers from iOS to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747446/whatsapp-chat-migrate-iphone-pixel-android-12"&gt;Google Pixels and other Android 12 devices&lt;/a&gt;. Letting users transfer their chats from Android to iOS would close an obvious loop, but it remains unclear which devices will support the rumored feature, as well as when (or if) it will start rolling out.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="FQXv71"&gt;The United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee is telling athletes to ditch their personal phones for burners ahead of next month’s Winter Olympics in China, according to a report from the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/team-usa-athletes-beijing-olympics-phones-11642177765"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/us-wants-athletes-use-burner-phones-beijing-winter-olympics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zwduFv"&gt;&lt;q&gt; “Every device, communication, transaction and online activity may be monitored”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wpul9o"&gt;The advisory was reportedly sent out twice last year to warn athletes about the possibility of digital surveillance while in China. “Every device, communication, transaction and online activity may be monitored,” the bulletin states. “Your device(s) may also be compromised with malicious software, which could negatively impact future use.” As noted by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, Great Britain, Canada, and the Netherlands have also cautioned athletes against bringing their personal electronics into the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlKoIN"&gt;The Committee’s fears aren’t unfounded. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/2/20679053/china-spyware-tourists-android-phones-xinjiang"&gt;China was caught secretly installing spyware on tourists’ phones&lt;/a&gt; who entered from the Xinjiang region. This &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745068/best-buy-home-depot-lorex-ezviz-uyghur-surveillance-sales-dji"&gt;heavily-surveilled area&lt;/a&gt; is populated by the Uyghurs, a predominantly Muslim ethnic minority that &lt;a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2021/06/china-draconian-repression-of-muslims-in-xinjiang-amounts-to-crimes-against-humanity/"&gt;China has subjected to imprisonment and torture&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, research group &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2022/01/cross-country-exposure-analysis-my2022-olympics-app/"&gt;Citizen Lab found that China’s My2022 Olympic app&lt;/a&gt;, which all attendees are required to install, is full of security holes that could lead to privacy breaches, surveillance, and hacking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGfdAe"&gt;Back when Beijing held the 2008 Summer Olympics, &lt;a href="https://www.popularmechanics.com/military/a12076/4276361/"&gt;the US Department of Homeland Security issued a similar advisory&lt;/a&gt; for any travelers headed to China, warning that bringing any devices potentially exposes them to “unauthorized access and theft of data by criminal or foreign government elements.” Things are a bit different this time around, however, as &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/29/beijing-olympics-to-ban-foreign-spectators-implement-covid-vaccination-protocols.html"&gt;China has banned all foreign spectators&lt;/a&gt; due to concerns over COVID-19. Athletes will likely be relying on their mobile devices to stay in touch with friends and family, which could be more complicated on a burner phone that comes with limits on mobile data, texting, and calling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6cW1l"&gt;But even if the Olympic athletes want to use their burner phones to browse the internet, they still might not get unlimited access. During the 2008 Olympics, China promised to offer spectators, journalists, and athletes unrestricted access to the web, since &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/which-websites-and-online-services-are-banned-in-china"&gt;The Great Firewall of China currently blocks a number of popular websites&lt;/a&gt; in the country, like Google, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, Netflix, and more. China didn’t seem to follow through on its promise, however. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/31/sports/olympics/31china.html"&gt;Journalists reported that they still weren’t able to access certain websites&lt;/a&gt;, including BBC China, a number of Hong Kong newspapers, as well as the site for human rights organization Amnesty International. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0GABh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2022/01/07/china-winter-olympics-beijing-omicron/"&gt;China has once again said&lt;/a&gt; it will give athletes and journalists uncensored access to the internet, but it’s unclear if the country will still block certain sites.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NYC Mayor takes pay cut as cryptocurrency market plunges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Conference Of Mayors Held In Washington, DC" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kbqnW5DWQ7G94vJV0oEA4LAuX8s=/0x0:5585x3723/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70420482/1365932278.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xCcGAh"&gt;Even in the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-21/crypto-meltdown-erases-more-than-1-trillion-in-market-value"&gt;midst of a crypto slump&lt;/a&gt;, New York City Mayor Eric Adams isn’t backing out of his plans to take his first three paychecks in Bitcoin and Ethereum. Bitcoin fell beneath $36,000 on Friday — &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-price-falls-below-40-000-in-tandem-with-tech-selloff-11642765835"&gt;a 47 percent dive&lt;/a&gt; from its all-time high in November — dragging the &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2022/01/21/crypto-market-cap-falls-below-2t-amid-selloff/"&gt;entire cryptocurrency market cap below $2 trillion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GjQewL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If the crypto market continues to trend downwards, Adams’ first check may evaporate&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PgIn0l"&gt;Adams officially received his first paycheck yesterday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893275/nyc-mayor-adams-convert-paycheck-cryptocurrency-coinbase-bitcoin-ethereum"&gt;which was converted to Bitcoin and Ethereum&lt;/a&gt; through cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. According to the &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2022/01/20/eric-adams-converting-first-paycheck-as-nyc-mayor-to-bitcoin-ethereum/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the NYC mayor receives biweekly paychecks of about $5,900, amounting to a salary of $258,750 a year. Adams didn’t reveal how much of his $5,900 check is split between Bitcoin and Ethereum, but if the crypto market continues to trend downwards, the funds from Adams’ first check may quickly evaporate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tGtGDR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22764104/new-york-city-mayor-elect-eric-adams-announces-bitcoin-paycheck-miami"&gt;Mayor Adams announced he would&lt;/a&gt; take his first three paychecks in Bitcoin last November (which, of course, was just before &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/11/11/bitcoin-retreats-from-all-time-high-ether-follows/"&gt;Bitcoin reached a record $69,000&lt;/a&gt;). The move came out of a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ericadamsfornyc/status/1456311827550384129?s=20"&gt;Twitter exchange&lt;/a&gt; between Adams and Miami Mayor Francis Suarez, who said he would receive his next paycheck in Bitcoin. Adams wanted to take things a bit further, though, electing to get not one, but three paychecks in digital currency, as part of his bid to &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/041-22/mayor-adams-receive-first-paycheck-cryptocurrency"&gt;turn NYC into “the center of cryptocurrency.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISPlFk"&gt;Mayor Adams is but one of a number of high-profile figures to take their paychecks in cryptocurrency. &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/7-nfl-players-that-chose-crypto-over-cash-salaries"&gt;NFL players including Aaron Rodgers&lt;/a&gt;, Tom Brady, and Odell Beckham Jr. have also chosen to convert a portion, if not their entire salaries into cryptocurrency. The current crypto slump is likely wringing out their digital wallets even more so than Adams’, however, as all three players switched over their salaries when Bitcoin was at its highest last fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0wgytC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube TV is $10 off for your first three months </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_9nqWHrIG9OH3EP7eutbM8rVLLA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70420349/akrales_181010_2991_0038.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New YouTube TV subscribers can pay YouTube TV $54.99 each month instead of $64.99.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y0ADTn"&gt;Just in time for Super Bowl season, a three-month subscription to the YouTube TV streaming service is a little more affordable. Right now, new subscribers can &lt;a href="https://tv.youtube.com/welcome/"&gt;pay $54.99 each month instead of $64.99 for your first three months&lt;/a&gt;. Normally, that would cost you around $195, so that means you’ll pay $165 by the end of this discount period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lx08Ii"&gt;That’s still expensive, but it’s a welcome discount for a service that significantly gone up in price within the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/12/17109018/youtube-tv-price-change-signup-grandfathered-google"&gt;last few years&lt;/a&gt;. Nevertheless, it’s a solid streaming app if you want many channels on-demand (with DVR capabilities available), presented in a familiar YouTube interface. For this price, you’ll get access to over 85 major channels, covering live sports, news, entertainment, and more. It also includes unlimited recording for up to six accounts, and you can cancel whenever you’d like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CNS9ey"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10989551"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="zz8Pdv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s why streaming services are always duking it out over channels","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/20/22846634/youtube-tv-disney-streaming-channels-dispute-espn-fx"},{"title":"Super Bowl 2022 won’t stream in 4K on NBC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22878110/super-bowl-lvi-2022-no-4k-streaming"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="RDiInC"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="AirPods Max: the good, the bad and a mic test|99774" data-volume-uuid="c4072aa82" data-volume-id="99774" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-512" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="on3ady"&gt;Apple’s AirPods Max over-ear headphones sold for their lowest price ever during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. In case you missed out on that deal, you have another chance at saving big today. For the first time since the holidays, you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Silver/dp/B08PZJN7BD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy the headphones in the sky blue colorway for $449 from Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is just $20 shy of their best price ever. That equates to a savings of $100 on some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; you can buy right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KCQQ7R"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;we noted in our review&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s over-ear headphones offer excellent sound quality, while boasting great spatial audio features so you can better immerse yourself in a movie or  compatible music. The headphones are comfortable to wear for a long time as well thanks to their breathable knit mesh canopy. While $449 is still quite expensive, this could be a good deal for those deeply embedded within the Apple ecosystem given how seamlessly these headphones can also pair with other Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XA9McH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yvE4iK"&gt;When we first published &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt; of Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra one year ago, we called it the best Android phone on the market. We were impressed with the huge phone’s excellent camera system, as well as its stunning 6.8-inch dynamic OLED screen that boasts a high refresh rate. We appreciated its lengthy battery life, too, as well as how fast the  Snapdragon 888 processor-powered phone is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Raudj"&gt;Though, almost a full year out from its release, we wouldn’t suggest paying $1,199.99 — its original price. However, if you can be swayed by a decent deal, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N2MSSZY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling the phantom black, 128GB model for $1049.99 today&lt;/a&gt;, saving you $150. That’s the lowest we’ve seen it sell for since the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67VNhH"&gt;Note, Samsung will soon release the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22870027/samsung-s22-series-unofficial-dummy-leak-design-camera-specs"&gt;Galaxy S22 series&lt;/a&gt;. It’s unclear exactly when, but that means we’ll likely see even more discounts on the Galaxy S21 lineup sooner rather than later. Still, if you can’t wait, this is a good deal for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AoP20p"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326077"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="lvmHwQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Want to preorder Samsung’s next Galaxy phone sight unseen? You can","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893756/samsung-galaxy-s22-2022-preorders"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ab5Gu2"&gt;On the market for a budget-friendly tablet? Amazon is selling its 2020 Fire HD 8 tablets for half-off, with the ad-supported, 32GB base model &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07TMJ1R3X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $44.99 instead of $89.99&lt;/a&gt;. If you want slightly more RAM and wireless charging, the Fire HD 8 Plus is also 50 percent off, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0839NDRB2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling for $54.99 instead of $109.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5I7pLX"&gt;Regardless of which you buy, both offer a USB-C port for faster charging, and have a faster processor than their predecessors. While app selection is limited to Amazon’s Appstore, that still gives you access to the likes of Netflix, Hulu, Facebook, Zoom, Outlook, and more. If you’re leaning toward the Fire HD 8 Plus, &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21294989/fire-hd-8-plus-review-amazon-prime-android-tablet-fireos-price"&gt;Dieter Bohn pointed out&lt;/a&gt; in his review that you can use the Plus as an Echo Show if you &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09MP4PNYG/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;purchase Amazon’s wireless charging dock alongside the tablet&lt;/a&gt;. Doing so costs $108, down from $163.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1fLyTb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10882618"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="t6bbI0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736517"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BXkoFx"&gt;Here are some even more deals to treat yourself to this weekend:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rUrVrp"&gt;Typically $59.99, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F265419191923%3Famdata%3Denc%253AAQAGAAAAkHzZbW8KkgQEADiqzkcqzSQgmhXsDBMhRufhkwVazKmaFBPeBDG82c%252FRmtwDbnCzhMqvq7yXrDR2PPTZy%252F9vFsysnuyNx5wGB%252FL4xiibIrnlaELM03nhesgW0oaZcTAlOogZvdMHW9b8n6EuttuaZIADxG3YYMFG5WBFm9zHztRfwoxxh3ksNJLLamCrfpuhiw%253D%253D%257Ctkp%253ABFBMnv6xpNBf%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F22%2F22894955%2Fyoutube-tv-apple-airpods-xbox-headset-amazon-fire-tablet-ravpower-myq-chamberlain-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft’s official eBay storefront is selling wired Xbox One gaming headsets for just $19.99.&lt;/a&gt;  While it’s not &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632185/microsoft-new-xbox-wired-stereo-headset-series-x-s-pc-headphones-features-price"&gt;the latest version&lt;/a&gt;, it should be suitable if you don’t want to spend too much on a headset.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BNVlyp"&gt;Apple’s Magic Keyboard, which is compatible with 11-inch iPad Pros (2018 and up) and the fourth-gen iPad Air, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/1066108/9383?subId1=TheVergeDailyDeals1212022&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMagic-Keyboard-for-11-inch-iPad-Pro-1st-2nd-or-3rd-Generation-and-iPad-Air-4th-Generation-iPad-Not-Included%2F984505060&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is selling for $229 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a $70 discount on the keyboard, which you can use to transform your tablet into something that’s more like a laptop. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1UA0vo"&gt;The popular &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GD3D9YJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;myQ Chamberlain smart garage door controller is once again selling for $19.98 instead of $29.98&lt;/a&gt; for the first time since the holidays, which is just $2 shy of its Black Friday price. This model supports &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Key-In-Garage-Delivery/"&gt;Amazon Key&lt;/a&gt;, giving drivers the ability to securely drop packages off in your garage.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="Xiqt3Q"&gt;LaCie’s Rugged Mini 4TB external hard drive is on sale, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LaCie-Rugged-External-Portable-LAC9000298/dp/B01789QMUW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling for $129.99 instead of $159.&lt;/a&gt; If you need less storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LaCie-Rugged-External-Portable-LAC9000298/dp/B0058VIWTM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB model is $69.99 instead of $84.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Hint: It’s not about the chip shortage&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="hz9sdp"&gt;On Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/21/22894612/intel-ohio-chip-plant-20-billion-processor-shortage"&gt;Intel announced it would build&lt;/a&gt; the “largest silicon manufacturing location on the planet” here in the United States, on a 1,000-acre plot of land in New Albany, Ohio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vGImjb"&gt;Hours later, President Biden, Ohio governor Mike DeWine, US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, and other executives and local officials suggested the up-to-$100 billion development could be a panacea for a wide variety of issues, too — including global competitiveness, national security, the chip shortage, the high price of cars, racial and gender gaps in STEM employment, even inflation itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1tY6N"&gt;It could become Ohio’s version of California’s Silicon Valley, several suggested. The phrase “Silicon Heartland” was uttered at least eight times across two livestreams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHTCD5"&gt;There’s no question that the investment is a big deal &lt;em&gt;for Intel&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22597713/intel-7nm-delay-summer-2020-apple-arm-switch-roadmap-gelsinger-ceo"&gt;which has been clawing its way back from the brink of potential irrelevance&lt;/a&gt; by fundamentally changing its entire outlook on the industry: doubling down on manufacturing, building chips for competitors, and relying on some competitors to help build chips of its own. It’s the first time Intel’s breaking ground on a new manufacturing site in 40 years. (Intel’s Arizona, New Mexico and Oregon expansions joined existing facilities.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZoc5F"&gt;And, of course, it could be a huge deal for Ohio, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alaRWa"&gt;But inflation? Car prices? $100 billion in investment? Let’s back up a second. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GzXHiY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is Intel actually promising in Ohio? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SVjcDF"&gt;To Intel’s credit, its own statements on the subject have been fairly clear: it’s a $20 billion initial investment in two fabs (short for fabrication plants; they typically produce silicon wafers), with construction beginning in late 2022 and the facility expected to open in late 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YglpA2"&gt;“If there’s a concrete truck in the state of Ohio that’s not working for me next year, I want to know about it,” joked Gelsinger on the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mCctxL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;$100 billion is a stretch goal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g70LIn"&gt;The rest of Intel’s promises are fuzzier — like the idea that the Ohio site might wind up housing eight fabs instead of just two. “At full buildout, the total investment in the site could grow to as much as $100 billion over the next decade, making it one of the largest semiconductor manufacturing sites in the world,” reads Intel’s press release. But that isn’t a firm commitment — it’s more of a stretch goal if Intel gets federal subsidies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ghKEH6"&gt;“We have a goal of investing as much as $100B over the next decade, but without federal government support, that goal will be difficult to reach in that time frame,” Intel spokesperson William Moss confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;The initial $20 billion investment doesn’t depend on federal subsidies, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgRSkH"&gt;Intel is also giving itself a decade to spend $100 million on education — “to help develop and attract a pipeline of skilled talent from within the region” — while promising approximately 3,000 Intel jobs, 7,000 construction jobs, and that 140 existing Ohio companies will do business with Intel as suppliers. Intel suggests the average annual salary at its facilities will be $135,000.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EGnBpZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How could any of that solve today’s chip shortage, car prices, and inflation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZigOj"&gt;It can’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYauDO"&gt;While the chip shortage is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;gigantic supply chain issue that is absolutely affecting the auto industry&lt;/a&gt;, leading chipmakers agree it’s slated to ease in the second half of 2022, and this plant won’t be operating until 2025 at the earliest. “Given this fab goes online in 2025 it won’t have any impact on the current chip crisis,” says Moor Insights &amp;amp; Strategy analyst Pat Moorhead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MxSFgR"&gt;Also, Intel doesn’t produce chips for cars, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22380555/intel-chips-automotive-industry-car-companies-fabs-production-pat-gelsinger"&gt;at least not yet&lt;/a&gt;. Intel had nothing to do with the shortage of car chips. (Intel did buy autonomous driving chip company Mobileye in 2017, but its chips are produced by TSMC.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lXAt6E"&gt;None of that stopped US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo and Ohio Governor Mike DeWine from repeatedly bringing up cars and tying them to inflation, though. “Car prices are driving a third of inflation because we don’t have enough chips,” said Raimondo, adding that each electric vehicle requires 2,000 chips. “So that’s why today’s announcement from Intel is so exciting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JypZq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will the Ohio plant actually make?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVR978"&gt;Intel hasn’t offered details yet, but Gelsinger said in the presentation that it will produce advanced chips at process nodes “2nm and below.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYf9dz"&gt;“What we have said is that the Ohio factories are designed for the ‘Angstrom era,’ with support for Intel’s most advanced process technologies, including &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.intel.com_content_www_us_en_newsroom_news_intel-2Daccelerates-2Dprocess-2Dpackaging-2Dinnovations.html&amp;amp;d=DwMGaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=XbPQjtdhJg1hC5-IccTkDxSrqhL0VWnmU2huSyK6TFc&amp;amp;m=CuNPIv1D9MydfLjeVh9u1X_6g_7EKxWuuzbnnf2iSIAvLzI4ahSJo1jYFmJl9yzR&amp;amp;s=9DRolgScPj1VjruB7fWBwDJpV8ltXvxaoVuj9xJ8OiU&amp;amp;e="&gt;Intel 18A&lt;/a&gt;,” an Intel spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t65crq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Would it actually be the “largest silicon manufacturing location on the planet”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SACDiG"&gt;It might be, but probably not for long. In August 2020, &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/16gb-lpddr5-dram-largest-semiconductor/"&gt;Samsung announced&lt;/a&gt; that it had begun producing memory chips on the largest production line in the world — Pyeongtaek Line 2, roughly the size of 16 soccer fields. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2Tn2a"&gt;But Intel manufacturing and supply chain boss Keyvan Esfarjani said its Ohio facility might be 30 football fields in size, with clean rooms as large as four football fields each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ESl67Hyf2ktFljV3U2l1OYTzOZM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23186346/Pyeongtaek_Semiconductor_DRAM_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;One of Samsung’s Pyeongtaek facilities.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3wt5Y"&gt;However, Samsung’s Pyeongtaek Line 2 is just &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of the facilities in the area, and &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Samsung-turns-South-Korea-garrison-city-into-chipmaking-boom-town"&gt;Japan’s Nikkei reports&lt;/a&gt; that a new, third Samsung fab will have clean rooms that fit 25 soccer fields, compared to Intel’s four. Plus, soccer fields are larger than football fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nLTbx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If the actual promise is $20 billion for two fabs, and Intel &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;already spent $20 billion for two new fabs in Arizona&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;and it won’t ease the shortage, why is this such a big deal?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emhGSP"&gt;It’s a big deal! It’s just not a &lt;em&gt;bigger&lt;/em&gt; deal. As of today, the deal is the exact same size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8WN5S"&gt;But the Biden administration and Ohio really want to be seen doing something important for the economy — and Biden can use it to pressure the House of Representatives to pass a key piece of legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmOA8Z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me more&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATAxCM"&gt;Remember how Intel’s hoping for a federal subsidy to help build out the Ohio fabs? There’s one waiting in the wings — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375814/biden-google-ceo-summit-budget-semiconductor-shortage"&gt;Last April,&lt;/a&gt; Biden called for federal funding to ease the semiconductor shortage, and the Senate answered in June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22457293/semiconductor-chip-shortage-funding-frontier-china-competition-act"&gt;passing a bill that would provide $52 billion for domestic semiconductor manufacturing&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tirM2n"&gt;But it never passed the House of Representatives. Even though the so-called “CHIPS Act” has bipartisan support, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/enterprise/chips-manufacturing-congress-subsidy"&gt;it’s been stalled in the House ever since&lt;/a&gt;, so the money isn’t available. So Biden held up Intel and Ohio as an example of what’s possible if we invest in domestic chipmaking, while raising the specter of national security and global competitiveness concerns if we fail to pass the bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q34a8T"&gt;“We were ranked number one in the world in R&amp;amp;D. But guess what? We now rank number nine,” said Biden, pointing how much US chip manufacturing has receded. “Today, 75 percent of production takes place in East Asia. 90 percent of the most advanced chips are made in Taiwan.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBK4Ok"&gt;“This project will be bigger and faster with the CHIPS Act,” Intel CEO Gelsinger stated on the Biden call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3TcXAf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there something to the national security concern?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBipBE"&gt;Perhaps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaRKVH"&gt;The public has never heard evidence of Chinese chips being used to spy on the United States outside of one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/8/17951174/apple-amazon-spy-chip-china-microchip"&gt;widely criticized&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report, but that hasn’t stopped the United States from repeatedly cracking down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21422939/huawei-zte-us-phone-networks-fcc-congress-reimbursement-cost"&gt;on Chinese telecommunications vendors in particular&lt;/a&gt; due to unspecified national security concerns, and Biden has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22516719/biden-executive-order-american-investment-chinese-firms-huawei-zte"&gt;actually expanded Trump-era bans&lt;/a&gt; on American investment in companies with ties to the Chinese military.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6cifDL"&gt;There are other forms of national security concerns, too: “If China attacked Taiwan or if North Korea attacked South Korea, the US would not have access to leading edge semiconductors, which is an issue,” says Moorhead. “This deal is mostly about diversifying where leading edge manufacturing is done to protect US interests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqy8ED"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about economic competitiveness? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVWtU1"&gt;Every little bit helps, I imagine, but even if the House approved $52 billion in funding for domestic semiconductor manufacturing and Intel spent the full $100 billion in Ohio — again, over a decade — they’ll still be completely dwarfed by chip giants TSMC and Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4E34IO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Tech/Semiconductors/Samsung-turns-South-Korea-garrison-city-into-chipmaking-boom-town"&gt;The Nikkei report&lt;/a&gt; points out that Samsung invests $25 billion &lt;em&gt;each year &lt;/em&gt;on chipmaking, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/13/22881576/tsmc-capital-investment-2022-chip-manufacturer-demand-increase"&gt;TSMC has earmarked a record $44 billion&lt;/a&gt; on manufacturing capacity in 2022 alone, after spending $30 billion in 2021. At that rate, it seems unlikely Intel would catch up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1Sob8"&gt;As far as global competitiveness, there’s hope that when Intel chooses to build new fabs in the United States, others will follow suit — and that does appear to be happening, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22245325/samsung-building-chipmaking-fab-texas-taylor"&gt;Samsung promising to build a $17 billion advanced chipmaking plant in Taylor, Texas&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/15/tsmc-eyes-expansion-in-us-japan-to-meet-sustained-chip-demand.html"&gt;both TSMC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2021/12/30/2003770394"&gt;its suppliers&lt;/a&gt; reportedly mulling additional investments in Arizona.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXLC4j"&gt;But Intel isn’t necessarily just playing for the US. It’s planning to open more fabs in Europe as well — &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/intel-says-it-will-reserve-ireland-chip-factory-capacity-automakers-2021-09-07/"&gt;by investing up to 80 billion euros ($90 billion US) over the next decade&lt;/a&gt;. In November, Margrethe Vestager, head of the EU’s antitrust division, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-12/eu-s-vestager-warns-of-chip-subsidy-race-as-intel-weighs-plant?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;warned that chipmakers might play governments “against each other”&lt;/a&gt; to get government subsidies. Reportedly, Intel will start its European expansion &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-23/intel-to-expand-in-france-germany-and-italy-in-comeback-effort"&gt;in France, Germany, and Italy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xe5tAC"&gt;“We hope to be able to make an announcement about major, new EU investment plans within the next several months,” Intel tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ppNV-PBp1R4fchChx15nOkSH7xc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23186510/image__2_.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The shape of Intel’s initial plans in Ohio.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lr2xPL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Will Ohio become a new Silicon Valley? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kzAvx"&gt;I would argue that Silicon Valley is unique, because it’s about a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; more than semiconductor manufacturing — it’s the mass accumulation of talent and investment and investors themselves, complete with all the problems (like crazy housing prices!) they cause. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dw8O9j"&gt;During his presentation, Intel’s CEO seemed to have a slightly looser definition: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rto4iw"&gt;“When we moved to Oregon, we established the Silicon Forest. When we went to Arizona, we helped to establish the Silicon Desert. We went to Ireland, we helped to create the Silicon Isle. We went to Israel, and we helped to establish the Silicon Oasis,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtWOZr"&gt;(&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_technology_centers#Places_with_%22Silicon%22_names"&gt;Here are more “Silicon” place names&lt;/a&gt; if you want.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVnOuC"&gt;That aside, &lt;a href="https://time.com/6140476/intel-building-factory-ohio/?s=09"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that New Albany, Ohio, is far more developed than outsiders might know, is one of the wealthiest places in Ohio, and that Intel isn’t the first big tech company to break ground. Google, Amazon, and Meta all have data centers there — all of them part of &lt;a href="https://newalbanycompany.com/business/new-albany-business-park/"&gt;the sprawling New Albany International Business Park.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cTTEMk333j23U5-aHCJx_isuGkk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23186466/new_albany_business_park.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: New Albany Company&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The upper-right-hand corner might be where Intel’s facility will lie.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VEb6NA"&gt;It appears that Intel liked the idea of being associated with wealthy New Albany, by the way. Technically, the land underneath Intel’s new facilities was part of Jersey Township, &lt;a href="https://www.newarkadvocate.com/story/business/2022/01/10/possible-semiconductor-factory-could-biggest-investment-ohio/9164479002/"&gt;until New Albany annexed that exact parcel this year&lt;/a&gt;, just ahead of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3YJV5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did Ohio promise Intel in exchange for this investment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66MQtL"&gt;Intel declined to get into specifics (except to say that tax credits, exemptions, and infrastructure improvements are part of the package), but Ohio Lieutenant Governor Jon Husted seems to have anticipated the question. “For every six cents of capital investment Ohio will make, Intel will make a dollar,” he said unprompted during the presentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SqH36z"&gt;Some quick napkin math: does that mean Ohio is contributing $1.2 billion on top of Intel’s $20 billion? Intel wouldn’t say. But &lt;a href="https://time.com/6140476/intel-building-factory-ohio/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the local government will be spending at least a billion: “The state agreed to invest $1 billion in infrastructure improvements, including widening State Route 161, to support the factory and the nearby community.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fscqWJ"&gt;To win Intel’s interest, Ohio also had to change its laws to offer job creation tax credits for 30 years instead of 15 years to big developments like Intel’s. “Until that passed, we weren’t in the game,” Husted &lt;a href="https://www.dispatch.com/in-depth/business/2022/01/21/how-mike-dewine-jon-husted-got-intel-come-ohio/9183683002/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Columbus Dispatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIYISc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why does this remind me of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; story about empty buildings&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sTCPA6"&gt;Though the promises may have similarities, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1484578847580377088"&gt;we’re not getting any Foxconn-in-Wisconsin vibes&lt;/a&gt; from the Intel deal quite yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="EVo60P"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, January 22nd 10:11PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The annexed land is the light region in the upper-right-hand corner of the map, not the dark region.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel Stand (2nd gen) review: nice but not a must-have</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Fast wireless charging speeds and a few extras&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="X3CTvo"&gt;The latest Google Pixel Stand is less of a “must-have” accessory if you’re a Pixel phone owner and more of a “nice to have.” For $79, its primary job is fast wireless charging, and it does that well. But unless you’re a Pixel 6 or 6 Pro owner and you’re really sold on one of the stand’s handful of extra features supported by your phone, then you’d be better off saving your money and getting an inexpensive third-party charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EhDlH0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10989360"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yb6sUW"&gt;The aptly named Pixel Stand (2nd gen) is Google’s second take on a fast wireless charger built to complement its Pixel phones. You don’t have to own a Pixel phone to use it since it works with Qi-compatible gadgets, but you will need a 6 or a 6 Pro to get the fastest charging speeds. You’ll also need the January 2022 security update or later, which, if you’re a Pixel 6 owner, you’ll want to download &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22884219/google-january-2022-pixel-6-pro-update"&gt;for a whole bunch of reasons anyway&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlOExJ"&gt;Like the original Pixel Stand, it does some multi-tasking while charging your phone. While your Pixel phone is docked on the stand, it can display images from your Google Photos albums to act as a kind of digital picture frame. During setup the first time you put your phone on the charger, you can specify which albums you’d like it to pull images from, and photos are displayed in batches of five to 10 at a time, slideshow style.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel Stand setup enables extras like a digital picture frame feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kk0qEo"&gt;Other features are geared toward bedside use. There’s an option to automatically turn on “do not disturb” when the phone is placed on the charger, and you can have the display automatically turn off in a dark room. There’s also a “sunrise” alarm that gradually brightens your display in the 15 minutes before your alarm goes off. You can specify a window of time for this feature, so it isn’t applied to other alarms throughout the day — just your wake-up call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfsXCD"&gt;As for its main job — charging your phone — it does this effectively. I noticed some false starts here and there when I’d set the phone on the stand, and it would start charging, only to stop momentarily before picking it up again. This didn’t cause any problems; it just gave me a few moments of concern as I tried to figure out if it was mounted on the stand correctly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ye4F54"&gt;The Pixel Stand 2 offers 23W charging with the Pixel 6 Pro and 21W for the Pixel 6 — quite speedy for wireless charging on a phone that isn’t made by OnePlus. It took a totally depleted Pixel 6 Pro battery from zero to 100 percent in almost exactly two hours, which is impressive. My more typical day-to-day use case was topping off the battery on a Pixel 6, taking it from 70–80 percent back to 100 percent, which took around 30 minutes using the fastest charging mode. The Stand offers a slightly slower 15W charging for other Qi-compatible phones and devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GXOFatK4yyIffKIgqGvkhkZBTzM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23179780/ajohnson_220118_4974_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stand displays images from the Google Photos albums that you specify.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ex0zMy"&gt;As for the extras, I like the photo frame feature more than I thought I would. I’m not sure I want to commit to owning and curating images for a dedicated digital picture frame, but I do happen to have dozens (okay, hundreds) of photos of my four-month-old on Google Photos that I like looking through. Having them displayed at my desk on my phone is kind of a nice middle ground — I get to actually see and appreciate the many, many photos I take without hassling with another device. I’m sure that my colleagues who review smart home tech could direct me to a number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review"&gt;smart displays that do this kind of thing already&lt;/a&gt;, but I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHnAFp"&gt;If I have one complaint about this feature, it’s that it tends to pick favorites and show those over and over. This might be because it favors portrait orientation photos, and I tend to shoot more landscape. In any case, you can tap the screen to end the current slideshow and swipe the lock screen to shuffle the selection and start a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/icgE98r_-WdagqtIglUJ6N49ZXg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23179783/ajohnson_220118_4974_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Features like the option to automatically enable “do not disturb” when the phone is docked make the Stand a good bedside companion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wvoTZZ"&gt;The Stand’s nightstand-oriented features work well, too. The sunrise alarm is a pleasant way to wake up, and the ability to detect a dark room and turn off the screen accordingly makes it a good bedside companion. But these features feel a little at odds with the Stand’s main draw: fast wireless charging. If I’m charging my phone overnight, then I don’t need the absolute fastest speeds. I wouldn’t see the photo frame feature much either since my phone doesn’t spend much time on the bedside dock during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IroSZX"&gt;I also encountered a couple of problems with Google Assistant while using the stand. After I tap the Assistant icon on the lock screen while docked, the phone will register my voice commands but will unhelpfully ignore everything it just heard me say and display “How can I help?” text on the screen. Accessing the assistant by saying, “Hey Google,” on the lock screen works just fine, though, and that’s not a Stand feature — just something you can enable on any Pixel phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MeVIRlybIoUgasfTZbHji52Pnmk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23179779/ajohnson_220118_4974_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The second-gen Stand includes a built-in fan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cTaFVJ"&gt;Then there’s the built-in fan; it’s fairly quiet, but if the fan is running at full speed, the assistant struggles to hear me at all. You can choose a quiet charging mode to avoid this, but then you’re missing out on those super-fast charging speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="gcyAv4"&gt;The Pixel Stand 2 isn’t inexpensive: at $79, it’s well more than the $30-ish standard Qi charging stands you can find on Amazon. If you own a Pixel 6 or 6 Pro, really want fast wireless charging, and think you’d particularly like any of the extras that the Stand (2nd gen) offers, then you’ll probably find its 80 bucks well spent. But if you’re only mildly interested in the bedside or photo frame features and fast wireless charging isn’t essential, save yourself some money and go for a standard Qi charger. You could even add a digital picture frame to your cart for the same cost, too.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds are a go-to pick that’s often on sale.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EMp8N7"&gt;Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the holidays may have come and gone, but there are still some great discounts available on Apple’s AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SziSp1"&gt;Since Apple launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt; in October and unveiled its new AirPods lineup, we’ve seen the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level model drop from $159 to $129. Even better, we’ve seen many retailers starting to heavily discount the second-gen AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model. We’ve even recently seen some significant discounts on the third-gen AirPods, despite how recently they launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best deals available on each model, including the entry-level AirPods, the AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods, and the AirPods Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Si36Ca"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"},{"title":"Which AirPods should you buy?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733797/airpods-2-3-pro-max-which-to-buy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="VFDHZw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10742787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ej2msf"&gt;The best entry-level &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; (second-gen) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eg29V6"&gt;Once $159, Apple recently lowered the list price of the second-gen AirPods — now the entry-level model — to $129. It only sells the model with a wired charging case, however, which charges via a standard Lightning cable. Despite their age, we found these easy-to-use earbuds offer great wireless performance and reliable battery life, making them a great pick if you can live without a wireless charging case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtXs0h"&gt;Although we’ve seen Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods drop to $90 — their lowest price to date — the second-gen earbuds are currently only &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1155135/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals123021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-2nd-generation%2F-%2FA-84852693"&gt;Target for $109.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is just $20 less than their typical asking price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;AirPods (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d2yjBK"&gt;The newest pair of wireless earbuds support Apple’s MagSafe technology. The short stems yield a more subtle design, while improved sound and features like sweat and water resistance, support for spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and improved battery life render them a nice improvement over the last-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiPrKN"&gt;Deals were once hard to come by on the third-gen model, but we finally started seeing some significant deals starting around Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Sadly, like the second-gen AirPods, they’re currently only available for slightly less than MSRP. At the moment, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1668152-REG%2Fapple_mme73am_a_airpods_with_charging_case.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon are selling them for $169&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1230713/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals010422&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-true-wireless-bluetooth-headphones-3rd-generation%2F-%2FA-77603772"&gt;Target has them for $169.99&lt;/a&gt;, just $10 shy of their full retail price and a far cry from their all-time low of $139.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q2OXRZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10744075"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Iewbkw"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="S8o5q4"&gt;We think Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, are the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; an iPhone owner can buy, regardless of the price. They have better sound quality than the models above, offer active noise cancellation, and come with a wireless charging case. The earbuds also support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;Apple’s spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; feature, which adds an immersive surround sound effect to select content, and come with swappable silicone tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM8uVd"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733183/apple-magsafe-charging-case-airpods-pro-qi"&gt;recently launched a new version&lt;/a&gt; of the AirPods Pro with a wireless charging case that supports Apple’s MagSafe technology, just like the third-gen AirPods. These retail for $249, but you can buy them right now for $189.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro-with-magsafe%2F-%2FA-77603773&amp;amp;subid1=Verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/612734/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro-with-MagSafe-Charging-Case%2F975690481&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not nearly as low as the $159 price we saw this model drop to during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but it’s still $59 off what you’d pay if you were to purchase the earbuds directly from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="THtgJp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="gxlsti"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"AirPods Pro 2 may come with lossless audio support and a charging case that makes sound","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22863442/airpods-pro-2-lossless-audio-charging-case-sound"},{"title":"Apple selling new AirPods Pro coinciding with the Year of the Tiger in certain markets","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22864887/apple-new-airpods-pro-year-of-the-tiger"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ear style that has become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and a wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the $550 sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max were discounted to $429 on Amazon during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, prices have since increased. Still, the Max are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZJN7BD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale in blue at Amazon for $449&lt;/a&gt; — just $20 shy of their best price ever — and in most other colorways for $479. You can also &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/search/search_results.aspx?Ntt=airpods+max"&gt;buy them in various colors at Micro Center for $449.99&lt;/a&gt;, though they’re only available for in-store pickup in select states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Mpx47T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0mvFWM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
