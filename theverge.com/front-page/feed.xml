    <title>Lordstown Motors delays Endurance EV pickup after announcing Foxconn deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dw7xasOy3DvbaYZsP7Iquqb7XKE=/110x0:3050x1960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70130173/Screen_Shot_2021_11_11_at_4.39.39_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4gEHaB"&gt;Cash-strapped EV startup Lordstown Motors is delaying the launch of its electric pickup truck, the Endurance, one day after announcing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775168/foxconn-lordstown-motors-electric-vehicle-factory-trump-ohio"&gt;sale of its Ohio factory to iPhone assembler Foxconn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJigzW"&gt;Lordstown Motors said Thursday that it now plans to ship the Endurance in the third quarter of 2022, not the second as previously targeted, because of supply chain shortages. It &lt;a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-third-quarter-2021-financial-results"&gt;announced a third-quarter loss&lt;/a&gt; of $96 million and said it will finish the year with just $150 million to $180 million in cash — including a $100 million payment from Foxconn toward the purchase of the factory. Lordstown Motors is also still building pre-production versions of the truck at the Ohio factory despite saying &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620787/lordstown-motors-q2-2021-earnings-gm-factory-production-manufacturing"&gt;as recently as August&lt;/a&gt; that it would be making production-level trucks in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4QqpZU"&gt;In addition, the startup distanced itself from the in-wheel motor technology that it has been promoting since its inception, as it now plans to try to design additional vehicles based on Foxconn’s own EV platform. While the Endurance will still use the hub motors, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644661/lordstown-motors-ceo-daniel-ninivaggi-hertz-steve-burns"&gt;new CEO Daniel Ninivaggi&lt;/a&gt; said Thursday that “not every vehicle needs hub motors, and we’ll weigh the tradeoffs.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eg0SPM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“not every vehicle needs hub motors”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aON7f6"&gt;In the span of just two years, Lordstown Motors has gone from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20954956/gm-lordstown-motors-factory-workhorse-electric-vehicles-trump-ev"&gt;a new startup that won the support of the Trump administration&lt;/a&gt;, to a public company that raised hundreds of millions of dollars on claims it would release the first EV pickup truck, to facing allegations of fraud and two &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560891/lordstown-motors-sdny-doj-investigation"&gt;government investigations&lt;/a&gt;. It has recently turned over its entire leadership team (much like Workhorse, the EV startup that Lordstown Motors was essentially birthed from) and has sold its factory to Foxconn to stay alive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jhjOF"&gt;Once the sale closes in April 2022, Lordstown Motors will only occupy 30,000 of the 6.2 million square feet available at the factory it once owned, while other electric vehicle startups like Fisker Inc. come in to work with Foxconn on their own EVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3BGFf"&gt;Ninivaggi, who recently finished a seven-year run on the board of Hertz, emphasized on a conference call Thursday that Foxconn is “only part of the solution.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1WtPN"&gt;“We realize that our company is not just an appendage to Foxconn,” he said. “We must execute, and execute better, and deliver the Endurance truck.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jprgch"&gt;He also thanked “all the shareholders who have hung in there with us” and acknowledged the startup that beat Lordstown Motors (and everybody else) to market with an electric pickup truck: Rivian.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zC4FYa"&gt;“It’s not easy; we see the news every day, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774403/rivian-ipo-debut-evs-12-billion-amazon-tesla-valuation"&gt;$100 billion market cap for Rivian&lt;/a&gt;. And we know we have a long way to go, but we feel like we have a path and a strong partner,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The global chip shortage is a nightmare before Christmas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GaoVGGMpIiI9uFmmJj31LLjR9pk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70130153/vpavic_4278_20201030_0292.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fHMlPj"&gt;The global chip shortage has had a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;massive effect&lt;/a&gt; on the entire technology industry for more than a year, but a wave of gaming hardware news over the past week and change has shown that things aren’t going to get better anytime soon. Gaming companies big and small are going to be feeling the sting well into next year, and it’s not just Sony and Microsoft’s next-gen consoles that could be hard to get a hold of. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zl9b8"&gt;Nintendo was arguably the first to kick off the waterfall of news, revising its &lt;strong&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/strong&gt; sales forecast for the fiscal year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22762933/nintendo-earnings-q2-2021-switch-sales-forecast"&gt;down by 1.5 million&lt;/a&gt; on November 4th “due to the effects of the global semiconductor shortage,” &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/211104_4e.pdf"&gt;according to the company&lt;/a&gt;. Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa elaborated further &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/211105_2e.pdf"&gt;in a Q&amp;amp;A&lt;/a&gt;, saying that “there has not been a major improvement in the situation” since the beginning of the fiscal year (which starts in April). The company is “evaluating alternative components and reviewing our designs,” according to Ko Shiota, GM of Nintendo’s Technology Development Division, but it’s unclear right now if anything it is looking at might make it easier to find a Switch on the shelf. (And if you don’t already have one of the Switch-compatible N64 controllers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760049/nintendo-switch-64-n64-controller-in-stock-2022-next-year"&gt;you’re out of luck until next year&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ro2sbv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Valve’s Steam Deck handheld gaming PC&lt;/strong&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774888/steam-deck-delayed-two-months-february-2022-launch-shipping"&gt;delayed two months&lt;/a&gt; from a December to a February launch on November 11th. “We did our best to work around the global supply chain issues, but due to material shortages, components aren’t reaching our manufacturing facilities in time for us to meet our initial launch dates,” &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/3084396982306430712"&gt;Valve said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Even before the delay, we had a sense that Steam Deck supply was going to be tight, as estimated order availability slipped to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580453/valve-steam-deck-pre-order-handheld-pc-gaming"&gt;early 2022 very soon&lt;/a&gt; after the initial reservations went live. But now, even people who had secured a December 2021 order date are going to have to wait a bit longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BSAEVE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sony expects to make fewer PS5s&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v50J58"&gt;Sony reportedly expects to make fewer &lt;strong&gt;PS5s&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-11/sony-trims-playstation-5-assembly-plans-after-chip-shortages-hit"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The company originally forecasted it could assemble 16 million consoles in the current fiscal year (which ends in March), but now, it plans to make “about 15 million,” &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; says. The PS5 has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/23/22434905/ps5-restock-best-buy-walmart-sony-playstation-5"&gt;incredibly hard to find&lt;/a&gt; since it launched in November 2020, and that’s likely not going to become easier soon: Sony’s manufacturing partners told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; that meeting Sony’s goal of 22.6 million PS5 sales in the next fiscal year will be difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qyWJLM"&gt;Panic’s &lt;strong&gt;Playdate&lt;/strong&gt; handheld has been pushed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/11/22776649/panic-playdate-delay-2022-handheld-battery-chip-shortage"&gt;from late 2021 to early 2022&lt;/a&gt;. While the delay for initial units was due to faulty batteries, components for future Playdates are challenging to come by, &lt;a href="https://lists.play.date/w/C1CCc0cxLPvgKc6tC8jVmg"&gt;according to the company&lt;/a&gt;. The Playdate’s current CPU, for example, isn’t available for two years, which has forced the company to redesign the main board with a more readily available CPU for Playdates made later in 2022. Panic warns that “there are a number of other part shortages we’re trying to outsmart right now,” so if it can’t get past those, that might mean it will be hard to get a Playdate down the road. If you have any interest in a Playdate, you might want to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587193/playdate-preorder-how-to-panic-teenage-engineering-handheld-console"&gt;preorder one now&lt;/a&gt; to secure your place in line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rybeLU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;And these are only shifts that we know about&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aJoMiI"&gt;These are only some recent shifts&lt;em&gt; that we know about&lt;/em&gt; — there could be other issues and delays behind the scenes that we’re not aware of. Microsoft’s Xbox boss Phil Spencer warned of ongoing shortages in September, saying that Xbox supply issues &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22701878/xbox-phil-spencer-supply-constraints-2022"&gt;will last into 2022&lt;/a&gt;. And the issue goes far beyond gaming hardware makers, with Intel saying that the chip shortage could last until &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739192/intel-chip-shortage-q3-2021-earning-laptop-revenue"&gt;at least 2023&lt;/a&gt; and Apple, which is renowned for its mastery of its supply chain, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751418/apple-q4-2021-earnings-supply-constraints-chip-shortage"&gt;taking a $6 billion hit last quarter&lt;/a&gt; because of constraints. Despite that, you can still get many Apple products by Christmas if you order them now from the company’s website, but that’s not as much of a sure thing for most gaming hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXMCl2"&gt;Amidst the many delays, there is one potential bright spot. The Analogue Pocket retro handheld, which has already been delayed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21337403/analogue-pocket-release-date-delay-pre-order"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22361017/analogue-pocket-handheld-delayed-electronic-component-shortage"&gt;few&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667465/analogue-pocket-preorders-delay-december-2021"&gt;times&lt;/a&gt; because of supply chain challenges, is “still on track” for a December launch, Analogue founder and CEO Christopher Taber told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email on Wednesday. But if even Nintendo and Sony are having trouble, you might not want to get too excited until you have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22722412/analogue-pocket-analogueos-operating-system-game-boy-retro"&gt;the Pocket&lt;/a&gt; in your hands. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s unexciting 2021 Mac and iPhone software prove it should take a break from annual OS updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1qRq7SHCJLRJiiCNR0ulhJp0cwg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70130116/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NZnL4b"&gt;Apple’s fall software updates, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt;, are officially out in the world for everyone. But Apple’s latest software has arrived with more of a whimper than a bang; the two updates aren’t so much bad as they are &lt;em&gt;boring&lt;/em&gt;. Which has me wondering: why is Apple still clinging to its annual release schedule at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lXVnu"&gt;There are two problems that Apple’s annual cadence causes. The first, as is the case this year, is that iOS and macOS are increasingly mature operating systems with fewer issues to fix or missing features to add. Which, in turn, means that there are fewer opportunities for sweeping upgrades like there were in the early days when the iPhone getting copy and paste support was headline news. Short of Apple changing its mind about how its operating systems and the rules that govern it work — &lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;like when it allowed for third-party email and browser apps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451018/ios-ipados-14-review-iphone-ipad-features-widgets-app-library-scribble"&gt;in iOS 14 &lt;/a&gt;— there’s just less room for big additions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="s8ks4Q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple macOS 12 Monterey review: the best is yet to come","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22765988/apple-macos-12-monterey-review-macbook-pro-air-imac-m1"},{"title":"iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 review: foundational fixes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22683681/ios-15-ipados-review-iphone-ipad-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Pjaj8I"&gt;Second is the fact that — because Apple silos off virtually all its updates, big or small, to help pad out the “big” iOS release — smaller but useful quality of life improvements often get stuck waiting around months for the fall cycle to line up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXjwLc"&gt;Take iOS 15, which added a grid view and the ability to blur a background in FaceTime, core features that have already been a key part of Zoom and Google Meet’s toolkits for making larger virtual conversations more organized. Neither appears to be the kind of earth-shattering, OS-level feature that would require waiting for a new version of iOS, but Apple saved the updates to be part of iOS 15 anyway, despite the fact that they undoubtedly would have been more useful during the height of the pandemic when video chatting was more heavily in need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PV2Lpr"&gt;Apple has, in fairness, already started to trend away from its one-and-done updates, if only because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684483/ios-15-announced-features-shareplay-airpods-universal-control"&gt;it’s missed its self-imposed deadlines&lt;/a&gt; multiple times. Major features for iOS and macOS like SharePlay or Universal Control have been delayed from the initial dot-zero builds for more development time. Point releases have gotten more and more important, too, used to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936510/apple-ios-13-2-airpods-pro-compatible"&gt;debut new emoji&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21265019/apple-ios-13-5-out-now-unlock-iphone-face-mask-id-exposure-notification-covid-19"&gt;critical Face ID updates for better mask support&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403554/apple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking"&gt;Apple’s high-profile App Tracking Transparency requirement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A MacBook Pro running macOS Monterey sits on a table in front of a window.

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MNSTz5"&gt;To solve the issues of lackluster annual updates, Apple should do two things. First, it should continue to build out point releases with additional features throughout the year or even unbundle app updates from its annual releases entirely. Did the FaceTime team come up with a great new feature that’ll make pandemic chatting easier? Release it when it’s ready! Second, it should start to space out its major software releases, waiting an extra year or two between iOS or macOS versions to ensure that when it does release a “new” operating system, there are actually big changes to be excited about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzPZiA"&gt;Spaced out software updates wouldn’t even be a new idea for Apple, at least on the macOS side of things. Apple spent almost a decade spacing out OS X releases every two years before it brought back annual releases with OS X 10.8 Mountain Lion in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mZbllQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Spaced out updates aren’t a new idea for Apple, either&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sxo47T"&gt;Sure, Apple does get some benefit from its current cadence. On a basic level, bundling iOS and macOS updates gives Apple a single, cohesive marketing push, a package of features that it can point to and say, “Look, here are all the ways the new software makes your life better.” The annual releases also mean that Apple can count on journalists writing roundups of the new features every year at WWDC and reviews of those new features in the fall, and Apple might have to risk that consistent coverage if it changes things up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j59DEI"&gt;But while the boosted public awareness is nice, I doubt that Apple would be missing out on much if it spaced out annual releases. New iPhones are not sold on the strength of having Apple’s new software installed; customers praised the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;M1 MacBook Airs&lt;/a&gt; because of their battery life and processing speed, not because they shipped with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564490/macos-big-sur-review-apple-macbook-pro-air-mac-ipad-m1"&gt;macOS Big Sur&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ck9iBC"&gt;People install iOS and macOS updates, but outside of the tech sphere, it’s not something that people are &lt;em&gt;eager&lt;/em&gt; to do. More often than not, Apple updates are installed out of a grudging frustration at push notifications and a desire to banish alert bubbles, not because Focus modes allow power users to set up more granular do-not-disturb settings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1NH9kX03zjMNoq8Xubjz6hdSLc4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864029/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wl2uuH"&gt;Spacing out iOS and macOS updates for when Apple actually has big marquee features to show off (like it did during the OS X days when it actually &lt;em&gt;charged&lt;/em&gt; for new updates) could go a long way to fixing that unenthusiastic update cycle. Less frequent iOS updates could help make sure that there’s actually something to get excited for, like a new visual design or substantial new features (like Siri). Additionally, Apple would get more time to develop new versions of its software, which could theoretically cut down on the bugs and glitches in the final versions of whatever it does ship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Crtfgq"&gt;Smaller updates, meanwhile, can be doled out over the year when they’re ready, instead of waiting to cluster every minor update into a massive, overwhelming grab bag once a year where they’re more likely to be overshadowed anyway by the more substantial parts of the new operating system. More gradual updates that aren’t tied to a single major release is an idea we know works, too, because it’s how every other third-party app on iOS already handles updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e0w6US"&gt;But right now, Apple’s system of annual releases leaves it with the worst of both worlds: siloed updates that come too infrequently for minor features while still not having enough major features to be worth the hype. If Apple can’t make macOS and iOS updates more substantial, it might be time to leave the annual release cycle behind.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is emailing out 50,000 Microsoft Store gift cards for the holiday season</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="znkudT"&gt;Double-check your inbox and your spam folder because Microsoft might have left something in there for you. Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22775341/microsoft-store-gift-card-email-promotion"&gt;a few people noticed gift cards for the Microsoft Store suddenly appearing via email&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has confirmed it sent out 50,000 of the codes to US customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2qx6t"&gt;Per a Microsoft spokesperson:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="dEPNd9"&gt;To help spread holiday cheer, Microsoft Store has surprised a total of 50,000 U.S. customers with virtual gift cards via email. 25,000 customers will receive a $100 Microsoft Gift Card while 25,000 others will receive a $10 Microsoft Gift Card ahead of this holiday season. These randomly selected recipients can redeem their gift card on Microsoft Store through December 31, 2021 and spend it within 90 days of redemption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gTHm3d"&gt;If you weren’t randomly selected, then you’re in good company — we didn’t get anything from the giveaway either. But it’s worth checking whatever email account you might use for Xbox Live or Skype. Even if you don’t need anything from the Microsoft Store, someone on your list will probably appreciate a new mouse or headset.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ten top weather apps for Android phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Radical Drop In Temperatures And Winter Weather In Pamplona" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2qQQ1D9d2wXKYrGmSr1vJt7obUc=/0x125:3000x2125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66996956/1215923322.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Eduardo Sanz / Europa Press via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="revCAV"&gt;One of the more popular uses for phones (besides taking photos and watching TikTok videos) is to check out the weather. As a result, there are myriad weather apps out there, making it really hard to pick which one to use. So we’ve put together this guide to what we think are some of the better ones out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BcUkev"&gt;With the exception of one that used to be very well-liked: Dark Sky. Back in March 2020, Dark Sky was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201666/apple-acquires-weather-app-dark-sky-shut-down-android-wear-os-ios"&gt;acquired by Apple&lt;/a&gt; and almost immediately removed from the Google Play app store. Originally, the Dark Sky API was going to be pulled as well — leaving a lot of third-party apps desperately looking for a substitute — but that’s been put off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527878/dark-sky-apple-ios-app-website-api-shut-down-end-of-2022"&gt;until at least the end of 2022&lt;/a&gt;. (By the way, if you use the iOS version of Dark Sky, that’s going away at the end of 2022 as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="or04Hp"&gt;Of course, if you want, you can just settle for the “At a Glance” weather widget that Google includes on its homescreen; tap that, and you get a reasonably good weather report. But if you’re a weather geek, or you want to be able to tweak your weather report a little more than Google allows, we’ve got 10 alternatives here. All have free versions with ads, and all but one have paid versions that remove the ads and often include additional features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSJiCj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: in earlier versions of this article, we listed the permissions that each app requested. However, since most weather apps seem to ask for pretty much the same permissions, we’ve removed the listings and suggest that you simply check out your chosen weather app’s list of permissions that’s at the bottom of its page in the Play Store. (That’s not a bad idea for any app, actually.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bNVpUL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.grailr.carrotweather"&gt;Carrot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Carrot greets the day with a snarky comment." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7mhLXvDyvP46KmaY4b_kbBLSeQk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19864259/Carrot1.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carrot greets the day with a snarky comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Carrot offers a reasonable amount of data on current and upcoming weather." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x0fzOlaiIUMx19v6beZ6EJxVyjU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19864262/Carrot2.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carrot offers data on current and upcoming weather.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7zTOy3"&gt;Carrot may be known less for its weather predictions than for its personality, which offers tongue-in-cheek commentary in audio and / or text on the happenings of the day. (One day, for example, it snarked, “I’m sending bad weather to all the people who refuse to wear masks to hide hideous faces.”) In fact, you can set its personality (friendly, snarky, homicidal, or overkill) and its politics (liberal, conservative, centrist, libertarian, communist, or apolitical) to suit your own tastes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XElp3P"&gt;All that being said, Carrot is a solid, good-looking app that offers a reasonable amount of data on current and upcoming weather. The Android app uses the Dark Sky API for its data; the iOS app, on the other hand, uses a variety of sources, such as Dark Sky, AccuWeather, AerisWeather, and Foreca. It also has several features that the Android app lacks, but in an email, creator Brian Mueller promised a major update in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFb5Si"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Free with ads. “Premium Club” removes the ads and offers a widget and other features for $0.99 per month or $3.99 annually.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="onylOP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.handmark.expressweather"&gt;1Weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="1Weather offers a good amount of info." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j33LlTkCsrSlOcWfbMnkEgDsuxI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006252/Screenshot_20211111_141721.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;1Weather offers a good amount of info.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="IWeather’s UI is frequently interrupted by ads." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TZC8QE2lIajznKTxXZ5pS509LC0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006254/Screenshot_20211111_141758.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;IWeather’s UI is frequently interrupted by ads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbQTup"&gt;1Weather is a well-known app with a variety of screens showing the current weather, the forecast, precipitation, radar, and the Sun and Moon rise and set, among others. I personally found the interface a bit crowded, but it does offer a lot of information, and it includes short weather-related articles. Unfortunately, not only do scrolling ads sit right in the center of the main screen, on other pages the ads take up a good third of the screen, and there are also full-page pop-up ads. According to the app’s website, it gets its info using the Weather 2020 platform, along with meteorologist Gary Lezak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xr8Hl2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Free with ads. Without ads: $1.99 one-time purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Vwr3zQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.accuweather.android"&gt;AccuWeather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="AccuWeather’s recently redesigned interface is attractive and informative." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J5RhGG8tdNNFxf-bKLfFlvfWfbk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21598259/Screenshot_20200731_135917.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AccuWeather’s recently redesigned interface is attractive and informative.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tabs at the bottom give you a number of options for weather predictions." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/idLIQYKWtTycc6yzTCOG76WlpWQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21598707/Screenshot_20200731_140005.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tabs at the bottom give you a number of options for weather predictions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iIf2N7"&gt;Anyone who ever watched cable TV or listened to the radio is probably familiar with AccuWeather, which has been used by many stations for their forecasts. &lt;a href="https://corporate.accuweather.com/company/weather-matters/"&gt;According to its website&lt;/a&gt;, it collects its own data using a combination of meteorologists, a global forecast engine, and other sources. The app has an attractive interface that offers immediate access to the current actual and “RealFeel” temperatures. The Next 4-Hours MinuteCast tells you what kind of precipitation to expect (if any) over the next four hours. You can see forecasts on an hourly and daily basis, along with current radar, using tabs at the bottom of the screen; you can also track any approaching hurricanes. Tap the Eyewitness News icon at the top-right corner for the latest news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cf1bdW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Free with ads or $8.99 annually for no ads, weather alerts, and live forecast radar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Rjb9mD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=mobi.lockdown.weather"&gt;Today Weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Today Weather is a very attractive app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3i6C25wSFwBNDc1uR6AuriLyM68=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19864272/todayweather1.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Today Weather is a very attractive app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Scroll left for more details on the weather." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8RqJBUDvo9RRJOCciyXHUD-4oGQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19864274/todayweather2.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scroll left for more details on the weather.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VGgadK"&gt;Today Weather may be the best looking of all the apps listed here. It’s got a straightforward interface that starts with a photo and today’s weather, and you can scroll down for details on the weather for the next 24 hours and seven days, live radar, air quality, and other categories. If you’re in the US, you can choose to get your data from a variety of sources, including Today Weather itself, the National Weather Service, Weatherbit.io, Open Weather Map, or YR.no / Met.no (the Norwegian Meteorological Institute). Paying customers can choose from even more data sources, including AccuWeather and Dark Sky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nyBEWT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Free with ads, $1.99 for six months, $2.99 for one year, or $6.99 forever. The paid options remove ads, let you choose your data source, and add a few other features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h0QahI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=appyweather.appyweather"&gt;Appy Weather&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Appy Weather has a simple, straightforward interface." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/clsyFQuyZgM7M7jvrHU-UkK4sW0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006300/Screenshot_20211111_142716.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Appy Weather has a simple, straightforward interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Besides the day’s timeline, you can get hourly and weekly reports." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pF_Yhij8NvG-Gdb5s1qRg2BNlYI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006299/Screenshot_20211111_142904.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Besides the day’s timeline, you can get hourly and weekly reports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7z9oCw"&gt;Appy Weather bills itself as “the most personal weather app.” It’s certainly privacy-conscious; at the outset, it asks if you want to check the weather via your current location (in which case it requires permission), or do a search for your location (in which case it doesn’t ask for your location permission). The interface is straightforward and simple, especially its timeline, which lets you scroll down to see the current weather and the upcoming forecast. You can also scroll from left to right at the bottom to see hourly and daily forecasts. Appy Weather currently uses a variety of sources for its data, including Dark Sky, Foreca, and OpenWeather.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sx0aGB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Free version with ads. The Plus version costs $4.99 annually for no ads, radar, notifications, widgets, and other features. The Pro version adds custom notifications and premium weather providers for $9.99 per year. A second Pro version unlocks a variety of map layers; it costs $4.99 a month or $19.99 annually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zx4YCP"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=widget.dd.com.overdrop.free"&gt;Overdrop&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Overdrop has a simple, easy-to-understand interface." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N3mm-XY8txXpFG4pNH5hugCyrQU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006420/Screenshot_20211111_144105.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overdrop has a simple, easy-to-understand interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Scroll down for more weather data." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/chlFpSyhyYqtrF4FYoGKLkx5uL4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006421/Screenshot_20211111_144149.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Scroll down for more weather data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZOjQ5k"&gt;Like Appy Weather, Overdrop has a simple, easy-to-understand interface with a reasonable, if somewhat limited, selection. You can see the current weather, hourly weather, the air quality, a radar map, and weekly forecast; select a drop-down arrow to get more details. However, its main advantage may be that, if you’re a paying customer, you can access 54 different weather widgets — something that widget fans may find worth the price. At the time of the review, you could choose between Open Weather Map, Dark Sky, or Weatherbit if you used the free version; paid subscribers can also select AccuWeather. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTEOp7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price:&lt;/strong&gt; Free with ads; Pro version costs $1.59 per month, $7.99 annually, or $14.99 for a lifetime sub. The paid options remove ads, unlock additional providers, and add 54 widgets and 10 themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XV4eoF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nstudio.weatherhere.free"&gt;NOAA Weather Unofficial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A great app if you want to get your data from the NOAA." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H0R3bkVHpiwWjKapKsiBIJW4ms4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006566/Screenshot_20211111_151101.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A great app if you want to get your data from the NOAA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The simple app offers a small but easily understood amount of data." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BhyIQmHP9YZP-VL3OxxGvDuvd18=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006567/Screenshot_20211111_151139.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The simple app offers a small but easily understood amount of data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L9fSXU"&gt;This simple app goes to the source: the National Weather Service, run by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). It presents data from the NOAA in a clear, easy-to-read format: it opens to the weekly forecast, and you can tap on each day to get more data. You can also get an hourly forecast and a weather map.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbMLV2"&gt;By the way, if you want to get your weather info directly from the NOAA, you can go to the site (&lt;a href="https://www.weather.gov/"&gt;weather.gov&lt;/a&gt;), enter your zip code to get your local forecast, and then save the mobile page to your homescreen (by tapping the three “More” dots in the upper-right corner of your browser and then selecting “Add to Home screen”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RMreXe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;Free with ads. $1.99 version removes ads and allows more than three saved locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jOXoUa"&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.enzuredigital.weatherbomb"&gt;FlowX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="FlowX offers data maps for weather nerds." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Urg9Hi4FqdeMfImoY7j5MFWr4zU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006614/Screenshot_20211111_153728.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;FlowX offers data maps for weather nerds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="FlowX lets you adjust the data that it shows." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ot06HKY1f_dxVr53YiaK8tXCyFM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23006584/Screenshot_20211111_153213.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;FlowX lets you adjust the data that it shows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3lf2tL"&gt;It’s immediately apparent that FlowX (once known as WeatherBomb) is for weather nerds: when you first install it, it opens to a weather map and temperature / humidity charts rather than the usual text-based weather summary, and it lets you choose what types of data the map shows. You get a seven-day forecast; slide your finger across the screen for each day’s forecast. The free app gets its data from the NOAA; the Bronze version gives you more map styles, a graph editor, and up to a 16-day forecast for $4.99 / year. The Silver subscription ($9.99 / year) adds RainViewer Radar and three regional weather models, among other features, and the Gold ($19.99 / year) adds even more, including models for Europe, global ocean temperature and current, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFaFKu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;Free; $4.99 / year for the Bronze version, $9.99 / year for the Silver version, and  $19.99 / year version for the Gold version.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Nn1xTx"&gt;Yahoo Weather is a good-looking and solid weather app that lets you scroll sideways for different locations. You scroll down for the week’s weather, a weather map, wind and pressure, precipitation, and schedules for the Sun and Moon. The homepage features the latest coronavirus statistics (you can hide them if you wish), and there is no premium version, so you’re stuck with the ads. Still, this is a worthy app. (Note: I couldn’t find any first-hand information about the data source, but its weather maps are sourced from The Weather Channel.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="PDMMY3"&gt;If you like sassy weather apps like Carrot, you might also want to try What The ForeCast?! It opens with an opinionated statement on the homepage; you can adjust the profanity level to either On, Some, Minimal, or Off and choose to make it vocal or silent. In fact, the UI settings are in general more varied than most other apps, letting you adjust it to fit your preferences. Scroll down for the daily and weekly forecasts; ads are at the bottom of the screen. You can also find data about the air quality index, bee index, and others via icons at the top of the homescreen. The app uses AerisWeather as a source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBK6fi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Price: &lt;/strong&gt;Free; $1.99 will remove the ads and another $1.99 will add a widget. The app also has its own Etsy page with various merch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify is acquiring an audiobook company </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gaq6WhZhqk-YiB1o-171qD_L7SU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70129483/acastro_180213_1777_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1EVy8u"&gt;Spotify has announced plans to acquire the audiobook services and distribution company Findaway for an undisclosed price. The company operates multiple businesses, including distributing audiobooks to various platforms and offering audiobook creation services under its business Findaway Voices. The company pairs authors with narrators, which could become a new and valuable source of revenue for Spotify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M31AsA"&gt;It also makes Spotify both a commercial bookseller and a publisher of audiobooks, a title the company has been hesitant to accept for its podcasting efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1js05"&gt;“With this acquisition, we’re going to be able to accelerate the addition of an audiobook catalog onto the platform so that users can effectively get all of the audio content that they want all on one platform,” says Nir Zicherman, head of audiobooks at Spotify, in a chat with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q5ebJt"&gt;Zicherman says the team is focusing on “innovation” in the space to make audiobooks a “richer experience,” as well as “democratization,” in that more people can create and publish more audiobooks. It also wants to work on audiobook discovery, as it has always focused on with music and podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YWw8Ga"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XLnUqb"&gt;Zicherman declined to share any specifics on exclusives that might factor into Spotify’s audiobook strategy but did praise the company’s work with creators. “Voices currently allows creators to distribute broadly,” he says, “and that is a very important part of the offering and something that we plan to keep and to continue supporting because we think that it’s part of what makes the platform so powerful from a creator standpoint.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgbYzf"&gt;Zicherman also says the core Spotify app will likely gain more audiobooks in early 2022 when certain Open Access partnerships begin distributing content there. (Storytel, a major audiobook streaming app, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-05-20/storytel-audiobooks-will-be-available-on-spotify-later-this-year/"&gt;is an initial partner&lt;/a&gt;.) These moves aren’t the first to signal Spotify’s interest in the audiobook space, however. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248393/spotify-audiobook-exclusive-recordings-david-dobrick-hilary-swank"&gt;worked with&lt;/a&gt; YouTubers and celebrities in January to distribute readings of classic books, like &lt;em&gt;Frankenstein&lt;/em&gt;, and also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21247804/harry-potter-daniel-radcliffe-reading-philosophers-stone-spotify-video"&gt;partnered with J.K. Rowling’s Wizarding World&lt;/a&gt; to release &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone &lt;/em&gt;in audio form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8YskJj"&gt;Most importantly, the acquisition will give Spotify a new way to make money while staying in the audio business. Findaway shares in authors’ royalties, which means that whenever someone buys a Findaway-distributed book on the platform, Spotify will make money. It’ll also take some cut of revenue when people buy a book on the platform, like any retailer. (A spokesperson declined to comment on its monetization plans.) It seems possible Spotify could launch new subscription tiers, similarly to Audible, to account for audiobook consumption. Notably, however, Spotify will also have to pay royalties to other audiobook distributors and authors, similar to how it treats music content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eo2VSE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction 11/11, 4:5 ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story initially stated that Spotify would make money when people streamed an audiobook. It should have said when they buy one. We regret the error and have corrected it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Using Apple Pay and Touch ID on an external Magic Keyboard can get complicated</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nVWK2Xsofm63cVZz5P5ibWwItNE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70129372/akrales_20210515_4583_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mropuN"&gt;Publications like &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/11/apple-pay-doesnt-work-on-your-magic-keyboard/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/550362/apple-pay-not-working-touch-id-mac.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macworld&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have reported some odd behavior when trying to use Apple’s Magic Keyboard with Touch ID to authenticate for Apple Pay — specifically, that it won’t work if you’re trying to do it with a MacBook that has its display closed, as it would be while running it in “clamshell mode” hooked up to an external monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECgIvc"&gt;Obviously, when the MacBook’s lid is closed, you can’t use the built-in Touch ID sensor, so it’s easy to see how this limitation was put in place. But in a world where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607386/apple-magic-keyboard-touch-id-standalone-seperate-price-release-date-m1-chip"&gt;Apple sells an external keyboard with the sensor&lt;/a&gt; (starting at &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MK293LL/A/magic-keyboard-with-touch-id-for-mac-models-with-apple-silicon-us-english"&gt;an eye-watering $150&lt;/a&gt;), it’s an awkward limitation. That’s especially true given that the keyboard’s Touch ID functionality only works with Apple Silicon-powered Macs and comes with all but the base-level iMac. That means that most of the people buying it will likely be laptop users looking for a way to type while their laptop is docked (maybe even with the screen closed). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rYYp5l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If it’s safe enough for an M1 Mac Mini, it’s safe enough for a docked MacBook&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fiiiec"&gt;Hopefully Apple will let its users make payments with their external keyboard soon, no matter what the state of their laptop’s lid is. It’s understandable that Apple wants to make sure that payment authentication is a secure process — &lt;a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/550362/apple-pay-not-working-touch-id-mac.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macworld&lt;/em&gt;’s article&lt;/a&gt; mentions a load of other security settings that can affect being able to use Touch ID with Apple Pay — but if it’s safe enough to use with the M1 Mac Mini, it should be safe enough to use with a docked laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u6CIcJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated November 11th, 4:50PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Clarified that this behavior appears to be intentional, rather than a bug.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can watch Valve’s Steam Deck developer event at 1PM ET Friday, even if you’re not a dev</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eHDLvIfP1m3i957I3kDG5ktilC4=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70129264/STEAMDECK_THUMB_Textless.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TJLYVt"&gt;We’ve known for a little while that Valve is giving developers a huge five-hour tour of its upcoming Steam Deck gaming handheld on Friday, November 12th starting at 10AM PT /  1PM ET. Now, we’re learning &lt;a href="https://steamcommunity.com/steamworksvirtualconference/steamdeck"&gt;you can come watch&lt;/a&gt; even if you’re not a developer — Valve is telling press that “anyone can watch the event.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMQ2gu"&gt;The five-hour virtual conference will include discussions of the hardware; games that will appear &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OnDeck/"&gt;“on Deck”&lt;/a&gt;; how the Linux handheld can play Windows games via a Proton compatibility layer; a deep dive on the AMD APU that powers it by AMD itself; and of course tips for Steam developers on how to make those things work in their favor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MadBBJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s free to watch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vix6QQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3104662546549776336"&gt;The initial announcement&lt;/a&gt; made it seem like you had to be a Steamworks developer “to participate,” but the company’s clarifying today that only applies to a final Q&amp;amp;A session (and possibly only when it comes to asking the questions: it sounds like you can still watch that, too). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUQYvl"&gt;Valve is a gigantic force in the PC gaming space, but it’s also a secretive company that doesn’t make a lot of hardware, so there’s loads of interest in any scrap of new information about the exciting new gaming handheld that might come out of the event. We’ll be watching for any news — and now you can, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3gM8X"&gt;Me, I’ll be particularly interested if Valve drops any more tidbits about what else the AMD APU can do. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;When I got to try the Steam Deck in person&lt;/a&gt; in Bellevue, Washington, Valve’s Greg Coomer kinda-sorta hinted to me that it might make sense in a possible future standalone VR headset, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXG2KW"&gt;Valve recently announced that the Steam Deck has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774888/steam-deck-delayed-two-months-february-2022-launch-shipping"&gt;delayed by two months&lt;/a&gt;. Originally, small quantities were expected to ship this December, but now the first handhelds will arrive in February 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I just bought a $329 Nvidia RTX 3060 for $329, and all I had to do was wait nine months in line</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mw6LBXY92_u2mo1PaqQuHBa1jz8=/0x102:2791x1963/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70129121/verge_sean_hollister_evga_rtx_3060_20211111_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ERjrAP"&gt;Nearly nine months ago, Nvidia said it would launch its most affordable RTX 3000 graphics card yet — the $329 RTX 3060. Good luck actually finding one at that price, right? That’s why I subtitled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;my review&lt;/a&gt; “$329 with an asterisk sign.” And sure enough, they were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301391/nvidia-rtx-3060-launch-supply-demand-newegg-shuffle"&gt;nigh-impossible to find on launch day&lt;/a&gt; for Nvidia’s sticker price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAFqs2"&gt;But that same day, February 25th, I signed up for EVGA’s graphics card &lt;em&gt;waiting queue&lt;/em&gt; on a whim. And after waiting in that queue for so long that I completely forgot I ever signed up, I got a surprise. On Monday, I received an email from EVGA letting me know I could actually purchase that $329 card for $329.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ql4mzI"&gt;So I did. Yesterday afternoon, a brand-new RTX 3060 arrived for $379.41 after tax and shipping. That’s a card that’s generally selling for north of $700 on eBay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fX78EV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Queues work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L87V8T"&gt;The queue worked! It remembered me, and it gave me what I wanted once it was ready. I never needed to wake up early and smash browser refresh buttons, never needed to throw down with scalpers, never needed to pre-fill my credit card information into half a dozen websites, never needed to pay an exorbitant finder’s fee. I just had to register an account and try EVGA’s two-step verification a few times (the website choked for me at first), and then I had 20 full hours to complete my purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeMH5k"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;We called out the industry in late 2020&lt;/a&gt; for failing to let us simply sign up to buy products when they’re ready to ship, the way Apple, Samsung, and others have done. But there’s been little movement since. While Sony did finally introduce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/14/22726198/ps5-playstation-5-sony-console-registration-restock-november-invite"&gt;a way to register your interest in buying a PS5&lt;/a&gt; last month, and Valve did introduce a first-come-first-served reservation system alongside its (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774888/steam-deck-delayed-two-months-february-2022-launch-shipping"&gt;now-delayed&lt;/a&gt;) Steam Deck handheld, most people who simply want to buy a new console or a new PC graphics card are at the mercy of the internet feeding frenzy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="y9E78D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why the global chip shortage is making it so hard to buy a PS5","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="chpD80"&gt;How has a tiny company like EVGA, best known as one of Nvidia’s board partners, figured out what almost every other company hasn’t? Well, it’s not quite that simple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4uDce"&gt;For one thing, as we pointed out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;in that late 2020 story&lt;/a&gt;, there are some perverse incentives that may keep companies from fixing the mess. Scarcity isn’t always a bad thing for retailers since it drives word-of-mouth, and some people may give up on the thing they came to buy and buy something else instead. (Big-box retailers also love the frenzy of in-person Black Friday shopping sprees, for that matter, even though people can get hurt and even killed in a stampede. At least that’s not a concern here.) But EVGA wins when you can buy a graphics card, and &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of its new cards are in high demand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P9bD9z"&gt;But also, EVGA isn’t actually satisfied that it’s figured out the queue quite yet. If you want to follow my lead and join the queue, you actually can’t — the company shut down its queues about a month ago after feedback that it still wasn’t quite fair. The company’s tweaked its queue system &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/evga-improves-queue-system-for-rtx-30-series-cards-after-backlash-from-waiting-consumers/"&gt;a few times now&lt;/a&gt;, but there are still concerns that, for instance, some users were able to purchase multiple cards instead of just one for personal use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ayj9Hf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This new queue may have some new rules and requirements”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oopm07"&gt;“After taking much feedback, we are working on a new version for [the] future with improvements to speed up queue fulfillment and fairness. This new queue may have some new rules and requirements, so for the time being, we have closed the existing queue for new signups as we continue to fulfill those in line, and plan to have more announcements in the near future,” EVGA tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwnwRP"&gt;Hopefully, EVGA can share its learnings with some other companies, too, because we’re not liking the way the industry is pointed now: it feels like retailers themselves are starting to become the scalpers, in a sense. Walmart and Best Buy offer paid memberships, in addition to Amazon’s Prime, that just so happen to let you into their member-exclusive sales — many of which are for in-demand tech, like consoles. They’ll tell you that’s not the primary purpose of these services, but for now, it seems like retailers are capitalizing on the scarcity of this gaming hardware with an upcharge instead of committing to making the lines work for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3xSip"&gt;That means you may have to wait twice: once for companies like EVGA to create the line and then again &lt;em&gt;in &lt;/em&gt;the line to actually get your new console or GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6fR5pJ"&gt;When it comes to smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of voice-enabled Echo devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. Maybe you want to add Alexa to a room, for example, or you’re looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your lighting or other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, this is one of the best times of the year to pick up an Echo device, especially as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; begin to ramp in preparation for the main event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8d6mj5"&gt;Below, we’ve curated a list of some of the very best Amazon Echo deals available right now. Be sure to keep an eye on our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday hub&lt;/a&gt; as well, which will continue to highlight the latest Black Friday news, tip, and deals through the end of November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="868HqZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"},{"title":"The best smart displays for every home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;The best Echo Dot deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;fourth generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry: Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;third-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BDRU5"&gt;We’ve recently seen the latest Echo Dot drop to an all-time low of $29, however, right now it’s only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $50, the original list price. Amazon is also selling a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; that showcases the time, weather, and other information for an additional $10 more, bringing the price to $60. Note, however, that both the base model and the LED-equipped variant are available 25 percent off at Amazon when you trade in select devices. Both can also be picked up with a Sengled smart bulb at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N7P5bD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDotDeals110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, are also offering the fourth-gen Dot at full price, with both retailers taking $10 off if you buy two — meaning you’d pay $90 instead of $100 for a pair. Best Buy, however, will also throw in a four-month trial to SiriusXM Streaming Platinum in addition to a Sengled smart bulb with each purchase. The same promotions apply to the fourth-gen Dot with the built-in LED display, which is available at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-clock-and-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795704%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDotDeals110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfYzQMDs5Oi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $60, the full retail price. The only difference is that Best Buy is not currently offering $10 off when you purchase two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EVsfiu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;The best Echo Dot Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt; is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;The Kids Edition is currently selling for $60, its full price, at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. However, the retail giant is also selling a discounted bundle for $75 instead of $90, which includes an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B08GV4SF3W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition and an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502549%26clkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDotDeals110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; is selling the Kids Edition for $60 as well, but you’ll get $10 off if you buy two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MJlccr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9574374"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VgQp2M"&gt;The best Amazon Echo deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; has also received a makeover. Like the aforementioned fourth-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. That said, it also touts a built-in smart home hub and produces better sound, thanks to a pair of 0.8-inch tweeters and a 3-inch woofer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdAa8S"&gt;Although we’ve seen the Echo drop to as low as $60 during shopping events like Amazon Prime Day, it’s only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747624046492524210" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers right now for $100. Like the fourth-gen Dot, you can, however, get a 25 percent discount when you trade in a select device at Amazon. Target is also currently &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo--4th-gen----smart-home-hub-with-alexa---charcoal%2F-%2FA-80770246%2F%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDotDeals110921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;taking $20 off a set of two Echos&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the bundled price down to $180.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3g4zTs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10674178"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="xR7jKq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XqDD6Q"&gt;The best Amazon Echo Studio deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt; is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker%2F-%2FA-81412943&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeAmazonEchoDeals051421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon also offers a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0939S1B5R/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Billie Eilish Limited Edition Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt; with the singer’s image pasted on the side for $230.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D411Fi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9536569"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ccs5nU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our over 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="oiVOWB"&gt;The best Echo Show 5 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for a compact Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; is the Echo device to consider. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest edition&lt;/a&gt;, which launched in June, features an always-on microphone, an upgraded 2MP camera, a 5.5-inch display, and a physical shutter, allowing you to block the camera’s view. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8jLZ5"&gt;The latest Echo Show 5 is currently available for $85 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfAzhE7JLdJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KJN3333/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, its typical retail price. If you’re looking to save some money, however, the 2019 model is currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Sandstone/dp/B07HZJ64WD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $40 instead of $80. Again, Amazon will take 25 percent off on either version if you trade in an eligible device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mVseNr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609475"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="6d2iBD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513095"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FiYkkx"&gt;The best Echo Show 5 Kids Edition deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JGaEAZ"&gt;The Echo Dot isn’t the only Echo device with a kid-friendly design. The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition offers all of the same features as the standard, second-gen Echo Show 5, only with a vibrant print on the rear and a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which grants your family access to a trove of videos, games, and other kid-friendly content. It even comes with a two-year warranty, providing a bit of protection from whatever your child might (literally) throw at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1db3Rn"&gt;The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition is available for full price ($95) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMSC4WZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740551130085982176" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and other retailers. If you’re looking for add-ons, you can also pick up an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09345FQWY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $115 or an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093462JMH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt; for $110 through Amazon. Once more, Amazon is also offering a 25 percent discount on each model and bundle if you trade in certain devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DwZKlk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500490"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O97UD3"&gt;The best Echo Show 8 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Like the Echo Show 5, the Echo Show 8 is available in two distinct models, both of which feature 8-inch displays and dual speakers. However, unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new model&lt;/a&gt; is equipped with a 13MP camera and some unique software tricks, one of which grants it the ability to keep the subject centered in the frame as they move around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNLpG4"&gt;When pitted against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Home Hub&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, their closest competitors in terms of price and functionality, both iterations of the Echo Show 8 are better options for a few reasons: they feature slightly larger displays, better speakers, and cameras that allow you to use them as video chatting devices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, we &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22521948/amazon-echo-show-8-2nd-gen-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; the Echo Show 8 to be better than other devices in Amazon’s current smart display lineup, which is why we think it’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535003/best-smart-displays-alexa-google-echo-nest" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best smart display&lt;/a&gt; for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;As far as deals go, the first-gen Show 8 is currently available for $110 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, though, there are a few discounted bundles available for a few dollars more. For $115, for instance, you can pick up a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZND1QQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8 and a Blink Mini security camera&lt;/a&gt;. Alternatively, you can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YD5WDCB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8 with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $131 instead of $135. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovLiAu"&gt;The second-gen Echo Show 8 is currently available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084DCJKSL/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCe6zrQP2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $130, its full retail price. Like the last-gen model, it’s also available in a bundle at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08ZN82HH7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCe6zrQP2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; that contains a Blink Mini for $135 instead of $165, or with an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0914YLN4D/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;adjustable stand for $155&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon. If you purchase through Amazon, the 25 percent trade-in discount is also applicable to all generations of the Echo Show 8 as well as the bundles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YdQbrX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="NkSBNy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10611942"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QJ2PFl"&gt;The best Echo Show 10 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-gen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;. The device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and, unlike the Show 5 and Show 8, the 2021 model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It’s also mounted on a motorized, swiveling base that allows the display to follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;We’ve seen the latest Echo Show 10 get discounted to as low as $200, but no active deals are available right now. But if you still want to pick it up, you can get it for its usual $250 price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08SQ2F8D2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; is also offering a discounted bundle, which includes an Echo Show 10 and a Blink Mini for $260 instead of $285. Again, trading in select devices at Amazon can net you 25 percent off on the Echo Show 10 and all aforementioned bundles.&lt;/p&gt;
