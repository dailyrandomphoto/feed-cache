    <title>Furosystems Aventa e-bike review: ice breaker</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Ease your way into the joys of commuting by electric bike&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4ZqxHI"&gt;Aventa is a new electric bike with a secret: its battery is removable despite the clean design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="ts5ZN1"&gt;London-based &lt;a href="https://www.furosystems.com/aventa/"&gt;Furosystems just launched the Aventa series of pedal-assist e-bikes&lt;/a&gt; into the European market. A more powerful US model is planned for later this year, or early in 2022 if the double whammy of Covid and Brexit creates undue complications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBkg14"&gt;Aventa is sold in three variations, with the first deliveries starting in mid-March. Each model is priced to include all the accessories needed for typical urban commuting: mudguards, bell, luggage rack, kickstand, and front and rear lights. The standard Aventa ships with a 10.4Ah 375Wh battery, hydraulic disc brakes, and full-sized LCD display for €1,799. If you want more range, then you can opt for the Aventa Max, which costs €1,999 and has a bigger 14Ah 504Wh battery. The Aventa Pure is the entry-level model. It lowers the specs with mechanical disc brakes, a tiny 7.8Ah 281Wh battery, and a miniature LCD display. That also lowers the price to €1,599, which compares favorably to commuter e-bikes from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21454206/cowboy-3-electric-bike-review-price-features"&gt;Cowboy&lt;/a&gt; (starting at €2,290) and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;VanMoof&lt;/a&gt; (starting at €1,998), and city bikes like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21199370/muto-review-electric-bike-price-features"&gt;Muto&lt;/a&gt; (starting at €1,799).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pCXUZ"&gt;It’s the entry-level Aventa Pure model I’ve been testing for the past month in frozen Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TVlWktzN--y2yZj5xZO3WIdFwRw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22313151/aventa_pure_on_ice.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;First canal freeze in years, so why not?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div id="h5jJ0r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10349823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BN399E"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; is always on the hunt for affordable and attractive electric commuter bikes. But they need to be from reputable companies. After all, if you’re going to spend a couple of grand on an e-bike meant for daily use then it had better be reliable and serviceable for years to come, not sold by some fly-by-night operator on Amazon or Indiegogo that’ll go bust just as soon as you need to make a warranty claim.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9ZqE7"&gt;Furosystems appears to be a company with staying power. It recently raised £750,000 (about $1 million) from investors ahead of the Aventa launch. That’s pennies compared to the recent funding rounds by Rad Power Bikes ($150 million), VanMoof ($40 million), Cowboy ($26 million), and Super73 ($20 million), but CEO Eliott Wertheimer tells me that the company was already profitable before the November funding round. In addition to the new Aventa e-bikes, Furosystems already sells Fuze scooters and the Furo X folding e-bike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvviFj"&gt;Last year Furosystems did 60 percent of its sales in the UK, according to Wertheimer, with the remaining 40 percent split across France and Italy. This year the company is planning to grow sales from about 3,000 units to 10,000 by expanding into Belgium, Germany, and the Netherlands. Aventa e-bikes are being assembled in Portugal with components sourced from around the world. Wertheimer tells me that his ultimate goal is to design and manufacture every part themselves, but to do that now would be too costly. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x2Yquut9XkTXTbv5r0aX3InExdA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22313097/verge_DSC_3377_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The battery, inserted backward, but you get the idea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qFvMqb"&gt;The Aventa Pure e-bike I’ve been testing is built for European roads. That means a motor with 250W of continuous power (and 500W peak) and a top speed of 25 km/h (15.5 mph). That speed is fine in congested city centers, but too slow for anyone commuting along lonely roads or protected rural bike paths for any great distance. Mind you, that’s criticism of European transportation policy, not the Aventa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jlrS_QkJEO1sFDYL9lQackK_KRE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22313074/verge_40kmph_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 25 km/h speed limit can be overridden for markets that allow it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYP9TQ"&gt;Furosystems does provide instructions to override the speed limit “to comply with local regulations,” requiring just a few taps on the buttons surrounding the LCD display. With that tweak the Aventa will reach a top speed of between 32 km/h and 36 km/h depending upon the rider’s size, I’m reliably told. But I was a good boy for this review. While I confirmed the speed hack was legit (and thrilling), I stayed within the European limits for my testing now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21558235/vanmoof-slows-s3-x3-europe-japan-speed-limit"&gt;police are increasingly cracking down&lt;/a&gt; on illegally fast e-bikes in cities throughout Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ityn1W"&gt;Furosystems says that the Aventa Pure’s 281Wh battery is capable of more than 40 km (25 miles) of range. In my testing, on long stretches of uninterrupted rural roads, I’ve already gone well beyond that estimate since I’m often pedaling at speeds greater than 25 km/h. At those speeds the motor is just idling as it’s not needed to supply power to the pedals. As a result, my battery says it’s still more than 50 percent full after 47 km (29.7 miles) of riding, despite riding at the max of five pedal-assisted levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYpFyp"&gt;Although the Aventa lacks any kind of throttle or boost button, the sturdy little Bafang motor fitted to the rear wheel hub was able to flatten the steepest hills I could find (which aren’t anywhere close to San Francisco steep) thanks to its ability to generate 500W of peak power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uO0s4G"&gt;When riding in stop-and-go traffic, power is provided smoothly and evenly to each downstroke of the pedals despite the lack of any torque sensor like you’ll find on more expensive e-bikes. On flat surfaces, I barely used the nine speeds allowed by the Shimano Altus derailleur. But those gears definitely came in handy when trying to start under heavy loads on inclines or when getting some exercise at top speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9VVwq"&gt;The Aventa puts the rider into a somewhat sporty forward lean on a saddle you’ll want to replace if regularly riding long bumpy distances. The ride is almost silent, disrupted only by a thin rattle when riding over some of the bumpiest brick roads I could find. While I wasn’t able to pinpoint the exact source of the rattle, it did go away when I rode without the battery installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnNvKS"&gt;Removing the battery is an easy, but awkward, procedure as it’s locked into place by a key at the base of the downtube. To extract it the bike has to be laid unceremoniously onto the ground. You can also flip the bike upside down, but at 16.5 kg (36 pounds), the Aventa may be relatively lightweight for a fully loaded e-bike, but it’s definitely not light. Nevertheless, being able to remove the battery for indoor charging is a necessity for many city dwellers who don’t have the space, or strength, to lug a hulking e-bike up narrow stairs to an apartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FLrtNmoZcBNYH2D-Xa2VMcrFQlk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22314436/verge_Aventa_promise_vs_reality_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The top image with better cable management is what buyers today will receive in mid-March, compared to the review bike which was sold in December and January. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zhJafd"&gt;Now, about the cable management. The Aventa Pure e-bike sent for review has far too many exposed cables and connectors for my liking. Fortunately, that’s being fixed for anyone preordering an Aventa today, as the bikes being manufactured now for delivery starting mid-March will route the cables through the frame. While integrated cabling certainly looks better, the exposed cables and connectors on my review bike make it more modular and therefore easier to service whenever a part needs replacing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="76frC6"&gt;My review unit arrived with a smashed headlight, for example, caused by a clumsy courier. Furosystems sent me a new assembly which I was able to install myself by releasing a pair of screws and unclipping the damaged unit. It took all of two minutes. Ease of repair is an important consideration for a young direct-to-consumer company that lacks a sophisticated global repair network. Shipping a busted e-bike to a foreign country for service is no fun for anyone, least of all the owner. Just ask &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21437704/vanmoof-interview-s3-electric-bike-issues-delays-mobile-service-network"&gt;early adopters of the VanMoof S3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eHm00L"&gt;Wertheimer tells me that Furosystems is constantly iterating and taking on customer feedback, and is willing to switch back to the external cabling if customer surveys suggest a strong preference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w1bnuc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10349799"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRbrM5"&gt;Other notable specs and observations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gfT0hm"&gt;Charges in about 4.5 hours, or as long as 7 hours if you buy the Aventa Max with higher-capacity battery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Xlg9cZ"&gt;The aluminum frame can fit riders between 165 cm (5 feet 4 inches) and 195 cm (6 feet 4 inches) and up to 120 kg (265 pounds).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gmVuhT"&gt;The lighting kit on the Aventa Pure features an integrated front light that can be controlled from the display pad (which also controls the LCD’s backlight). The rear clamp-on lamp has to be operated manually.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AlTndH"&gt;The mini LCD display is fine for showing battery level, speed in km/h or mph, and distance traveled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QWfYWf"&gt;There isn’t Bluetooth or an app, which is fine by me — the Aventa is powered on via a button below the LCD.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cfthPB"&gt;I hate the giant logo printed on the downtube. I get it, the company is young and needs to build recognition, but it comes at the expense of the buyer who’s transformed into a rolling billboard for a brand without any prestige (yet). One bystander asked me if I got it from some bike-sharing startup. Ugh, the humiliation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="k3dHuV"&gt;The battery can be inserted backward accidentally. It really should be keyed to make insertion idiot-proof (hi, I’m an idiot).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6aiEaZ"&gt;The quick-release front-wheel and saddle stem are convenient but also magnets for thieves. Be careful out there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NmSl-ioR-8DY-hamKeIyVjlGvQo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22313044/verge_DSC_2901_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LIrB5j"&gt;The entry-level Aventa Pure is a lot of bike for the price, coming in at €400 less than the VanMoof S3, which has become a benchmark of sorts for commuter e-bikes. The Aventa Pure also has a removable battery unlike the S3, and that might make all the difference for many buyers. True, the Aventa Pure doesn’t have all the gee-whiz features you’ll find on premium e-bikes at €2,000 and above. But expensive features like integrated security, theft recovery, at-home servicing, crash detection, and apps that can recommend the least polluted bike routes are ultimately just nice-to-haves, not critical functions of an electric bike. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LtS64Y"&gt;The Furosystems Aventa Pure is an attractive, inexpensive, and bare-bones e-bike for commuters. It will get you from A to B and back safely and reliably, and likely well into the future. And honestly, what more do you need? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="loh3kM"&gt;The Aventa Pure is a great icebreaker for anyone wanting an introduction to e-bike commuting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valheim is Steam’s hottest new PC game, and it’s now sold 3 million copies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V1jZ3m6OHe2wY4qSrBownsaWqo4=/155x0:829x449/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68831563/valheim_steam.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WxySs4"&gt;The other day, I saw a game named &lt;em&gt;Valheim &lt;/em&gt;atop the Steam Early Access sales charts, with overwhelmingly positive reviews. &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/9/22275109/valheim-viking-game-steam-charts-explainer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt; seemed to like the $20 Viking-themed survival game&lt;/a&gt;, and I thought friends might like it, too. I wasn’t ready to commit quite yet — I waffled a while before giving it a go. Know who bought it while I was making up my mind? &lt;em&gt;One million other people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67WpZr"&gt;On February 10th, just eight days after launch, indie developer Iron Gate announced that &lt;em&gt;Valheim &lt;/em&gt;had &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970?emclan=103582791463217109&amp;amp;emgid=3059603085894895511"&gt;already sold 1 million copies&lt;/a&gt;. Five days after that, &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/4627981752752748715"&gt;reached 2 million sales&lt;/a&gt;. On Friday February 19th, two days after we originally published this post, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/3059603718053006418"&gt;it hit 3 million sales&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlvYZS"&gt;Here are a few other facts you might like to know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="4TAu80"&gt;It has now been &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/"&gt;the second-most played game on &lt;em&gt;all of Steam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at one point, ahead of every game save &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, &lt;/em&gt;and it’s comfortably sitting at number three now.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fzcx0K"&gt;It’s already set a top-ten record for concurrent players on Steam &lt;a href="https://steamdb.info/app/892970/graphs/"&gt;with roughly 392,000&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, knocking &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/"&gt;off that top 10 chart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="an0GTw"&gt;By Friday, it took the #9 spot with 410,000 players, pulling &lt;em&gt;Postal &lt;/em&gt;down one rung.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WJosSj"&gt;It topped the Steam Top Sellers list during Valve’s Steam Lunar New Year sale — despite having zero discounts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ttr5q0GEPIwdbRlpZ4pb474KNjI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309259/steam_charts_top_played_games.jpg"&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZJXT0NhkWQgCA4_iJaYyaP3x5AI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309223/steam_top_sellers_lunar_new_year.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshot taken February 15th, the last day of the Steam sale.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O6RSp0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valheim-may-well-be-steams-biggest-ever-viral-hit/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt;’s trajectory is unlike anything we’ve seen before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUq6tJ"&gt;The closest parallel is perhaps &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/pubg-playerunknown-brendan-greene-interview-july-2017/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; —&lt;/em&gt; which similarly came out of Steam Early Access, sold oodles of copies during Steam sales &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/steam-summer-sale-pubg-player-unknown-battlegrounds/"&gt;(also without being on sale&lt;/a&gt;), set a record for the Steam game with the most simultaneous players (3.2 million) that still stands today, and kicked off the entire battle royale genre that spawned today’s &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and more. But even &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; took months to reach the kind of numbers that &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; already has now, and that was with a genre-defining, action-packed, nail-biting, streamer-friendly game that makes for a delightfully tense watch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MmalvW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Technically, ‘Valheim’ released a 2018 alpha build on itch.io&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UjhWdv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt;, by comparison, is slow and methodical. It’s part of an established genre of survival games where you scavenge and harvest, chop and dig, hunt and skin, then build better tools to do it all more efficiently over and over again. Only here, you’re also a badass Viking who can (eventually) build fortresses and ships, you’re hunting down gods for sport, and you’re exploring &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valheim-player-discovers-whats-beyond-the-edge-of-its-enormous-map/"&gt;a gobsmackingly gigantic map&lt;/a&gt; filled with idyllic scenery, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PatrikJarlestam/status/1361604565531959305"&gt;charming music&lt;/a&gt;, a touch of lived-in mystery, and some enemies that stomp me convincingly enough that I get a slight &lt;em&gt;Dark Souls&lt;/em&gt; vibe out of it. Oh, and when you cut down trees, they fall and hit other things (like you) for massive damage! That’s never going to get old.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The game’s graphics may seem dull at first but can be picturesque, particularly with eye candy like depth of field, tessellation, and sun shafts. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zklytf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/9/22275109/valheim-viking-game-steam-charts-explainer"&gt;As Cass Marshall at &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, it’s also incredibly accessible and easy to learn — I’d convinced myself that I disliked survival games due to their typically rigid mechanics, but in &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; everything seems to make sense without thinking too hard. I don’t need to spend ages punching trees to build some basic tools, there’s no need to acquire blueprints (recipes unlock as soon as you find new materials), and I don’t have to painstakingly plan how I want my house to look before I start building. You can instantly demolish a portion of a structure and refund your materials if it’s not quite right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wk3PCo"&gt;In fact, building is fast enough that I’m starting to build temporary forward operating bases before I venture into each new area, like the tiny fort below that took all of five minutes and I’ve since expanded twice. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DDoTrQoXUEMDG9CjIsfEfptUEqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22309305/valheim_2.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It gets real dark at night. Fire is a must if you’re planning to stay up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3dFC"&gt;There’s no telling how long the magic will last for me or for the game’s 2 million players and counting, of course. It’s been &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/945360#1y"&gt;all downhill for &lt;em&gt;Among Us &lt;/em&gt;on PC&lt;/a&gt;, which currently only attracts one-tenth of its peak player count of 438,000 last September (though it could still be wildly popular on mobile). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKI4K5"&gt;But I imagine word-of-mouth may keep &lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; going for a while. I can’t wait to try the game’s two- to ten-player co-op mode with my circle of friends, and that means more copies in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khWT2s"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Valheim &lt;/em&gt;does have staying power, expect to hear this game’s name on a lot of lips in the months to come. If history’s any indication, we’ll soon see a rush of knockoffs, &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-08-18-mobile-version-of-fall-guys-is-a-scam-mediatonic-warns"&gt;fake-outs&lt;/a&gt;, and attempts to make other games play more like it, and there may be a lot of pressure on Iron Gate to port the PC-only game to consoles and phones as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3l7Vk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, February 19th: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valheim has now sold 3 million copies and is now has a new record for the ninth-most simultaneous players at any one moment on Steam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned how the Daft Punk robot helmets were created</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q9_Dpvk7pmX8UtjpmWkuB8lnZuQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845901/acastro_210219_4434_daftPunk_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / Images by Daft Punk, Alex and Martin, and Alterian Inc.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CxncBL"&gt;As a visual artist who also makes beats in the anonymity of my bedroom, I’ve always wondered how Daft Punk managed to craft not only their music, but their visual presence. A masterpiece unto itself, the Daft Punk helmets transform two anonymous musicians into otherworldly beings. Arbiters of funk and electro. Ambassadors of sound. Gods of the synthesizer. You get it. The helmets allow the musicians to detach themselves from reality and bring the audience into their universe. It leaves the musician in mystery, and until today, the genesis of the helmets was a mystery to me too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbaORk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Daft_Wub/status/1362285526435340288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1362285526435340288%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;In a tweet thread by @daft_wub&lt;/a&gt;, you can see the whole process from sketch to final, including electrical schematics and initial sculpts of the helmets. They also show the complex wiring that was required to power the matrix of LEDs, as well as behind-the-scenes images from Daft Punk’s very first photo shoot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P4xuzf"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="flEgXj"&gt;The thread also credits the companies involved: Alterian Inc., which did work on the first version of the helmets, and Ironhead Studios, which worked on the latest and slimmest versions of our favorite funk bots. Both studios have experience in film; Ironhead Studios in particular has worked with Marvel on live-action costumes for characters such as Spider-Man, Black Panther, Thanos, and more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="6sIiG8"&gt;These images aren’t new; the tweet thread is simply recirculating them, but this is great for fans like me who’ve never really seen the process. If you want to learn more, I suggest reading &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wnyekw/daft-punk-birth-of-robots"&gt;this article by Piers Martin&lt;/a&gt;, based on an extensive 2000 interview of the duo originally conducted for &lt;em&gt;The Face&lt;/em&gt;. You can even read a full annotated transcript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NN2IXs"&gt;And for bonus material, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtjucCWeOf4&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;check out this video&lt;/a&gt; with Alterian SFX Designer Tony Gardner exploring various iterations of the suits. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The biggest news and trailers from Blizzcon 2021’s opening keynote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2dFwmxY_jZ9t8ReGd3kbuz0L9Yc=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845804/Diablo_II_Char_Select_Act1.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hZCJrv"&gt;Blizzcon happened a little later than usual due to the pandemic, but the first virtual version of Blizzard’s games convention still had some interesting news and trailers. The opening keynote covered most of the big franchises, like &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;, along with some more obscure classics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1bXQ35"&gt;If you missed the event, you can catch up on all of the biggest news right here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="I0LOZz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291771/blizzard-arcade-collection-announced-blizzcon-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blizzard Arcade Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E6sHSD"&gt;The first announcement was one of the most unexpected: three of Blizzard’s more obscure games are being bundled into a new package called the &lt;em&gt;Blizzard Arcade Collection&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Lost Vikings, Rock &amp;amp; Roll Racing&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Blackthorne &lt;/em&gt;have all been ported to modern platforms, including PC, Xbox One, PS4, and the Nintendo Switch. And they include some handy features, like save states and a virtual museum. The best part? The collection is out now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QJ6PH9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LvrLZ4yETHI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6MIdJz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22285611/diablo-4-blizzcon-2021-trailer-rogue-class"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4yCsWV"&gt;Diablo IV is still some ways away — Blizzard has already said it won’t be launching this year — but we at least got a glimpse of what to expect thanks to a new trailer that unveiled the rogue class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dhXmOu"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DRP62MGOrUo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0dqJyV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291766/diablo-2-resurrected-remaster-blizzcon-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo II Resurrected&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="My83ua"&gt;If you prefer an older-style of demonic dungeon crawling, Blizzard also officially unveiled &lt;em&gt;Diablo II Resurrected&lt;/em&gt;, an HD remaster of the nearly two decade-old game. It’s coming out this year for both PC and console, with versions for the Switch, PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S. It’ll even include cross-progression between console and PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jUqsDY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tLDvM5IDyL8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="1j7Jfx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hn1KPO"&gt;For &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft Classic&lt;/em&gt; players, Blizzard revealed that the game’s next big adventure will be the “Burning Crusade.” There’s no word on when exactly it’ll launch, but Blizzard says “the Dark Portal reopens 2021.” For the main game, there’s also a new chapter for the &lt;em&gt;Shadowlands&lt;/em&gt; expansion on the way, called “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Warcraft/status/1362889402612133891"&gt;Chains of Domination&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aFPou7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lRj-GotnNaQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VzzgEs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bKSpq9"&gt;During a presentation after the main keynote, Blizzard unveiled some new information about &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;. There are two new maps, &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1362902203875303427"&gt;Rome&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1362902483081719808"&gt;New York&lt;/a&gt;, weather effects like &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1362905194460106754"&gt;sandstorms and snow&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1362906847770906625"&gt;new&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1362907402790608898"&gt;enemy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1362906606124503040"&gt;units&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1362908431691116547"&gt;redesigned looks&lt;/a&gt; for Widowmaker, Reaper, McCree, and Pharah.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQyHFf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 19th, 6:56PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added &lt;/em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;em&gt; announcements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Diablo II is getting remastered for console and PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yAYTtt9jYFghX2H6VERDG2jGZZ4=/145x0:1767x1081/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845709/screenshot__170_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7HhRi5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo II&lt;/em&gt; is getting a big overhaul in a new remaster. After &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/25/22248563/diablo-2-remake-release-dates-pc-blizzard-vicarious-visions-activision-report"&gt;a few leaks&lt;/a&gt;, Blizzard officially announced &lt;em&gt;Diablo II Resurrected&lt;/em&gt; at its online-only edition of Blizzcon 2021. The new version of the game — which first launched back in 2000 — will launch this year on PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, and Xbox Series X and S, with cross-progression between PC and console. The HD remaster will include both the base game and its expansion, &lt;em&gt;Lord of Destruction&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R1N5Dr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;                              &lt;br&gt;          Arise,                        &lt;br&gt;               Diablo,     &lt;br&gt;   Lord         &lt;br&gt;                of              &lt;br&gt;                      Terror.&lt;br&gt;                   &lt;br&gt;                             &lt;br&gt;                       &lt;a href="https://t.co/76kxCCMv51"&gt;pic.twitter.com/76kxCCMv51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Diablo (@Diablo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Diablo/status/1362896494622294017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LNiclb"&gt;The announcement comes at a surprisingly busy time for the long running action-RPG series. In addition to the remaster of &lt;em&gt;Diablo II&lt;/em&gt;, Blizzard is also working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22180377/diablo-immortal-iphone-android-technical-alpha-preview"&gt;a mobile spinoff called &lt;em&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and the next full-fledged title, &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySwr6n"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Diablo II&lt;/em&gt; is too modern for your tastes, the original game is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254558/diablo-classic-digital-gog-blizzard-windows-10-purchase"&gt;still available on GOG.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VFz7TL"&gt;Google has fired Margaret Mitchell, co-lead of the ethical AI team, after she used an automated script to look through her emails in order to find evidence of discrimination against her coworker Timnit Gebru. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/google-fires-another-ai-ethics-leader-6ef7dcd5-4583-4396-b5b3-129547ff3091.html"&gt;The news was first reported by &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfxfna"&gt;Mitchell’s firing comes one day after Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289264/google-restructuring-ethical-ai-team-timnit-gebru-firing"&gt;announced a reorganization to its AI teams&lt;/a&gt; working on ethics and fairness. Marian Croak, a vice president in the engineering organization, is now leading “a new center of expertise on responsible AI within Google Research,” &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/marian-croak-responsible-ai/"&gt;according to a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gvV6yD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These decisions were made behind our backs”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oxgjl7"&gt;Mitchell joined Google in 2016 as a senior research scientist, according to her LinkedIn. Two years later, she helped start the ethical AI team alongside Gebru, a renowned researcher known for her work on bias in facial recognition technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vbfa9w"&gt;In December 2020, Mitchell and Gebru were working on a paper about the dangers of large language processing models when Megan Kacholia, vice president of Google Brain, asked that the article be retracted. Gebru pushed back, saying the company needed to be more open about why the research wasn’t acceptable. Shortly afterwards, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;she was fired&lt;/a&gt;, though Google characterized her departure as a resignation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JZWbr"&gt;After Gebru’s termination, Mitchell became openly critical of Google executives, including Google AI division head Jeff Dean and Google CEO Sundar Pichai. In January, she lost her corporate email access after Google began investigating her activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yLL1Su"&gt;“After conducting a review of this manager’s conduct, we confirmed that there were multiple violations of our code of conduct, as well as of our security policies, which included the exfiltration of confidential business-sensitive documents and private data of other employees,” Google said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;about Mitchell’s firing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3DKnrA"&gt;On Friday, Google announced it was making changes to its research and diversity policies, following an investigation into Gebru’s termination. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291631/google-diversity-research-policy-changes-timnet-gebru-firing"&gt;In an internal email&lt;/a&gt;, Jeff Dean apologized to staff for how Gebru’s departure was handled. “I heard and acknowledge what Dr. Gebru’s exit signified to female technologists, to those in the Black community and other underrepresented groups who are pursuing careers in tech, and to many who care deeply about Google’s responsible use of AI. It led some to question their place here, which I regret,” he said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13Pv0K"&gt;The ethical AI team has been in crisis since Gebru’s firing in December. After the reorganization announcement yesterday, senior researcher &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexhanna/status/1362477638749626369"&gt;Alex Hanna wrote&lt;/a&gt; that the team was not aware of Croak’s appointment until the news broke publicly Wednesday night. “We were told to trust the process, trust in decision-makers like Marian Croak to look out for our best interests,” she said on Twitter. “But these decisions were made behind our backs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yx2EGt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lv1Nbs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hVQcYk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Diablo IV’s latest trailer unveils the rogue class</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q30MkFRCycfmeqLFxQgJ4VaeaM4=/130x0:967x558/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845651/Screen_Shot_2021_02_19_at_5.44.51_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dJMwlk"&gt;At Blizzcon 2021, Blizzard revealed the latest glimpse at its upcoming RPG &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt;. The cinematic trailer introduced a previously-unannounced character class to the game: the rogue. The other already-announced classes are barbarian, sorceress, and druid. The trailer also provided a nice look at the game’s dark atmosphere, getting particularly gruesome towards the end. You might not want to pierce your ears after watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWmHGz"&gt;Before the virtual convention Blizzard made sure to temper expectations by announcing that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22267131/diablo-4-overwatch-2-release-date-2022-activision-blizzard-earnings"&gt;neither &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt; nor &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; would be releasing this year&lt;/a&gt;. The action role-playing game has been much-anticipated for some time, as it was originally announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942565/diablo-4-announced-release-date-blizzcon-2019"&gt;way back at the 2019 edition of Blizzcon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHoF8C"&gt;Meanwhile, Blizzard is also hoping to expand the franchise’s reach with an upcoming mobile adaptation called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22180377/diablo-immortal-iphone-android-technical-alpha-preview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291766/diablo-2-resurrected-remaster-blizzcon-2021"&gt;remaster of Diablo II&lt;/a&gt; for PC and various consoles including the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ex-Google engineer Anthony Levandowski has closed his artificial intelligence church</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Anthony Levandowski In Court For Bond Hearing After Being Charged With Stealing Google Trade Secrets" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TjdIjNSnW1Lp6E_OZUAOhtI7MCo=/0x63:4194x2859/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845574/1172284878.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CPxfhD"&gt;Anthony Levandowski, a former Google engineer convicted of stealing self-driving car secrets, is closing his artificial intelligence-focused church Way of the Future (WOTF), &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/18/anthony-levandowski-closes-his-church-of-ai/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a somewhat inauspicious end to the church’s goal of pursuing “the realization, acceptance, and worship of a Godhead based on Artificial Intelligence (AI),” in preparation for &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity"&gt;the Singularity&lt;/a&gt;. Now humanity will be left to deal with rampant AI without the religion’s guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3QDR"&gt;Levandowski started the process of shuttering WOTF in June 2020, according to documents filed in the state of California found by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. WOTF never had regular meetings or a physical church building. The church’s funds, totaling $175,172, have been donated to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4tIEwP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Way of the Future is a thing of the past&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="83DlSm"&gt;Owning and operating an AI church is really just one piece of the larger Levandowski story, which &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has covered as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/2/16965974/uber-waymo-self-driving-car-lawsuit-news"&gt;the legal saga between Uber and Google’s Waymo&lt;/a&gt;. Levandowski worked on autonomous vehicles at Google, then started his own self-driving trucking company Otto, which he later sold to Uber. At some point in the journey from Google to Uber, Levandowski took some internal documents from the search giant, leading to Google suing Uber in 2017 and settling in 2018. Levandowski was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354906/anthony-levandowski-waymo-uber-lawsuit-sentence-18-months-prison-lawsuit"&gt;convicted of trade secret theft&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CSrVBK"&gt;Levandowski was sentenced to a shortened 18 months in prison to be served following the pandemic, but was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22240175/trump-pardons-anthony-levandowski-google-uber-waymo-trade-secrets"&gt;pardoned by former President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; before he left office. With Way of the Future a thing of the past, no prison sentence to serve, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18146339/anthony-levandowski-self-driving-car-cross-country-co-pilot-pronto-uber-waymo"&gt;another autonomous driving company&lt;/a&gt; to oversee, Levandowski seems like he can wait for AI to surpass humans in relative peace.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blizzard Arcade Collection bundles three of the studio’s more obscure classics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qa3vV4MWu_A6eJTXosFca9h92pA=/172x0:1749x1051/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845484/Screenshot__156_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9JQr7S"&gt;As part of BlizzCon Online’s opening ceremony, Blizzard Entertainment announced a new video game anthology that includes some of the earlier titles created by the &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; developer. &lt;a href="https://blizzard.gamespress.com/en-CA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blizzard Arcade Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a compilation featuring three titles developed by Blizzard around the early and mid-1990s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VH1OnR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blizzard Arcade Collection&lt;/em&gt; includes &lt;em&gt;The Lost Vikings&lt;/em&gt;, a puzzle platformer that was originally released on SNES in 1993, back when the studio was known as Silicon &amp;amp; Synapse. The game would also see previous ports on other consoles like the Amiga and Game Boy Advance, and was even made available on PC &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/5/3/5678044/the-lost-vikings-free-blizzard-deal"&gt;as a free download on Battle.net&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TF6V9D"&gt;The other games available include another platformer called &lt;em&gt;Blackthorne&lt;/em&gt;, which was released originally in 1994 on the SNES, as well as &lt;em&gt;Rock n’ Roll Racing&lt;/em&gt;, a vehicular combat racer. And just like &lt;em&gt;The Lost Vikings,&lt;/em&gt; both titles would make their way onto &lt;a href="https://www.blizzard.com/en-us/download?show=classic"&gt;Blizzard’s digital storefront as free titles&lt;/a&gt; in 2013 and 2014, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgNnXt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blizzard Arcade Collection&lt;/em&gt; is available now on PC, PS4, Switch, and Xbox One.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Street Fighter icons Chun-Li and Ryu are joining Fortnite</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/16s9UED8v3kOiP-3lF1_EDuqdBA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68845433/Screen_Shot_2021_02_19_at_1.58.14_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AYd8l2"&gt;Famous video game fighter Chun-Li may not be &lt;a href="https://jezebel.com/who-forgot-to-invite-chun-li-to-the-mortal-kombat-1846300631"&gt;in the new &lt;em&gt;Mortal Kombat&lt;/em&gt; movie&lt;/a&gt;, but she and fellow &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter&lt;/em&gt; icon Ryu will be playable characters in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;soon. Both Chun-Li and Ryu will be available in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; in-game shop on Saturday, February 20th at 7PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1EWB9"&gt;Chun-Li and Ryu aren’t the first video game stars to appear in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; this season — fans have also had the chance to pick up skins based on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22151470/fortnite-god-of-war-kratos-skin-now-available"&gt;Kratos from &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166187/fortnite-master-chief-halo-the-walking-dead-the-game-awards"&gt;Master Chief from &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXE3H7"&gt;This entire season of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has been jam-packed with other crossovers, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22276283/fortnite-tron-crossover-skins-light-cycles"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/30/22256564/fortnite-gi-joe-snake-eyes"&gt;G.I. Joe’s Snake Eyes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fortnitegame/status/1337245726477348865?lang=en"&gt;two characters from &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22231705/fortnite-soccer-skins-manchester-city-juventus-ac-milan-faze-clan"&gt;soccer kits from real-world teams&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22028767/the-mandalorian-fortnite-perfect-character-season-5"&gt;even the Mandalorian and Baby Yoda&lt;/a&gt; (who is absolutely adorable in-game). And the game’s last season was a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402707/fortnite-chapter-2-season-4-marvel-nexus-war-thor-iron-man"&gt;huge Marvel-themed crossover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NhmWW"&gt;As unexpected as Chun-Li and Ryu’s arrivals may be, they’re just another reminder that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;no brand is safe from &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
