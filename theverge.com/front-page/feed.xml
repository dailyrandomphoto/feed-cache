    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cqjWjM"&gt;Amazon Prime Day, the retail giant’s two-day blitz of deals and promotions, officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22"&gt;lands tomorrow, June 21st&lt;/a&gt;. The annual shopping event is taking a place a few weeks earlier than it has in the past, and Amazon has already kick-started the event with a slew of deals for Amazon Prime subscribers, discounting everything from the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Charcoal/dp/B07HZLHPKP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;last-gen Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; to the latest pair of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085WTYQ4X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt;. More deals are set to live during the main event, too, with retailers such as Walmart and Target joining the shopping fray with deals of their own, many of which will rival Amazon’s offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfQOiJ"&gt;Below, we’ve rounded up the best early Prime Day deals. In most instances, all you need to do is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21493780/amazon-prime-sign-up-day-deals-sale-price-free"&gt;sign up for Amazon Prime&lt;/a&gt; to take advantage of the deals, however, a few promotions come with some additional caveats that we’ll note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PzRclz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to sign up for Amazon Prime","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21493780/amazon-prime-sign-up-day-deals-sale-price-free"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Omrvrp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085WTYQ4X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Buds (second-gen) — $40 off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="D7ZuXF"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price"&gt;second-gen Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt; were appealing when they launched two months ago — and that was before they received a $40 discount. They also improve upon their predecessors in almost every way, offering up enjoyable sound, better comfort, and effective noise cancellation that helps you to drown out the world around you. They can’t compete with the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;, but if you’re looking for an affordable pair of true wireless earbuds, or a way to bring Alexa with you on the go, the Echo Buds are it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPdJR0"&gt;Right now, you can snag the standard, second-gen &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085WTY1HQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Buds with a wired charging case&lt;/a&gt; in either black or white for $80. Amazon is also offering $40 off the version with the wireless charging case, bringing the price down to $100 for a limited time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jFw2gO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600144"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hqXCjy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-TV-Stick-4K-with-Alexa-Voice-Remote/dp/B079QHML21/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K — $25 off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Bh03Bv"&gt;Let’s face it: there are a ton of options when it comes to streaming devices. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/31/18044584/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-review"&gt;Fire Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt;, however, remains the best streaming device if you’re already tapped into Amazon’s ever-growing ecosystem. The latest model supports Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos, along with HDR, HDR10, and HDR10+, all three of which allow for brighter highlights and a more expansive color palette. The Fire TV Stick is also plenty fast and comes with an Alexa-enabled remote, meaning you can bark commands into more than just your smart speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GC3ebs"&gt;For a limited time, Amazon is offering the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-TV-Stick-4K-with-Alexa-Voice-Remote/dp/B079QHML21/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire TV Stick 4K for $25&lt;/a&gt;. You can also currently get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/all-new-fire-tv-cube-with-alexa-voice-remote/dp/B07KGVB6D6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire TV Cube&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon for $80, a discount of $40. The latter device offers the same functionality as the Fire TV Stick 4K but doubles as a smart speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BmCBMT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10616045"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bX2g7q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PMT4T11/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Halo — $30 off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gXr8Hu"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;Amazon Halo&lt;/a&gt; is no Fitbit, but if you don’t mind a little invasiveness and can get around the fact it doesn’t have a dedicated screen, it’s a convenient way to track your sleep habits, chart your physical activity, and access a host of workout programs. While the woven, band-like device can track basic fitness metrics like your steps and heart rate, it can also measure your body fat percentage and the tone of your voice, a tool that will supposedly measure your emotional state throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yTy0WF"&gt;The Amazon Halo is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Halo-Fitness-And-Health-Band/dp/B07QKPCQKW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available&lt;/a&gt; in several sizes and color configurations for $70, the lowest price we’ve seen the band since its debut in August 2020. The fitness tracker also comes with a six-month membership, after which you’ll be required to pay $4 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vU2DAg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10269519"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lpBzPI"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Charcoal/dp/B07HZLHPKP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 (first-gen) — $35 off&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="V6vA7l"&gt;The recently updated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review"&gt;second-gen Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best smart displays you can get for the bedroom, however, it’s also not nearly as affordable as its last-gen counterpart. Thankfully, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; offers much of the same functionality in the same compact package. Like the newer model, it features a vibrant touchscreen and a host of voice-activated features, and while its 1-megapixel camera leaves a lot to be desired, it does come with a physical shutter if you’re someone who prefers privacy assurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiR31X"&gt;Normally $80, the Echo Show is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Charcoal/dp/B07HZLHPKP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;priced at $45&lt;/a&gt; for Prime members, matching the lowest price we’ve seen yet on Amazon’s capable smart display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FFqJae"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513095"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BMm3YQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-10-tablet/dp/B08BX7FV5L/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Fire HD 10 — $70 off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RSe5T9"&gt;Of all the tablets Amazon produces, the Fire HD 10 and 10 Plus are easily the most capable. The latest HD 10 is outfitted with a brighter, 10.1-inch 1080p display and 3GB of RAM — twice as much as the previous generation — and touts USB-C and 12 hours of battery life, rendering it a capable device for entertainment and lightweight productivity. Sure, its app selection is still pretty limited and you’ll have to pay an additional $15 fee to kick the ads on the lock screen, but it’s less than a fifth the street price of the latest iPad Air, which is a feat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9WNdR"&gt;Now through Tuesday, Prime members can pick up the latest &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-10-tablet/dp/B08BX7FV5L/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire HD 10 (32GB, ad-supported) for $80&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-10-tablet/dp/B08F69779X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ad-free version for $95&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HDsKrp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10616001"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ndvK35"&gt;Other Fire tablet deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="On0Jlf"&gt;The latest &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-10-Plus-tablet/dp/B08F6FYN6B/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Fire HD 10 Plus&lt;/a&gt; (32GB, ad-supported) is $110 at Amazon (usually $180).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="H7u7Rg"&gt;The latest &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-Plus-tablet/dp/B0839NDRB2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Fire HD 8 Plus&lt;/a&gt; (32GB, ad-supported) is $65 at Amazon (usually $110).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JcLkpg"&gt;The latest &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-tablet/dp/B07TMJ1R3X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Fire HD 8&lt;/a&gt; (32GB, ad-supported) is $45 at Amazon (usually $90).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hAcT9Z"&gt;The latest &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-Kids-Edition-tablet/dp/B07WDDT3G5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Fire HD 8 Kids&lt;/a&gt; is $70 at Amazon (usually $140).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nhfmVo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ftu/plans/prepaid_3month/"&gt;Amazon Kids Plus — $29 off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xJpt6E"&gt;Amazon Kids Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436457/amazon-kids-rebranding-freetime"&gt;formerly FreeTime Unlimited&lt;/a&gt;, isn’t so much service for you as it is for your child. As the name implies, the subscription-based service grants your child access to a host of kid-friendly content on select devices, allowing them to discover a trove of educational apps, books, movies, and games. Much of the content is exclusive to the service, however, it also spans a multitude of age groups, meaning there’s likely age-appropriate content for your kid, regardless if you have a toddler or preteen. Like most kid-centric services, you can also limit screen time, filter content, and restrict web access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xI4rFY"&gt;In the lead-up to Prime Day, Amazon is offering Prime members a three-month subscription to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ftu/plans/prepaid_3month/"&gt;Amazon Kids Plus for a $1&lt;/a&gt;, amounting to $29 in savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cgwgP5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10610382"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Vl6LGO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Dot (fourth-gen) — $25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7fd6rg"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;fourth-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon’s latest entry-level smart speaker, is yet another refinement of what has become the most popular model in the Echo lineup. Despite its price and size, the Alex-equipped speaker still manages to tout impressive sound and a commendable set of mics, which allow you to play music, control your smart home gadgets, and carry out the full range of commands you might find on other, more capable Echo devices. It’s the entry-level smart speaker to get, even if the new design isn’t as convenient for mounting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UrCp0b"&gt;Now through Prime Day, Amazon is discounting the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Echo Dot to $25&lt;/a&gt;, half of what it typically retails for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3sPqPS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10616009"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="Sw9BNE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to find the best deals during Prime Day 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21502865/amazon-prime-day-best-deals-how-to-find"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="xH7cYU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/music/unlimited"&gt;Amazon Music Unlimited — free four-month trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JpmtUX"&gt;If you haven’t tried Amazon Music Unlimited before, Amazon is offering Prime members a four-month free trial to the popular Spotify and Apple Music alternative. Its feature set is akin to most of its competitors, however, it also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440058/amazon-music-hd-price-cut-apple-lossless-audio"&gt;offers lossless audio&lt;/a&gt; at no extra cost, a perk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;Apple recently rolled&lt;/a&gt; out to Apple Music subscribers. With Amazon Music Unlimited, you’ll gain access to ad-free listening, podcasts, and a robust catalog of more than 70 million songs, not to mention the service’s deep integration with Amazon devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEAkAT"&gt;Just be sure to cancel your subscription before the trial ends if you no longer want to continue subscribing after the four-month window. Otherwise, you’ll automatically be charged an $8 monthly subscription fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="96zkrl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10607756"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LMENHd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo (fourth-gen) — $30 off a pair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2NBjU1"&gt;The Amazon Echo remains the namesake of the current Echo lineup. Although it shares much of its functionality with the aforementioned Echo Dot, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;fourth-gen Echo&lt;/a&gt; produces bigger, bolder sound and features a built-in smart home hub, meaning you can connect it with lightbulbs, door sensors, and a host of other popular Zigbee devices sans a secondary hub. It even has a temperature sensor, just in case you want to turn on your air conditioner or fan via Alexa routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4YrIb"&gt;If you’re looking to add multiple Echos to your space, Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounting a pair&lt;/a&gt; ahead of Prime Day, knocking $30 off the price of two with offer code &lt;strong&gt;ECHOPRIME &lt;/strong&gt;(discount applies at checkout).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="407A0B"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AqGaWV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P989QTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Luna Controller — $21 off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9qTMwM"&gt;With Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532868/amazon-game-streaming-luna-access-no-invite-prime-day-members"&gt;opening up Luna access&lt;/a&gt; to all Prime subscribers starting tomorrow, now might be your best opportunity to check out Amazon’s answer to Google Stadia and Microsoft's xCloud. Using a dedicated app or browser, the cloud gaming platform is available on pretty much any device you can throw at it — including Windows, Mac, FireTV, iOS, iPadOS, and select Android devices — and offers a way to stream titles like &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus &lt;/em&gt;without a dedicated console or gaming machine. Basic subscriptions run $5.99 a month, though, you can also pay $14.99 a month for the Ubisoft Plus beta channel, which grants you access to a range of Ubisoft titles, including &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b0KHof"&gt;We found the service to be hit or miss in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525339/amazon-luna-hands-on-cloud-gaming-streaming-early-access-price-games"&gt;initial review&lt;/a&gt;, but Amazon is currently offering a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P989QTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Luna Controller for $49&lt;/a&gt; as part of its early Prime Day deals, making the lack of titles far more palatable. You can also purchase a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-TV-Stick-4K-with-Alexa-Voice-Remote/dp/B095ZMSY1N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bundle with a Fire TV Stick for $74&lt;/a&gt; or with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08KT9XY9Z/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;phone clip for $62&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to attach your phone directly to the Luna Controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8vEOXK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10606997"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pOhmCy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08X7KQQGJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Insignia 55-inch 4K Fire TV Edition — $150 off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BZzTsE"&gt;Insignia’s 55-inch 4K Fire TV Edition television certainly doesn’t offer the kind of picture afforded by today’s best OLEDs, but it’s hard to find a Fire TV Edition model that supports HDR10, a feature that allows for better brightness, color accuracy, and contrast. Insignia’s 4K TV also supports HDMI ARC and HDMI eARC, meaning you can utilize a single cable to send audio from a compatible soundbar or receiver to your TV, and features Amazon’s Fire TV software, allowing you to access Prime Video, Netflix, and a slew of popular streaming services without a standalone streaming device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZi8EO"&gt;As of this week, Insignia’s 4K Fire TV Edition model is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08X7KQQGJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for $350&lt;/a&gt;, a $150 discount and the lowest price we’ve seen yet on the 55-inch model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pj5QuH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10605845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gLz8Bs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/membership/premiumplus/prime?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Audible Premium Plus — $32 off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MuUbyq"&gt;If you’re an audiobook fan, it’s hard to ignore Amazon’s audiobook service, Audible. Its catalog spans more than 200,000 ad-free titles, and it's peppered with exclusives and originals, some of which come in the form of podcasts and guided wellness programs. A monthly subscription to Audible Premium Plus provides you with one credit a month, which can be redeemed for any premium audiobook in Amazon’s catalog, regardless of the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mG7MNG"&gt;Audible Premium Plus subscriptions typically run $15 a month, however, now through Prime Day, you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/membership/premiumplus/prime?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscribe for $7 a month&lt;/a&gt; for the first four months, after which the subscription rate will automatically revert to the standard rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ue1uCc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10607843"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S4zlh4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 20th, 7:05PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt; Added the Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K and select Fire tablets to the roundup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Wwc6RJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Enw9zU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hXb07G"&gt;So I completely devoured &lt;em&gt;Hacks &lt;/em&gt;(fantastic), watched the season four finale of &lt;em&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale &lt;/em&gt;(wow) and episode two of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; (fun!) and I still feel like there are a lot of shows I’m missing? But, I have to sleep sometime. I encourage you to read Emily VanDer Werff’s &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/22535615/handmaids-tale-season-4-review-gilead-covid-normalcy-catharsis"&gt;excellent analysis of &lt;em&gt;Handmaid’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; very good fourth season in &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;, this excellent New Yorker piece &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-new-yorker-interview/jean-smart-never-went-away"&gt;about what it’s like to be Jean Smart&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Vulture&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/loki-episode-2-recap-the-variant.html"&gt;insightful recap&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; ep. 2. I’m now counting the days until the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsmE5t3TaPM&amp;amp;ab_channel=AppleUK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; season two&lt;/a&gt; premiere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V5aiNi"&gt;We have a lot of strong women in this week’s trailer roundup, along with a music documentary produced and directed by Questlove, a new Titans trailer, and a flick with Nicolas Cage and his pet truffle pig (yet another sentence I never anticipated I would write one day).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="A1YXhS"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="sNF1qn"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sM0j03d9fdI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DjXGGM"&gt;LFG &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lQedx4"&gt;This is the story of the US women’s national soccer team and their fight for equal pay, and just watching the trailer I got angry all over again on their behalf (the title stands for “let’s fucking go”). Despite winning four Olympic gold medals and four World Cup championships, they were still making less than their male counterparts— player Jessica McDonald mentions at one point that her paychecks don’t even cover her childcare.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Grr&lt;em&gt;. LFG&lt;/em&gt; premieres on HBO Max June 24th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dox40k"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/slFiJpAxZyQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vgfecQ"&gt;Summer of Soul &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1jssKw"&gt;The Harlem Cultural Festival took place in 1969, the same summer as Woodstock, and featured performances by Gladys Knight and the Pips, Sly and the Family Stone, Mahalia Jackson, B.B. King, The 5th Dimension, and Stevie Wonder. Yet the festival was largely forgotten, even though it was all captured on film. Ahmir “Questlove” Thompson went through 45 hours of never-before-seen footage (that had &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/questloves-documentary-summer-of-soul-release-date-1234944207/"&gt;apparently been left in a basement&lt;/a&gt; for 50 years), to tell the story of this musical event in &lt;em&gt;Summer of Soul &lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(...or, When the Revolution Could Not be Televised)&lt;/em&gt;, which premieres on Hulu July 2nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RZ8cfA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H7ZrjXuNgmA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kCVnjo"&gt;Gunpowder Milkshake&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6GaEmh"&gt;Lena Headey, Karen Gillan, Angela Bassett, Michelle Yeoh, and Carla Gugino are in this movie about lady assassins, and to be perfectly honest I don’t really need much more plot description, I am totally in. Paul Giamatti also stars in &lt;em&gt;Gunpowder Milkshake&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to Netflix July 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b2GCje"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y7H6EtsaJW8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6K6tVR"&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4zugfa"&gt;After the way last season ended, with Alex (Jennifer Aniston) and Bradley (Reese Witherspoon) being cut off abruptly after they spill all the behind-the-scenes secrets at their dysfunctional workplace on live television, I wasn’t sure what season two would look like. Well the wait is almost over and it looks like there are plenty more of the plot twists and backstabbing that made me like this show to begin with. Julianna Margulies joins the cast, and Mark Duplass, Billy Crudup, and Steve Carell all return with Aniston and Witherspoon. &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show &lt;/em&gt;returns to Apple TV Plus on September 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y043gU"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fd09zvjdktE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nNmjFs"&gt;Titans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="NTjDlf"&gt;The hit series based on the &lt;em&gt;Teen Titans&lt;/em&gt; comics returns for season three, which is (appropriately) set in Gotham. Dick Grayson (Brenton Thwaites) notes in the voiceover that the city “breeds a special class of criminal,” and with Vincent &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/titans-season-3-scarecrow-vincent-kartheiser-1234962620/"&gt;Kartheiser joining the cast&lt;/a&gt; as Dr. Jonathan Crane, aka Scarecrow, he may be on to something. &lt;em&gt;Titans&lt;/em&gt; season three comes to HBO Max August 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCyiv5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P59teS"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1i-_CRKdh4Y?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5njFGY"&gt;Pig&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="lpSqEY"&gt;I honestly do not know what to make of this movie— Nicolas Cage is a former chef who is now a recluse and someone steals his pet truffle pig, so he goes all Liam-Neeson-in-&lt;em&gt;Taken&lt;/em&gt; on them. Or as &lt;a href="https://ew.com/movies/pig-trailer-nicolas-cage/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Entertainment Weekly&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; succinctly put it: “John Wick but with a pig.” Our friends at &lt;em&gt;Eater&lt;/em&gt; note that &lt;a href="https://www.eater.com/2019/5/28/18638762/truffle-fraud-fake-italian-piedmont-alba-white-truffles"&gt;truffle-related crimes&lt;/a&gt; are a thing, and a scary thing at that, which I did not know. Cage’s delivery of the line “who has my pig?” is not exactly terrifying but it is a bit creepy, so I am fairly confident this is not a comedy even though the trailer has strong “&lt;em&gt;Saturday Night Live&lt;/em&gt; digital short” vibes. &lt;em&gt;Pig&lt;/em&gt; hits theaters July 16th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FCC updates how some emergency alerts will look on phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_2mQ3GKF0B_0fH5PD4D7xQ5M_Zc=/0x0:525x350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69478483/wea_test_graphic_phone_only_081018.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: FEMA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yi4lRU"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) said it has combined two categories of text message alerts into one: the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/3/17931750/fema-presidential-alert-test-reminder-trump-public-alert-warning-system"&gt;Presidential Alerts&lt;/a&gt;” and alerts from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The two will now be in a  new “National Alerts” category,  active on all devices that receive Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdpkBY"&gt;The goal of the alerts is to warn the public of natural disasters and other crisis situations, “and are of ever-increasing importance given the emergencies and disasters Americans have faced in recent years,” the FCC said in a &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/DOC-373365A1.pdf"&gt;news release (pdf)&lt;/a&gt;. The false alert in Hawaii in 2018, where residents were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/13/16888390/hawaii-missile-emergency-alert-false-alarm"&gt;warned of an imminent ballistic missile threat that wasn’t real&lt;/a&gt;, highlighted the need for improvements to its alert system, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dn0kUG"&gt;The new rules provide states with a checklist of information for their own Emergency Alert Systems, and encourages states to form committees to help administer alerts on the state level. Under the new rules, government agencies can now report false emergency alerts to the FCC’s 24/7 Operations Center, and gives guidance on how alert originators can repeat an alert transmission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41HbpQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.hstoday.us/subject-matter-areas/emergency-preparedness/fema-and-fcc-plan-nationwide-emergency-alert-test-for-aug-11/"&gt;Later this summer&lt;/a&gt;, FEMA and the FCC will conduct a nationwide test of the wireless alerts and the Emergency Alert System (EAS) that sends alerts to radios and televisions. Both tests are scheduled for 2:20PM ET on August 11th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xVQyb4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjMQT4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airspeeder says it had the first successful test flight for its electric flying racecar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oij4YByFd3gQTCPU7n40utvGicE=/0x0:1346x897/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69478341/airspeeder.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://airspeeder.com/news/worlds-first-flying-racing-car-makes-historic-flight#2" target="_blank"&gt;Airspeeder&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="speakable-summary"&gt;Airspeeder says its electric “flying” race car, the Alauda Mk3, has had its first unpiloted test flights in southern Australia. The craft, an electric vertical takeoff multicopter (abbreviated eVTOL for &lt;strong&gt;e&lt;/strong&gt;lectric &lt;strong&gt;v&lt;/strong&gt;ertical &lt;strong&gt;t&lt;/strong&gt;ake &lt;strong&gt;o&lt;/strong&gt;ff and &lt;strong&gt;l&lt;/strong&gt;anding) was remotely controlled and the test flights took place under the supervision of Australia’s Civil Aviation Safety Authority. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdaKPp"&gt;The ultimate goal for Airspeeder and Alauda Aeronautics (the former is the racing series, the latter is the manufacturer), both founded by entrepreneur Matthew Pearson, has been to build flying vehicles for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/11/16761748/alauda-flying-car-race-australia"&gt;purpose of racing them&lt;/a&gt;, which the companies say is the next step. According to Airspeeder’s website, the “successful execution of these flights means that uncrewed electric flying car Grand Prixs will take place in 2021 at three soon-to-be-revealed international locations.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="t0AEv6"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aq6JDIL12Xg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="psy1NZ"&gt;According to&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22670224/WORLD_S_FIRST_FLYING_RACING_CAR_MAKES_HISTORIC_FIRST_FLIGHTS_.pdf"&gt; Airspeeder&lt;/a&gt; (pdf), the unpiloted Mk3 weighs 130 kilograms (about 286 pounds), can go from zero to 62 mph in 2.8 seconds, and climb to 500 meters. It has a removable battery, which its pit crews have been able to replace in under 20 seconds. It can fly for 10 to 15 minutes on one battery pack, the company says, and it’s equipped with lidar and radar to create a “virtual forcefield” to help prevent collisions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oRnSB7"&gt;Airspeeder says its initial EXA Series races, which it’s planning for later this year, will include up to four teams with two remote pilots per team.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: If you enrolled in an energy saver program, your smart thermostat may adjust itself</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Hg9JNt-JdMuQ31ww61smMIsNFA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69472181/dseifert_201115_4301_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Thermostat&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VW5PrM"&gt;Texas’ energy grid, which &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/texas-freeze-power-grid-failure-electricity-market-incentives-11613777856"&gt;failed spectacularly over the winter&lt;/a&gt; during a stretch of historically cold weather, will be put to the test again this weekend, as temperatures across much of the state are forecast to be in the upper 90s. Despite &lt;a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/politics/texas/article/AbbottFailedTexas-ERCOT-heat-Texas-electricity-16249076.php"&gt;assurances from Gov. Greg Abbott&lt;/a&gt; that “everything that needed to be done was done to fix the power grid in Texas,” earlier this week the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) &lt;a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/energy/article/ERCOT-issues-intermittent-conservation-alerts-16246788.php"&gt;urged customers to adjust thermostats&lt;/a&gt; to 78 degrees or higher and cut back on electricity use for several days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1FUqG"&gt;Texas residents with smart thermostats are &lt;a href="https://enrollmythermostat.com/faqs/texas-faq/"&gt;eligible for a number of programs&lt;/a&gt;, sweepstakes, and discounts which effectively allow energy providers to adjust their thermostats remotely during periods of high energy demand. Known as demand-response programs, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/spavis/status/1405872205091704833?s=21"&gt;some Texans were taken by surprise&lt;/a&gt; this week, as their thermostats were turned up without any action from them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UKAd4j"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;texans with smart thermostats have lost the ability to control the temperature in their own homes!   their smart thermostats are being controlled by their utility company and fixed at very high levels (&amp;gt;80 °F) which could be dangerous if those homes have elderly people &lt;a href="https://t.co/qZvG3OnJQu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qZvG3OnJQu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sarah Pavis (@spavis) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/spavis/status/1405872205091704833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2MF4FF"&gt;But that’s the way these seasonal programs, typically offered via utility companies across the country, are intended to work. Nest owners can also &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-nest/seasonal-savings-nest-thermostat/"&gt;opt-in to programs directly via Google&lt;/a&gt;, Nest’s parent company, even if their local utility isn’t participating in such a program. Raising or lowering thermostats by a few degrees, can, in theory, reduce the strain on the energy grid and prevent the need for rolling blackouts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lm5oeJ"&gt;According to a Google spokesperson, what’s happened in Texas “is related to energy programs managed by local utilities that are working as intended. These programs are not exclusive to Nest Thermostats, and users must opt in to these programs through their utility provider. Users can also opt out any time.” The spokesperson added that if an enrolled customer wants to manually adjust the temperature during a so-called &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9232355/sign-up-for-rush-hour-rewards-or-stop-participating-in-an-event-android?hl=en"&gt;Rush Hour Rewards event&lt;/a&gt;, they should be able to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sm5cjM"&gt;A spokesperson for Honeywell, which also makes smart thermostats, also said customers enrolled in an energy savings program that allows for their thermostats to be adjusted remotely can override the change using the thermostat or the corresponding app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WhILsP"&gt;We reached out to electric companies in Texas to try to get more details on what was happening. A spokesperson for TXU Energy in Dallas said the company “did not activate our demand response program this week.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9hNgd9"&gt;Alejandra Diaz of CenterPoint Energy, which is based in Houston and has more than 2 million residential customers (according to &lt;a href="https://www.centerpointenergy.com/en-us/corporate/about-us/company-overview/fast-facts"&gt;its website&lt;/a&gt;) wrote in a response to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that on June 16th the company “conducted a test curtailment event from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m.,” and that such tests occur twice a year. The utility issued a notification to a company called EnergyHub, “to initiate energy curtailment for their residential customers who have agreed to participate in the program.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1mRQZ"&gt;Then, according to CenterPoint, “EnergyHub adjusted the thermostat setpoint” for enrolled customers and the test concluded by 5PM local time. &lt;a href="https://www.accuweather.com/en/us/houston/77002/june-weather/351197"&gt;According to AccuWeather&lt;/a&gt;, the high temperature in Houston on June 16th was 90 degrees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJ0SVB"&gt;Many Texas electricity customers are enrolled in a program called “Smart Savers Texas,” which is overseen by EnergyHub, which operates the demand response program on behalf of Texas utility companies. The terms of the program, according to EnergyHub’s FAQ:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="neGdeH"&gt;By participating in the Program, you agree to allow EnergyHub, Inc. and your thermostat provider to remotely access your thermostat to make brief, limited adjustments to your thermostat temperature setting at times of peak electricity demand in the summer. You may benefit by seeing a reduced electricity bill. You can opt out of these temperature adjustments at any time&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8e6ADA"&gt;It’s likely that many people enrolled in this program were not aware of these terms; it’s well-established that many people don’t read the fine print on such agreements. &lt;a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/texas/remote-thermostat-adjustment-texas-energy-shortage/285-5acf2bc5-54b7-4160-bffe-1f9a5ef4362a"&gt;And according to news station KHOU&lt;/a&gt;, some customers enrolled in the Smart Savers program in exchange for a sweepstakes entry, which makes it seem even less likely that people knew their thermostats could be adjusted remotely. Some companies offer discounts or rebates on smart thermostat purchases, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/22/4253594/nest-adds-extra-features-and-rebate-in-power-company-partnerships"&gt;discounts on their electric bills&lt;/a&gt;; but the conditions aren’t always clear, and sometimes involve a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dellcam/status/1406355868355022856"&gt;lengthy list&lt;/a&gt; of terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NgmddP"&gt;The thermostat companies claim that their devices can be adjusted manually even after they’ve been adjusted remotely, but reports across social media reports suggest this wasn’t the case for many customers in Texas the past few days. At the very least, making people’s homes hotter during a major heat wave event — whether it’s because of a device not functioning as intended, or an energy program that might save a few pennies— seems like a bad idea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erpqPP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: June 20th 9:12AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added more detail about energy savings programs and comments from company spokespersons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G is a good phone with a too-short shelf life</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;For $399, it doesn’t do enough to stand apart from the less expensive 4G-only version&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="8RBjOF"&gt;The Motorola Moto G Stylus 5G, as you may have pieced together, is a phone with a built-in stylus and 5G. It’s a slightly upgraded version of the 4G-only, 2021-edition Moto G Stylus (I’m sorry, that’s really how these phones are named).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3xsw4"&gt;The Stylus 5G includes a few more hardware upgrades in addition to 5G connectivity, including a bigger battery, more storage and RAM (256GB and 6GB on the version I tested, respectively), and a newer Snapdragon 480 processor. There’s a new stylus-friendly GIF creator mode, which is fun. Fun is good! But it more or less feels like the same phone: the rear camera array is identical with the exception of a different macro sensor, its 6.8-inch screen is the same, and overall dimensions are similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2I5Inz"&gt;This puts the G Stylus 5G in a kind of awkward spot. At $399, it sits between the $279 G Stylus and the $1,000 Galaxy Note 20 (the next step up if you want a stylus with your phone), but it doesn’t go far enough to clearly offer more than the budget-friendlier version. Performance and battery life are a bit better, but these aren’t really weak spots for the 4G version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E8esrM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10611736"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UwjuEC"&gt;Having 5G is nice, too, but the value is diminished when you consider that the G Stylus 5G is only guaranteed two years of security updates. That’s about when 5G in the US will start getting good, so most of us can get away with a 4G device for the next couple of years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sa4Oq8"&gt;It all adds up to a good phone without a compelling case to recommend it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8hI0xGclHIrjtsqT6cIuvbWOVKQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22668420/DSC00884.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone’s 1080p LCD panel lacks the nice contrast of an OLED.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SCCNLW"&gt;Moto G Stylus 5G screen and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="G42hlE"&gt;The G Stylus 5G is a big phone — big with a capital B. Its 6.8-inch display is about as large as they come, at least until all of our phones start folding and expanding into weird little Transformer-style tablets. It’s a 1080p LCD panel that’s just fine — lacking the nice contrast of OLEDs but still usable in bright daylight conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6EiVo"&gt;Battery life is very good, thanks to a large 5,000mAh cell. Using it on Wi-Fi I’ve gotten four hours of screen-on time out of it and it’s only down to 36 percent. You could certainly get two days’ worth of use out of it — including relatively heavy use on cellular data — and even a full day of very demanding use seems reasonable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OQBitH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;For $400, you really should get more than a couple of years of support for your device&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GRDdsH"&gt;Performance is good, too; jumping between apps is quick and smooth, and heavier tasks like zooming in and out of Google Maps shows only a bit of stuttering. There’s minimal but noticeable shutter lag in the camera app, which feels like a problem this phone shouldn’t have, but not enough to ruin anyone’s day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bCsgx"&gt;The G Stylus 5G ships with Android 11 and will only be supported with one major OS platform update and two years of security updates. That’s an unfortunately short lifespan, especially considering that Samsung’s Galaxy A-series phones are now guaranteed four years of security updates. For $400, you really should get more than a couple of years of support for your device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TC96mMxTbWcSHzpUnUOfN5jRZFY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22665397/cat_dot_jay_peg.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The phone’s stylus features are basic but make it easier to do things like add handwriting to an Instagram story post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BpeVmv"&gt;A couple of side notes on the Stylus 5G’s 5G connectivity: at launch it will work on Verizon and T-Mobile’s 5G networks but will operate as 4G-only on AT&amp;amp;T. Motorola says AT&amp;amp;T 5G support will be available “in the coming months.” It’s not compatible with any of the networks’ mmWave 5G (the super fast, hard-to-find variety), but that’s not a big loss. More importantly, it &lt;em&gt;will &lt;/em&gt;work with the C-band 5G frequencies Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T will start using at the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ieQogj"&gt;The Stylus 5G’s stylus features are basic but adequate. The capacitive stylus is spring-loaded into the phone’s lower right corner and automatically brings up a quick menu of options when you remove it. If you’re on the lock screen, you can jot down a note without having to unlock the device, which is handy. You won’t find productivity features or neat tricks like wireless control a la the Note series, but rather some handy shortcuts to grab a GIF or doodle on a screenshot. They’re useful and fair for the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GcjxHvfsnOaYN8CnqzG1DW4Fqt4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22668421/DSC00854.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are standard wide, ultrawide, macro, and depth cameras on the Stylus 5G’s rear panel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Rmh1q3"&gt;Moto G Stylus 5G camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="tYNxtw"&gt;The Stylus 5G offers three rear cameras — a 48-megapixel f/1.7 standard wide, 8-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide, and a 5-megapixel macro — along with a 2-megapixel depth sensor and 16-megapixel selfie camera. The 4G G Stylus has a 2-megapixel macro camera, but that’s the only difference between them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNVTnE"&gt;Much like the 4G version, the Stylus 5G takes good photos in abundant light with a surprising level of detail, thanks to the way it processes 48-megapixel images into 12-megapixel files. The ultrawide camera is nice to have, though its images can be a little noisier in challenging lighting conditions, and the macro camera is still underwhelming, despite the modest resolution boost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oQhLW0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10611787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="1KAPDa"&gt;The main camera is prone to some drastic color shifts with even slightly different compositions of the same scene and subject — in one shot my orange cat is orange, and in the next one taken at a slightly different position, he suddenly looks blue. This happens more frequently in mixed lighting conditions, which many cameras will struggle with, but it popped up just often enough in my testing to annoy me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/genvJDVaBrf66KgQdM0ipRAmHI8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22668423/DSC00841.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Stylus 5G doesn’t quite do enough to stand out.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KNeY5b"&gt;The 4G-only G Stylus is a good deal for $279, and there’s nothing really wrong with the $399 G Stylus 5G, but it’s harder to justify its higher cost. With only a couple of years of security updates guaranteed, this phone will only see the beginning of truly good 5G in the US. It’s a nice step-up option if you’re inclined toward a stylus phone and the Note isn’t in your budget, but for most people, I’d recommend either sticking with the 4G-only model for a couple of years or looking into a 5G phone with a little more longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sh9bnJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Stylus enthusiasts on a budget have a good option in the Moto G Stylus 5G&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2CluFg"&gt;If you’re more interested in the big screen and battery than the stylus, you could save quite a bit and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;go with the Moto G Power (2021)&lt;/a&gt;. Its processor isn’t as good and you miss out on the ultrawide camera, but if you want to cover the basics for a couple of years, it will do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPBRnt"&gt;On the other hand, if you can afford to spend a little more and you do want to get more than a few years out of your phone, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G is a great pick&lt;/a&gt;. It has a big, lovely screen, 5G, and comes with a generous support policy. Stylus enthusiasts on a budget have a good option in the Moto G Stylus 5G, but most others could do better elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facial recognition software used to verify unemployment recipients reportedly doesn’t work well</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4bwyt4x6JP1uBqJPnxa9BZG2rmM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69476410/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kkg1l6"&gt;The facial recognition program used by some two dozen US states to to verify people seeking unemployment benefits is working inconsistently, leading to many people being denied benefits or having their applications put on hold, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5dbywn/facial-recognition-failures-are-locking-people-out-of-unemployment-systems"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbeLCb"&gt;The identity verification service ID.me is intended to help reduce unemployment fraud, and uses biometric data and official documents to verify people. But according to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;, some who have applied for unemployment have reported that ID.me has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=(to%3Aidme)&amp;amp;src=typed_query&amp;amp;f=live"&gt;failed to identify them&lt;/a&gt; correctly, and that they have had difficulty reaching someone at ID.me to remedy the problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ipu6K7"&gt;In a lengthy email response to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, ID.me CEO Blake Hall said the company uses “1:1 Face Matching to match the selfie image to the photo on the government ID. This is similar to how Apple uses FaceID to unlock phones and analogous to how a TSA agent would compare your face to your photo ID at an airport.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gog1gg"&gt;He added that the algorithms the company uses for Face Match “operate at ~99.9% efficacy.” Hall also said the company was not aware of “eligible individuals” who couldn’t verity their identity with its software, and that wait times for a video chat with a company representative “has been consistently under 30 minutes all week.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltIF1s"&gt;With millions of people unemployed due to the coronavirus pandemic, state offices have dealt with a surge of claims over the past year. Some states reported a &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/economy/washington-halts-unemployment-payments-for-two-days-after-finding-1-6-million-in-fraudulent-claims-amid-coronavirus-pandemic/"&gt;sharp rise in fraudulent claims&lt;/a&gt; last spring, and the Department of Labor &lt;a href="https://www.oig.dol.gov/public/reports/oa/viewpdf.php?r=19-21-002-03-315&amp;amp;y=2021"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; (.pdf) in February that between March and October of last year it had identified more than $5 billion of potentially fraudulent unemployment payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBLrOL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 20th 9:24AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added comment from ID.me CEO&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook to update its community standards to clarify what it considers satire</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KLqqKk1CBPUcd05hbDLZZOWJoAo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69475706/acastro_180319_1777_facebook_data_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SQvU4x"&gt;Following a recommendation from its Oversight Board, Facebook says it will update its community standards to be clearer about how it handles satirical content, the company said in &lt;a href="https://transparency.fb.com/oversight/oversight-board-cases/comment-related-to-armenian-people-and-the-armenian-genocide/"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nOfpPR"&gt;“We’ll add information to the Community Standards that makes it clear where we consider satire as part of our assessment of context-specific decisions,” according to the post.  “This change will allow teams to consider satire when assessing potential Hate Speech violations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjsmOa"&gt;The update comes after the &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.com/news/288225579415246-announcing-the-board-s-next-cases-and-changes-to-our-bylaws/"&gt;Oversight Board determined&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook was wrong to remove a user’s comment with a reference to the Turkish government, based on the &lt;a href="https://memerino.me/two-buttons"&gt;two buttons meme&lt;/a&gt;. The Oversight Board described it: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aUqNoi"&gt;This meme featured the same split-screen cartoon from the original meme, but with the cartoon character’s face substituted for a Turkish flag. The cartoon character has their right hand on their head and appears to be sweating. Above the cartoon character, in the other half of the split-screen, there are two red buttons with corresponding labels, in English: “The Armenian Genocide is a lie” and “The Armenians were terrorists who deserved it.” The meme was preceded and followed by “thinking face” emoji.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="pjk1Bh"&gt;Facebook removed the post, citing its &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/cruel_insensitive"&gt;Cruel and Insensitive Community Standard&lt;/a&gt;, which says it will remove posts that target “victims of serious physical or emotional harm,” which includes the use of memes and gifs. Facebook later reclassified the removal so it fell under its &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/communitystandards/hate_speech"&gt;Hate Speech Community Standard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1Qn0d"&gt;The Oversight Board pointed out in its recommendation that while Facebook has said it will make exceptions for satire, it doesn’t specify how or what qualifies as satire in its guidelines. Facebook said in its post that in addition to making its guidelines around satire clearer, it would “initiate a review of identical content with parallel context,” and may take further action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ao3guy"&gt;This marks the latest instance of Facebook following the guidance of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21530524/facebooks-new-oversight-board-platform-governance"&gt;its fledgling Oversight Board&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier this month, Facebook said would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22474738/facebook-ending-political-figure-exemption-moderation-policy"&gt;end its so-called “newsworthiness” policy&lt;/a&gt;, which allowed politicians to skirt many of its content rules. Going forward the company “will not treat content posted by politicians any differently from content posted by anyone else,” Facebook’s Nick Clegg said in a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/06/facebook-response-to-oversight-board-recommendations-trump/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The slow transitions of a lingering pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NYC has mark the end of the COVID-19 restrictions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8veOUHyTHXNn4fNMqX0li5ZnWgk=/0x0:5341x3561/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69475596/1323971899.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Pedestrians walk through NYC on June 16, the day before COVID-19 restrictions lifted in the state.  | Photo by Kena Betancur/VIEWpress&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AYB7Un"&gt;With COVID-19 restrictions &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/michael-brown-europe-australia-coronavirus-pandemic-coronavirus-vaccine-78a0c659eccb7680ba6773bbdb8f01e8?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;amp;utm_source=Twitter"&gt;lifting in some places&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jun/16/covid-outbreaks-in-chinese-ports-could-cause-global-goods-shortages"&gt;outbreaks popping up in others&lt;/a&gt;, the pandemic has officially entered the weird zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSzanL"&gt;Okay, there’s nothing official about it, but the entire world is in a strange transition time right now — and likely will be for a while. Unlike the jump-cut into the pandemic, or even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22364637/pandemic-edge-fear-hope-vaccines-surge-antivirus-newsletter"&gt;suspenseful vaccine ramp-up&lt;/a&gt;, this time is more hopeful, less frantic, but also stretched out in an uneven mess. Places, populations, and even industries are moving at different paces as they move back to some semblance of normality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="1CtwS7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KmCpwC"&gt;It’s like the entire globe is playing by a perverse version of &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and..."&gt;“yes, and.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Yes&lt;/em&gt;, more people are vaccinated in the US than before, &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;immunocompromised people are &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/06/immunocompromised-covid-vaccine-unprotected-autoimmune-condition.html"&gt;still at risk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Yes,&lt;/em&gt; the vaccines that we have are stunningly effective, &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;they are in such short supply that many countries are &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/nepal-coronavirus-pandemic-health-1493a03ed4adb7be582d892b98efef76?utm_campaign=SocialFlow&amp;amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=AP"&gt;absolutely desperate to get them&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wIbH2b"&gt;Here in the US, one of the most visible transitions is the vanishing act of various COVID-19 regulations. New York lifted &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/15/nyregion/coronavirus-restrictions.html"&gt;most restrictions this week&lt;/a&gt;, and Disneyland reopened to everyone, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/how-to/disneyland-is-now-open-for-everyone-how-to-get-tickets-and-park-reservations/"&gt;without mask requirements&lt;/a&gt;. People in those areas are enjoying a return to offices, and restaurants and blessed normalcy — especially in regions where case rates are low. At the same time, parts of the country where vaccination rates have stayed low face the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/07/world/us-south-covid-vaccine.html"&gt;potential of summer surges&lt;/a&gt;. Tensions between different regions will linger as long as disparities remain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99ryXh"&gt;In the pharmaceutical and research realm, there’s a different shift. The flurry of clinical trials and lab work that accompanied vaccine development is now slowing. There are still thousands of questions, but the biggest and most urgent — can we make a vaccine? — has been answered. Now, research focuses have shifted and split. Some are still working on vaccines and boosters, others are investigating new &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/17/health/covid-pill-antiviral.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;COVID-19 drugs&lt;/a&gt; or seeking to understand the virus’s origins and mechanics, and others have gone back to different projects entirely. With vaccines, the biggest issues are now monitoring and distribution, not research and development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EBMthj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;most people are stuck somewhere in the wide gap between caution and abandon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BCbZZD"&gt;How people feel about all of these changes is another factor entirely — personal shifts in priorities, fears, and emotions are going to play a huge role in this next phase of the pandemic. As vaccinations go up and case numbers go down, eventually, we’ll get used to the coronavirus, and it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22445906/social-end-pandemic-covid-adjustment-death-vibes"&gt;cease to be an unknown threat&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll stop thinking about it every day — some people already have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcoZHo"&gt;In the meantime, most people are stuck somewhere in the wide gap between caution and abandon. Each person will eventually move past their own personal marker for the pandemic era. It might come when they get that second shot or step into a theatre for the first time or leave a mask sitting on the table at home. As with all transitions, something will end, and something else will take its place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7HSXL"&gt;As a quick note before we get into what happened with COVID-19 this week, I also wanted to note that you might see some new (small) changes to this newsletter. Eventually, we’ll shift the newsletter over to a weekday instead of a Saturday. And starting next week, I’ll be handing over the reins to Nicole Wetsman, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s health reporter. She’s been filling in periodically, but I’m thrilled to have her writing to you more regularly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrP5mX"&gt;Some things won’t change, at least not yet. We’ll keep covering the pandemic and keep you up to date with what’s going on in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="myGY4G"&gt;Thank you so much for joining us each week. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="hEoMyi"&gt;In the US, there’s more proof that vaccines are overwhelmingly effective. Doctors and health systems are increasingly reporting that the COVID-19 patients showing up for treatment are not vaccinated. (Elizabeth Weise and Aleszu Bajak/&lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="4uV0lG"&gt;A study published this week found that one reason for the horrifying disparities in COVID-19 deaths in the US might come down to a paucity of healthcare resources in hospitals that serve Black patients. (Stephanie M Lee/&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="TrFqao"&gt;A different mRNA vaccine just tanked a clinical trial, only showing 47 percent efficacy against the virus. It’s a setback for the vaccine, which some hoped would help bolster the global supply. (Ludwig Burger/ &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="9aFAk2"&gt;$3 billion has now been set aside to help researchers dig into a treatment for COVID-19. Instead of a vaccine, which prevents the virus from taking hold, a treatment would combat the disease when a person actually has it. (Carl Zimmer/&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="hQZsiF"&gt;Accredited social health activists are the foot soldiers of India’s rural healthcare system.

    <title>The best pre-Prime Day deals for Father’s Day weekend</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jyVmZW"&gt;Next week is when Prime Day 2021 begins. We’ll be here early on Monday and continue scouring deals through Tuesday night, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535681/amazon-prime-day-tech-news-deals-date-time-2021"&gt;bringing you the best deals on the tech&lt;/a&gt; we know you’ll like. However, before that, on Sunday, is Father’s Day. If you’ve already gotten a gift for the dad in your life, hopefully you‘ll be able to celebrate together in some manner. But, if you haven’t yet, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22410178/fathers-day-best-gift-ideas-tech-gadgets-tools"&gt;it’s never too late to get one through our thoughtfully-curated gift guide&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="KV0Wut"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="05aw2d"&gt;Get $150 off Apple’s Magic Keyboard for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="h4HtK0"&gt;Best Buy is offering a rare discount on the Magic Keyboard for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro (that fits even the latest M1-equipped version). Normally $349, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736544054881862306#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $199 for all of Saturday&lt;/a&gt;. Usually, it’s just the 11-inch model that sees a big discount. This keyboard has USB-C passthrough charging, it’s sturdy, and it has an excellent trackpad and keyboard. Keep in mind, though, that it’s going to add a good amount of weight and thickness while attached to your iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="p3yolB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295314"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Z9q0SC"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/acxOn1fPEghXkzEBxtcUdbY8R4U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22667782/Philips_Hue_Bundle_Father_s_Day.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Philips&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PmV4VD"&gt;Whether for Father’s Day or for yourself, Philips Hue is offering solid deals on two smart light bundles. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/p/hue-white-and-color-ambiance-3-pack-e26/046677562786" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The first is a three-pack of standard E26 white and color ambiance bulbs for $100&lt;/a&gt; (usually $135). If you want to turn the color in your bathroom to blue and your living room to green, these are the bulbs for you. They’re Bluetooth-enabled, too, so you don’t need a Hue bridge accessory to use them, which is appealing. Though, if you want more instantaneous and seamless functionality, you may want to eventually get that Hue Bridge at some point — and these bulbs will work just fine with it once you do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nkTs5g"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10613537" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3wHAfk"&gt;The other Philips Hue deal is slightly more niche, but still good. If you buy Philips Hue’s Ligthstrip Plus V4 80-inch model for $80 (located at the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.philips-hue.com/en-us/products/promotions/fathersday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bottom of this page&lt;/a&gt;), the company will toss in a 40-inch extension at no extra cost. These two items would normally cost $105.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8GMm0i"&gt;
&lt;p id="aY1ro2"&gt;In case you haven’t already seen it in our deals coverage, Best Buy is offering the best prices on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;previous-gen iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; through Sunday, June 20th. If you have a free My Best Buy account, you can get $150 off most 11-inch and 12.9-inch configurations, whether you want a Wi-Fi or LTE-connected iPad. The base 11-inch model with 128GB of storage costs $600 — the same price as the iPad Air with half that amount of storage. The 256GB 11-inch model is just $100 more at $700. If you want a 12.9-inch iPad Pro, the 128GB base model costs $850.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6ibQ2o"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="rST98l"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="eRvGTP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
