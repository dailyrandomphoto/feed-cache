    <title>Google’s rumored Pixel 6 Tensor processor sounds extremely weird</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1422228336533676035/photo/1" target="_blank"&gt;Sundar Pichai / Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oedMe5"&gt;Google is set to debut its first in-house smartphone chipset, the Tensor SoC, in its upcoming Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro phones. And if the &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/exclusive-google-tensor-specs-in-pixel-6/"&gt;latest report from &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt; is correct&lt;/a&gt;, the Tensor’s rumored CPU setup could be very, very weird — even by Google standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmFoij"&gt;So far, Google has largely been hyping up the Tensor SoC’s AI performance; but it hasn’t revealed any information on the basic CPU and GPU specs of the chip. Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Rick Osterloh would only tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “the standard stuff people look at will be very competitive and the AI stuff will be totally differentiated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PfKq0t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google’s Tensor chip is only the first step toward truly great Pixel phones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609924/pixel-6-google-tensor-soc-chip-cpu-gpu-samsung-apple"},{"title":"This is the Pixel 6","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3gaqxi"&gt;Some aspects of the Tensor’s components have already come to light. An &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-6-same-gpu-exynos-galaxy-s21/"&gt;earlier &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; notes that the Pixel 6 will likely use an off-the-shelf Arm Mali-A78 GPU design (which Samsung uses on its flagship Exynos 2100), while &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/google-brings-samsung-5g-modem-tech-us-market-with-new-pixel-phone-sources-2021-08-25/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Google will be sourcing its 5G modem from Samsung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rowUF8"&gt;But the CPU still remained a mystery, until today, when &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt; published a report based on both a Geekbench score and a source who claims to have an actual Pixel 6 Pro. The report claims that the CPU setup on the Tensor will consist of two Cortex-X1 performance cores clocked at 2.802GHz, two Cortex-A76 performance cores clocked at 2.253GHz, and four Cortex-A55 efficiency cores. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google’s new Pixel 6 phones, regular and Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ckQnWc66L7bV9d2osK3PMYdxPE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755089/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xjMCZV"&gt;If you’ve been keeping up with major flagship smartphone chips, that’s a very weird list to see, one that mixes together powerful new cores with weaker old ones. Let’s take a step back to explain why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwMKCb"&gt;When we’re looking at most smartphone SoCs, there are generally two main parts: performance CPU cores and efficiency CPU cores. Arm-based designs tend to mix those together in big.LITTLE configurations, to allow for devices that can ramp up performance by using the more powerful “big” cores for intensive things like gaming, while running less demanding tasks (like checking your email) on the “little” efficiency cores to prolong battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="XZf1wB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"ARM’s Cortex-A78 CPU and Mali-G78 GPU will power 2021’s best Android phones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/26/21267893/arm-cortex-a78-mali-g78-cpu-gpu-designs-smartphones-2021-samsung-qualcomm-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="reOgai"&gt;A typical Arm-based design might include four performance cores (like the Cortex-A78) and four efficiency cores (like the Cortex-A55). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/26/21267893/arm-cortex-a78-mali-g78-cpu-gpu-designs-smartphones-2021-samsung-qualcomm-apple"&gt;But last year&lt;/a&gt;, Arm added a new, even more powerful performance option for chip makers to use: the Cortex-X1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Q8hnG"&gt;So, the top smartphones of 2021 tend to offer a triple-cluster design: the Snapdragon 888 uses partially customized versions of a single &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/26/21267893/arm-cortex-a78-mali-g78-cpu-gpu-designs-smartphones-2021-samsung-qualcomm-apple"&gt;Cortex-X1, three Cortex-A78, and four Cortex-A55&lt;/a&gt; cores, while Samsung’s Exynos 2100 uses a similar configuration. Tensor, on the other hand, is said to offer two Cortex-X1 cores, two Cortex-A76 cores, and the usual four Cortex-55 cores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhL6CC"&gt;Which makes for a very strange version of a triple cluster design. By including not one, but two Cortex-X1 performance cores, Tensor could theoretically allow it to outclass even the best chips from Qualcomm and Samsung, on paper, if not for the second half of the rumor, which is that Google is also using two older Cortex-A76 cores... which, simply put, doesn’t make any sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nc1Jjl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Tensor’s rumored CPU design is extremely strange&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CoZeGs"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt; points out, the Cortex-A76 was introduced in 2018 and is a full two generations behind the Cortex-A78 design used in 2021’s flagship chips. There’s no immediately logical reason why Google would use the older design, either; the A78 is both faster &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; more efficient than its older counterpart, making it an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; strange choice to include as part of the Tensor CPU cluster, especially if Google is already going all out with two X1 cores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L66oBa"&gt;There is the chance that Google is simply obfuscating its CPU design in the Geekbench score, although the report does note that it would be unlikely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZhPNm"&gt;For now, though, the mystery of the Pixel 6’s Tensor chip has gotten even weirder. And it’ll likely stay that way, too, until Google reveals more information when the phones arrive later this fall. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These climate stars are among the world’s most ‘influential’ people</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Miss Phyllis Omido, a Kenyan environmental activist and..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XZjvPGKy1foyq17lzDYmkUxu9HI=/0x0:3456x2304/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69863882/1229847704.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Miss Phyllis Omido, a Kenyan environmental activist and Goldman Environmental Prize Winner.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LUxRmh"&gt;Climate change was a big theme in &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; Magazine’s &lt;a href="https://time.com/collection/100-most-influential-people-2021/"&gt;2021 list&lt;/a&gt; of “Most Influential People,” with a handful of climate scientists and environmental advocates making the list along with celebrities like Dolly Parton and Naomi Osaka. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2CGU4c"&gt;2021 isn’t the first year rock star environmentalists have made &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;’s list. Teen activist Greta Thunberg was Time’s “Person of the Year” in 2019. Green New Deal champion Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was also among the “most influential” that year. This year’s honorees may not be as widely known, but they’ve had a huge impact on how the world grapples with an existential crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cT99rl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Possibly the greatest challenge humanity has faced”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DZpCV2"&gt;Tackling climate change is “possibly the greatest challenge humanity has faced,” one of the people who made the list, Fatih Birol, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/iea-executive-director-named-on-time-100-list-of-the-world-s-most-influential-people"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; today. Birol heads up the International Energy Agency, which issued a landmark &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/pathway-to-critical-and-formidable-goal-of-net-zero-emissions-by-2050-is-narrow-but-brings-huge-benefits"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; this year that called for a stop to investments in new fossil fuel infrastructure. It marked a dramatic shift for an institution that started in the 1970s to monitor oil markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9U6zUh"&gt;People around the world are already reeling from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654003/floods-wildfires-hurricane-ida-climate-change-disasters-compound-risks"&gt;back-to-back disasters&lt;/a&gt; fueled by climate change: scorching heatwaves, relentless droughts, raging wildfires, and terrifying storms, to name a few. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmOXCG"&gt;Researchers had already predicted that these kinds of things would grow worse, but Friederike Otto and Geert Jan van Oldenborgh set out to find climate change’s fingerprints in each catastrophe. They joined forces with other scientists around the world to launch the World Weather Attribution project, which has truly changed the game when it comes to our understanding of how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt;climate change supercharges extreme weather&lt;/a&gt;. The group found that this summer’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22559961/heat-roads-washington-oregon-climate-infrastructure"&gt;road-buckling heatwave&lt;/a&gt; in the US Pacific Northwest and southwest Canada would have been “&lt;a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/"&gt;virtually impossible&lt;/a&gt;” without climate change. Thanks in large part to the group’s work, leading climate scientists can say definitively that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;human activity is the main driver&lt;/a&gt; behind increasingly apocalyptic weather. Otto and van Oldenborgh are on the list.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RaX8oz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gjvoldenborgh?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@gjvoldenborgh&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; myself are on the 2021 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TIME100?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TIME100&lt;/a&gt; list: &lt;a href="https://t.co/z9FOeKrtqV"&gt;https://t.co/z9FOeKrtqV&lt;/a&gt;. Wow. Not sure I can quite believe that but it's fantastic to see that science &amp;amp; in particular climate science is seen to be influential. Always hoped &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wxrisk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@wxrisk&lt;/a&gt; actually makes a difference.&lt;/p&gt;— Dr Friederike Otto (@FrediOtto) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FrediOtto/status/1438126354277576705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AtOdt1"&gt;Time also highlighted a few leaders working on big solutions. Frans Timmermans, executive vice president of the European Commission, was on the list because of his work to get Europe on track to slash heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions by more than half this decade. That &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577162/european-union-climate-change-greenhouse-gas-emissions"&gt;roadmap&lt;/a&gt; includes a plan to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576994/european-union-gas-vehicle-ice-ban-2035-electric-cars"&gt;phase out&lt;/a&gt; gas-powered vehicles by 2035. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UeW7rL"&gt;Then there’s attorney Roger Cox, one of the architects behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455387/big-oil-gas-shell-exxon-chevron-climate-change"&gt;Big Oil and Gas’ no good, very bad day&lt;/a&gt; in May. Cox won a suit against Royal Dutch Shell to cut its pollution nearly in half by 2030 to keep in line with global goals made in the Paris climate agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xDt6a3"&gt;As the world charts out potential solutions to the climate crisis, there will need to be watchdogs to ensure that a new energy economy doesn’t repeat the sins of the old one — particularly when it comes to exposing vulnerable communities to toxins and pollution. Phyllis Omido was named one of Time’s “Most Influential People” after she successfully &lt;a href="https://qz.com/africa/1231792/a-battery-recycling-plant-owned-by-indian-businessmen-caused-a-lead-poisoning-crisis-in-kenya/"&gt;fought&lt;/a&gt; to shut down the lead-smelting plant she once worked at in Mombasa, Kenya. Such smelters popped up in Kenya to feed demand for lead-acid batteries paired with solar arrays, and poisoned children in the process — including Omido’s son. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRRwA9"&gt;Omido, Cox, Birol, Otto, van Oldenborgh, and Timmermans are just a few of the countless voices around the world holding polluters accountable. So there’s a good chance we’ll see more of their names next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52zdve"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Become a true impostor with an official Among Us costume</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z-7X7qIIfnOFrnn1vuQM0kiJo9A=/0x8:2429x1627/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69863776/among_us_costumes.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The official &lt;/em&gt;Among Us&lt;em&gt; costumes.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Among-Us-Official-Inflatable-Crewmate/dp/B09151X1VG?ref_=ast_sto_dp" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="alx3m0"&gt;Halloween is just around the corner, and if you still need a costume (smh if you haven’t gotten one yet, Halloween is 46 days away, what are you doing?) might I recommend the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1438221581117964288"&gt;new official &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; crewmate costumes&lt;/a&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3AGAuo"&gt;If you get one of these ridiculous inflatable outfits, you’ll surely fool everyone around you into believing you’re not suspicious in any way whatsoever. Definitely not an impostor, nope. Just see for yourself:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6MDOm3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;roll up into the finest establishments with our new Among Us costumes  ✨ &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/toikido1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@toikido1&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;u can grab these on Amazon, Walmart, HMV, and other retailers globally! BE!! THE SPACEBEAN!!! &lt;a href="https://t.co/9LVvKBzvwM"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9LVvKBzvwM&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Among Us (@AmongUsGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1438221581117964288?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UJl91U"&gt;The costumes come in two sizes, an adult version and a kids version, and are available in four colors for each size. The adult size tops out at five feet, nine inches, so if you’re on the taller side, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1438223053935325184"&gt;your ankles might stick out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z4OElz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;5'9"! i mean you could still wear it, ur ankles would just stick out which makes it kinda cursed but also funny&lt;/p&gt;— Among Us (@AmongUsGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AmongUsGame/status/1438223053935325184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zt1Q2W"&gt;There are holes for your arms, though they don’t look like they let you reach very far in front of you. To stay truly camouflaged, you might want to wear a matching sweater.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dN9qgoOCWaruo9m0QJIrJAn8j4o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22853474/58a45ea0_71ec_458e_b4d8_8bcd932c.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the left is what your arms will look like in one of the costumes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o2ZM4Q"&gt;In addition, the adult version looks to have a visor with a mirror effect to help hide your identity, while the kids version seems to have a mesh one so you can see who’s wearing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x6ZoFL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10755193"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pMZTqA"&gt;On Amazon, the adult costumes cost $49.99, but I couldn’t find the price for the kids ones. Disappointingly, it appears that &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/054B5A97-69B7-4A59-8663-22E2DFAA7A50"&gt;Amazon’s listings for the costumes&lt;/a&gt; are already sold out. But the &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; tweet says they’ll be available at Walmart, HMV, and other retailers around the world, so you might still be able to snag one before the spookiest day of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sd7wgS"&gt;A day that you definitely would not consider sneaking up behind your friends and frightening them in an &lt;s&gt;impostor&lt;/s&gt; crewmate costume. Never.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The 2020 iPad Air and new iPad Mini have the same design and shape as the iPad Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OqDG5sf2dQljUBF65yxBXRiy6oE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/vpavic_4244_20201020_0013.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1L3M8j"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPads are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable — now outgoing — entry-level iPad from last year, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of sale happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s often what deal our deal hunters at &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;are doing each and every day, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each iPads model that is currently available, some of which are also available &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fipad" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;refurbished&lt;/a&gt;. You should also be aware that &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus-hed%2Fshop%2Fback-to-school&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple is currently running its back-to-school promotion&lt;/a&gt; until September 27th, meaning you can snag a free set of AirPods with the purchase of either an iPad Air or iPad Pro. If you prefer the AirPods Pro, you can also upgrade for an additional $90. Either way, you have to be a student who’s eligible to check out through Apple’s educational storefront. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jzeS15"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10754964"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="DMtl0v"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;The best iPad (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;2020 iPad&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s most affordable tablet, however, it’s now being replaced by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22672438/ipad-2021-new-price-specs-release-date-apple-a13-chip"&gt;9th Gen model announced&lt;/a&gt; during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674369/apple-iphone-13-event-2021-announcements-missing-m1x-macbook-pros-airpods-3-macos-monterey"&gt;Apple’s recent iPhone 13 event&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re in the market for the new model, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665133/apple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date"&gt;preorders are available now&lt;/a&gt;, with shipments slated for Friday, September 24th. As you might expect, there are no discounts currently available on the 2021 model, given the tablet has yet to hit store shelves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMZ13y"&gt;If you want to try getting the best possible price on last year’s model, though, know that the 32GB model initially retailed for $329 and the 128GB variant for $429. The new, 64GB model goes for the same price as last year’s 32GB variant ($329), while the 256GB configuration jumps to $479. The 2020 model has the same 10.2-inch display and features the older A12 Bionic processor, a front-facing Touch ID fingerprint sensor on the physical home button, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9iBwQg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10431710"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;Currently, the outgoing base model iPad is a bit hard to come by at many retailers. It is either out of stock or marked as discontinued at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5J9699?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-10-2-inch-wi-fi-only-8th-generation%2F-%2FA-81498539%3Fpreselect%3D80596591%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1751882593844829755#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594504-REG%2Fapple_myl92ll_a_10_2_ipad_wi_fi_32gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt;. Right now, Apple only offers a refurbished one with &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FFW782LL%2FA%2FRefurbished-IPAD-WI-FI-128GB-Silver%3Ffnode%3Df7a6c58dde7329b21579b02c65a17e1f89102b3746bf56fb4fc1e60dbff56530c0f1da3d19e86a9a6f6e6858f96394b5d01117d34b59a73cdea074885f80ed0867aa9a4cdbdcf73ca96c7f42bd02edf1&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB of storage and Wi-Fi for $279&lt;/a&gt;, though the new ninth-generation model might be a more compelling proposition if you prefer the benefits of the faster A13 Bionic processor and 12-megapixel ultra-wide camera with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395325/ipad-pro-pan-zoom-video-conferencing-microsoft-teams" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Center Stage&lt;/a&gt;, a feature designed for keeping you framed up and centered while on video calls. That said, we’ll keep an eye out for any sale opportunities before the 2020 iPads are completely gone,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;The best iPad Mini (2019) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;latest iPad Mini&lt;/a&gt; in early 2019 with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. Just like the base iPad, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667216/ipad-mini-6-price-specs-release-date-features-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new iPad Mini was announced&lt;/a&gt; during Apple’s “California Streaming” event. While the upcoming, revamped Mini looks promising with its larger screen, top-of-the-line processor, support for USB-C, and 5G option, it also starts at a higher price point of $599. The current iPad Mini has the A12 Bionic processor and normally runs $399 for 64GB of storage and $549 for 256GB. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $529 for the 64GB model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rG7i7T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QD0sMe"&gt;Sales on the basic Wi-Fi model of the 2019 iPad Mini don’t always come around, though we have seen some recently. The 64GB, Wi-Fi-enabled iPad Mini is &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB%2F207104625%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available right now for $299 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; in space gray and gold. Amazon does not currently have any 64GB models in stock, but is offering the 256GB unit &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PSK4LGQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in silver for $449&lt;/a&gt; while &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-256GB%2F211304805%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart offers all three colors of the expanded storage option for the same price&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="skoMEh"&gt;Just like the base iPad, the replacement model looks enticing — and if you’re interested &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665133/apple-ipad-mini-2021-preorder-buy-how-to-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can preorder it now&lt;/a&gt; — though there will certainly be a bigger price delta with the increased starting price of the new iPad Mini and the fact that its predecessor is sure to continue receiving discounts. Also, as of right now, the 2021 model is not available at a discount, which is expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;The best iPad Air (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. Apple has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, too, which is located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;The fourth-generation iPad Air comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than the prior gen. The units equipped with LTE start at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FkUXn4"&gt;Fortunately, if you’ve been waiting for a discount on the iPad Air, the 64GB model with Wi-Fi is available for $539 — $60 off the list price — in all of its vibrant colors at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-64GB-Silver%2F694429303&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. The 256GB, Wi-Fi-enabled version is available for a $100 discount from the same retailers, with your choice of most colors marked down to $650 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J6LJMT4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F325933358&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. The one outlier is the green model, which has a more modestly discounted price of &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-9-inch-iPad-Air-Wi-Fi-256GB-Green%2F705887437%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=vergeipadsbestdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$720&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tNTIrn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple is releasing iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 on September 20th","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2020) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9tR4OQ"&gt;The fifth-generation, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-equipped iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; came out earlier this year, which means there are many deals to be had on the prior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro from 2020&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth-generation iPad Pro looks nearly the same as the 2018 model, when this design was first established, aside from a dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lvMKy"&gt;If you’re looking for the 11-inch, 2020 iPad Pro, it’s currently available on clearance in some configurations at Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H, and Target. As far as the Wi-Fi models go, the 128GB base storage is &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1148110/2092?subId1=VergeiPadDeals080321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-ipad-pro-11-inch-wi-fi-128gb-silver%2F-%2FA-77616876" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted to $700 at Target&lt;/a&gt; — though you may have to pick it up at a brick-and-mortar location near you. The 256GB model is available for $769 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553812-REG%2Fapple_mxdc2ll_a_11_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and $800 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747067025091069041#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; in space gray. Best Buy is also selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065575324374726#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065628094129232#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; variants for $950 and $1,150, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQi2tt"&gt;Similar discounts extend to the 12.9-inch model at Best Buy and B&amp;amp;H Photo. If you prefer Wi-Fi only, the 128GB model is discounted to $849 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553840-REG%2Fapple_my2h2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. The 256GB model is $929 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1553828-REG%2Fapple_mxat2ll_a_12_9_ipad_pro_early.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and $1,000 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748082168808445595#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Lastly, the 512GB model is $1,150 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065793668725731#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; while the massive &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065843218873803#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; is $1,350&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zobp6q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0LPHck"&gt;The best iPad Pro (2021) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M0IoQA"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro is great, but if display quality is the most important factor to your purchasing decision, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch 2021 iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go. The larger, fifth-generation model makes use of a Mini LED display, which is engineered to produce deeper blacks and better contrast, much like OLED technology. Additionally, both the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros tout Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip — the same processor found in the latest Mac computers — as well as new features like Center Stage. They’re the most impressive and expensive iPads to date, with the 11- and 12.9-inch configurations typically starting at $799 and $1,099, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kIHPXF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Mini LED display reportedly coming to 11-inch iPad Pro next year","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569690/mini-led-11-inch-ipad-pro-macbook-air-2022"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="I5hP3e"&gt;If the latest model is what you desire, the 11-inch, 128GB iPad Pro with Wi-Fi is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-11-inch-Wi-Fi-Cellular-128GB/dp/B09328WZPR/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-11-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-128GB-Space-Gray%2F354993710" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $50 off, bringing the price down to $749. Walmart is also discounting the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-11-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-512GB-Space-Gray%2F221905739%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-11-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-2TB-Space-Gray%2F434629461" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2TB models&lt;/a&gt; to $1,000 and $1,799, respectively. That shaves $100 off the cost of either of those massive storage options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vj7Nj6"&gt;The desirable Mini LED-equipped 12.9-inch, 128GB model with Wi-Fi is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932D45W8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-12-9-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-128GB-Space-Gray%2F774697337" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; for $999, the second-best price we’ve seen on Apple’s high-end tablet to date. You can also snag the &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-12-9-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F385211636%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $1,099&lt;/a&gt; at Walmart, a $100 discount.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OpenSea product chief accused of flipping NFTs using insider information</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WphlKb"&gt;OpenSea, the biggest NFT trading marketplace, &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/blog/announcements/employee-information-use-at-opensea/"&gt;said today&lt;/a&gt; that one of its employees used internal information to buy NFTs that were about to be featured on its homepage — and likely spike in value. Accusations were made against OpenSea’s head of product, Nate Chastain, last night after a community member publicized suspicious transactions from his wallet. “Yesterday we learned that one of our employees purchased items that they knew were set to display on our front page before they appeared there publicly,” the announcement &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dfinzer/status/1438122446847201283?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; by OpenSea CEO Devin Finzer read. “​​This is incredibly disappointing.” The site explicitly &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/tos"&gt;prohibits&lt;/a&gt; “deceptive or manipulative trading activities” in its Terms of Service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOpS0E"&gt;The statement was prompted by a community-led investigation of Chastain’s trades. On Twitter yesterday, a user named ZuwuTV &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZuwuTV/status/1437921263394115584"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; a thread claiming Chastain operated “secret wallets” that purchased the site’s front page NFTs before they were “featured,” later selling them for a profit once the price increased due to their exposure. In the thread, ZuwuTV &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZuwuTV/status/1437921701589921801?s=20"&gt;identified&lt;/a&gt; a September 14th transaction where Chastain allegedly sent 5 Ethereum (around $17,000 USD) from his known wallet to an anonymous wallet that then sent the money to a third account. According to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RiceFarmerNFT/status/1437956088998072325?s=20"&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; user, ricefarmer.eth, the account purchased four NFTs by artist Dailydust, one titled “Spectrum Of A Ramenfication Theory,” which OpenSea directly featured soon afterward. The account is then alleged to have “flipped” the NFTs for a profit of roughly 2 Ethereum and funneled the money back to Chastain’s original wallet. OpenSea has not confirmed which NFTs were traded on using internal information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mQrwBX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Because there’s a blockchain … at least we know a hell of a lot more and can talk about it”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OLMYqw"&gt;As the NFT community picked up on ZuwuTV’s investigation last night, he posted more transactions suggesting that the front running behavior could have begun as early as last month. Using tools such as Wayback Machine and Twitter’s advanced search function, ZuwuTV and other users &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZuwuTV/status/1437932608067866629?s=20"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; that Chastain likely purchased would-be-featured NFTs before or immediately after the OpenSea website updated. Like other NFT platforms such as Nifty Gateway, OpenSea’s front page is curated by hand rather than algorithmically determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DVWjId"&gt;Because the Ethereum blockchain is transparent, meaning &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22654785/blockchain-explained-cryptocurrency-what-is-stake-nft"&gt;all transactions are permanently recorded on a public ledger&lt;/a&gt;, users were able to follow the money trail leading back to Chastain’s publicly known account. Every transaction is timestamped, and the NFT or Ethereum traded is known. This transparency has historically allowed users to protect the community by uncovering elaborate scams, such as when “cybersleuth” Fedor Linnik discovered that the team behind a million-dollar “female-led” project was &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/fame-lady-squad-nft-women-men-scandal-scam"&gt;actually&lt;/a&gt; Russian men.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmSQkP"&gt;In a late-night Twitter Spaces titled “Investigating allegations” (with the monocle face emoji at the end), over 1,700 NFT collectors and traders joined to discuss the situation. Many celebrated the capabilities of the blockchain, arguing that the technology enabled a thorough investigation despite the unsettling findings. “Because there’s a blockchain … at least we know a hell of a lot more and can talk about it,” fungiblΞs, an NFT trader, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="LpbIQV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s nice words from OpenSea, but we have heard those words before.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ICOZnU"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lurklovesyou"&gt;LURKLOVESYOU&lt;/a&gt;, one of OpenSea’s featured artists, whose work was allegedly flipped by Chastain, said he wasn’t paid or knowingly involved in the trading. He also surmised that he had been selected mainly because he had helped OpenSea with an art show but never got a heads-up from the site. “From an artist’s point of view, I’m just a guy who’s doing artwork and enjoying the NFT space and community. This has kind of shaken me a little bit,” he said during the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="26j9Xv"&gt;In the wake of the investigation, OpenSea has implemented new policies regarding team members. They “may not buy or sell from collections or creators while we are featuring or promoting them” and are “prohibited from using confidential information to purchase or sell any NFTs, whether available on the OpenSea platform or not.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X1NMS7"&gt;Chastain did not respond to a request for comment. As of writing, Chastain has yet to make a public statement, and OpenSea has not directly named him as the employee involved. Yet, despite the concerns the allegations raise — trusting OpenSea’s centralized curation practices, the merits of Securities and Exchange Commission regulation versus community-led regulation, and insider trading in general — many NFT community members remain optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pv3RML"&gt;“It’s nice words from OpenSea, but we have heard those words before. If they follow through, this could turn into a good thing,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NFTherder"&gt;OK Hotshot&lt;/a&gt;, a friend of ZuwuTV who also does blockchain analysis, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhhAFA"&gt;“We just invented anti-insider trading by putting this on blast. If this were a humongous trading firm, they would have done so much to bury the story,” &lt;a href="http://twitter.com/yuppieventures"&gt;yuppie.eth&lt;/a&gt;, a community member and co-host of the Spaces, added last night. “We’re working for the best interests of the customers of OpenSea right now.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to wipe your iPhone before selling it or trading it in</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WRZDDxjgCrH3NcjNp8c-HipaLj0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69863370/jbareham_171031_2099_A_0227.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bVRqDL"&gt;Whether you’re trading in your old iPhone for a discount on a new one, selling it, giving it away, or recycling it, you’re going to want to erase all of your data first. Not only do you want to keep personal information from falling into the wrong hands, but let’s face it: nobody’s going to want a phone with your old selfies on it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vTTd2a"&gt;After you’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22671906/iphone-date-transfer-ios-icloud-upgrade"&gt;transferred all of your data to a new phone&lt;/a&gt; (or, if you’re not getting a new phone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22673693/iphone-apple-backup-ios-icloud"&gt;backed your data up&lt;/a&gt;), here’s how to wipe your iPhone:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KJzHI1"&gt;Get rid of a few identifiable features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uUBuwb"&gt;Disable “Find My iPhone” by going to “Settings” &amp;gt; “Find My” &amp;gt; “Find My Phone” and toggling “Find My Phone” and “Find My Network” to off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DQ6OXX"&gt;Unpair any devices from your phone, including your Apple Watch. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="SMREGp"&gt;Toggle iMessages off (just in case).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="g1y20x"&gt;Sign out of your Apple ID&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="t9tT4x"&gt;Select “Settings” &amp;gt; [your name] top button &amp;gt; “Sign Out” (at the bottom of the page).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LaxEWl"&gt;Enter your Apple ID password.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xmVLyK"&gt;You’ll be asked if you want to keep a copy of your data on this iPhone. Assuming you’ve backed everything up and are about to wipe your phone, you don’t need to toggle anything on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xZdkhV"&gt;Tap on “Sign Out” in the upper-right corner and then again on the “Are you sure?” pop-up window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1ucZCq"&gt;Get ready to erase it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RHqjWX"&gt;Remove the SIM card from the phone. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="72iH92"&gt;Go into “Settings” &amp;gt; “General” &amp;gt; “Transfer or Reset iPhone” and select “Erase All Content and Settings.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Why your Nintendo Switch might seem borked after the Bluetooth update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TD0cNGqEGu55bCn3-QZItmOVXk4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69863358/jbareham_1492_170228_0126.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XKHYgm"&gt;Did the Nintendo Switch’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674704/nintendo-switch-bluetooth-audio-software-update"&gt;surprise Bluetooth audio update yesterday&lt;/a&gt; make your handheld worse instead of better? That’s what happened to me: instead of inviting me to the magical world of wireless audio, it repeatedly failed to detect my headsets and connect to them reliably. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aldVPo"&gt;Worse, it suddenly took more than 30 seconds to wake my Switch from sleep! That’s a huge pain in the ass, considering one of the Switch’s single greatest strengths is how you can instantly jump back into a game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngFZAj"&gt;But after a whole bunch of testing, I think I know what’s going on — and if you’re seeing the same thing, a full Switch shutdown seems to offer a partial fix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGyTy9"&gt;It’s not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; that simple, though, so read on for the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DVwuoX"&gt;The Nintendo Switch Bluetooth pairing problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Bsa1Fn"&gt;To pair a Bluetooth headset, you’re supposed to go to &lt;strong&gt;System Settings&lt;/strong&gt;, scroll down to &lt;strong&gt;Bluetooth Audio&lt;/strong&gt;, set your Bluetooth device to pairing mode, tap &lt;strong&gt;Pair Device &lt;/strong&gt;on your Switch, then select your device once it appears on the Switch’s screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHKoZR"&gt;If it pairs, you’re set! If it fails because your device wasn’t ready to pair, you &lt;em&gt;might &lt;/em&gt;still be okay. Simply put it in pairing mode again, and tap the &lt;strong&gt;Search Again&lt;/strong&gt; button on your Switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Mrphq6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Two problems: ghost pairing and wake delays&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5NaXwO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem #1. &lt;/strong&gt;But if it fails to pair &lt;em&gt;properly — &lt;/em&gt;if your Switch &lt;em&gt;thinks&lt;/em&gt; it paired, if your headset is blinking like it’s paired, but isn’t routing audio and isn’t showing up on your Switch screen as a paired headset — you might be in for a world of hurt. The Switch’s process does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; fail gracefully, and you may run into all kinds of error messages afterward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKwAOu"&gt;After that point, my Switch sometimes won’t even bother to keep scanning for Bluetooth devices. It’ll pop up an “Unable to find Bluetooth audio devices” message the moment I hit the scan button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ij7AIm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Problem #2. &lt;/strong&gt;And if you’ve run into a ghost pairing issue, you might experience a problem with the Switch waking from sleep as well — because it appears the Switch tries to fire up Bluetooth audio &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; it wakes the screen and controllers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1vFj4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1438206760188219392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1438206760188219392%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;Here’s what the Nintendo Switch looks like&lt;/a&gt; with no Bluetooth audio devices paired or remembered whatsoever. It wakes pretty quickly, right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WAO6BR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here’s how quickly a Nintendo Switch is supposed to wake. No headset. &lt;a href="https://t.co/zrpoMTT6Cd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zrpoMTT6Cd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1438206760188219392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G4lK7h"&gt;But once I pair a headset to the Switch,&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1438207007790551042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1438207007790551042%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt; it’s no longer instant&lt;/a&gt;: the screen takes a little longer to light up, and it doesn’t immediately recognize my button presses that let me unlock the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rutayd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here’s with a paired headset. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Gdqd7UBbIW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Gdqd7UBbIW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1438207007790551042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dwZy7E"&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1437965735389585409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1437965735389585409%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;here’s what it’s like&lt;/a&gt; when the Switch fails to pair properly with a waiting headset: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A1DTJQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So, uh, not only does my Nintendo Switch not get along with Bluetooth headphones as of the new update… it now takes a MINIMUM of 10 seconds to wake from sleep. &lt;a href="https://t.co/13dUvv41ga"&gt;pic.twitter.com/13dUvv41ga&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1437965735389585409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F05NSU"&gt;(Why yes, my eyes &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; look scary when they’re bugging out, thanks for noticing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MYikpz"&gt;How to partially fix Nintendo Switch Bluetooth &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iHsGUQ"&gt;You need to fully shut down the Switch, and I mean fully shut it down. I restarted it loads of times, and it didn’t seem to help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="sMMaDf"&gt;Tap the power button and wait however long it takes for your screen to turn on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IZiPPH"&gt;Unpair and forget any Bluetooth devices&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UbEGfW"&gt;Hold down the power button for four seconds until you see &lt;strong&gt;Power Options&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NmZoQs"&gt;Tap &lt;strong&gt;Power Options &lt;/strong&gt;then hit &lt;strong&gt;Turn Off&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6I7uEX"&gt;Wait a beat, then power on your Switch again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Qlaucw"&gt;Sometimes, simply shutting off my Switch was enough to fix my ghost pairing issue (where I saw a 10–30-second delay when waking the system) and let me start pairing Bluetooth headsets again. I was able to get my Wyze Buds Pro to pair on the very first try, a headset that repeatedly failed to connect at all last night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbV4Tn"&gt;But other times, it still wouldn’t do an initial pair — and as soon as I saw that “Unable to find Bluetooth audio devices” message, my Switch would take ages to wake from sleep once again. Your mileage may vary: in case it matters, I’m using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/12/20802539/nintendo-switch-v2-new-updated-battery-console-how-to-buy"&gt;the v2 of the original Switch, the one that added more battery life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y7mhyU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some Bluetooth devices may simply not work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0kH788"&gt;And if you’re trying to restore the full wake-up speed the Switch is normally known for, you’ll also need to unpair and forget any Bluetooth devices &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; you do the full shutdown. When I simply unpaired a Bluetooth headset but left it in the Bluetooth menu, I still saw the small delay. Same thing if I shut down first then unpaired and forgot the headset second. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Afwo8E"&gt;My guess is the Switch leaves its Bluetooth audio feature turned on whenever it thinks you’re going to use it, but you can force it off by removing those devices and initiating a full shutdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BgpQC2"&gt;We’ve asked Nintendo whether these are known issues and whether we can expect fixes in a future firmware update. We’ll let you know what we hear. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="r2DXjp"&gt;The refreshed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22454960/apple-tv-4k-2021-review"&gt;Apple TV 4K&lt;/a&gt; hit shelves in April, but the anticipated tvOS 15 update that introduces exciting updates to the Apple TV experience was previously only available in beta. That will change next week: Apple has confirmed tvOS 15 will become widely available to everyone on September 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wkRNFp"&gt;Apple confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the tvOS 15 update will go live the same day as its other &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"&gt;operating system updates&lt;/a&gt;, which include iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667046/apple-watchos-8-feature-release-date"&gt;watchOS 8&lt;/a&gt;. The tvOS 15 update brings a number of new features to the Apple TV experience. SharePlay is arguably the most exciting addition to the experience and will allow FaceTime users to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22526742/apple-facetime-shareplay-ios-15-watch-party"&gt;stream titles together&lt;/a&gt; in sync across their Apple devices, including on Apple TV. However, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;confirmed in August&lt;/a&gt; that the feature would be delayed on iOS 15 and tvOS 15 initially and would arrive in a later update, so that feature’s currently still on ice — for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xszn4z"&gt;tvOS will also add two new discovery features to its Apple TV app: For All of You and Shared with You. For All of You will appear as a new row in the Apple TV app and will suggest titles for an entire household to stream together. Shared with You, meanwhile, will show movies and series that have been shared from Messages in their own row within the Apple TV app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rMl7tB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;New discovery features and eventual support for SharePlay will arrive with tvOS 15&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1FPUPb"&gt;Plus, tvOS is also getting a handful of less flashy but nonetheless functionally exciting updates. Beginning with tvOS 15, Apple TV users will see an on-screen prompt to connect their AirPods for easy silent streaming, and the AirPods Pro or AirPods Max will also get support for Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt; when connected to the Apple TV for a theater-like experience. The update will also introduce HomePod Mini pairing as well as a HomeKit update that will allow Apple TV users to see multiple home camera feeds at once. Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment about whether any of these other expected features would be delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXl0z9"&gt;tvOS 15 will be supported on the Apple TV HD, Apple TV 4K (2017), and the latest Apple TV 4K (2021). Look for the software update in the settings menu on your Apple TV device beginning next week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SIM swapper charged in cryptocurrency theft scheme</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T7uN_TSaE_Eh89c6857-srawK-8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69863241/acastro_170621_1777_0006_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2g7zKb"&gt;A University of California San Diego student named Richard Yuan Li was indicted on August 26th for a SIM swapping scheme that involved stealing phone numbers and accounts and extorting at least 40 people for cryptocurrency and other payments, according to &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edla/pr/california-resident-charged-superseding-indictment-role-sim-swap-scam-targeting-least"&gt;a new release the US Department of Justice shared on Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KReoIc"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-edla/press-release/file/1432286/download"&gt;the indictment (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;, Li convinced Apple customer service in 2018 to send him a replacement iPhone 8 for one he claimed was lost in the mail. Li and others then convinced carriers to port victims’ phone numbers to the iPhone 8 to take control of their accounts — and in some cases, drained their crypto wallets directly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6Bu3dS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A phone number could give you access to many different accounts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MkyUy2"&gt;“Li and his co-conspirators contacted victims and demanded that they pay ransoms in order to avoid further harm, including additional account compromises, the loss of additional cryptocurrency, and the release of victims’ confidentiality information the conspirators obtained,” the DOJ writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHJqFP"&gt;If Li is convicted for all counts, including wire fraud, aggravated identity theft, and “conspiracy to engage in interstate communication with intent to extort and to commit computer fraud and abuse,” he could serve 20 years in prison and pay a fine up to $250,000, among other possible charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYxEMd"&gt;SIM swapping is the practice of stealing someone’s identity by assuming their phone number. Typically, numbers from unsuspecting victims are ported over to burner phones — often by asking carriers to do it — and then scammers use those phones to impersonate the victim and seize control of their online accounts. Li’s case is an unfortunate reminder of how common SIM swapping is. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/31/20841448/jack-dorsey-twitter-hacked-account-sim-swapping"&gt;it even happened to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIbOJU"&gt;Phone numbers being the key ingredient for identity theft has a lot to do with the common way two-factor authentication is set up. By default, many online services offer two-factor authentication but use a mobile phone as the second method for identifying someone. With stolen phone numbers, that can just as easily become a foothold to taking over someone’s account.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to install the iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 public betas</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TP3dqaskJRC84C50bnOQSSkyrOs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69525171/cgartenberg_210629_4653_002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WyU16X"&gt;Apple’s iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22666881/apple-ios-ipados-15-features-release-date-update"&gt;are launching officially on September 20th, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but you can test them in the public beta right now if you’re willing to risk encountering possible bugs. Here, we walk you through the steps for installing the software. It’s a similar process for the iPhone and iPad, but we’ve made separate sections for each OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TncjxD"&gt;As expected, Apple announced the release date at its September event, where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;it also showed off the new iPhone 13, iPad Mini with USB-C charging, and more&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFiozr"&gt;Before we get started, here’s the usual word of warning about installing unfinished beta software: these releases may seem stable for general use, but they could contain some bugs. Your experience may differ from others depending on the apps you use. And finally, if you do decide to install, I suggest backing up your device’s data, in case things go badly.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VdqQYd6S1VclYKqBImQmlJQ5trA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643660/743_2021_06_07_743_chromescreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GE7efX"&gt;What are the new features that come with iOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ajIb8j"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22456874/apple-ios-15-features-notifications-facetime-wwdc-2021"&gt;new features coming to iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; include updates to FaceTime, Messages, notifications, privacy controls, and much more. For example, FaceTime will support spatial audio and reflect the speaker’s location on-screen, with a new voice isolation ability that can remove background noise. Other changes for FaceTime include the ability to share music and videos during calls and to invite Android users to a FaceTime call with a shareable link. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MhlCIp"&gt;SharePlay, which will allow people to enjoy streaming entertainment together at the same time, was one of iOS 15’s most anticipated features, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;Apple recently decided that it won’t arrive&lt;/a&gt; in the final version of iOS 15 launching on September 20th. Instead, it’ll arrive later in fall 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RjIx6e"&gt;What devices are supported for iOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="C29a2b"&gt;Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rIzjYR"&gt;iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Mini, iPhone 12 Pro, iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d4rqkT"&gt;iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro, iPhone 11 Pro Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4MYuU8"&gt;iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mWbtK7"&gt;iPhone X, iPhone XR&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9gPzYC"&gt;iPhone 8, iPhone 8 Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xXbea7"&gt;iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CrMC2z"&gt;iPhone 6S, iPhone 6S Plus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WTQtvI"&gt;iPhone SE (first and second generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Jl56Ou"&gt;iPod Touch (seventh generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A0LR1r"&gt;How to install the iOS 15 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uwP76L"&gt;Head to &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta software portal&lt;/a&gt; from your phone’s Safari browser and agree to sign in with your Apple ID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TSasnT"&gt;Select “Enroll Your Devices” within the drop-down menu at the top right of the webpage, if it automatically doesn’t route you there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pUOjHU"&gt;Select “iOS,” which is the left-most option on the next page. Doing so will reveal a reminder to make sure that you’ve sent a backup of your phone’s content to your macOS computer, in case you need to revert to a previous state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wxm87C"&gt;Scroll down until you find a button that says “Download profile,” then tap on it. This will bring up a warning that says the website is trying to download a configuration profile. Select “Allow.” You will get a pop-up window that says you can set the new profile from the Settings app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d1bnSQ"&gt;Open the Settings app. A new section called “Profile Downloaded” should be added near the top. Select it, and you’ll have access to the beta software download. You may need to restart your phone for the profile to activate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yJf4ys"&gt;Congrats, you did it!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/67NLyjVyqi1TZegsQ794RWjvKic=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22643196/Screen_Shot_2021_06_07_at_1.49.20_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WEwIsU"&gt;What are the new features that come with iPadOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="n1Ft4C"&gt;This year’s version of iPadOS makes the home screen more customizable, and it makes split-screen multitasking easier. The App Library feature introduced last year in iOS 14 has made its way to this new iPad software. Additionally, many of the features that Apple is bringing to iOS 15 are also coming to the tablet lineup, including more spatial audio for FaceTime, portrait mode, and SharePlay, which lets you watch TV or listen to music with others who are on the call. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22463812/apple-ipados-15-features-productivity-release-date"&gt;Chris Welch wrote all about the new features here&lt;/a&gt;, including a section on how iPadOS 15 “punts for another year on ‘pro’ requests,” delivering features that will appeal more generally to people instead of ones for pro-level users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pS9XwF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple says you can build apps on an iPad now, but devs say the reality is trickier","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534902/ipad-pro-apple-swift-playgrounds-4-wwdc-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="kMvcyI"&gt;What devices are supported for iPadOS 15?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2amtEx"&gt;Here’s the list:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="gYFnXh"&gt;iPad Pro 12.9-inch (first through fifth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7awfUC"&gt;iPad Pro 11-inch (first through third generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nSheDn"&gt;iPad Pro 10.5-inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="q39aHn"&gt;iPad Pro 9.7-inch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LooIpb"&gt;iPad (fifth through eighth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0fRC4p"&gt;iPad Mini (fourth and fifth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1gb9MY"&gt;iPad Air (second through fourth generation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OEDSbC"&gt;How to download the iPadOS 15 beta&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="vRB6nl"&gt;Head to &lt;a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram/"&gt;Apple’s beta software portal&lt;/a&gt; from your iPad’s Safari browser.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VyVf4p"&gt;Click “Enroll Your Devices” at the top of the webpage (you may need to scroll horizontally to find it).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JizQFZ"&gt;Click “iPadOS,” which is the option that’s second from the left on the next page. Doing so will reveal a reminder to first make a backup on your macOS computer in case you need to revert your OS to a previous state.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7E9jLb"&gt;Scroll down until you find a button that says “Download profile,” then select it. This may bring up a warning that says the website is trying to download a configuration profile. Select “Allow.” You’ll get a pop-up window that says you can set the new profile from the Settings app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vgHgoU"&gt;Open the Settings app, and a new section called “Profile Downloaded” should be added near the top. Select it, and you should have access to the beta software download. You might need to restart your iPad first.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aMnO1y"&gt;Lastly, if nothing prompts you to get started with the download, open the Settings app, head to General, then find “Software Update” to install the beta software.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="UxAttn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 15th, 2021, 2PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on June 30th, 2021, and has been updated to add new information about iOS 15 and iPadOS 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
