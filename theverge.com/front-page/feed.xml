    <title>The Alpha 1 is Sony’s new flagship camera with monstrous specs and a $6,500 price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8ronwrJU3_OfARnmB-eNHcBDfns=/84x0:1746x1108/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68722506/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_10.57.50_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a0DXXo"&gt;Sony has today announced its &lt;a href="https://pressroom.pixelshift.studio/groundbreaking-sony-alpha-1-camera-marks-a-new-era-in-professional-imaging"&gt;most advanced mirrorless camera yet&lt;/a&gt;: the $6,500 Alpha 1 features a new 50.1-megapixel full-frame sensor, is capable of continuous photo shooting at 30 images per second, and can record 8K video at 30fps. It’ll ship beginning in March.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuoDsz"&gt;The powerhouse camera is priced significantly above the highest-end mirrorless cameras from Canon and Nikon, but Sony promises that customers who buy in will be rewarded with “the most technologically advanced, innovative camera” it’s ever made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dzw78P"&gt;It sounds like a dream for sports and action photographers: even with its large sensor, Sony says the buffer lets you shoot “up to 155 full-frame compressed RAW images or 165 full-frame JPEG images at up to 30 frames per second with the electronic shutter while maintaining full AF and AE tracking performance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMMxK6"&gt;That autofocus and autoexposure system can make up to 120 calculations per second. And you’ll be peering through a high-resolution OLED electronic viewfinder with a refresh rate of 240Hz — something Sony claims is a world first. The Alpha 1 offers five-axis, in-body image stabilization and a standard ISO range of 100–32,000 (expandable to 50–102,400 for stills).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="66smIx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H0om2qHS1o4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qakWkx"&gt;Sony’s autofocus system is still perhaps the best in the game, and the company says the Alpha 1 speeds up Eye AF even further when focusing on humans and pets. And with this camera, Eye AF will also work on birds. If you can justify a $6,500 camera for your nature forays, Sony says that “optimized algorithms ensure that tracking is maintained even if a sitting bird suddenly takes flight, or the framing suddenly changes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dhIUqj"&gt;Flash sync speeds have been pushed up to 1/400 sec. (with mechanical shutter), and the silent electronic shutter supports sync speeds of up to 1/200 sec. Rolling shutter has been reduced due to high-speed sensor readout, and Sony says you can unleash that full 30fps continuous shooting without any blackout. Flicker under LED lighting conditions is also mitigated, as the Alpha 1 can match the shutter speed to flicker frequency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="41Y72G"&gt;As for video, the Alpha 1 can shoot 8K30 and 4K120 — both in 10-bit — and recording 4K at up to 60fps allows for full-sensor readout without any pixel binning. Adding an external recorder to the mix lets you capture 16-bit RAW video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HyBMiY"&gt;The Alpha 1 represents Sony’s very best, and the price clearly reflects that. You’re looking at a price several thousand dollars above the Canon R5. But considering the reputation that Sony has earned with its full-frame mirrorless cameras past and present, there will be a lot of pro photographers itching to get this $6,500 beast in their hands come March.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s creator-focused Xperia Pro arrives in the US priced at $2,499</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BGsiYZS-3P06Gr77R_wAkXnmuIE=/0x0:9504x6336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68721906/Xperia_PRO___DC___HDMI_Monitoring_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xperia Pro can be used as an external monitor for a camera.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PADRfM"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/professional-smartphones/xperia-pro"&gt;Xperia Pro&lt;/a&gt;, Sony’s first smartphone with 5G in the US, is launching today for $2,499.99. Sony is targeting the device at professional users, who it hopes will use its HDMI input to turn the phone into an external camera monitor and its 5G connectivity to quickly upload or live-stream footage. Sony says it currently has no plans to release the Xperia Pro in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZjkgE"&gt;Outside of its HDMI input and US 5G support, the Xperia Pro’s hardware is very similar to last year’s Xperia 1 II (which shipped with 5G support in Europe but was limited to 4G LTE in the US). That means it’s powered by a Snapdragon 865 processor with a 4,000mAh battery, and around the back, there are the same 12-megapixel wide, telephoto, and ultrawide cameras. The Xperia Pro also includes a tall 6.5-inch 21:9 aspect ratio OLED display, which Sony is once again describing as 4K but actually has a sub-4K resolution of &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/professional-smartphones/xperia-pro/specifications#specifications:~:text=4K%20HDR%20OLED%20(3840x1644)"&gt;3840 x 1644&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tph7hhTkcejHf5YX-8fs2ufGytQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260192/01_Xperia_Pro_group_black_withclock_Large.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Although it’s got the form-factor of a smartphone, the Xperia Pro is aimed at professionals.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aEsgyn2odI1RSQUFDlj5JYHy0Bo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260194/Xperia_Pro_40R.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Its HDMI input sits next to its USB-C port.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OwgCb2"&gt;At $1,200, the Xperia 1 II was already an expensive smartphone, and the Xperia Pro is over double its price. But Sony argues its 5G support and HDMI input could be incredibly useful to professional users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3TPgn"&gt;Let’s start with the HDMI input, which is located on the bottom of the phone where the Xperia 1 II’s USB-C port. (The Xperia Pro’s USB-C port is still on the bottom of the device, but it’s shifted to the left.) Sony says it’s capable of taking up to a 4K 60fps HDR video stream and should work with any cameras that have an HDMI output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sONXBY"&gt;In practice, what this means is that you can connect the Xperia Pro to a camera’s HDMI output, for example, and use its bigger screen to get a clearer view of whatever’s being filmed or photographed. You can pinch to zoom into the image displayed on the screen or overlay gridlines to help with framing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Or04Ek"&gt;Where this functionality gets especially interesting is with the Xperia Pro’s 5G connectivity, which enables it to act as a live-streaming link for your camera in addition to being an external monitor. The Xperia Pro can stream footage from its HDMI input to YouTube directly, and it supports StreamLabs and StreamYard for streaming to other platforms like Twitch and Facebook Live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TKYRzS"&gt;The phone supports both Sub-6GHz and mmWave 5G, and Sony claims that it has a unique four-way mmWave antenna array to maximize reception. There’s also a built-in network visualizer app that can be assigned to its shortcut key to help you find the best position to get a signal. Hopefully Sony’s software and hardware are enough to mitigate mmWave’s problems with limited coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7k6EnE"&gt;Ever since it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147066/sony-xperia-phone-1-ii-specs-price-features-5g-triple-camera-headphone-jack-wireless-changing"&gt;started teasing the Xperia Pro&lt;/a&gt; early last year, Sony has emphasized that it’s a device for professional users, and its $2,499.99 price tag makes this more obvious than ever. When I asked Sony why it hasn’t released a 5G device aimed at consumers in the US, it told me it’s waiting for the technology to be more broadly implemented by carriers. Until then, Sony says it’s focusing on professional users who it thinks can get more use out of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAiBCZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Raya and the Last Dragon looks like a fantastical Ocean’s Eleven in the latest trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PKzFawMt4jZGd29z1QZNzbN1Wm8=/517x0:2227x1140/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68721828/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_9.34.41_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uLJWUX"&gt;Disney has released the second trailer for&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1VIZ89FEjYI&amp;amp;amp;feature=youtu.be"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;giving the best look yet at the upcoming animated fantasy film, which is set to hit both theaters and Disney Plus’ Premier Access program on March 5th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6qb0f"&gt;The new trailer sees Raya (voiced by Kelly Marie Tran) putting together a crew of warriors and con artists (including a surprisingly nimble baby) to join her on a quest to find the titular “last dragon,” which legends promise can save her people. But, as the trailer reveals, the mythical dragon, Sisu (voiced by Awkwafina) turns out to be, in her own words “that one kid [in a group project] who doesn’t pitch in as much but still ends up with the same grade.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFleSR"&gt;Plus, the movie looks absolutely stunning, as Disney Animation once again takes the change to show off just how good it’s gotten at creating these CGI wonderlands. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zF_MNooPHaRfXHdSn-hDWIbVj8s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22260384/Screen_Shot_2021_01_26_at_9.34.27_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mD9uqM"&gt;It’s a good thing that &lt;em&gt;Raya &lt;/em&gt;looks like a fun movie, too, since it’s one of the only major new films that will likely be released in the first half of 2021. Another wave of delays saw movies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243496/bond-uncharted-ghostbusters-movie-delays"&gt;&lt;em&gt;No Time To Die&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters: Afterlife&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The King’s Man&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/bob-odenkirk-nobody-edgar-wright-michael-bay-release-date-universal-focus-features-1234889942/"&gt;Edgar Wright’s &lt;em&gt;Last Night In Soho&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/01/cinderella-ghostbusters-afterlife-peter-rabbit-2-uncharted-release-date-changes-1234678097/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cinderella&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and more all shift dates to late 2021 and beyond. Other major films, like Disney’s &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; and Universal’s &lt;em&gt;F9&lt;/em&gt;, are likely to move as well, leaving just streaming experiments like &lt;em&gt;Raya &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;Warner Bros.’ HBO Max approach&lt;/a&gt; as the main source of new films for the next few months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuw6Dz"&gt;It also means that the film — just the second that Disney will be releasing through its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168472/disney-plus-raya-last-dragon-pixar-premier-access-streaming"&gt;Disney Plus Premier Access&lt;/a&gt; program, which will allow for subscribers to pay a premium to watch the film concurrently with its theatrical release — will be an important test for Disney, following a similar strategy for the live-action &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt; release last year. Disney has yet to say how much it’ll cost Disney Plus subscribers to purchase &lt;em&gt;Raya and the Last Dragon&lt;/em&gt;, but when it released &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt; as a Premier Access, it charged $30. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vizio’s midrange 65-inch 4K QLED TV is $600 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vizio" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v9sDbKVKWOzX7us_Z1bSyrLx8P4=/0x0:1217x811/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68721769/vizio_voice.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Vizio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e9CJoC"&gt;Super Bowl Sunday is less than two weeks away! Sure, the game itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242680/super-bowl-lv-4k-hdr-cbs-sports-stream-not-available-2021"&gt;won’t be streaming in 4K resolution&lt;/a&gt;, but that doesn’t mean you can’t spoil yourself with a new UHD television for your bedroom or living room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IrCum5"&gt;Over at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1727833425321972223" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1607492-REG%2Fvizio_m65q7_h1_m_series_quantum_65.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F1%2F26%2F22250173%2Ftv-super-bowl-deal-sale-vizio-qled-headphones#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, you can pick up Vizio’s 65-inch M-series (M65Q7-H1 model) 4K television for only $600. It’s not the lowest price we have seen it go for ($580), yet this is still a great deal given the TV’s specs and size. Vizio’s M65Q7-H1 stands out (especially at this price point) because of its QLED panel, allowing for a more accurate contrast and colors, unlike televisions with standard LED. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ed3hyU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10255489"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RomItk"&gt;Don’t have room for a 65-inch television? Not a problem. Hisense’s 55-inch Class H8 4K TV (model 55H8G) is a good option for its spec and size. You can buy this particular model for $480 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hisense-55-Inch-Quantum-Android-55H8G/dp/B085LR4NPN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730515216541676425" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; $50 off its regular price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="M3Avwo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10303440"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="35YJLi"&gt;Noise-canceling headphones are extremely useful if you enjoy blocking out all outside noise while you listen to music or podcasts, and Sony’s WH-1000XM4 headphones are some of the best on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xKJhAj"&gt;This model is back down to its lowest price yet of $278 at a few retailers, including &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0863FR3S9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730426388561424168" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. But the best deal, in my opinion, is currently at Adorama, which offers the &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/102869/1036?sharedid=verge%20&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fsowh100xm4ba.html%3F"&gt;headphones plus a 20,800mAh power bank for the same $278&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZUBlto"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10303430"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="R3YbRg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Apple launches limited-edition ‘Black Unity Collection’ Apple Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N5TB_L4fUKGaUpDNooXD542-tBY=/0x0:1866x1244/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68721801/apple_watch_Black_Unity_Collection.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zgRt1T"&gt;Apple is launching &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F01%2Fapple-celebrates-black-history-month%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F26%2F22250242%2Fapple-watch-black-unity-collection-limited-edition#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a limited-edition Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; for Black History Month, with a unique watch band, new watchface, and some of the proceeds going toward civil rights organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHKEOw"&gt;The watch, part of a new Black Unity Collection of products, comes with a black, green, and red striped band and face, meant to reflect the Pan-African flag. It otherwise appears to be the standard aluminum version of the Apple Watch Series 6, with pricing starting at $399. The band will also be available separately for $49.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HldCjl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple also plans to highlight Black artists, authors, and developers throughout its apps&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EnxlxE"&gt;The products will go on sale starting February 1st at Apple and Target. The band will remain on sale all year, but the watch as a whole will only be sold in February. It sounds as though the watchface will be available to anyone with an Apple Watch starting later today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBACLi"&gt;Apple says it’ll be “supporting six global organizations” as part of this product launch, including the Black Lives Matter Support Fund, the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, and European Network Against Racism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VvNgYc"&gt;In addition to the new watch edition, Apple announced a number of other initiatives for Black History Month this year. There’ll be a hub in the App Store highlighting Black-owned businesses and developers; Apple Music will get “curated playlists, essays, original videos” and other content highlighting Black artists; and Apple Maps is getting curated recommendations from EatOkra, which highlights Black-owned restaurants. Apple plans to curate stories focused on Black families and experiences in the Apple TV and Apple News apps and highlight Black authors in Apple Books and Apple Podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjpOed"&gt;Apple is among a number of tech giants that collectively &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21362540/racial-justice-tech-companies-donations-apple-amazon-facebook-google-microsoft"&gt;pledged hundreds of millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; toward racial equity initiatives. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21287999/apple-racial-equity-justice-initiative-amount-cook-lisa-jackson"&gt;announced a $100 million fund&lt;/a&gt; in June 2020; earlier this month, Apple said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228580/apple-detroit-developer-academy-equity-center-hbcu-tech-hub"&gt;create a developer education center in Detroit&lt;/a&gt; and support a tech hub for historically Black colleges and universities in Atlanta. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ next big event is a carnival</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CqZt0eMw9DmzEkG-S6zumD_Sg80=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68721710/ACNH__2_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JwZ1zF"&gt;The next in-game event for &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; will bring a little more color to your island. Today, Nintendo revealed its next big update, the highlight of which is Festivale, a carnival-like event that will take place on February 15th. Here’s how Nintendo describes it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XDs1Y2"&gt;Dancer Pavé will arrive to your island’s plaza to usher in some confetti and carnival spirit. On the day of the event you can capture colorful feathers floating on your island with your net and trade them to Pavé to receive a passionate dance number in return. Rainbow feathers seem to be an especially rare sight, so be sure to catch them and trade them with Pavé.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="SXDdAR"&gt;The event will also introduce new clothing options and reactions. It’s all part of &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;’ latest free update, which will be available to download on January 28th. In addition to Festivale, Nintendo also says there will be new items based on other upcoming holidays, including Valentine’s Day and Groundhog Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXeCCO"&gt;Perhaps the most exciting feature, though, was teased at the end: &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; is also getting an update in March, and it looks like it will be &lt;em&gt;Super Mario &lt;/em&gt;themed.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hard lessons of the SolarWinds hack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QgnulylYAyfyEpPhE9FTHlWzQmY=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68721670/VRG_ILLO_4383_Decoder_Joseph_Menn.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Cybersecurity reporter Joseph Menn on the massive breach the US didn’t see coming&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="k3n519"&gt;In December, details came out on one of the most massive breaches of US cybersecurity in recent history. A group of hackers, likely from the Russian government, had gotten into a network management company called SolarWinds and infiltrated its customers’ networks. This access was then used to breach everything from Microsoft to US government agencies, including the US Treasury and departments of Homeland Security, State, Defense, and Commerce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Y2w8w"&gt;On today’s episode of&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/decoder-with-nilay-patel/id1011668648"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Decoder&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; I’m joined by Joseph Menn, a reporter at &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; who focuses on cybersecurity investigations and the author of the new book &lt;em&gt;Cult of the Dead Cow: How the Original Hacking Supergroup Might Just Save the World&lt;/em&gt;. We discuss what this breach means for US security and the companies in SolarWinds’ supply chain that might have been affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3TS8Uy"&gt;The SolarWinds hack hasn’t really gotten the attention it deserves because it happened during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174429/solarwinds-hack-russia-cisa-christopher-krebs-cybersecurity-infrastructure"&gt;the chaos after the presidential election&lt;/a&gt; — but it’s a big deal. And it raises a lot of questions about how to respond to such a massive attack and the responsibility of the private sector when it comes to national security. There aren’t a lot of easy answers here, but it’s clear that change is coming with the Biden administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgR7d8"&gt;Okay, Joseph Menn. Here we go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SPRN0H"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP8280732833" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H7Su99"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Below is a lightly edited excerpt from our conversation. A full transcript will be posted on Jan. 27th. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMzR13"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=8xELQwgE-FFH9TICRxdYWFRvdkDK9pivZ7yZaVAvJ1vNiXShE_P6jhc328Rk8QZwZQ1o7rfbM-10iwPmxvXjkH0qM58&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=1774.17"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="giOcvh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s complicated that the hack happened in an election year. The Trump administration, and specifically President Trump himself, is strangely cozy with Russia. Now, there’s a new administration. It seems like Biden’s going to take a more aggressive posture toward Russia. In the middle of all this, there’s the election security noise, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21562844/us-cybersecurity-election-official-christopher-krebs-fired-president-trump"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trump fires Christopher Krebs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, who is in charge of cybersecurity. How does that all play into this? Is it “We didn’t want to say it was Russia too loudly, and now we’re comfortable saying it a little louder”? Is it “The Trump administration did not have a good cybersecurity infrastructure”? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJszXz"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=LP7XQl81uhWOq3Ix5foDlTKnl28LD2LixsFDm6cT7w4zOvh7ErRULf9rLkk0suc_ewQ_xB5LnXDV6B2muiVVgJbZezM&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=1816.83"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iIR2Vh"&gt;I don’t think that’s something that we know yet. It may have been a bit of insurance on the part of the Russians that, under Trump, the United States government did not aggressively punish — particularly, the executive branch did not aggressively punish — Russia for a lot of really bad behavior that other governments would have done more about. There were sanctions, but it was driven by congressional action. So you don’t have to be a big conspiracy theorist to think the Russians believe, “Well, we’ve gotten away with invading Ukraine. We can do this big hack, and even if we get caught, this is the least likely White House in memory to sound the alarm and rattle a saber at us.” So from here, I certainly doubt that there was any foreknowledge of this in the administration. But from the attacker perspective, the US is distracted and has a president that’s less likely than predecessors to yell and scream and threaten sanctions if we are found out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEd8Bw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=7KnUu9FOLh8YzZCkt4N9WjKfrkjoZXP_8LHAZH1f-GGkWUVzZjXZdOQnOofWlFuKAhYzUCNgDKKLNSrv02qp1f3xApo&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=1906.32"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VT18QJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve got a new president now. Has the posture toward particularly this act, but also Russia cyber operations, shifted at all yet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjrkBL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=A56c8tcYQ0aC3IXEWVl5ewWiPhAf8ecSLtYAsOU8k2SldRcXt9S2Mpa8IgyfeX-kclP1QxuP5ptVYviZLupZYfn_XjI&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=1920.87"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="puZD8h"&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Sighs&lt;/em&gt;] &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLP4IL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=I2pJBB9Kii3mI0GVcy_2upknC_DcQFyZfIWrswVMF99scZbNZ6pAsxqwDNZ5Y5ZeJlEmKzHjc7iEqimEdgIOxL6x3xg&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=1921.79"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJxkXd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That was a very telling sigh.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFjSJs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=giUIVIFI6OslOxE3qluthOJb_jouxlm7nzLF76hBIEx5OQEQMFq-fvJAS7NXvQaHShGdulRLq0G4LO9TTcE8BJdGD1k&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=1925.97"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EGtOMb"&gt;The administration’s been on the job for a few days, and in the heated political atmosphere, there’s a wide spectrum of noise before things are sorted out. During the transition, Biden said that this is something specifically that is going to be responded to in a big way. Some folks said this is an act of war. The people who’ve been at this for a long time and don’t have a particular axe to grind are not saying it’s an act of war. There’s no evidence of destruction. There’s no human life lost. This is classic espionage. It’s just that we got owned really badly. It’s similar, I mean, in my mind, to the hack of the office of personnel management widely attributed to China some years ago where they got classified personnel files on the majority of folks in the US government and outside of the US government with a secret clearance or above. That was really, really bad, but it wasn’t warfare. That’s an espionage win. And we’re trying to do exactly that sort of thing to China and Russia and other governments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22vJ3Y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=SewoTMneziGfECrYR-nfyyjLj2EeWTxkqHfr6n3aC2evEcoDQrxeHn1zMxZzsXk7XcFqwBX28oKo0OTe4SxDhIgnXt0&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=2000.28"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nV30Cd"&gt;But I think it’s clear that there will be some kind of response. There are going to be hearings on this, but like many things cyber, it has a lot of aspects. Like, “Are we sure that country X was behind this? Can we prove that to the world’s satisfaction? And then do we respond economically or diplomatically and other ways?” Hopefully not militarily, though I suppose that’s a possibility. And then, “How do we stop this from happening again?” And that’s really hard and complicated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEzMTn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=zzCOC1VhQ93cqiEVJeDfRsNeZzCZNLAN4YLNEuhJPZlhM6YlCYQTlOUg4ueAUFabyTvkpgi3TN7ozSWgBhFt-dCjYw8&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=2055.21"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0h7SY"&gt;It involves defense versus offense. It involves asking how you secure the supply chain. What do you do about employees in other countries and contractors in other countries? It’s similar to the trade war with China. Our computers and their software go back and forth dozens of times before they wind up on your desk. And it is pretty impossible to secure completely. So what do you do about that? Do you try and undo all these global relationships because you’re sometimes rivals? If you do, you’re going to hurt the economy in a pretty major way. So there are big thorny issues, and it’d be nice if the new administration and Congress take that seriously and come up with a plan. It hasn’t really happened before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ynoCsI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=WjAOkv6RBojKmVxMfSC5U_1lW7xMjnnojwFpfVGHqtGpGsrVVcOsmpPC-xUBOLwHAZPz9x_lA8SyxoOc9DSZDwcW3iI&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=2104.16"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMPC1a"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210667/solarwinds-hack-worse-government-microsoft-cybersecurity"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;breach of this scale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, involving the biggest companies in America and the American government itself, is usually the thing that catalyzes change, that leads to a disclosure law or a reframing of the American posture toward offensive cyberattacks. But because of the transition [from Trump to the Biden administration] and the sort of instant quiet from the attacked parties, it doesn’t feel like this is that moment. Is there a group of people who are going to tackle this in the Biden administration? Does he have an appointee set who has the expertise to raise the profile of this again and build the political capital to actually make the change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sp1GCA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=sb7ApLyeKU1aehbFZRVv9sAE_Vec22rILC6OODikMi9RHYXSF_p76M7kR6-0hLgtC2snv8sEqH49nsSrBtCfbCZxYEQ&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=2146.96"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlBNsB"&gt;Well, that’s really interesting. And this is playing out in real time. Biden has appointed most of the top cyber people. As of this morning, there were one or two key holes. But among other things, for the first time, there’s a deputy national security adviser for cyber, Anne Neuberger. Anne is very well-regarded, was at the NSA for many, many years, and, among other things, was fulfilling part of the NSA’s mission to cooperate with industries on defense. There are a number of people who have really strong military and government experience. As of this weekend, the suspected new cyber czar inside the White House is Jen Easterly, who was one of the people that helped create Cyber Command as a separate unit of the Pentagon, the people responsible for running cyberattacks in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t2Wekf"&gt;So you have really intelligent, really experienced people. Do they have the kind of broad, blue sky, strategic thinking that might help turn around this really gnarly problem? I don’t know. We’ll see. The fact that both houses of Congress are from the same party probably helps, as does the fact that a lot of this isn’t that partisan in a terribly polarized environment. Nobody’s a big fan of getting hacked to pieces by the other countries. So I am more optimistic now than I have been in 20 years of covering this, but that doesn’t mean I’d actually bet on a complete turnaround.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3EMni"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=Rn9IFWyP19lfxrrg18uL7z68rO4YKdUiwDCZCWgz8mrPeF-sTsnLAoWbGg5I-vN73Cj_ab6kkMx3YlXfB2nl_217ceE&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=2255.43"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWFVrE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So you’re starting from a low bar, is what you’re saying.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPbZZy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=2vjeH1IPfz42BBs57dXrwGASAxJV9FjKBJnLy__LD2Csca4UzAGK36XSwRRXaLNp1X8_eZme56L2hUPQKHdn7zSMlV8&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=2257.12"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPZYvW"&gt;Yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jOUiuG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=y9Hb7Vzrhsr5VE60hjCKMv6tXSQxRDLznT5gZnmTZlaAl-QtDdpNShkV3HuXDLUgvOo0b58An87AkZxV1iOEzlK_i7o&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=2259.55"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5qpnYn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned that this looks like an espionage operation. What’s interesting about that is you come from Microsoft’s view of espionage, but kind of the way Americans would see it is, “Well, that’s Microsoft’s problem. We don’t need the government or the Pentagon...” or “That doesn’t merit a military response,” which is kind of what you’re describing. But at the same time, this is a major national security problem. How does that play together?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sm8aJr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=0cSc3RUuszP57_Eb7q5EZL3SPRUX1bPoXOFkE-oRxnspGNLWf2_6mzoCqw4ifLNeiEaef1Okl7BMGoBLbEIYXi6HefU&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=2291.73"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iSZabP"&gt;So that’s a really good question. ... Very, very rarely do you see military response to legit espionage targets being attacked. But there’s the separate issue, which you hit on, which is like, is this a Microsoft problem? In my opinion, it is not fair to expect private companies, no matter how large, to fend off entire nation-states. The job of the US government should be to defend private enterprise from other countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="3X9PX5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9545330"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C8jxOk"&gt;It’s really, really hard when you try to get into the weeds on that because sometimes a nation-state will use the same techniques as a 16- or 17-year-old. So there should be some reasonable standard of defense that is expected of companies. But again, at the really, really high end, if the Russians got into NSA or the Chinese got into the classified personnel files, it doesn’t matter how big a company you are. You’re going to get owned if they really want you to. So that is one of the big strategic issues that I would hope that the White House and Congress address. Where do you draw the line? What kind of help can be provided? And what’s overreach?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ENJmyA"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=lDCHJi3FW6YkbwdYmxThcoNru5-V3z9l-3H5vYwVs-_TbbPzaEDCUful-NMYvLxShTvpcmSbz8d9wuIM-vKeBJ3GsiM&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=3474.93"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaKJVU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you think there’s a cultural shift with the new generation of lawmakers? I mean, we have some younger lawmakers now. We have lots of younger people who’ve come up in things like &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cult of the Dead Cow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; in parts of the government. People are good at computers now in a way that maybe they weren’t so good at computers 10 years ago.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1A0ev"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.rev.com/transcript-editor/Edit?token=lHpsezpX45TZIrWNZM1qXSX1rdcsh9gNPDrzAGpaUKXkb8da0B5K1acheb6mHcmVBVlCm6_YKn0bFFRTP5PApf9EG6E&amp;amp;loadFrom=DocumentDeeplink&amp;amp;ts=3497.06"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7m4f3"&gt;Yes, this is one of the good things. I mean, in the olden days when I started covering this, the only good thing you could say about cybersecurity was, “Well, awareness is rising.” And now it’s true. There are people in Congress that actually understand. There are actual engineers in Congress. You still have a hearing where they drag in [Facebook CEO Mark] Zuckerberg and members of Congress ask embarrassing questions, but it is a big change from where it was, and there are tech-savvy staffers at all levels. They’re digital natives and they understand these trade-offs. I think that there’s a better chance than we’ve ever had of people having a real discussion about this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="liAjLY"&gt;But again, I am concerned more about the establishment, the Four-Star Generals, the people running intelligence agencies, people in the White House who still think of warfare and intelligence in the old terms and don’t get into questions of the private sector versus the public sector stuff because there aren’t really straightforward answers. Right now, our government has been so dysfunctional that you couldn’t get the two houses to agree on pizza toppings, so how are you going to tackle something like this? I mean, the Chamber of Commerce, the private lobbying group, was outraged that folks in the Department of Energy and [Department of Homeland Security] wanted to put out voluntary guidelines for best practices to protect nuclear plants or power plants from hackers because they thought that was a slippery slope that would lead to more regulation. We can’t have that crap anymore. We need people actually willing to give and take and deal with complicated issues, or we’re going to keep getting owned like this.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon: Zero Dawn performed favorably at QHD resolution with the GS66 Stealth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A first look at the next trend in gaming laptops&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6qYdie"&gt;I had hoped that MSI’s GS66 Stealth for 2021 would look and feel a &lt;em&gt;little &lt;/em&gt;different than last year’s model — not that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21348101/msi-gs66-stealth-gaming-laptop-review-rtx-2070-super-300hz"&gt;the 2020 version&lt;/a&gt; was particularly busted in any major way. In fact, the previous model was a few nips and tucks shy of reaching Razer’s high bar for gaming laptop design. But while the outside shell of this year’s model is exactly the same as last year’s, I can live with that because what’s inside is mostly all-new. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7c2Bh"&gt;The review unit we were sent was kitted out with the current pinnacle of mobile graphics tech: Nvidia’s new RTX 3080 Max-Q graphics chip, with 16GB of video memory (Nvidia also makes an 8GB variant). MSI also added a gorgeous canvas of a display: a 15.6-inch 1440p (QHD) IPS G-Sync screen with a fast 240Hz refresh rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dVG2z"&gt;The other specs in the review model are good, too, but not necessarily cutting-edge. It has 16GB of RAM, a 1TB NVMe SSD, and the same big, four-cell 99.99Wh battery that was in the previous iteration. It is equipped with an &lt;a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/208018/intel-core-i7-10870h-processor-16m-cache-up-to-5-00-ghz.html"&gt;Intel Core i7-10870H&lt;/a&gt; processor, which on paper is a slight step down compared to the &lt;a href="https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/202329/intel-core-i7-10875h-processor-16m-cache-up-to-5-10-ghz.html"&gt;Core i7-10875H&lt;/a&gt; in the previous model I tested, but I didn’t notice a difference in performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI GS66 Stealth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n6tNQ6K8haUWY4MrISWUCGXlQl8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22251172/cfaulkner_210121_4379_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Everything from games and websites to desktop backgrounds look so crisp in QHD.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vJ0MB9"&gt;Other minor tweaks worthy of mention include a bump up to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22212938/wifi-6e-rollout-starting-2021-smartphones-tvs-laptops-vr-routers"&gt;Wi-Fi 6E&lt;/a&gt; compatibility and Bluetooth 5.2. This laptop has an HDMI 2.0 port, so it’s limited to outputting 4K resolution at up to 60 frames per second. Of the things MSI updated in this year’s GS66, the HDMI port should have been a little higher on the list than Wi-Fi 6E. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22215119/razer-blade-15-17-laptops-screens-graphics-gaming-price-release-date"&gt;Razer’s new Blade 15 and 17 Pro&lt;/a&gt; each feature HDMI 2.1, allowing 4K output with up to 120 frames per second to really take advantage of the hardware while connected to an external monitor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vt9bpr"&gt;The refreshed GS66 Stealth lineup with RTX 30-series chips and either a 1080p or 4K display will be shipping in February, but unfortunately, the model with the QHD display won’t be available until sometime in Q2 2021. MSI doesn’t have a price nailed down for the review configuration, either. Given that assessing value is an important part of the review process, we’re reserving a score until the cost is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QlYies"&gt;I’ve been testing the flagship configuration of the new GS66 Stealth for a week. General performance outside of gaming felt similarly snappy to last year’s model. A big stack of tabs in Microsoft Edge, alongside Slack and Spotify, didn’t slow this machine down. It didn’t perform nearly as well in our Adobe Premiere Pro export test, though. Tasked with exporting a five-minute, 33-second 4K video, the laptop took six minutes, 30 seconds, compared to the three-minute, 14-second export time that we got with last year’s model. (It wouldn’t be fair not to mention that this configuration has 16GB of RAM versus 32GB in last year’s model, but I plan to retest this once final drivers are released for the GPU.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI GS66 Stealth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JR0pBRhK98VTDTDYON4JvZlHA6o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22251176/cfaulkner_210121_4379_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;em&gt; performed the worst of any recent AAA title I tested, but the numbers are still impressive.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="M40Vyy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10301829"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lrHyue"&gt;But the real question is: was Nvidia’s latest high-end graphics chip worth the wait — and can it keep up with a QHD display? The short answer is that, like my colleague Tom Warren saw on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;the desktop version of the RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt;, this mobile variant is a big leap over what the last-gen RTX 2080 could provide. Since this is also the first generation of gaming laptops that offer QHD screens, it’s a little hard to compare the two, but there’s no question that games look great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNNE23"&gt;The RTX 3080 with 16GB of video memory is capable of running some of the most demanding games in QHD well beyond 60 frames per second — with all graphical settings adjusted to max, and with ray tracing and other RTX settings activated, when applicable. That’s an incredible achievement. And if you’re someone who doesn’t always play the latest games as they are released, these specs will afford you even more headroom to power through your backlog, with a fantastic display to enjoy them on to boot. The IPS screen that MSI opted to use is rich with contrast and better viewing angles than I expected, and its G-Sync adaptive sync does a great job of keeping visuals free of artifacts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQk3ZT"&gt;I was able to spend time playing &lt;em&gt;Horizon: Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;, most of which have ray tracing and / or DLSS (deep-learning super sampling) graphical options to take further advantage of this powerful graphics chip. I tested it by running brief snippets of these games at 1440p and 1080p in order to see the gains from playing games at a slightly less demanding resolution.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6556f7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10301825"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bn2TxQ"&gt;Since &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;don’t ship with built-in benchmarking tests, I simply ran around a variety of locales to stress-test the hardware (the other games have scripted methods for gathering performance metrics). As someone who’s used to playing games on a 1080p display, I was impressed to see such graphically intensive games run this fluidly, especially at a higher native resolution. (If you’re a gamer who wouldn’t be totally happy with some of the numbers above, you could probably improve the frame rate by knocking down a few graphical settings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Var6nM"&gt;As I mentioned up top, the design of the 2021 GS66 Stealth is note-for-note the same as last year’s model. The overall look is stellar, though, and I wish every gaming laptop had a trackpad this generously large. It has backlit keys that can be programmed to dazzle with RGB splendor through SteelSeries software, but that’s really the only element that reveals this is a gaming laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EFSUis"&gt;Well, aside from the very loud fans. I noted that last year’s model was relatively quiet, even under pressure. I’ve heard laptops louder than this new RTX 3080 version, but the decibel level went high enough so that at times I felt I needed headphones to hear all of the in-game details. Of course, that differed depending on the game. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; made this laptop whir the loudest of the games I tested, while &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;actually ran fairly quietly by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI GS66 Stealth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eT4fmVn7Ip2xLZdyMjPb-8cHsM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22251177/cfaulkner_210121_4379_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This QHD screen is pin-sharp, but importantly, it’s really vibrant, and the viewing angles are generous.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O3XMlL"&gt;I found other flaws with the design. The keyboard layout is still crowded, with the important function key placed awkwardly next to the control key, making it cumbersome to do simple tasks like adjust the volume and brightness. Also, the bottom of the laptop chassis still flexes in a slightly worrying way. I don’t think it’s liable to break under normal use, but for a pricey machine like this, the design doesn’t inspire confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F9mVYZ"&gt;Nvidia says that QHD-equipped laptops featuring RTX 30-series graphics chips will begin launching today, with systems from Razer, Asus, and Eluktronics launching first. For example, Razer’s &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-15%2FRZ09-0369BEA2-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Blade 15 with a 165Hz QHD screen and the RTX 3070 will price out at $2,199.99&lt;/a&gt;. We haven’t gotten our hands on it yet, but we expect to find similar performance in models with similar specs. However, since not all QHD panels are created equally, it will be interesting to see how the others compare to the excellent display in MSI’s review unit. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="MSI GS66 Stealth" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kT2h56Oz1XhD3XObu8TXkymHGWA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22251173/cfaulkner_210121_4379_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I couldn’t stop holding my eyeballs this close to the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2Ije5"&gt;If you’re looking to buy one of MSI’s non-QHD models today, there is a number of options. You can get a system equipped with a less powerful RTX 3060 chip starting at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730437098990828811" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,799.99&lt;/a&gt;, one with the RTX 3070 for &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1611894-REG%2Fmsi_gs66_stealth_10ug_075_15_6_gs66_stealth_gaming.html%3FSID%3Ds1610634215938lifha52581&amp;amp;xcust=verge#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,399.99&lt;/a&gt;, or with the new RTX 3080 chip starting at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730437267445605394" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,699.99&lt;/a&gt;. The specs start with a 1080p IPS display with a 240Hz or 300Hz refresh rate. &lt;a href="https://www.msi.com/Laptop/GS66-Stealth-10UX/Specification"&gt;MSI’s product landing page&lt;/a&gt; indicates that it will be possible to upgrade to a 4K 60Hz IPS display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lzs0eR"&gt;Meanwhile, if you’re curious about how the RTX 3070 is shaping up while running alongside an FHD display, my colleague Monica Chin has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22008450"&gt;our review of the MSI GP66 Leopard&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll have a lot more coverage of laptops built with the latest RTX graphics chip in the coming weeks and months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="cY1oIk"&gt;But the TL;DR is that the RTX 3080, working in tandem with the QHD display and everything else that this GS66 Stealth is packing, has fantastic graphics performance, reaffirming that a display like this really is worth spending extra for (if you can swing it). The sharpness of the 1440p display makes pictures and text more enjoyable and pleasant to look at — both in-game and with everyday tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MSI GP66 Leopard review: substance over style</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Step-up performance at the right price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="9wXGDf"&gt;If you’re looking for a gaming rig that’s a step above the budget price point but still more affordable than the flashiest PCs on the market, you’re looking for MSI’s Leopard line. With a starting price of $1,599 ($1,899 as tested), the 2021 GP66 Leopard takes the same top-end chips that are in the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536996/msi-ge66-raider-dragonshield-edition-gaming-laptop-review-rtx-2070-super-300hz"&gt;MSI’s GE66 Raider&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22195676/asus-rog-strix-scar-15-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Strix Scar 15&lt;/a&gt; and puts them in a less exciting, more affordable chassis. In this case, that’s Intel’s eight-core Core i7-10870H and Nvidia’s brand-spanking-new RTX 3070 mobile graphics card — components you’ll also see in luxury gaming flagships across the board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nr1qL0"&gt;That’s the clear argument for the GP66. If you’re willing to make some compromises (particularly when it comes to the chassis and the battery life), you can get high-end gaming performance at a midrange price point. Thanks especially to the RTX 3070, these are some of the best frame rates you’ll find below $2,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2XhJX3"&gt;The GP66 Leopard is a revamp of the 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/MSI-GP65-Leopard-9SE-Laptop-Review-The-best-screen-on-a-mid-tier-gaming-laptop.431863.0.html"&gt;GP65 Leopard&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to the RTX 3070, MSI made at least one other major change: its design. The changes are subtle, but they add up to a machine that looks a bit more professional and a bit less gamer-y. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IRhemx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10297572"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b5FEyB"&gt;For one, the GP66 is noticeably thinner — it’s 0.92 inches thick, while its predecessor was 1.08 inches thick. There’s also a new hinge design, which leaves less visible space between the display and the keyboard deck and is meant to make the clamshell easier to open with one hand. MSI sent a dummy GP65 specifically to verify this claim, and I can confirm that the GP66 is much easier to open. The lid, which had a red MSI logo on the GP65, is all black on the GP66, and the two raised ridges in the center of the GP65 that gave the laptop a distinctively “gamer” look are gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iG1WA1"&gt;But the keyboard deck is where the Leopard has matured the most. MSI eliminated the GP65’s stiff discrete clickers in favor of a smooth, modern touchpad. The keyboard keys, which looked and felt quite plasticky on the last model, have been upgraded to a wider design that more closely resembles those of the &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade line&lt;/a&gt;. (Don’t worry: per-key RGB backlighting remains.) The clunky dedicated buttons the GP65 had for toggling the power and fan profiles are gone as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2kQhXo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10303144"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="Uq8xsT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10297589"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qF7yUh"&gt;That doesn’t mean this is the best-made laptop around. The chassis has a bit of a plasticky feel compared to many more expensive models, and the touchpad wasn’t as smooth as I’d like — I often found my fingers skidding. But I’m happy with the revamp all the same. It’s a smoother, sleeker look — a Leopard for 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKP4By"&gt;One more design change: MSI moved a bunch of ports to the rear of the chassis. There’s one Type-C USB 3.2 Gen 2 with DP1.4, one HDMI 2.0, one RJ45, and one power port back there, in addition to a Type-A USB 3.2 and an audio combo jack on the left and two Type-A USB 3.2 on the right. That means the GP66 actually has fewer ports than its predecessor, which was able to fit in a miniDP 1.4, separate input and output audio jacks, and an SD card reader (though that reader was frustratingly slow according to &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/MSI-GP65-Leopard-9SE-Laptop-Review-The-best-screen-on-a-mid-tier-gaming-laptop.431863.0.html"&gt;reviewers&lt;/a&gt;). On the other hand, having so many ports crammed together on the sides of a device can make cable management a frustrating endeavor, so I’m glad that MSI has been able to spread them out. In particular, having USB-A ports on both sides is handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6w4FG2"&gt;Let’s get into the second thing that’s new with this machine: the RTX 3070. This graphics card was unveiled at Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226544/nvidia-rtx-3080-laptops-gpus-ces-2021"&gt;CES 2021 keynote&lt;/a&gt; two weeks ago, along with the rest of the new RTX 3000 mobile line. Nvidia said the chip would deliver speeds up to 1.5 times faster than those of RTX 2070 systems. In my testing, the GP66 didn’t quite display that large of a bump on every title, but it wasn’t too far off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="di1Jpw"&gt;(My test unit also included an Intel Core i7-10870H, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage, in addition to a 1920 x 1080 240Hz display with 3.5ms response time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="WwVIvA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10297617"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qGG88K"&gt;The TL;DR is that pretty much any game you want to play, you can play. All of the games here were tested at their highest possible settings, and none of them gave the RTX 3070 any trouble. The GP66 averaged 96fps on &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;; gameplay looked fantastic without a stutter to be seen. It averaged 75fps on the highly demanding &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption II&lt;/em&gt;, with a minimum of 55fps on the game’s built-in benchmark. Those are both significantly better results than we saw from MSI’s flagship &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/k792L" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GE66 Raider&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202006AM100000008"&gt;Asus’ ROG Strix Scar 15&lt;/a&gt;, both of which use an RTX 2070 Super, and both of which cost several hundred dollars more for comparable specs. It’s also (unsurprisingly) a step up from MSI’s high-end &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21348101/msi-gs66-stealth-gaming-laptop-review-rtx-2070-super-300hz"&gt;GS66 Stealth&lt;/a&gt; that’s equipped with an RTX 2070 Super Max-Q. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI Gp66 Leopard seen from above, half closed." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5Tpr3D86NOHHVy_yCS9Ko40SY6g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259914/mchin_190417_4380_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MSI’s dragon remains, but the red is gone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="URqz1W"&gt;Ray tracing was also no problem: the Leopard put up 82fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; with the feature on its Ultra setting. The Raider and the Strix averaged 70fps and 67fps, respectively, on that title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vz053n"&gt;With esports titles, you can take full advantage of the 240Hz screen. The GP66 maxed out &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; (which goes up to 250fps) and averaged 169fps on &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; (where the Raider only averaged 124fps). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2QP9AQ"&gt;The Leopard employs MSI’s “Cooler Boost 5” system, which includes two fans and six heat pipes. Cooling was good throughout; the CPU never passed 88 degrees Celsius during gaming. I never heard the fans during my regular multitasking, but there was sometimes an annoying coil whine that swapping to the Silent Fan profile didn’t always eliminate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI GP66 Leopard seen from the left." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AlSBt7tb8qSUr4st_-Jca8EWObk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259919/mchin_190417_4380_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can switch between cooling profiles to eliminate fan noise when you’re not stressing the machine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qThxhU"&gt;While some gaming laptops can double as drivers for media work, the GP66 wouldn’t be a great choice for creative professionals because its screen maxes out at 205 nits. That’s dim, even for a mid-tier gaming laptop. The system also wasn’t quite as dominant in Premiere Pro as it was in gaming — it took five minutes and 21 seconds to export a five-minute, 33-second video that the GS66 Stealth completed in three minutes and 14 seconds. On the bright(er) side, the GP66’s display does cover 100 percent of the sRGB gamut and 80 percent of AdobeRGB, which means your games should look nice and vibrant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZOtTP"&gt;When it came to regular multitasking and office work, I didn’t experience any performance issues with the GP66. I ran into a number of bugs with the last MSI product I reviewed, the GE66 Raider, but I’m happy to report that they all seem to have been fixed. The Dragon Center app (where you can swap fan profiles and customize other settings) was so crash-prone and glitchy when I used it last October that MSI had to tap into my review unit and troubleshoot, but it’s quite smooth and responsive now. I’ve also previously had some trouble with the SteelSeries engine, where you customize keyboard colors and effects, but it was easy to use here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI GP66 Leopard keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QArUr_lsxHqwuBih5J_1RjTxt4U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259911/mchin_190417_4380_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No backlight bleed at all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="DAucQS"&gt;Battery life, though, is a major area where the GP66 isn’t ahead of its competition. I was averaging three and a half to four hours from the four-cell, 65Wh brick, with consistent multitasking in around a dozen Chrome tabs with the screen at 200 nits of brightness. That’s not great news for anyone who was hoping to work on the go, especially considering how heavy the 230W charger is to carry around. This unit also came preloaded with Norton Antivirus, which can drain power, so make sure to uninstall that if you want the longest possible life span. (Premiere Pro results also improved significantly after I nuked Norton.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hZSch"&gt;Finally, on sound. The GP66 includes two 2-watt speakers. As is usually the case with laptop speakers, treble tones were much stronger than the middle ranges, while bass and percussion were subdued. Game audio was fine with a decent surround quality — but not the best I’ve ever heard and not as good as you’d get from a decent external speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpfNgB"&gt;The GP66 also comes preloaded with Nahimic customization software, which lets you swap between audio presets for Music, Movie, Communication, and Gaming, and manually adjust equalizer settings. There’s a “Surround Sound” feature you can turn on and off (I didn’t notice a huge difference), and a “Volume Stabilizer” that’s supposed to keep your audio audible without waking people up (this did change the sound, though I wasn’t able to test its efficacy on any sleeping roommates). You can also customize the built-in microphones for conferences and chats — there are toggles for echo cancellation, static noise suppression, and the like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0OnONe"&gt;The GP66 Leopard isn’t a perfect laptop. Between the plasticky texture, the skid-prone touchpad, the dim screen, and the preloaded bloatware, it’s clear where MSI has had to cut some corners. And while I certainly enjoy the modest all-black chassis, gamers who need RGB lights everywhere may still prefer the likes of the Raider and the Strix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PaQaAT"&gt;But the Leopard excels in the area that matters most: game performance. Not only does it blow budget competitors like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335740/lenovo-legion-5i-gaming-laptop-review-intel-nvidia"&gt;Lenovo Legion 5i&lt;/a&gt; out of the water, but thanks to the new RTX 3070 it’s a significant step up from today’s luxury gaming laptops while remaining a large step down in price. With a powerful new chip and a fresh modern design, the GP66 Leopard is an excellent new product to kick off 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus ROG Flow X13 review: a game-ready 2-in-1</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A top-notch convertible with a pricey sidecar&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="Y9Yo1A"&gt;If I saw the Asus ROG Flow X13 in the wild, I would never guess it was a gaming laptop. It’s a 13.4-inch 2-in-1 convertible that’s just 2.9 pounds and .62 inches thick. Flip the screen around, and you can use it as a tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="roJNTP"&gt;A 13-inch gaming laptop with those proportions isn’t unheard of, but it’s certainly unusual. How is Asus pulling it off? The secret is that the real gaming hardware is on the outside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RRr20p"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10302632"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Flow X13 connected to the XG Mobile." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B2c9wWT425-5rlEDyX6XnAw7jqg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259418/mchin_190421_4382_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ROG Flow and its eGPU companion make an attractive pair.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IIV7Df"&gt;On its own, the Flow X13 looks like a high-end productivity machine. Inside is AMD’s Ryzen 9 5980HS, a monstrous mobile processor with eight cores and 16 threads — making this undoubtedly the most powerful CPU we’ve ever seen in a 13-inch chassis. That’s paired with an entry-level Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 with Max-Q design, 32GB of memory, 1TB of storage, and a 16:10 3840 x 2400 touch display. (You can choose a 120Hz FHD display as well.)   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSrrTu"&gt;On paper, that’s an excellent multimedia device that could compete very well with the likes of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221003/dell-xps-13-2020-review-core-i7-specs-features-price"&gt;Dell XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;, in the $1,000-$2,000 price range. But Asus isn’t selling it that way: it’s selling it as an ultraportable gaming laptop and bundling it with its very own external GPU called the XG Mobile. Asus says this GPU will deliver power equivalent to that of a GeForce RTX 3080 — Nvidia’s top of the line. So here’s the kicker: for the moment, you can only buy the Flow X13 &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/search?q=rog%20flow%20x13&amp;amp;s_c=1"&gt;bundled&lt;/a&gt; with the XG Mobile. The configuration we have costs $3,299.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="gjO0SK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10302650"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uhsm36"&gt;That’s a lot of money. It’s more than any number of excellent high-end gaming laptops cost. It’s over $1,000 more than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21340554/razer-blade-stealth-13-review-keyboard-specs-price-features"&gt;Razer Blade Stealth 13&lt;/a&gt; and more than twice the price of Asus’s own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;, the two best gaming laptops in the ultraportable class. The argument for it is that for $3,299, you’re essentially buying three laptops: one that’s competing with the Dell XPS 13, one that’s competing with the Blade Stealth, and one that’s competing with much larger systems like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Razer’s Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt; (with the caveat that it needs an eGPU to keep up). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="itUNkb"&gt;I just wish those three laptops could be sold separately — and I wish I could give them separate scores. Because the Flow X13, on its own, is truly an excellent laptop and one of the most powerful 13-inch systems on the market today. But by positioning this as a gaming rig and slapping it with a $3,000 price tag, Asus has forced the Flow into the premium gaming category. And while it holds its own among competitors there, it still comes with more compromises than I’d want to see from a $3,000 product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7XeMF"&gt;I’ll start by explaining what makes the Flow X13 so great as a general-purpose laptop, because there really is a lot going for it. Not only is it light enough that carrying it feels like carrying nothing, but it’s also the coolest-feeling laptop I’ve used in the past year. The lid, the palm rests, and the bottom of the deck all have a ridged corduroy-ish texture that’s hard to resist running your hands over. It also gives the whole thing a sleek, futuristic look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTheBQ"&gt;Like many Asus laptops, the Flow X13 has an ErgoLift hinge that tilts the keyboard slightly off the table when the clamshell is open. This hinge was a bit more rounded than those I’ve seen on fold-under laptops in the past, and it wasn’t sharp at all in my lap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Flow X13 keyboard seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W9Z3CC3EnN3CMcmYKMRozaAu55I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259421/mchin_190421_4382_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keys have 1.7mm of travel and a 0.15mm keycap curve.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QB9H9O"&gt;Another thing that’s great: the 16:10 screen. Most gaming laptops are still 16:9, but many high-end business and productivity laptops are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238671/16-9-aspect-ratio-hp-elite-folio-dell-latitude-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-legion-7"&gt;starting to move&lt;/a&gt; to 16:10 and 3:2 displays this year. That’s with good reason: You get noticeably more vertical space with a 16:10 resolution, which means much less scrolling and zooming out throughout your work day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nw7kWw"&gt;The panel is also compatible with the Asus Pen, and Asus says it’s “highly scratch-resistant.” While I didn’t go to great lengths to try to scratch the thing, I was struck by how resilient it was in general. I gave it a good amount of touchscreen use throughout my first day of testing, and I never noticed any kind of fingerprints or smudges left behind. One note: there’s noticeable hinge wobble when you’re using the touchscreen in clamshell mode, which wasn’t an issue for me but may be for some folks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EPStim"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Asus says the display is “highly scratch-resistant”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NbIHDh"&gt;Inside, this laptop is a whirlwind. The Ryzen 9 5980HS is clearly a powerhouse. It handled my decently heavy load of photo editing, Spotify streaming, and heaps of Chrome tabs and apps with no problem; I never once heard the fans spin up. The X13 could be a great choice for anyone who needs a 13.4-inch laptop for computational tasks or other heavy office or school work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyxH3L"&gt;Audio is also pretty good. It doesn’t get as loud as an external speaker would, but the bass and percussion are some of the best I’ve ever heard on a laptop. In the preloaded Dolby Access app, you can also switch between presets for music, gaming, movies, etc. The Flow also supports two-way AI noise cancellation for video calls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ROG Flow X13 faces away from the camera." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xSo4fOM89irgc-Hkp-GSWmCdYE4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259414/mchin_190421_4382_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a flashy ROG logo in the bottom corner.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The left side of the Asus ROG Flow X13." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c0arlFjI5gWukpeTAw_YspHuARo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259416/mchin_190421_4382_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The cap that covers the eGPU connector is tiny, so make sure not to lose it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The right side of the Asus ROG Flow X13." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SaDr6yxfUB0PJYoH7hWT-BLrbdM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259415/mchin_190421_4382_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The X13 Flow charges via its USB-C port when not plugged into the XG Mobile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wr2doE"&gt;And the keyboard, as Asus keyboards often are, is excellent. It feels quite similar to that of the Zephyrus G14, which was one of my absolute favorite keyboards of 2020. It has a resounding click, good travel, and very nice backlighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="X5ltAP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The keyboard has a resounding click, good travel, and very nice backlighting&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MJdWcH"&gt;Finally, because this is a legitimate question with Asus ROG products: yes, there is a webcam. It’s nothing to write home about, but it does exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZpm4O"&gt;I really have only one complaint about this system, and that’s the battery life. While running my usual workload with the screen at 200 nits of brightness, even with Battery Saver on and bloatware uninstalled, the Flow X13 only lasted an average of five hours and 47 minutes. The high-resolution display is likely a contributor here — you may get slightly better mileage from the FHD panel. While playing &lt;em&gt;Red Dead&lt;/em&gt;, the Flow lasted just over an hour and became unplayable 55 minutes in with 10 percent remaining.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The XG Mobile seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GHWj-8eTq6MJ6XhUxMJOOwVLRx4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259420/mchin_190421_4382_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The XG Mobile weighs just 2.2 pounds and measures 8.19 x 6.1 x 1.17 inches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YzFANI"&gt;I wish this review could stop there. Because what Asus has made here is a beautiful machine that could absolutely rival the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; as an ultraportable, 16:10 convertible. Battery life is really my only complaint. But since Asus has decided that this is a gaming laptop, we’re going to need to dive into how it handles games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJnEec"&gt;Let’s talk a bit about this XG Mobile thing. It’s small for an external GPU, weighing just 2.2 pounds; Asus says it’s only 6 percent of the size of a typical GPU. It connects to the Flow X13 with a proprietary connector that allows for up to 64Gbps of bandwidth, with another 10Gbps reserved for USB link. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="osYiKC"&gt;In addition to serving as an external GPU, the XG Mobile powers the laptop when it’s plugged in. (The Flow also ships with a regular 100W charger.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="t7jTtA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;XG Mobile powers the laptop when it’s plugged in&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CUG9On"&gt;The eGPU also serves as an external USB dock with a whole bunch of extra ports. In total, it includes: one HDMI 2.0, one DP 1.4, one Ethernet jack, one DC input jack, four USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports, and one SD card reader. That’s in addition to the one USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, two USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type C (with DisplayPort 1.4 and PD support), one audio combo jack, and one HDMI 2.0b that are already on the laptop itself. All in all, a good selection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Flow X13 in tent mode." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AJd7WwpVp7y1mc8_9kkIlZLSHXE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259422/mchin_190421_4382_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With the XG Mobile connected, the X13 Flow can power up to four displays.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WyHUOl"&gt;I ran five popular games on the ROG Flow at 1920 x 1080 resolution, both with and without the XG Mobile. I also ran them at native resolution (with the XG Mobile). All games were run at their highest possible settings; in 4K, they were run with DLSS on and ray tracing off (where applicable). Take a look at the results in the chart below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KFWqos"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10302666"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9sy7K1"&gt;As you can see, these frame rates are respectable. You should be able to play whatever game you want at 1080p without needing to bump the graphics down, and you can even play some at native resolution. Even so, my overall reaction here is “Meh.” To illustrate why, I’ll pull out a few comparisons. (This is all with the usual caveat that relative performance will always vary by title.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Who2Be"&gt;While using the GTX 1650, the X13 ran &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at an average of 40fps. The Razer Blade Stealth 13 ran that title at 45fps, and the Zephyrus G14 ran it at 74fps. The Zephyrus also beat the Flow on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption II&lt;/em&gt;, averaging 31fps to the Flow’s 29fps. &lt;em&gt;Red Dead &lt;/em&gt;wouldn’t allow me to max out every slider due to available memory, so this system is further behind the Zephyrus than that score makes it appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="c3NFAe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;My overall reaction here is “Meh”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TvxfHH"&gt;Both of these laptops are comparably portable to the Flow X13 and just as well-built; they have worse processors and better GPUs. They also both cost over $1,400 less than this Flow X13 bundle. So if you’re looking to actually &lt;em&gt;game&lt;/em&gt; on the go, rather than just do office work, think about whether you’d rather have one of those much more affordable devices with better frame rates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W53dzu"&gt;But I’d still be on board with a $3,299 bundle price if the X13 Flow and XG Mobile delivered exceptional performance with no compromises — &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; if it put 4K gaming on the table. The good news is that this external GPU does provide an acceptable 4K gaming experience (especially on &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, the easiest game on here). But eGPUs generally come with some sort of performance penalty, and I’m seeing that on some of these titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAiK7T"&gt;For comparison, we can look to the Razer Blade Pro 17, a GeForce RTX 2080 Super Max-Q system in the same price neighborhood as the Flow X13 bundle. (Our 2080 Super Max-Q configuration was $3,199.) The XG Mobile clearly has no trouble with easier titles like &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, where it breezed past all of the laptops mentioned here. But it struggled with more intense fare, and ray tracing in particular. The Blade Pro 17 averaged 95fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; with ray tracing maxed out, where the Flow X13 and the XG Mobile averaged 76fps. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21431381/asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-15-review"&gt;Asus’ Zephyrus Duo 15&lt;/a&gt;, also with a 2080 Super Max-Q, also handily beat the Flow there, averaging 87fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="88OiAL"&gt;And the Flow is also coming in behind more affordable systems with Nvidia’s GeForce RTX 3070 — the $1,899 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22008450"&gt;MSI GP66 Leopard&lt;/a&gt; beat it on both &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Horizon&lt;/em&gt;, and essentially tied it on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AgKloZ"&gt;So overall, whether you’re getting better frame rates from the XG Mobile or a larger gaming laptop will be somewhat title-dependent — but it’s clear that we’re seeing a performance penalty on some popular games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG X13 Flow seen from the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bex_-4q2YzfvdMXa01SgN8fZjqk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22259417/mchin_190421_4382_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The X13 Flow is an innovative gaming rig, but it asks some compromises.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YGDHZl"&gt;So here’s the best argument for the ROG Flow X13. During the day, you can use it as a work and entertainment laptop, with a great screen, a comfortable keyboard, full audio, and a phenomenal processor that can handle whatever tasks you throw at it. Maybe you can play a game or two, if you bump down the resolution. When you’re home at night, put the Flow on your desk and pop in the XG Mobile, and it becomes a premium gaming laptop with 4K chops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EyCFa"&gt;That’s fine; I’m all for that. But prospective buyers should be aware that in creating a laptop that essentially functions as three laptops (an XPS 13, a Stealth 13, and a Pro 17), you’re making compromises in each use case. In the ultrabook category, it’s the battery life. In the portable gaming category, it’s the low-powered graphics card and the massive uptick in price. And in the desktop-replacement category, it’s the eGPU performance cost, which may or may not be significant depending on the games you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YK3SlX"&gt;Reviewers throw this phrase around to describe all kinds of laptops, but it’s very true here: in attempting to be a jack of all trades, this laptop is a master of none. And while the Flow X13 is a top-notch convertible, and an impressive achievement from Asus, it also costs over $3,000. If you need both a high-performance office laptop and a high-performance gaming laptop in one, and you have that kind of change to throw around, I won’t stop you. But those who primarily need one or the other should be better able to fulfill their needs with something more affordable, whether it’s a high-end 2-in-1 or a portable gaming rig. &lt;/p&gt;
