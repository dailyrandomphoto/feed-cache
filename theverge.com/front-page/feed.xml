    <title>Ivermectin misinformation has poisoned Amazon’s platform, with few fixes planned</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SATPKw-tD54xKwlhqcz9AeKMKx0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69801615/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0007.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P8SF6L"&gt;Earlier this week, I started a search on Amazon and mistyped, entering just two letters in: “iv.” Amazon then helpfully compiled a list of suggested search results, almost all of which were for the horse de-worming version of the drug ivermectin. That drug is at the center of one of the more recent and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/oneunderscore__/status/1431040456364810242"&gt;more mind-boggling&lt;/a&gt; parts of the anti-vaccine misinformation story, a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/ivermectin-demand-drives-trump-telemedicine-website-rcna1791"&gt;false cure touted by hucksters and others out to make a quick buck&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ni2rc3"&gt;This evening, Amazon spokesperson Craig Andrews tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “Amazon’s autocomplete responses are driven by customer activity. We are blocking certain autocomplete responses to address these concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EfKxJd"&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644579/tiktok-reddit-facebook-ivermectin-covid-19-misinformation"&gt;Facebook, TikTok, and Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon has not gotten a lid on limiting the spread of COVID-19 misinformation. Unlike those platforms and others, Amazon has seemingly done very little to try to stop it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Autocomplete results on Amazon for “iv” showing ivermectin." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m_XiNgN1O8l-CcsOQ6s_3teK2O4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22819245/Screen_Shot_2021_08_31_at_8.28.23_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Autocomplete results on Amazon for “iv” showing ivermectin.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="clcsdW"&gt;Amazon is not unique in using an algorithm to drive its autocomplete results. But as companies like Google have learned, there are “data voids” for previously unpopular search terms that can suddenly skew the algorithm when those terms get swept up in a new misinformation campaign. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550430/google-search-results-changing-quickly-warning-breaking-news"&gt;Google has gone to some length&lt;/a&gt; to try to solve the data void problem, most recently by presenting warnings on search results it thinks might suffer from the issue. As of the publication of this article, Amazon’s search results still show entries for ivermectin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSy53W"&gt;When you click through to one of those suggested search terms, Amazon simply lists many options for purchasing the drug meant to treat animals — without any further context about its dangers when ingested by humans. Although there are legitimate uses for ivermectin in humans, treating COVID-19 isn’t one of them. And though it should go without saying that taking the veterinary version is a very bad idea, that’s exactly what’s happening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hyu0u4"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://msdh.ms.gov/msdhsite/_static/resources/15400.pdf"&gt;bulletin issued by the Mississippi department of health&lt;/a&gt;, the agency says that “At least 70% of the recent calls [to poison control] have been related to ingestion of livestock or animal formulations of ivermectin.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrvAaf"&gt;Ivermectin can cause side effects ranging from “skin rash, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, facial or limb swelling, neurologic adverse events (dizziness, seizures, confusion), sudden drop in blood pressure, severe skin rash potentially requiring hospitalization and liver injury (hepatitis),” &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/animal-veterinary/product-safety-information/faq-covid-19-and-ivermectin-intended-animals"&gt;according to the FDA&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g2CS74"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You are not a horse. You are not a cow. Seriously, y'all. Stop it. &lt;a href="https://t.co/TWb75xYEY4"&gt;https://t.co/TWb75xYEY4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— U.S. FDA (@US_FDA) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/US_FDA/status/1429050070243192839?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FadffS"&gt;Where other platforms have put effort into presenting information boxes leading to reliable and trustworthy information about COVID-19 and COVID-19 treatments, Amazon shows no such information in either its search results nor on product pages for ivermectin. An Amazon spokesperson tells me that if you search specifically for “ivermectin for covid,” it does display only a link to the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/consumers/consumer-updates/why-you-should-not-use-ivermectin-treat-or-prevent-covid-19"&gt;FDA’s warning page about the drug&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bL6Xo1"&gt;It does appear that on at least some product listings, at least some moderation teams at Amazon are keeping an eye out for problems. Some of the top search results for ivermectin have very few written reviews. Scroll down a bit, however, and there are plenty that are clearly meant to discuss the use of the drug in humans. One reviewer, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Duramectin-Ivermectin-Paste-1-87-Horses/dp/B07PT9NGGQ/ref=sr_1_9?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=ivermectin&amp;amp;qid=1630467118&amp;amp;sr=8-9&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for example&lt;/a&gt;, wrote that it “Worked good on my 200lb horse” and that “long CV already going away.” Another &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bimectin-Paste-For-Equine/dp/B003UO0QOS/ref=sr_1_7?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=ivermectin&amp;amp;qid=1630468754&amp;amp;sr=8-7&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rated&lt;/a&gt; a product 5 stars, writing that “I love the taste [...] Ivermectin too hard to get, but so effective at preventing something I cannot mention here.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SPmdv"&gt;Over on Reddit, more than a hundred subreddits &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/08/reddits-teach-the-controversy-stance-on-covid-vaccines-sparks-wider-protest/"&gt;went dark today&lt;/a&gt; in protest of that platform’s refusal to ban communities that spread COVID-19 misinformation. TikTok appears to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644579/tiktok-reddit-facebook-ivermectin-covid-19-misinformation"&gt;playing whack-a-mole&lt;/a&gt; with videos on its platform, and Facebook has struggled to enforce its policies against misinformation as communities &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/ivermectin-demand-drives-trump-telemedicine-website-rcna1791"&gt;resort to euphemisms&lt;/a&gt; like “moo juice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qwN9pb"&gt;On Amazon, veterinary ivermectin remains easy to find without being shown any science-based information that could inform a consumer of the dangers of taking a drug that is meant for animals. It also remains easy to purchase on that platform, in some cases with free Amazon Prime delivery, fulfilled by an Amazon warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BqwBVJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hey Amazon this autocomplete result for just two letters is VERY BAD on so many levels. Not only does it reveal how easily your algorithm can be skewed by misinformation, it’s also possibly leading to genuine, human harm. &lt;a href="https://t.co/A2hfsKIcQr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/A2hfsKIcQr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1432548841518092292?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new ‘adaptive volume’ will make Alexa speak louder when it’s noisy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XptYQQwOXx-MUYwLFCK59T_P9Lc=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69801027/dseifert_201025_4263_00012.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gvnSWG"&gt;Amazon is working to solve a frustration with smart home speakers by introducing a feature called Adaptive Volume, which will make Alexa respond louder if it detects that you’re in a noisy environment. According to the company, the mode is meant to make sure that you can still hear Alexa’s responses over any background noise (like the sound of a dishwasher, people talking, or music playing on another device). Amazon says that the feature is currently available to US customers, and that you can activate it by saying “Alexa, turn on adaptive volume.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mGRyr9"&gt;Amazon doesn’t mention adaptive volume working in the opposite direction, becoming quieter if there’s no background noise, but there are other ways to reduce the volume dynamically. One of them is Whisper Mode, where Alexa will whisper its response if you talk to it quietly. As &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFK0rKnPZPw"&gt;this relaxing video&lt;/a&gt; points out, you can activate the mode by asking Alexa to “turn on whisper mode.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6WLJux"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iFK0rKnPZPw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tOusVh"&gt;If you’re instead looking to just adjust the volume depending on what time it is, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amazonecho/comments/gqq9kz/is_it_possible_to_have_alexa_adjust_her_response/frujab2?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;Alexa enthusiasts recommend doing so&lt;/a&gt; by adding a “set volume” action to a custom routine that activates at a certain time, or making it &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/alexa-can-you-chill-quick-and-easy-workarounds-for-5-minor-issues/"&gt;part of your bedtime routine&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sIBiox"&gt;We just gave Adaptive Volume a quick test with an Echo Dot sitting next to a desktop PC with a spinning fan, and it seems a little bit inconsistent; some of Alexa’s responses were louder than usual, but others went back to the original volume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cie8Bv"&gt;It’s worth noting that the Adaptive Volume feature isn’t the same as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;spherical Echo fourth gen’s&lt;/a&gt; adaptive sound, which uses the device’s microphones to tune music to sound better in your specific room. This also isn’t the first time we’ve seen a smart assistant try to adapt its volume to the user’s environment — &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/thread/29125230/ambient-iq-how-google-nest-speakers-work?hl=en"&gt;Google Nest’s Ambient IQ&lt;/a&gt; promises to do something similar for spoken word content or assistant responses.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple pledges another small but welcome sum to racial justice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h9Y_J8KAdDaqwZr6u6njzXwXsLI=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69801019/VRG_4132_BigTechs_Commitment_Lede_FR.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f2rpl3"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F08%2Fapple-broadens-racial-equity-and-justice-initiative-with-30-million-in-new-commitments%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F31%2F22651312%2Fapple-pledges-another-small-but-welcome-sum-to-racial-justice" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;has pledged&lt;/a&gt; another $30 million to racial justice, on top of the $100 million it promised last year in the wake of George Floyd’s death. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JV1EwC"&gt;It includes funding for a wide array of causes, including a Global Hispanic-Serving Institution (HSI) Equity Innovation Hub at California State University Northridge in Los Angeles, with the intent to create regional hubs at other universities, and an expansion of its work to bring community coding centers to Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) by adding 11 additional schools to the roster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MXnnS"&gt;Last August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21362540/racial-justice-tech-companies-donations-apple-amazon-facebook-google-microsoft"&gt;we calculated just how small the donations from Big Tech were compared to their immense profits&lt;/a&gt;, and today’s $30 million doesn’t really change the calculus there. At the rate Apple is currently raking in cash, it takes just 2.31 hours, or roughly 139 minutes, to make $30 million in profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UTzh38"&gt;&lt;q&gt;$30 million for Apple is like $7.51 to the median US family&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="drXnY3"&gt;Or — to bring the comparison down to earth a bit — it’s like if &lt;a href="https://www.census.gov/library/publications/2020/demo/p60-270.html"&gt;a middle-class US family&lt;/a&gt; made a one-time donation of seven dollars and fifty-one cents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TmKs0I"&gt;It’s also not entirely clear how much of Apple’s now-$130 million contribution is in the form of donations, rather than investments where Apple might get its money back: in January, the company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F01%2Fapple-launches-major-new-racial-equity-and-justice-initiative-projects-to-challenge-systemic-racism-advance-racial-equity-nationwide%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F31%2F22651312%2Fapple-pledges-another-small-but-welcome-sum-to-racial-justice" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;revealed at least $35 million would be invested&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UezQqT"&gt;Still, it’s notable that Apple’s still sending significant sums towards racial justice at all, when an expert we quoted last year suggested that companies might turn their attention elsewhere when the moment fades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RkWXhT"&gt;Cash also isn’t everything. There’s also institutional change to consider. Also: “It’s not just about where you’re going, but it’s also about owning up to where you have been, and how you may have contributed to a situation that exists right now, and that the wealth and prosperity of your business could be rooted in, is likely rooted in, some deep-seated inequities,” Laura Morgan Roberts, a professor at the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business, told us last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="fuzKF4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Big Tech pledged a billion to racial justice, but it was pocket change","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21362540/racial-justice-tech-companies-donations-apple-amazon-facebook-google-microsoft"},{"title":"Tim Cook’s Apple, ten years later","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Retailer leak suggests Google’s Pixel 6 will have 23W wireless charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-qv5vUzcehk_Pc9n9yiH5-Y2z1M=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69800616/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tELnPI"&gt;Google may be working on a new wireless charging stand for its Pixel phones, according to a leaked image of a retail inventory backend mentioning a “Google Pixel 23W WL Stand” &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/08/31/exclusive-googles-new-pixel-stand-for-the-pixel-6-should-support-23w-fast-wireless-charging/"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The name suggests the charger could support 23W wireless charging, and if Google does end up releasing this stand, it seems likely that the upcoming Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro would support 23W charging as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lW-ybK-aHCSF8Z4WcoegbJT7GoI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22818317/Pixel_Stand_23W_668x445.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/08/31/exclusive-googles-new-pixel-stand-for-the-pixel-6-should-support-23w-fast-wireless-charging/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Android Police’s&lt;em&gt; image seemingly revealing the existence of a new Pixel Stand.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CiWQpx"&gt;That wireless charging speed, if accurate, would be more than the iPhone 12’s maximum 15W wireless charging &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514850/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-wireless-charging-speed"&gt;with a MagSafe charger&lt;/a&gt; and surpass the 10W wireless charging offered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17941176/google-pixel-stand-wireless-charger-announcement-price-release-date"&gt;by the original Pixel Stand&lt;/a&gt; (which is still available on &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/pixel_stand?hl=en-US"&gt;Google’s online store&lt;/a&gt;). Google hasn’t replied to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OEe95k"&gt;The company revealed the first details about the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;earlier in August&lt;/a&gt;. They seem like promising devices, especially with their new Google-designed Tensor system on a chip, and 23W wireless charging could make them an even more enticing purchase. Google plans to release those phones this fall, and if this new charging stand is real, it seems likely it will come out alongside them — especially since the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628702/google-pixel-6-charger-not-included"&gt;won’t ship with an included charging brick&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This image showed up on Banksy’s site, was sold as an NFT, then was taken down. The artist’s team says it’s fake.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Internet Archive&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EfMQ3d"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;The NFT space&lt;/a&gt; continues to be weird and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22639353/cool-cats-bayc-generative-nft-profile-avatar"&gt;occasionally wonderful&lt;/a&gt;, but today’s story is going for some sort of award: a collector paid over $300,000 in Ethereum for an NFT from someone claiming to be Banksy after the image appeared on the famed street artist’s website. &lt;a href="https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/were-banksy-and-pranksy-both-pranked-in-usd330-000-nft-sale"&gt;Then, Banksy’s spokesperson said&lt;/a&gt; that the artist had no involvement with NFTs, and stories came out declaring it a fake. Finally, the NFT’s seller spontaneously refunded the collector, seemingly with no note. Oh, and to really muddy the waters, the collector who bought the NFT &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/nfts-on-the-news-mega-whale-pranksy-brings-collectible-highlights-to-the-fore"&gt;goes by the name of Pranksy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQm24f"&gt;Pranksy &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58399338"&gt;told the BBC&lt;/a&gt; that he heard about the auction, which was being held on the NFT marketplace OpenSea, from someone in his Discord. (The BBC doesn’t identify Pranksy by name, but he has since revealed that he purchased the NFT, which is verifiable on his OpenSea page.) It seemed legit, as the seller had posted a link to a page on Banksy’s official website, at https://banksy.co.uk/nft.html, which the &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210831083419/https://banksy.co.uk/nft.html"&gt;Wayback Machine confirms existed&lt;/a&gt;. The page showed a picture of the NFT being sold, which depicts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430254/cryptopunks-christies-sale-larva-labs"&gt;a Cryptopunk-esque person&lt;/a&gt; smoking in front of industrial smokestacks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="7SoeYg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Banksy’s spokesperson says he’s not associated with any NFT auctions&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="wfA7oT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R2Jiuf"&gt;Less than an hour later, the seller accepted Pranksy’s bid for over $300K, which made him suspect it was a scam. That suspicion wasn’t helped by the NFT page being deleted from Banksy’s website. Then, the artist’s spokesperson told the BBC that there weren’t any NFT actions associated with Banksy and that the artist hadn’t “created any NFT artworks.” At that point, Pransky more or less &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pranksy/status/1432683731362402304?s=20"&gt;accepted that he’d been scammed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;div id="1CuTig"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;However the account has minted a second &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFT?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NFT&lt;/a&gt; which makes me feel I have in fact been scammed here, very elaborate takeover of the &lt;a href="https://t.co/J8U3TmR3gE"&gt;https://t.co/J8U3TmR3gE&lt;/a&gt; website&lt;/p&gt;— Pranksy   (@pranksy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pranksy/status/1432668324278714372?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yws6xq"&gt;He wasn’t the first. We’ve seen sellers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22334527/nft-scams-artists-opensea-rarible-marble-cards-fraud-art"&gt;try to pass off other artists’ work as their own before&lt;/a&gt;, and if this situation involved pretty much any other artist, there likely wouldn’t be any question if this was a scam — especially given the weirdness happening with duplicates. Pranksy told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that another scammer had created a duplicate NFT, then gifted it to him. The other person used a similar username to the original seller, minted a few other NFTs in the same style, then sent one to Pranksy. Since then, a &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/gaakmannn?tab=created"&gt;torrent of other fakers&lt;/a&gt; popped up, minting the same images as NFTs, sending some to Pransky, and listing the other ones for sale. It probably goes without saying that nobody should buy them. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yVpz0SVqeI3-BCxWAvPXDb3YGDo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22817968/Screen_Shot_2021_08_31_at_12.17.55_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These imitation images, along with the original imitation image, have been minted by a wave of scammers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Oh6yEQ"&gt;With Banksy, though, there’s always some level of doubt as to what is or isn't the artist’s work. This is the same person who says he &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_is_in_the_Bin"&gt;tried to build a painting that shredded itself&lt;/a&gt; and who reportedly had his quote saying “copyright is for losers” &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-54189113"&gt;thrown back at him during a trademark battle&lt;/a&gt;. What’s irony, what’s real, and what’s not is usually at least somewhat up in the air with him. While his team's denials seem very clear cut, they haven’t gotten back to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; or the BBC about how the link for the NFT &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210831083419/https://banksy.co.uk/nft.html"&gt;verifiably ended up on Banksy’s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wPV44A"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Getting a refund after a blockchain scam is not the norm&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Es1N4y"&gt;That note was supposed to be the end of the story, but then Pranksy DM’d me to say that the original scammer had returned the Ethereum Pranksy paid for the NFT. Sure enough, the transaction between the two wallets &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/tx/0x820163406b84c11e324b95e9b9b9158ec54ca3f52fc58be2a01708a3b819e689"&gt;showed up on Etherscan&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619272/poly-network-attack-600-million-cryptocurrency-theft-doge-ethereum-binance-return-defi"&gt;hacker who stole&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638087/poly-network-600-million-stolen-crypto-hack-restored-defi"&gt;returned the Poly Network funds&lt;/a&gt;, whoever it was behind this didn’t leave any notes when sending the Ethereum back, making it difficult to tell what their motives were. Pranksy told me that he hadn’t been in contact with the scammer, apart from adding the person who had originally dropped the link in his Discord and following them on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbFoo2"&gt;Getting a refund after a blockchain scam is not the norm. The system is designed to transfer funds from one wallet to another permanently, and there’s really no feasible way to get funds back unless the person you sent them to decides to return them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UMQcxR"&gt;Just as we saw &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AfAswap/status/1428191925157441536?s=20"&gt;after the Poly Network attack&lt;/a&gt;, there have been accusations on Twitter that this whole thing was a publicity stunt. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pranksy/status/1432770987582447618"&gt;Pranksy denies it&lt;/a&gt;, saying that he wouldn’t want to risk a possible future relationship with Banksy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IiNR6h"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just to add a comment, to those who feel this may have been some sort of stunt. I would never risk a future relationship with Banksy or any fine artist by hiring someone to hack their website and then buying an &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFT?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NFT&lt;/a&gt; from myself, what an unusual day!&lt;/p&gt;— Pranksy   (@pranksy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pranksy/status/1432770987582447618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xq1krn"&gt;So, what have we learned today? For starters, it seems clear that NFT scams are still alive and well, as the digital tokens &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22639353/cool-cats-bayc-generative-nft-profile-avatar"&gt;keep attracting high-paying buyers&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve also gotten a look at how hard things can be to verify in the Internet age — one NFT showing up on Banksy’s website seems like proof that it’s real, but everything else points to it being a fake. Even now, it’s hard to tell whether we’ll ever know who was actually behind this whole fiasco and what they were hoping to accomplish. It really &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dril/status/13408516505075712?lang=en"&gt;could be anybody&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="zV8ORq"&gt;The fast-approaching Labor Day holiday promises to bring plenty of great tech deals on notable favorites, including smart speakers, headphones, TVs, and tablets. While we regret to inform you that it is, sadly, not yet the weekend, there is a wide selection deals already available at retailers such as Amazon, Walmart, and B&amp;amp;H Photo, many of which are likely to run through the rest of the week and into the long weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eq0I3N"&gt;Right now, there are savings to be had on devices like the Bose Noise Cancelling 700 and second-gen Apple Pencil, and we’ll be sure to bring you more as the week unfolds, both on-site and in your inbox via our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;Verge Deals newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. In the meantime, check out these early Labor Day deals on a wide swath of tech goodies.&lt;/p&gt;

The premium pair of last-gen on-ears offer some of the best noise cancellation around, not to mention USB-C charging and supreme comfort. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/11/17844914/sony-1000x-m3-review-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;

Right now, they’re $130 at Amazon, the cheapest we’ve seen the true wireless earbuds in recent weeks. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

Normally $379, you can pick a refurbished pair with a two-year warranty at eBay for $100 off. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

It’s available in silver at Walmart for just $299, its lowest price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;

Apple’s latest wearables features a fantastic display in addition to built-in sleeping tracking, though, it remains exclusive to iOS. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

Right now, Amazon has the Intel i7 six-core machine for $1,165, saving you nearly $335 on the 2020 model. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22315386/razer-blade-15-base-2021-review-gaming-laptop-nvidia-rtx-3070-qhd-screen-performance" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our 2021 Razer Blade 15 base review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

Couple that with HDR10 support, FreeSync to prevent screen tearing, and a $297 price tag at Amazon, and you’ve got yourself a sweet 32-inch monitor.&lt;/li&gt;

This $80 price tag has only been beaten during Amazon Prime Day, when Amazon devices are at their cheapest, but it’s still a great value for an affordable Alexa-equipped smart speaker that offers impressive sound quality and tunes itself based on the room. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

The capable smart display — which is a bit sluggish, in our testing — can track your sleep if you choose it to be your bedside assistant, and it can display images directly from your Google Photos account. Walmart’s current discount brings the price down to $70, regardless of which color you choose.&lt;/li&gt;

Even with its small stature, it can do just about anything other Echo speakers can do, even if it is limited when it comes to video calling and video streaming. Today, you can buy it for just $55 ($30 off) at Amazon. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

If you buy a three-pack of the colorful bulbs, you pay the same price as you would for two of them, effectively a discount of $35 that brings the price of three bulbs down to $100. Philips doesn’t often discount its app-enabled bulbs, and this is a great way to get started with smart lighting or stock up.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Six things we learned about the Dead Space remake</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sx1TrZiagZ5NiBLG_Lv0gyHmQik=/186x0:2241x1370/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69800131/Screen_Shot_2021_07_22_at_1.55.22_PM_1.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wNZXik"&gt;When EA announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22586840/dead-space-remake-pc-ps5-xbox-series-x"&gt;remaking &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it wasn’t really clear what “remake” meant. Would the company be completely rebooting the beloved space horror series? Or would it be more like a remaster that upgraded the original’s 13-year-old graphics for the Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, and modern PCs? &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Squadrons&lt;/em&gt; studio EA Motive offered &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-remake-gameplay-story-ps5-xbox-tech-details"&gt;a little bit more detail&lt;/a&gt; in interviews. But it was still hard to gauge what the remake was supposed to accomplish — since compared to remakes of ’90s games &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/25/22301179/system-shock-remake-trailer-demo-release-date"&gt;like &lt;em&gt;System Shock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where designers are updating limited graphics and unfamiliar control schemes, &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt; still feels eminently playable today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhKW0w"&gt;Now, the &lt;em&gt;Dead Space &lt;/em&gt;remake’s developers have helped fill in some of the gaps. Motive held a &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1135081171"&gt;livestreamed Twitch session&lt;/a&gt; with members of the studio’s creative team, showing off extremely early footage demonstrating how the gameplay and level design could work. (We still don’t have a release date.) It confirmed a few things that will set the new game apart — but won’t necessarily transform it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1wPmZ1"&gt;Isaac Clarke will talk, and he’s getting a familiar voice actor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tuvHYI"&gt;The original &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt; starred engineer Isaac Clarke as a silent protagonist, but in the games since then, he’s been distinctively voiced by actor Gunner Wright. Today, Wright appeared on EA’s livestream to confirm that he’s coming back for the remake, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AoqJAd"&gt;Wright’s return makes the &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt; remake sound more like a retroactive continuation of the original series, not a total reimagining of the franchise. EA also clarified that apparently Isaac will follow the same rules for speaking as a polite Victorian child.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot reading “Rules for Isaac’s dialogue. 1: Isaac will primarily only speak when spoken to. 2: Isaac will sometimes speak in a situation where it would feel weird if he remained silent." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OULyzOZUsOYNKxN_p0kDb5v9Ltc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22817855/E_IxKsMWEAIu2sr.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;EA&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3Buc3F"&gt;The second rule presumably exists to let him swear while stomping boxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OT15TI"&gt;Dismemberment is going to be more complicated&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3Sah0F"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/8/31/22650616/the-dead-space-remake-cut-off-their-limbs"&gt;my &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt; colleague Joshua Rivera details&lt;/a&gt;, simulated limb severing technology has advanced substantially since 2008. The livestream featured some very early renderings of the game’s necromorphs, and they seem affected by weapons in more detailed and convincing (these are still space knife zombies getting shot with plasma, so I won’t say “realistic”) ways.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Early Dead Space remake footage of shooting a necromorph" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MphLCTB9iMPgkE7OUb8JuqWyQps=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22818028/Screen_Shot_2021_08_31_at_3.41.58_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;EA&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tJdfwF"&gt;The new system includes limbs whose flesh gets stripped off as you shoot them, helping you gauge how much damage you’ve done. It’s got weak points that feel more organic than the original game’s big glowing joints. It’s got more variety in how a given weapon affects a given necromorph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EOFT2v"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dead Space’s&lt;/em&gt; weapons were already more varied than they sometimes get credit for. (If you go through the original game and &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; the sequel with just the plasma cutter, you’re legitimately missing out.) But the remake is clearly putting effort into meaningfully rebuilding them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vYYfnq"&gt;Zero gravity actually lets you float&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VASCxH"&gt;The livestream’s generally scant in-game footage confirmed one substantial change: &lt;em&gt;Dead Space’s&lt;/em&gt; remake will let you float in zero gravity (like you can in the game’s sequels), rather than having to leap between surfaces with your boots otherwise anchored to the “ground.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YqNW6F"&gt;Like &lt;em&gt;Dead Space’s&lt;/em&gt; original weapons, its zero-G controls arguably get an unfairly bad rap. The levels are designed around jumping, and it’s weirdly satisfying to bounce from wall to wall. But adding free motion is a pretty natural tweak for the remake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8qtRYO"&gt;There are no microtransactions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="T3XSge"&gt;Did we already know EA isn’t bringing the widely hated microtransactions of &lt;em&gt;Dead Space 3&lt;/em&gt; into the &lt;em&gt;Dead Space &lt;/em&gt;remake? &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-remake-no-microtransactions"&gt;Yes&lt;/a&gt;. Was it nice to hear Motive’s developers emphatically repeat that promise today? Obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CDKy0V"&gt;A lore infusion is coming  &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3HwO6m"&gt;Motive and EA previously hinted that they’d build out &lt;em&gt;Dead Space’s&lt;/em&gt; story, and today, they gave more specifics about what that might mean. “We are not going to change the foundation of the story, because that story is really iconic,” said creative director Roman Campos-Oriola. “The things we want to enrich in terms of story or narrative, it’s really about the bigger universe of &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt;. We want to have more ties with what came after, whether it’s the books, whether it’s the anime, whether it’s &lt;em&gt;Dead Space 2&lt;/em&gt;, we want to put the original in a better way inside that broader universe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EcNlyO"&gt;That can apparently be done subtly through the environment, but some additions might be “a bit more,” says Campos-Oriola. &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt; became an extremely lore-heavy series across three main games and a host of tie-in media, and the &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt; remake sounds like it will spend more time acknowledging that lore than changing it. The team didn’t discuss the game’s most beloved Easter egg, but after the livestream, it feels safe to say &lt;a href="https://deadspace.fandom.com/wiki/The_Peng_Treasure"&gt;there’s always Peng&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jv5mRl"&gt;The game aims to flesh out its side characters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mASv43"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt; remake also aims to provide more depth to the characters around Isaac, including Nicole Brennan, the girlfriend that he spends the game looking for. As Campos-Oriola puts it, “we want to give you the means to actually look for her, and more than look for her, learn what happened to her during the outbreak.” That might imply that &lt;em&gt;Dead Space’s&lt;/em&gt; remake will involve a little more active player agency than the highly linear original, or maybe it’s just acknowledging that the original storyline &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; seem to periodically forget Nicole exists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEYEEF"&gt;All the details above are still fairly vague. Motive showed off the remake in ways that highlighted its unfinished-ness, like putting enemies on a stage of untextured blocks, and a lot of the changes were just discussed theoretically. And it remains frustrating to see a new &lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt; game after EA unceremoniously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/17/16491044/ea-visceral-games-shut-down-dead-space-studio-star-wars"&gt;shut down the series’ original studio&lt;/a&gt; Visceral Games. But for now, at least it’s becoming easier to tell what the remake’s creators are aiming at — whether or not they pull it off.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MotorTrend shows off Rivian’s electric adventure truck in detail</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LeUODRLSDiQ7TLxXK81oGQBVxY4=/30x0:3258x2152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69800062/Screen_Shot_2021_08_31_at_2.55.13_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rivian&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1mUm0I"&gt;Rivian’s R1T electric pickup truck is finally set to ship next month after a series of delays — roughly three years after it debuted at the 2018 Los Angeles Auto Show. Ahead of the launch, though, &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/reviews/2022-rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-truck-first-drive-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MotorTrend &lt;/em&gt;got to spend a handful of days&lt;/a&gt; with the all-electric adventure truck, and the team there came away impressed by its performance. What’s more, they offer one of the best looks at the R1T’s interior, which borrows as much from Tesla as it does from other high-end off-road-focused vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbtD4T"&gt;None of this is exactly surprising — Rivian has actually been quite open about the development of the R1T since its debut, regularly posting its own articles, photos, and videos along the way — but the truck features two large, crisp displays on the dashboard, In the preproduction version &lt;em&gt;MotorTrend &lt;/em&gt;tested, those screens were surrounded by a wood-grain dashboard with silver accents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hbgiS"&gt;There are just two physical buttons on the steering wheel, which resemble the scroll wheels Tesla employs in its cars. That means &lt;em&gt;a lot &lt;/em&gt;of the controls are routed through the touchscreen. Some people may not like that, though Tesla has proven that it’s not an approach that will hurt sales. But the R1T is supposed to be just as capable off-road as it is on the highway or city streets, and tapping a touchscreen while rumbling through the woods seems like it could get tricky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CZkCyi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Get ready to use the touchscreen a lot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TrvgPj"&gt;It looks like all of the R1T’s exterior storage compartments can be opened through the touchscreen, like the massive front trunk, the doors to the “gear tunnel” that sits between the cab and the bed, and the tonneau cover. The main touchscreen is also where you’ll be able to toggle between the R1T’s suite of drive modes or adjust the ride height. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DORGSm"&gt;Over the years, Tesla has sort of redefined what “luxury” means in a modern car — or at the very least, it has been able to find buyers who care more about technology and minimalistic design than they do about the kinds of traditional luxury touches found in something like a Mercedes-Benz. Rivian looks like it’s going to try to straddle those two worlds a bit with the R1T, with the added complexity of appealing to buyers who want to use its vehicles in truly rough settings. We won’t know how that plays out until the first customers receive and start using their trucks next month, but &lt;em&gt;MotorTrend &lt;/em&gt;seems to have stumbled on one potentially risky compromise: there are just two cupholders in the front seats.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best wireless gaming headset is slowly driving me up the wall</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9xf9z0Jl91ByIiMIj0j4XdHrzzw=/352x110:1562x917/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69800002/arctis_pro_wl_white_livingroom_wide_4k_001.jpg__1920x1080_q100_crop_fit_optimize_subsampling_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SteelSeries Arctis Pro Wireless.&lt;/em&gt; | Image by Steelseries&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3P3P4X"&gt;If you’re going to make the best product on the market, please go all the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TwBZFN"&gt;Case in point: the SteelSeries Arctis Pro Wireless is one of the best wireless gaming headsets ever made. In 2018, I tested it against every single competitor on the market (&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1YZ4lqpnYIHhoy8IXDHhJMZRXGXcYujI5O1yYFHZcQsE/edit?usp=drive_web&amp;amp;ouid=117898641365769640880"&gt;seriously, all of them&lt;/a&gt;), and none could beat its combination of excellent audio quality, a clear microphone, incredible wireless range, oodles of connectivity, and twin swappable batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIVvuz"&gt;It’s a nearly perfect gadget — but a couple of times a week, that “nearly” part makes me want to scream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAJrC3"&gt;Here’s how I described living with the Arctis Pro Wireless &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22244488/gaming-gear-recommendations-favorite-nintendo-logitech-microsoft"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="xqySSk"&gt;If I’m gaming with buddies and want a snack, I don’t need to stop chatting — I just walk several rooms away to the kitchen and the audio never cuts out. When a too-loud game drowns out my friends, I tap the dial beneath the ear cup to rebalance the audio between “game” and “chat” — it gives you two different audio devices in Windows. When the battery runs out, I can just pop a spare battery pack out of the base station and swap it in under 15 seconds. I make a lot of calls with the Arctis Pro Wireless, too, thanks to its built-in Bluetooth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OJNTH9"&gt;It’s true! There’s just one tiny thing I neglected to mention: the act of keeping it powered on can involve regular embarrassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TmQhVN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Thankfully, my webcam is too noisy to see my reddened cheeks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hz8IA3"&gt;Almost every week, I will inevitably be on a Zoom or Teams or Skype or Slack or Discord call when I’ll hear the dreaded beep — the beep that means the battery is nearly dead. Not “25 percent battery remaining” or “five-minute warning,” mind you. The beep means I probably have 90 seconds to apologize to my conversation partners, grab a freshly charged pack, flick the old one out, pop the new one in, and hold down the power button for what feels like an eternity while frantically gesturing to my boss / colleagues / interviewees to let them know yes I’m okay and I’m terribly sorry for wasting their time but isn’t technology &lt;em&gt;hilarious&lt;/em&gt;? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IDuoo"&gt;(Many &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleagues have witnessed me doing this dance. Miraculously, I have so far escaped without it becoming a meme.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FRJ0P5"&gt;If all goes well, my headset will come back to life, and I’ll pretend it never happened. But as often as not, the embarrassing heat of the moment will lead to even more embarrassment — I’ll press the power button, but the headset &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; won’t turn on because I didn’t press it quite long enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DozqP9L8ONySKYgC6EEgw-iA-pY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22818031/verge_sean_hollister_20210831_steelseries_buttons.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SteelSeries Arctis Pro Wireless’ twin power buttons on the bottom of the right ear cup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DzxBdJ"&gt;You see, the Arctis Pro Wireless has &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; power buttons located right next to each other — one to connect to your PC or console, and one for the Bluetooth radio that lets it connect to your phone. To activate Bluetooth, you only need to briefly tap the button. Like most other Bluetooth headsets, holding it down too long throws the headset into pairing mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFWd80"&gt;But the Arctis Pro Wireless’ primary power button is just the opposite: you &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to hold it to power on. And while the product manual says you only need to hold it down for two seconds, it actually takes 2.25 seconds... and a full 3.5 seconds before you get any audible confirmation that the headset responded to your command.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USzWAD"&gt;That extra second feels like an eternity when you’re miming an “almost ready, be right there!” gesture in Zoom. And sometimes — between that delay and the worry that &lt;em&gt;maybe&lt;/em&gt; I stabbed the Bluetooth button instead of the power button in my haste — I wind up letting go of the button too early and have to repeat the cycle again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqaNWb"&gt;All of this assumes the headset actually warns me that it’s powering itself off, of course! The first few months I used the headset, I never got any warning at all. Turns out, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/steelseries/comments/cpbdp6/arctis_pro_wireless_doesnt_give_audible_warning/ewxip22/?utm_source=reddit&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;if you stop the base station from beeping every time you switch menus&lt;/a&gt;, it turns off the low battery alert as well. And once every month or two, I’ll also experience a sudden loss of power with no warning at all — typically when I’m playing a game or listening to music at low volume. My best guess is that the headset’s auto-power-off function is a poor listener and doesn’t realize I’m still playing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mJaFS4"&gt;Would I get rid of my Arctis Pro Wireless? Not at all. It’s a fantastic gadget I use every day for games, meetings, and calls, even if I wasn’t long past the window for return. I’ve accepted that regular embarrassment is the price I’ll pay. But it’s so tantalizingly close to being worth its $330 price in US dollars as well — which, last I checked, made it the single most expensive wireless gaming headset on the market. If SteelSeries made it slightly more comfortable / adjustable for larger heads, ironed out these power issues, and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/steelseries/search/?q=hinge&amp;amp;restrict_sr=1"&gt;reinforced the hinge&lt;/a&gt;, a future version would be worth every penny. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="weTWrq"&gt;In the meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"&gt;here are the best wireless and wired gaming headsets&lt;/a&gt; we’re actually recommending right now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LinkedIn gives up on Stories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Linkedin Launches 24 Hours Stories" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iSu9bQyFjNyffn2n0iKp7f_OipQ=/0x0:3959x2639/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69799681/1229184225.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Lorenzo Di Cola/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MAlpsN"&gt;LinkedIn is shutting down its ephemeral Stories product, &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/whats-next-linkedin-stories-video-liz-li/"&gt;the company announced Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. The company plans to “remove the current Stories experience by the end of September,” according to Liz Li, senior director of product. The Snapchat-style video Stories were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21156247/linkedin-testing-instagram-stories-feature-social-network-resumes-why"&gt;first launched in February 2020 in internal testing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpKQPI"&gt;Part of the reason for the shutdown is that LinkedIn learned users just didn’t want disappearing video. “In developing Stories, we assumed people wouldn’t want informal videos attached to their profile, and that ephemerality would reduce barriers that people feel about posting,” Li said. “Turns out, you want to create lasting videos that tell your professional story in a more personal way and that showcase both your personality and expertise.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sWAwKB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;LinkedIn’s move follows Twitter’s shutdown of Fleets&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lUiu6Y"&gt;LinkedIn’s move follows Twitter’s shutdown of Fleets, its Stories-like product, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577166/twitter-fleets-shuts-down-stories-clone"&gt;in July&lt;/a&gt;. Like LinkedIn, Twitter observed that users didn’t respond to ephemeral video in the way it had wanted. “We hoped Fleets would help more people feel comfortable joining the conversation on Twitter,” Ilya Brown, Twitter’s vice president of product, &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/goodbye-fleets"&gt;said on Twitter’s blog&lt;/a&gt;. “But, in the time since we introduced Fleets to everyone, we haven’t seen an increase in the number of new people joining the conversation with Fleets like we hoped.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eihKcy"&gt;The two shutdowns could signal a broader pullback from ephemeral video products among social media companies. However, it seems unlikely that Snapchat or Instagram will be giving up on their Stories products anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RJiX4C"&gt;Now we just have to wait and see which social media companies step back from their Clubhouse clones. If you were wondering, yes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22359332/linkedin-clubhouse-clone-social-audio-networking-room"&gt;LinkedIn is working on one of those&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
