    <title>Netflix debuts video from its adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s The Sandman</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pmDE6N"&gt;Netflix debuted &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBXqrBl6pEo"&gt;a video&lt;/a&gt; from its upcoming series based on Neil Gaiman’s DC comic book series &lt;em&gt;The Sandman&lt;/em&gt;. The video was brief, but it gave us a good glimpse at actor Tom Sturridge as Dream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iaiJZt"&gt;The video was shown during Netflix’s Tudum event that took place Saturday. The show also also featured Gaiman, Sturridge, and Kirby Howell-Baptiste (who plays Death) talking about the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qBR7d"&gt;If you want to get another preview of what to expect from the series, check out the character posters Netflix shared for Sturridge’s Dream, Howell-Baptiste’s Death, and Mason Alexander Park’s Desire &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1441813546560630784"&gt;in a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4DXJ3y"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zXvb7Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sandman&lt;/em&gt; has been in development for years, with Netflix picking up the show in 2019 in a deal with Warner Bros., which owns DC Entertainment, that was reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/sandman-tv-series-neil-gaiman-david-goyer-a-go-at-netflix-1220761/"&gt;“massive.”&lt;/a&gt; Earlier this year, Netflix announced &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/01/the-sandman-tom-sturridge-gwendoline-christie-vivienne-acheampong-boyd-holbrook-charles-dance-asim-chaudhry-sanjeev-bhaskar-netflix-neil-gaiman-1234681995/"&gt;some of the cast for the show&lt;/a&gt;, which also includes Vivienne Acheampong as Lucienne and Gwendoline Christie (known for playing Brienne of Tarth in &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; and Captain Phasma in &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;) as Lucifer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="85NuPR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sandman&lt;/em&gt; is just the latest show based on Gaiman’s work. Amazon adapted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18645935/neil-gaiman-interview-good-omens-amazon-adaptation-terry-pratchett-michael-sheen-david-tennant"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good Omens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for Amazon Prime Video, and the show was successful enough that the company opted to pick it up for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555489/good-omens-second-season-amazon-prime-video-neil-gaiman-terry-prachett"&gt;a second season&lt;/a&gt;. Starz made three seasons of &lt;em&gt;American Gods&lt;/em&gt;, the last of which debuted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22233014/american-gods-season-3-premiere-review"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>See inside the iPhone 13 Pro in iFixit’s latest teardown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro is a bit thicker because of a larger battery, so iPhone 12 Pro cases won’t fit." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zPGKdX2GYMScpQ9aCS8Mt6E-oV0=/0x0:2025x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69908059/vpavic_210916_untitled_0027.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;iPhone 13 Pro | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tXl1KP"&gt;The team at iFixit has a new teardown of the iPhone 13 Pro, finding it has an enormous battery and some small internal changes to how the components are laid out to accommodate the smaller notch on this year’s models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4DUVl"&gt;First, the battery. After conducting battery swap tests, on the iPhone 13 Pro, iFixit found its tests succeeded, but still got a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F32343%2Fapple-is-locking-batteries-to-iphones-now&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F25%2F22693123%2Fiphone-13-pro-ifixit-teardown" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;warning notification.&lt;/a&gt; The L-shaped battery echoes the iPhone 12 Pro Max, iFixit notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="HInpUx"&gt;This beefy L caps out at an expected 11.97 Wh compared to the 10.78 Wh obelisk found in the iPhone 12 Pro (and non-Pro), but loses out to the standard’s 12.54 Wh rectangular cell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dWFmkpVEq1xlFSZr_DTup5QPyPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22877335/ifixit_x_ray.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;iFixit/Creative Electron&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;An X-ray image of iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vxtXHE"&gt;iFixit posits that Apple was able to shrink the screen notch partly by moving the earpiece speaker from the back of the display to inside the chassis. It does make replacing the earpiece speaker more difficult, iFixit notes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9XB-bKQOtb76HRX2raPxiZwRDWs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22877338/earpiece_ifixit.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;iFixit&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dxHGY6"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro is sealed with adhesive, like the iPhone 13 and some prior iPhones, and iFixit says the display came off relatively easily. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DByV2eyXDtfHaM5NIlmWAOZOkzA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22877310/ifixit_teardown_iphone_13_pro.png"&gt;

    <title>Stranger Things season 4 gets a new teaser trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8GZ3G6fY4P5gYfpKa-qvgfWhrJY=/160x0:1716x1037/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69908053/Screen_Shot_2021_09_25_at_9.16.11_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fxTVh1"&gt;Netflix debuted a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hgsUzL75Yjk"&gt;new teaser trailer&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; season 4 as part of its Tudum event on Saturday. It opened on a family going into an old-timey house, but in classic &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; fashion, things quickly got spooky and, well, strange. The new season will premiere sometime in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Y7wDy"&gt;The fourth season has been a long time coming. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20683399/stranger-things-season-3-review-duffer-brothers-finn-wolfhard-millie-bobby-brown-david-harbour"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;’ third season&lt;/a&gt; debuted more than two years ago, on July 4th, 2019, so fans have been waiting for quite a while to see what happens next in Netflix’s hit series. (Season 3 was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20692109/stranger-things-3-netflix-nielsen-media-research-hit"&gt;quite popular&lt;/a&gt; — just four days after it launched, Netflix said that 18.2 million accounts had watched the whole season.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVZ6xU"&gt;The company has already shared a few very fleeting hints about what to expect in season 4, though. In February 2020, a teaser revealed that a fan-favorite character &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21137590/netflix-stranger-things-4-trailer-character-teaser-missing-return"&gt;would be returning&lt;/a&gt;. A teaser from May appeared to show &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422642/stranger-things-4-new-trailer-netflix-eleven"&gt;a brief glimpse&lt;/a&gt; of Eleven’s past. And an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612753/netflix-stranger-things-season-four-release-date"&gt;action-packed 30-second teaser&lt;/a&gt; shared in August provided a lot of brief flashes of the new season and gave a non-specific 2022 release window.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly told a TV and movie workers’ union its TV Plus had fewer than 20 million subs </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Apple TV+ (Plus) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xlEbrp2g2zhJqYZb7Ky9Flk9pXg=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69907526/1233058085.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A union for TV workers says Apple claimed its TV Plus streaming service had fewer than 20 million subscribers as of July 1st | Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1qauvj"&gt;Apple told the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) that its Apple TV Plus streaming platform had fewer than 20 million subscribers, which allowed it to pay lower rates to IATSE workers than bigger streaming platforms, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/24/apple-told-a-showbiz-union-it-had-less-than-20-million-tv-subscribers.html"&gt;CNBC reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jynhWz"&gt;Apple has never publicly released subscriber numbers for its streaming network, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20850842/apple-tv-plus-release-date-price-shows-oprah-streaming"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; in November of 2019. But Apple TV Plus has fewer original shows than larger, more established streaming rivals like Netflix, which &lt;a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2021/q2/FINAL-Q2-21-Shareholder-Letter.pdf"&gt;said in August&lt;/a&gt; it had 209 million subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7T5itS"&gt;“Workers on certain ‘new media’ streaming projects get paid less, even on productions with budgets that rival or exceed those of traditionally released blockbusters,” according to a press release IATSE posted on Tuesday. The release didn’t mention any streaming platform by name, but a spokesman told CNBC that Apple claimed under 20 million subscribers in the US and Canada as of July 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HpKP6"&gt;The union is preparing for a possible strike after negotiations with production companies have stalled, saying in the release that “the explosion of streaming combined with the pandemic has elevated and aggravated working conditions, bringing 60,000 behind-the-scenes workers covered by these contracts to a breaking point.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ALLId"&gt;Apple TV Plus has several big-budget shows on its roster, including &lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt;, which stars Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon, and &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;, its surprise hit comedy about an American coaching an English football club. &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; had a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/emmy-awards-2021-list-winners-nominees-11632095321?mod=article_relatedinline"&gt;big showing at the Emmys&lt;/a&gt; last week, taking awards for Outstanding Comedy, Lead Actor in a Comedy for star Jason Sudeikis, and supporting acting awards for Brett Goldstein and Hannah Waddingham. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyu1vc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Morning Show&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/apples-bumpy-tv-launch-inside-tech-giants-impending-arrival-hollywood-1247577/"&gt;reportedly costs Apple $15 million&lt;/a&gt; per episode, and many of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s writers and stars have &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/ted-lasso-pay-raises-season-three-1235011799/"&gt;reportedly negotiated&lt;/a&gt; more lucrative contracts for the show’s third season. Apple said in July that it had a net profit of $21.7 billion on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596120/apple-q3-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"&gt;$81.43 billion in revenue&lt;/a&gt; in its third quarter of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPbyfC"&gt;Apple and IATSE didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday. An Apple spokesperson told CNBC that it pays rates comparable to leading streaming services.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Netflix’s major Tudum event today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yRXM4NJgFQbiY85XuKdTx27ngeI=/285x0:2592x1538/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69907134/Screen_Shot_2021_09_23_at_1.40.26_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fT7BsD"&gt;Netflix is kicking off a massive fan event today. Tudum — named for the ubiquitous chime that plays before Netflix titles — is a global event that will feature a huge slate of news, trailers, celebrity appearances, and more. It’s essentially the Lollapalooza of Netflix news, and anyone hoping to stay ahead of the streamer’s biggest upcoming announcements will definitely want to tune in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DtHsL3"&gt;What is Tudum?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eQgFEa"&gt;Tudum is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641142/netflix-tudum-fan-trailers-interviews-announcements-date-movies-shows"&gt;global mega-event&lt;/a&gt; — the first of its kind for Netflix. It kicks off Saturday and will feature more than 145 celebrities, 70-plus series, and 28 films over the course of several hours. Expect exclusive clips and news for forthcoming titles like &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; The Sandman&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cobra Kai&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt; starring Dwayne Johnson and Ryan Reynolds, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uCdyJF"&gt;Tudum will be available in 29 languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UfR2kQ"&gt;What time is Tudum?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ybMpj7"&gt;The event will kick off at 9AM PT (or 12PM ET for our East Coast readers). The main event will last three hours, but Netflix will also host pre-shows for Korean and Indian films and series, as well as anime programming that will begin at 5AM PT (or 8AM ET). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rMnFCA"&gt;Where can I watch Tudum?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LDEK9d"&gt;Great question! Netflix will stream &lt;a href="https://www.tudum.com/?lang=en"&gt;Tudum&lt;/a&gt; on its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lKgMA0MoY2Y"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; channels worldwide, as well as on &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/netflixus/videos/899218064345155"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/netflix"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflix"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Save $50 on the Nanoleaf Elements wood-styled LED panels</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nanoleaf Elements offer some unique decor, whether illuminated or not.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nanoleaf&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kB12A1"&gt;Kicking things off are the Nanoleaf Elements light-up wall panels, which are currently seeing a nice discount at Best Buy. A seven-piece kit of the hexagon-shaped panels is $50 off right now, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752882625164258609#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bringing them down to $250&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to go beyond seven, you can opt for a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752882728847809246#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three-panel expansion kit for $80&lt;/a&gt; (saving you $20). These panels are customizable, too, and you can connect up to 22 of them in one contiguous pattern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frrzP6"&gt;You may be familiar with the colorful Nanoleaf panels due to their popularity with Twitch streamers and YouTubers, but the Elements promise a more refined look with their wood styling and white illumination, which ranges from cool to warm tones. When turned off, their subtle aesthetic still complements a room while looking less like light panels that have gone out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="m_-3734251510231392608Nimiqt"&gt;Either of those can add some drama to a room or entertainment center, while the starter kit can outfit an entire bedroom and give you easy control with the dimmer.

    <title>How Elizabeth Holmes sidelined the real scientists at Theranos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Zj-xw6GfDSKBGFowX-wWZnezgo=/0x0:4781x3187/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69906352/1341968229.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jane Tyska/Digital First Media/The Mercury News via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;By leaving them off email threads&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="FiQ3pL"&gt;Former Theranos lab director Adam Rosendorff was the second employee who testified in Elizabeth Holmes’ trial who kept his work emails. Forwarding work emails to a personal account can violate a non-disclosure agreement, which Rosendorff signed when he joined the company. But, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680372/elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-emails-gangakhedkar"&gt;Surekha Gangakhedkar&lt;/a&gt; before him, he was worried he’d be blamed for the company’s problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVZJF4"&gt;He was right to worry: he’s one of the people Elizabeth Holmes’ defense is trying to blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ElyIGK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The company was more about PR and fundraising than patient care.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="erCXly"&gt;In opening arguments of US v Elizabeth Holmes, the defense agreed there were problems in Theranos’ lab. But Lance Wade, Holmes’ attorney, said that problems in the clinical lab were ultimately the responsibility of the lab director. And besides, that lab director reported to Holmes’ co-defendant, Sunny Balwani, who is being tried separately. They face 10 counts of wire fraud and two counts of conspiracy to commit wire fraud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mluaic"&gt;Today’s testimony was about bad Theranos tests. A lot of new emails were introduced, showing Holmes was aware of the company’s problems, and was even actively trying to manage the situation. Several times in those emails, Rosendorff tried to get Theranos labs to run FDA-approved tests instead of the ones Theranos developed. But maybe even more telling were the emails that Rosendorff was excluded from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3ZPHj"&gt;Rosendorff didn’t mince words when he took the witness stand. He quit because of many things, he said. “One was the unwillingness of management to perform proficiency testing as required by law, I felt pressured to vouch for tests I did not have confidence in.” That wasn’t all. He came to believe “the company was more about PR and fundraising than patient care,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpnXpy"&gt;When he first joined Theranos in April 2013, Rosendorff thought Theranos might be the next Apple. But the sheen wore off the company quickly — and he began looking for other jobs by that summer. In August, before Theranos’ launch in patients, the clinical lab was “anxious” about testing real people, he said; the pace around the launch “extremely rushed and hurried.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VM23Yt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Raising alarm bells”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="35adBP"&gt;On August 31, 2013, Elizabeth Holmes sent a 1AM email asking for an update on how many tests had completed validation. An employee wrote back that none of them had. The launch was scheduled for September 9th, 2013, and the schedule came from Holmes and Balwani, Rosendorff said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gjsvt4"&gt;Increasingly worried, he tried to stall it. He was “raising alarm bells.” In an email a little more than a week before the scheduled launch, Rosendorff wrote to Holmes and Balwani raising concerns about some of the tests. He also thought the lab needed more staff with better training.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bqdzoX"&gt;He needed “a few more weeks to sort through these medical and logistical issues,” he wrote in the email. That would mean delaying bringing Theranos’ tests to patients. He even met with Holmes about his concerns, because he felt Balwani wasn’t taking him seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWvsXR"&gt;During that meeting Rosendorff described Holmes as “very nervous.” “She was not her usual composed self. She was trembling a little bit,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XuTTm"&gt;Despite Rosendorff’s concerns, the launch went ahead as planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="oaKHg0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Theranos devices “failed so frequently it raised doubts in my mind regarding the accuracy of the tests themselves.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xUWsGJ"&gt;Some of his testimony corroborated what previous Theranos employees had said. He echoed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674657/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-wire-fraud-financial-witness"&gt;Erika Cheung’s concerns about removing outliers&lt;/a&gt; from Theranos data. As both Cheung and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680372/elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-emails-gangakhedkar"&gt;Gangakhedkar&lt;/a&gt; testified, the Edison machines frequently failed quality control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gb0nJ5"&gt;While a quarter of Theranos’ devices routinely failed quality control, failures of commercially-available tech was far less frequent. Theranos devices “failed so frequently it raised doubts in my mind regarding the accuracy of the tests themselves,” Rosendorff said. He emailed Balwani about the failure rates, who wrote back, “Adam. This is not the case.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5eN5H"&gt;Normally lab directors deal with doctors who have concerns about lab results — this was part of Rosendorff’s job at his previous employer, the University of Pittsburgh. But Theranos installed Holmes’ brother, Christian, as a liaison for complaints. Rosendorff said he was pressured to come up with explanations about bad results that didn’t call into question the tests themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5TDRB"&gt;But the tests were bad. In the case of a key pregnancy hormone — one that we heard testimony about from&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22687026/theranos-patient-bad-test-miscarriage-pregnancy"&gt; a patient who was wrongly told she was miscarrying&lt;/a&gt; — Rosendorff sent an all-caps email to his staff in May 2014 telling them that all future tests were to be run on an FDA-approved device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="cxboS6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A complete mess”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nQqoGc"&gt;This didn’t happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oaSCAX"&gt;In fact, there was a June 2014 email chain where Christian Holmes wrote his sister, CCing Balwani, that the test was “causing serious complaints and patient issues.” Additionally, the lab was “a complete mess.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70Qz2H"&gt;Holmes wrote back that she’d connect with her brother, then added, “Sunny / this is already handled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uSxFV"&gt;There are a few notable things about the exchange. First, it demolishes the idea that Holmes could have been misled about the state of the clinical lab and its tests. Second, it shows her clearly taking charge of the situation, even telling Balwani to stand down. But third, it’s remarkable for who’s missing from the chain: Rosendorff, who may not have even been aware that his instruction to use FDA-cleared devices &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; was ignored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3kybhb"&gt;The first time he saw those emails was in court, he said. It was not the only set of emails about patient complaints we saw where Rosendorff wasn’t included, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="P3xRFA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The test has lost any diagnostic value.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FcQlOd"&gt;In February of 2014, Rosendorff also tried to convince the company to stop running its HDL  (“good”) cholesterol test on Theranos devices. He sent an email to Balwani and added Holmes, because he thought Balwani wasn’t listening to him. “I got a lot of pushback” for suggesting the lab use approved devices, Rosendorff said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmQnzB"&gt;That pushback came from Holmes, Balwani, and VP Daniel Young, he testified. And though Young didn’t have a medical degree, he often offered suggestions about what was “really” wrong with tests, Rosendorff said. Through his testimony, Rosendorff generally talked about Young in a tone that suggested he loathed the VP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fpHtLH"&gt;The problems in the lab were widespread, Rosendorff testified, pointing to tests of bicarbonate, and an email where he pointed out that two-thirds of patients were reading below the normal range. “The test has lost any diagnostic value,” he emailed in September 2014&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4Zkoq8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I am not sure what to do with these lab results????”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dbQhUV"&gt;But Theranos wasn’t honest with physicians or providers about this. Instead, customer service representatives were instructed to say that the results “were not reported due to temporary unavailability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vtIOHL"&gt;Another email from a healthcare provider said it didn’t realize Theranos’ methods weren’t FDA-approved, and complained about testosterone and blood sugar tests. “I am not sure what to do with these lab results????” the email read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvlHx7"&gt;Part of the problem was that all the validation studies had been done on venous blood, Rosendorff testified. See, to get enough fingerprick blood to run all the studies, you’d need to prick every finger on the patient — so as a matter of convenience, venous blood was drawn. But if you draw blood from fingerpricks, you’re far more likely to destroy red blood cells in the process, leading to faulty readings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4InyxK"&gt;Among the bad tests was one for sodium, potassium, and chloride, called ISE. Young, who was a statistician, not a doctor, suggested the faulty results for this test was because of the red blood cells breaking apart, and urged a visual examination of the blood to confirm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="wrstfW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This bad assay had been used on patients since September 2013. In June 2014, there were still problems with the tests.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zC31Kc"&gt;This was bad for several reasons. First of all, the FDA-approved machines detected this immediately, not after a weird reading. Second, evidence of broken red blood cells wasn’t always obvious to the eye, Rosendorff testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EYGbQv"&gt;This bad assay had been used on patients since September 2013. In June 2014, there were still problems with the tests, and Young’s suggested fixes, including a “bias-correction” method, still weren’t working. So Theranos voided tests that fell above and below accepted values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p5dd39"&gt;That was a problem, too. We saw an email from a doctor dated October 27th, 2014, addressed to a customer service rep. The patient had low sodium levels — which was why the test had been ordered. A customer service rep emailed Rosendorff saying, “Is it possible that that was the value? If she comes in again, and the value is still critical low, will it be voided again?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYz8re"&gt;Rosendorff forwarded this email to Balwani and Holmes, writing, “I’m not sure of a clinical value of a sodium assay in which the only time we can report it is when it is not critical and the very situations that require accurate measurement and reporting of abnormal sodium results are voided.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FCwAg6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s pretty obvious we have issues with calcium, potassium, and sodium.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N3NMGN"&gt;Calcium testing, too, was bad. “Are there any findings we can relay about high trends in calcium reporting?” Christian Holmes wrote to Young and Balwani. “Seems to be by far the majority of questions we get about accuracy now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AkjEFW"&gt;He then forwarded this to his sister. “It’s pretty obvious we have issues with calcium, potassium, and sodium, specifically,” he wrote. “Obviously I can’t tell them we are wrong, but they continue to send patients to Quest [another blood-testing company] after we report high, and the results continue to come back normal.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9b9zRE"&gt;Rosendorff wasn’t included on this chain, and took issue with “specifically.” There were lots of problems with other tests, he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C42Wab"&gt;“I didn’t believe at this point that Theranos could solve these problems,” Rosendorff testified. He began avoiding speaking to doctors, and told one or two physicians that he didn’t trust the results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xrZpu"&gt;All of this is bad for Holmes  — not only is she aware of the problems, she’s calling the shots. But her defense hinted at what the cross-examination of Rosendorff may bring. One of his subsequent employers was also investigated by the federal authorities, as well as another company that was subject to a justice department probe. (We found this out before the jury was allowed in the courtroom.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="cds0js"&gt;It’s not clear that Rosendorff’s post-Theranos employment will be deemed relevant to the current case — the jury may hear nothing about this. But the defense will certainly have some work to do. Though Rosendorff’s testimony was much more technical than that of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22689083/elizabeth-holmes-trial-james-mattis-testimony-theranos-fraud"&gt;board member James Mattis yesterday,&lt;/a&gt; it was possibly even worse for Holmes. If she’s trying to convince the jury that any fraud was mostly Balwani’s fault, she’s going to have to explain the ample evidence she was giving marching orders.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says an issue is preventing some animations from using high refresh rates on the iPhone 13 Pros</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max keep the major redesigns introduced last year — they still feel fresh and modern." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qE7KKhm4BbsB-hqoA8GkQQwKWzo=/0x0:1995x1330/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69906241/vpavic_210916_untitled_0031.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aSCxYB"&gt;Apple’s iPhone 13 lineup launched Friday, and one of the key features of the 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max are their ProMotion displays with variable refresh rates that can top out at 120Hz. But &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/24/iphone-13-promotion-third-party-apps/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, some app animations in third-party apps are currently only running at 60Hz. That might be frustrating if you were expecting to see buttery-smooth animations across all of your apps with the new phones, but when we asked Apple what was going on, the company shared two reasons why this might be happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McbI7i"&gt;One reason is that developers will need to update their apps to declare that they use the higher refresh rate. This can be done by adding an entry to the app’s plist, Apple tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and the company says it plans to share documentation about the entry you need to add soon. But in some cases, animations built with the company’s Core Animation technology are also affected by an issue that will be fixed in an upcoming software update, Apple says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3q9Uz"&gt;Variable refresh rate screens offer a lot of benefits, including smoother animations and scrolling when you’re using the device and battery savings the screen runs at lower refresh rates. We were impressed with the screens on the 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;in our review&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s good to hear that third party apps will be able to take full advantage of what they have to offer — though some may have to wait until after that software update.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix queues up a roguelike PC game to go with its action movie Kate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Kate: Collateral Damage" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vYqNg8SfnbM5EaMSdMOJa4jhzwg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69905778/FAESDXVVEAgLmmT.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Kate: Collateral Damage | Image: Ludic Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Uz6WjG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kate: Collateral Damage&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the first gaming tie-in we’ve seen for a Netflix original, but now that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585802/netflix-gaming-mobile-subscription-earnings"&gt;seriously entering the space&lt;/a&gt;, each title feels a little different. Developed by Ludic Studios, the new game is a “time-attack action roguelike” that relates to the movie &lt;em&gt;Kate&lt;/em&gt;, a Netflix movie starring Mary Elizabeth Winstead about an assassin who has 24 hours to find the antidote to a poison that is killing her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1jvIN"&gt;The plot of the movie makes the game’s time attack approach easy to understand as players take over the central character on her quest. As its &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623000/Kate_Collateral_Damage/"&gt;Steam description&lt;/a&gt; reveals, players extend the length of each run by killing enemies to slow down the constantly depleting timer, and earning stimulant syringes that reset it entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PP6DJN"&gt;The movie’s plot also comes into play through your hostage-turned-companion Ani and its grimy neon-lit atmosphere. Unlike an earlier Ludic Studios game, &lt;em&gt;Akane&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kate: Collateral Damage&lt;/em&gt; leans into a &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;⁄&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; view, but comparing their trailers shows why the Brazilian developer was a good match for the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZsD8xB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5a_AvatAd7s?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oxZClF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kate: Collateral Damage&lt;/em&gt; is scheduled for release via Steam on October 22nd. There’s no pricing listed, but it doesn’t look like this game is tied to your subscription &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585802/netflix-gaming-mobile-subscription-earnings"&gt;like the ones Netflix is testing on Android&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, like the Eden Unearthed App Lab that &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Fquest%2F3632378823549307%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently popped up on Oculus VR&lt;/a&gt;, this has the feel of a marketing tie-in that could help &lt;em&gt;Kate &lt;/em&gt;stand out among a slew of &lt;em&gt;John Wick&lt;/em&gt;-like action movies with female leads that have popped up lately. Maybe we’ll find out more during the streamer’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641142/netflix-tudum-fan-trailers-interviews-announcements-date-movies-shows"&gt;Tudum fan event this weekend&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter says new videos will be less pixelated</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter’s blue bird silhouette logo on a black background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/33wiyGe-HoR2R0mu_kerGv5-pi0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69905758/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4R41TM"&gt;Twitter’s poor video quality has been a long-running frustration for users on the platform, but on Friday, the company shared some potentially promising news: videos uploaded to the service will now “appear less pixelated for a better watching experience,” Twitter said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1441475693863391232"&gt;in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; from its support account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gs4VkS"&gt;Twitter removed a pre-processing step in its video pipeline when you upload, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; After we published this article, the company clarified that this removed step split videos into smaller chunks for ingestion, which could reduce quality because of the additional processing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U1JW3I"&gt;App researcher Jane Manchun Wong &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1441488893778415616"&gt;uploaded a video&lt;/a&gt; intended to put the supposed improvements to the test. (The sound on this video is a little loud, so you might want to turn down your volume before you watch it.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ddrzRL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;less pixelated videos huh. let’s see...&lt;a href="https://t.co/b6SBDnLnsc"&gt;https://t.co/b6SBDnLnsc&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/TrlZQJHSH0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/TrlZQJHSH0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1441488893778415616?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iwZrAA"&gt;While it might appear better — and it did, in my eyes — Twitter told us after we first published this that the changes announced Friday aren’t yet supported in Twitter Media Studio, which is what Wong used to upload the video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Nr16Y"&gt;If you want to see a video that Twitter says &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; use the improved video quality, check out the video &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/erinbeess/status/1441489334901878787"&gt;in this reply to Wong&lt;/a&gt; (which, I should warn you, is also loud).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V2NgY8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;u wanna go &lt;a href="https://t.co/UVuZJZkHvX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/UVuZJZkHvX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— erin | sigh.eth (@erinbeess) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/erinbeess/status/1441489334901878787?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jeyxb2"&gt;This second video does seem somewhat improved, but it’s hard to tell exactly by how much with the mostly-black background. Both videos are clearly not as crisp as a high-quality video that you might watch on YouTube or Twitch, though. And this upgrade only applies to newly-uploaded videos, so older videos won’t see the improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFw6Oy"&gt;That said, it’s promising to see that Twitter is putting some effort into improving its video experience. And the upgrades may extend past video quality, as earlier this week, Wong’s research suggested that Twitter is also working on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1440094616980578306"&gt;video playback speed options&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XRLFEG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter is working on video playback speed options &lt;a href="https://t.co/5PH9lQPSfj"&gt;pic.twitter.com/5PH9lQPSfj&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jane Manchun Wong (@wongmjane) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wongmjane/status/1440094616980578306?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GpAYcF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 24th, 8:33PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added additional detail from Twitter and a second video that the company says takes advantage of the video improvements.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
