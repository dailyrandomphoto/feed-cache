    <title>Uber aims for 50,000 Teslas on its platform by 2023</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3nTKpJ"&gt;Uber is acquiring 50,000 Tesla vehicles to rent to its drivers as part of an ambitious plan to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427196/uber-promise-100-percent-electric-vehicle-ev-2030"&gt;electrify its fleet in the US by 2030&lt;/a&gt;. The ride-hailing company is working with rental car company Hertz, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744504/hertz-tesla-order-100000-vehicles-electrify-fleet"&gt;announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that it had ordered 100,000 Teslas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2SxyM"&gt;The move comes as car companies and transportation providers around the world are coming under regulatory pressure to phase out gas-powered vehicles in favor of those that produce zero emissions. California, the largest auto market in the US, set in place rules for ride-hailing companies like Uber and Lyft, requiring that 90 percent of their fleets be electric by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V7Sn5T"&gt;Uber has long offered discounts on car rentals to drivers who don’t own their own vehicle, with Uber and Hertz working together on such a program since 2016. But they have never collaborated to rent out one specific vehicle to drivers until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KTToV9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Uber drivers will pay $334 a week to rent a Tesla Model 3 from Hertz&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bq22S1"&gt;Starting November 1st, Uber drivers who live in Los Angeles, San Francisco, San Diego, and Washington, DC can rent a Tesla Model 3 through Hertz at a rate of $334 a week, including maintenance and insurance. The weekly rate will fall to $299 or lower as the program gets underway, Uber says. And the program will expand nationwide in the weeks to come — with the goal of having all 50,000 Teslas on Uber’s platform by 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKx7Ar"&gt;It may be difficult to attract drivers to the program with a weekly rate of $334, but Uber is confident that drivers will see the benefit in fuel savings and less maintenance. Also, drivers who use hybrid or electric vehicles to pick up passengers receive an extra 50 cents per ride, while drivers using specifically battery-electric vehicles get another dollar on top of that — for a total of $1.50 extra per ride. The average weekly cost for a Hertz rental car ranges from about $150 up to about $325, &lt;a href="https://www.autos.com/car-rentals/average-weekly-cost-of-a-hertz-rental-car"&gt;according to Autos.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5pmvT"&gt;Initially, drivers must have at least a 4.7-star rating and have completed at least 150 trips to be eligible to rent a Tesla. For recharging, drivers will have access to Tesla’s Supercharger network, as well as discounts at participating EVgo charging stations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ccRiyQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Uber pledges to shift to ‘100 percent’ electric vehicles by 2030","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427196/uber-promise-100-percent-electric-vehicle-ev-2030"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VOHlpX"&gt;Last year, Uber made the ambitious pledge to go “100 percent electric” by 2030 in the US, Canada, and Europe and by 2040 for the rest of the world. The company also said it would spend $800 million to help “hundreds of thousands of drivers in the US, Canada, and Europe transition to battery EVs by 2025” — though a spokesperson wouldn’t disclose the financial aspects of the company’s deal with Hertz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PT4Tnu"&gt;Uber’s track record with car rentals and leases isn’t exactly spotless. The company &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1125601/uber-has-ended-its-subprime-car-leasing-program-for-new-york-drivers/"&gt;shuttered a subprime auto lending program&lt;/a&gt; after drivers complained about racking up debt to pay exorbitant rates. Uber notes that this new program is designed to appeal to drivers who rent specifically, not get drivers to switch from owning to renting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFa24B"&gt;Ride-hailing was originally pitched to the public as a more environmentally friendly way to get around compared to private car ownership. But it turns out the opposite was true. Numerous studies have shown that the &lt;a href="https://blog.ucsusa.org/don-anair/electrifying-ride-hailing-part-1-six-reasons-why-uber-and-lyft-must-go-electric"&gt;average ride-hailing trip creates about 50 percent more pollution than the average traditional car trip&lt;/a&gt;. Even worse, over half of all ride-hailing trips in major cities are made by people who would have &lt;a href="http://www.schallerconsult.com/rideservices/automobility.htm"&gt;otherwise used cleaner means of transit to get to their destination&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AGHTYv"&gt;Today, however, fewer than 1 percent of ride-hailing vehicles in the US are electric, &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/california-sets-green-car-goals-for-ride-hailers-like-lyft-uber"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The auto industry is in the midst of a massive transition to electric vehicles, even though EVs still only compromise less than 5 percent of annual sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qvZ1ic"&gt;Uber isn’t the first company to use Teslas as a ride-hailing vehicle. Earlier this year, moped rental company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22405539/revel-ride-share-nyc-tesla-model-y-moped-uber"&gt;Revel announced its own Uber-esque ride-hailing service&lt;/a&gt; in New York City with 50 bright blue Tesla Model Y vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Police arrest 150 suspects after closure of dark web’s largest illegal marketplace</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1tZias3x7qmEwb3zjxZisjCga7E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70050887/acastro_180109_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fcshw6"&gt;A 10-month investigation following the closure of the dark web’s largest illegal marketplace, DarkMarket, has resulted in the arrest of 150 suspected drug vendors and buyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSF4DU"&gt;DarkMarket was taken offline &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227929/darkmarket-shutdown-europol-worlds-largest-illegal-marketplace"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; as part of an international operation. The site boasted some 500,000 users and facilitated around 320,000 transactions, reports the EU’s law enforcement agency, Europol, with clientele buying and selling everything from malware and stolen credit card information, to weapons and drugs. When German authorities arrested the site’s alleged operator in January this year, they also seized valuable evidence of transactions which led to this week’s arrest of key players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DChyqU"&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-law-enforcement-operation-targeting-opioid-traffickers-darknet-results-150"&gt;US Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/150-arrested-in-dark-web-drug-bust-police-seize-%E2%82%AC26-million"&gt;Europol&lt;/a&gt;, Operation Dark HunTor saw law enforcement make numerous arrests in the United States (65), Germany (47), the United Kingdom (24), Italy (4), the Netherlands (4), France, (3), Switzerland (2), and Bulgaria (1). More than $31.6 million in cash and cryptocurrencies were seized during the arrests, as well 45 firearms and roughly 234 kilograms of drugs including cocaine, opioids, amphetamine, MDMA, and fentanyl. According to the DoJ: “A number of investigations are still ongoing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tggEmu"&gt;As part of the operation, Italian authorities also shut down two other dark web marketplaces — DeepSea and Berlusconi — arresting four alleged administrators and seizing €3.6 million ($4.17 million) in cryptocurrency. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BJXxBBoYynM15_64l-m264yxI1Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22959037/darkhuntor_social_media_map.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Europol&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The operation was conducted across the US, Europe, and Australia.  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UtvYr9"&gt;Although the dark web was once considered to be a relatively safe haven for those selling and buying drugs, international operations like Dark HunTor have seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/17/18226718/alphabay-takedown-drug-marketplace-federal-arrest"&gt;regular arrests of suspects and speedy closure of marketplaces&lt;/a&gt;. The list of dark web markets closed just in recent years is extensive, including Dream, WallStreet, White House, DeepSea, and Dark Market. Although law enforcement certainly have to play Whac-A-Mole with such sites, with new markets springing up as soon as established ones are closed, doing so makes it harder for buyers and sellers to build steady businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VTvI3"&gt;“The point of operations such as the one today is to put criminals operating on the dark web on notice: the law enforcement community has the means and global partnerships to unmask them and hold them accountable for their illegal activities, even in areas of the dark web,” said Europol’s Deputy Executive Director of Operations, Jean-Philippe Lecouffe, in a &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/international-law-enforcement-operation-targeting-opioid-traffickers-darknet-results-150"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how to get the Google Play Store running on Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oAeQobD1JWnJusncAuCgFIr_MP0=/0x0:2880x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70050875/Hdh35Ti.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Play Store running on Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AOm0Dj"&gt;A developer and design student has managed to get the Google Play Store working on Windows 11. Google’s Android app store is fully functional within Windows 11 using this method, allowing you to install a game or app and run it alongside traditional Windows apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tCVfpn"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22737102/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-feature-hands-on"&gt;started testing Windows 11 Android app support&lt;/a&gt; last week, but the official implementation is limited to the Amazon Appstore and less than 50 apps during the preview phase. Getting the Google Play Store installed opens Windows 11 up to every Android app or game you’d want to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQbJkp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ADeltaXForce"&gt;ADeltaX&lt;/a&gt;, an Italian UX design student, has successfully installed the Google Play Store on Windows 11, and detailed all the steps required to get it working. If you’re not familiar with Linux commands or command prompts, then the install process won’t be the most straightforward, but ADeltaX &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIt00xDp0tM"&gt;has created a video guide&lt;/a&gt; for those who really want to get this running.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1MbraUscY8eA6o1PTn0OJm5zwhA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22959042/aAxYUbo.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gmail Android app running alongside a mobile Android game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QNZ6wk"&gt;I managed to get the Google Play Store up and running on Windows 11 in about 30 minutes, after downloading all the necessary tools, enabling the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), and installing Ubuntu. The result is a fully functional Play Store that you can use to install any Android app on Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPVrLm"&gt;The full instructions for the install process are &lt;a href="https://github.com/ADeltaX/WSAGAScript"&gt;available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, or through the YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIt00xDp0tM"&gt;walkthrough video&lt;/a&gt;. We’re expecting Microsoft to make the Windows Subsystem for Android available to all Windows 11 users in the coming months, alongside Amazon Appstore support.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify expects to have over 400M users by the end of the year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6i3rDyGYPtbolEPJ6WhFZMW-stA=/1x0:1888x1258/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70050857/VSQGmW0.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An infographic released by the company.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G3VsMd"&gt;Spotify now has 172 million paid subscribers and 381 million monthly active users, the &lt;a href="https://investors.spotify.com/financials/press-release-details/2021/Spotify-Technology-S.A.-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Third-Quarter-2021/default.aspx"&gt;company announced today&lt;/a&gt; in its latest earnings release. That’s up from 165 million paid subscribers and 365 million monthly active users last quarter, with both figures up 19 percent year-over-year. Those are in line with what Spotify was expecting this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5t3DO1"&gt;The growth means that Spotify continues to be the biggest music streaming service in the world. Although competitors Amazon Music and Apple Music don’t regularly release subscriber numbers, figures &lt;a href="https://musically.com/2020/07/28/spotify-apple-how-many-users-big-music-streaming-services/"&gt;compiled by &lt;em&gt;Music Ally&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;put their subscriber counts at around 55 million and 60 million respectively. By the end of the year, Spotify expects to have in excess of 400 million monthly active users, and over 177 million premium subscribers, which is in line with previous projections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkA2pm"&gt;Notably, this quarter saw Spotify’s average revenue per user increase to €4.34 (around $5.03), which is up from €4.29 (around $4.98) last quarter, and represents an increase of 4 percent year-over-year. Overall the company made a profit of €2 million up from a loss of €101 million in the same quarter the previous year. Both are relatively unusual for Spotify, given its emphasis on growth rather than quarterly profit or revenue. Average revenue per user has been helped by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403813/spotify-price-increase-subscriptions-2021"&gt;price increases from the company&lt;/a&gt; over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GF6fF4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We became the #1 platform for podcasts that U.S. listeners use the most, according to Edison Research and our own internal data; we launched podcasts in additional markets and more. Find more information about &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24SPOT&amp;amp;src=ctag&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;$SPOT&lt;/a&gt; Q3 2021 here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/BV6CqbCLC3"&gt;https://t.co/BV6CqbCLC3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Xa7DgYh4Qu"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Xa7DgYh4Qu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Spotify News (@SpotifyNews) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpotifyNews/status/1453308074538721290?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x29YxJ"&gt;Earnings were buoyed by growth in podcast advertising, rising from 10 to 13 percent of total revenue, according to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-ad-business-boosted-by-podcasts-11635328801"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Spotify says that the amount of its users engaging with podcasts is accelerating, and that podcast share of overall consumption hours reached an “all-time high” this quarter. The amount of podcasts on the platform now sits at 3.2 million, up from 2.9 million at the end of the previous quarter. Spotify boasts that it’s now the “number one platform for podcasts that US listeners use the most,” citing its own data and a report from Edison Research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNOsmn"&gt;The figures come at the end of a relatively quiet quarter for Spotify, which hasn’t been marked by any major acquisitions or launches. There’s also still no sign of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;Spotify HiFi&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s new CD-quality streaming tier announced in February that’s supposed to launch by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgFPxE"&gt;Instead the company has made more minor tweaks to its service this quarter, like widely rolling out the ability for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22701219/spotify-interactive-podcast-polls-question-answer-feature-launch-anchor"&gt;podcasters to add interactive polls and Q&amp;amp;A’s to their shows&lt;/a&gt;, releasing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638628/spotify-offline-playback-wear-os-now-rolling-out"&gt;Wear OS app with support for offline playback&lt;/a&gt;, and adding a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664655/spotify-enhance-feature-recommended-songs-playlists"&gt;new “Enhance” feature&lt;/a&gt; that automatically adds songs to users’ pre-existing playlists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oeWjXF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 27th, 6:39AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added tweet from Spotify claiming it’s now the number one podcasting platform in the US.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTpNkO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XdyoVJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oy6tA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now ask Google to remove images of under-18s from its search results</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06Y4BMIHxGCyne6lHxoNneskq4o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70050740/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VAwTSr"&gt;Google has launched a new safety feature that lets under-18s request the removal of images of themselves from the company’s search results. The feature was originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617976/google-children-ad-targeting-youtube-default-privacy-safesearch"&gt;announced in August&lt;/a&gt; (along with new restrictions of ad targeting of minors) but is now widely available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ia2pIe"&gt;Anyone can start the removal process from &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/10949130?hl=en"&gt;this help page&lt;/a&gt;. Applicants will need to supply the URLs of images they want removed from search results, the search terms that surface those images, the name and age of the minor, and the name and relationship of the individual that might be acting on their behalf — a parent or guardian, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5RfO9s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google will make exceptions for “cases of compelling public interest or newsworthiness”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l59Xr6"&gt;As ever with these sorts of removal requests, it’s hard to say exactly what criteria Google will be applying in its judgements. The company notes it will remove images of any minors “with the exception of cases of compelling public interest or newsworthiness.” Interpreting how these terms apply in different situations is difficult territory, as we’ve seen with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/22/18192626/eu-right-to-be-forgotten-dutch-surgeon-medical-negligence"&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/right-to-be-forgotten"&gt;cases&lt;/a&gt; involving the EU’s “right to be forgotten” law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aiTbRf"&gt;It also seems from Google’s language that it won’t comply with requests unless the person in the image is &lt;em&gt;currently&lt;/em&gt; under 18. So, if you’re 30, you can’t apply to remove pictures of you when you were 15. That limits the scope of the tool to prevent abuse or harassment, but it presumably makes the process of verification much easier. It’s hard to prove what age you are in any given photo as opposed to proving how old you are right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zy5FMD"&gt;Google also stresses that removing an image from its search results does not, of course, remove it from the web. The company encourages those going through the application process to contact the webmaster directly. Though in cases where doing so has been unsuccessful, removing information from Google’s index is certainly the next best thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epAesN"&gt;In addition to these new removal options for images of minors, Google already offers other avenues for requesting the removal of &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/troubleshooter/3111061?hl=en"&gt;specific types of harmful content&lt;/a&gt;. These include non-consensual explicit imagery, fake pornography, financial or medical information, and “doxxing” information including home addresses and phone numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11’s new Microsoft Store is now available for Windows 10 testers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IT_jI5F9yqhZtzn_Vt_VWxxwoMk=/60x0:1860x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70050736/windows11store.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Windows 11 store running on Windows 10.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Rudy Huyn (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/RudyHuyn/status/1453248154183286796/photo/1" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QgCOV4"&gt;Microsoft is close to releasing Windows 11’s new Microsoft Store for Windows 10 users. The software maker has now released this new app store to Windows 10 testers in the Release Preview ring, alongside a final version of the upcoming &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/10/21/preparing-the-windows-10-november-2021-update-for-release/"&gt;Windows 10 November 2021 Update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3iSBZ"&gt;The updated Store is identical to the one found on Windows 11, offering greater access to win32 apps, a more modern design, and all of the new apps that have made their way into Microsoft’s store recently. This new Microsoft Store is also more open that before, allowing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698196/microsoft-store-third-party-app-stores-epic-games-amazon"&gt;third-party stores&lt;/a&gt; like the Epic Games Store to be listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pzv6dO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Exciting news today, the new &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MicrosoftStore?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MicrosoftStore&lt;/a&gt; (modern design, support for win32 apps, Disney+ movies and way more) is now available to Windows 10 Insiders! &lt;a href="https://t.co/O9zSZ8pudp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/O9zSZ8pudp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rudy Huyn (@RudyHuyn) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RudyHuyn/status/1453248154183286796?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8YUAvl"&gt;Microsoft’s new approach to its Store has also meant a deluge of apps have finally arrived, including Discord, Zoom, VLC, TeamViewer, and Visual Studio Code. Any browser can also be listed in the store now, and so far Opera and the Yandex Browser are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVENB6"&gt;If you want to test the new Microsoft Store on Windows 10 you’ll need to be on the Release Preview Insider ring. We’re expecting the new Store update to arrive for all Windows 10 users in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro will arrive with a day-one update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wpk4c4JfW3PHhZKTdttIMKn8QzM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70050227/bfarsace_211014_4802_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KAHsOx"&gt;Assuming you managed to order a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, then you should know that once the phone is in your possession, you’ll need a little extra time to get everything set up and working. That’s because, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/132599975/update-your-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-to-the-latest-software-to-get-all-the-features"&gt;as a post on the Google support forums points out&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/26/pixel-6-day-one-update/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), there is a software update to install. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rqmypE"&gt;The post indicates you’ll need it to get all of the features, although it’s unclear what would be missing if you simply started using the phone without it other than the November security update. According to Google, the build number is the same for both phones, and it should display SD1A.210817.036 or SD1A.210817.036.A8 for Verizon customers. If your phone arrives early, then the update might not available at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBbf5b"&gt;According to our team, all the review units are running the same build present after the device installs its day-one update, so any impressions you see here or elsewhere are using the same software. For a device that must be connected to a network, this approach isn’t surprising — it allows production to ramp up even as the launch software is finalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ikbi0b"&gt;The day-one update installs after you complete your device setup, and Google says it can take about 25 - 50 minutes to download and install in the background. The Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are scheduled to start shipping on October 28th, so first-hand experiences with the update (and our reviews of both phones) aren’t far away.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Theranos FOMO kept the DeVos family from doing its investment homework</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes Attends Criminal Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pg_h7SRn4TWLtv5gHu6SpNMuuw8=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70050146/1235841569.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The family office took Elizabeth Holmes at her word&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="0rZcRt"&gt;Theranos said a lot of things to Lisa Peterson that made the company seem credible when she evaluated it on behalf of the crazy-wealthy DeVos family. One of the things that stood out as a reason to trust Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes? Its devices didn’t need FDA approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfHrWj"&gt;That made it seem more credible that the machines worked, said Peterson, who works on investments for the DeVos clan (including former secretary of education Betsy DeVos), and who testified today during &lt;em&gt;US v. Elizabeth Holmes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="F9pVVG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The DeVos’ approach to Theranos seemed to be more about shiny things and FOMO&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X19IrU"&gt;Okay, some background: it’s true that Theranos didn’t need FDA approval to start using its tests and devices. That’s because they were considered “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/17/9750048/ldt-loophole-fda-hearing-theranos-lab-tests"&gt;lab-developed tests&lt;/a&gt;” — a category of tests developed and used within a single lab, which means they don’t have to go through the typical FDA process. Just because something is a lab-developed test isn’t necessarily a reason &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;to trust that it works as well as advertised. But it’s definitely not a reason to have &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; trust that a test is reliable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDIHQP"&gt;Treating the lack of FDA approval as a reason to bet on Theranos was a small aside in Peterson’s testimony; it was just one reason she thought Theranos seemed like a good investment. (A skepticism of the regulatory process is also one of the reasons &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22689083/elizabeth-holmes-trial-james-mattis-testimony-theranos-fraud"&gt;Theranos board member General James Mattis&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t concerned with some of the company’s actions — something the powerful conservatives seem to have in common). But it set the tone for a day of testimony about the DeVos family’s approach to its $100 million investment in Theranos — which seemed to be more about shiny things and FOMO than about the science behind the blood testing devices Holmes promised would change the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUS4jv"&gt;Peterson volunteered to take the lead on assessing Theranos after hearing about the company (and Holmes) from Jerry Tubergen, the CEO of the DeVos’ family office, which is called the RDV Corporation. The company sent her two large binders with information on the blood testing tech, and she sat on a call with Holmes in early October. Then she took a trip with members of the family out to Palo Alto, where they spent five hours at Theranos headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TVpbs"&gt;There was a lot to bolster the case for Theranos. Peterson said the documents and conversations with Holmes gave the impression that the company could perform hundreds of tests using just a finger stick of blood. A document with the Pfizer logo seemed to show that the Theranos tech was used and validated by major pharmaceutical companies. The company had major contracts with Walgreens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qHW7VZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The documents looked science-y and apparently that was good enough&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J4Ocx5"&gt;Nothing about any of those materials raised red flags with Peterson. But Peterson didn’t look that closely. The relatively poor due diligence was a theme that Lance Wade, Holmes’ attorney, hammered during cross-examination. Wade showed her charts from the Pfizer-branded report, asking if she understood the types of scientific tests the document showed. She said she didn’t. He asked if she scrutinized Theranos’ list of patent filings. She hadn’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQLFVL"&gt;“I’m not a scientist,” Peterson said. “I can’t figure out if those things were lending credibility to what they’re saying.” The documents looked science-y, and apparently, that was good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aOxl2"&gt;The DeVos family didn’t hire any scientists to review the materials, either, Wade pointed out. They didn’t bring in regulatory experts or lawyers. They didn’t go visit one of the Walgreens stores in Arizona that were supposedly using Theranos devices. Peterson didn’t even call Walgreens, even though she said she knew the chief information officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uP4BWS"&gt;Peterson said that was partly because she was afraid of upsetting Holmes. Holmes was vetting investors at the same time as investors were vetting her, and the family didn’t want to miss out on the opportunity to throw their money into the pot. “We felt if we circumvented the process we would be uninvited to participate,” Peterson said. “We were very careful not to circumvent things and upset Elizabeth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="HRebzS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They were telling us that it worked.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NM1cz8"&gt;Wade dug in harder. Holmes wouldn’t have necessarily found out if they had made calls to Walgreens or asked a scientist about the data from Theranos, he said. So why didn’t Peterson do more than the bare minimum? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSQvtW"&gt;Her answer was that she didn’t think she needed to. “They were telling us that it worked,” Peterson said. “We were relying on what we were told.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIqfTB"&gt;Peterson — and the DeVos family office — didn’t come off here looking like the most thoughtful stewards of billions of dollars. During the site visit, they were more interested in top-level takeaways than the actual details of how the Theranos tests worked. Holmes’ and Theranos’ assurances that everything worked great were enough for Peterson and the DeVos family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgzOtE"&gt;But treating that credulousness as a problem also seems like a risky strategy for the defense team. After all, their argument is that Holmes didn’t mislead investors. If she &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; misleading investors, why would the DeVos family need to do extensive independent evaluation? In the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663723/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-trial-opening-arguments-day-one"&gt;defense’s opening statement&lt;/a&gt;, Wade made a case that the people who invested in Theranos were sophisticated and knew what they were getting into. Peterson’s testimony seems to suggest otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="go50nu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Whatever it was Theranos was selling — outright lies, or smoke and mirrors — the DeVos family fell for it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wklkGG"&gt;The defense posited that Peterson and the DeVos family just misunderstood Theranos’ capabilities as described by Holmes. Wade showed a slide in the Theranos documents that didn’t specify that all its tests were done using finger sticks. He pointed to articles where Theranos didn’t &lt;em&gt;directly &lt;/em&gt;claim its testing devices were used in military helicopters, just that it might happen in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gRdMLj"&gt;But whatever it was Theranos was selling — outright lies, or smoke and mirrors — the DeVos family fell for it. And they were left scrambling when John Carreyrou published his first articles in the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;questioning the Theranos technology. In August 2016, Peterson even took a trip to the annual meeting of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, where Holmes was &lt;a href="https://www.aacc.org/meetings-and-events/resources-from-past-meetings/theranos-presentation"&gt;presenting&lt;/a&gt; on the Theranos tech. Belatedly, she had started asking some questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MtLOdk"&gt;“The whole point was to figure out if the technology worked or not,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Stadia tries something new: a free 30-minute game trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Cl1mUMKhDjym7ai2Zy9mpGJ_j0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70050003/akrales_191113_3779_0163.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5WW5LY"&gt;Google’s Stadia cloud gaming service is still coming up with new ways to attract gamers, and it’s finally trying one that we’ve suggested for years: free time-limited trials of entire games, so you can see whether it’s for you. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/26/stadia-free-trial-games/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, you can now hop on over to Stadia, sign in with your Google account, and be playing a 30-minute free trial of &lt;em&gt;Hello Engineer&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://stadia.google.com/u/1/store/details/e85d550899de407e996a8a2d9dfbc7efrcp1/sku/4db0c5af19c74032beb90d083dfb9431p?"&gt;just by following this link&lt;/a&gt; and scrolling down to the “Free trial” button you see below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIOYtz"&gt;A Stadia rep tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this is an experiment Google’s running over the next couple of months, and it’ll come to other select titles in the weeks to come. It won’t always be 30-minute sessions, and you may not see the same games as everyone else, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TjUfE3GL2MXP9g9tQPcMs3yhi5I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22958321/stadia_free_trial_30_minutes.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xGSkxx"&gt;Google also has &lt;a href="https://stadia.google.com/u/1/store/list/47"&gt;this dedicated webpage&lt;/a&gt; for other free trials that it might offer in the future, though you’ll only find &lt;em&gt;Hello Engineer &lt;/em&gt;there right now. Google previously tried some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525074/google-stadia-free-game-demos-cloud-gaming"&gt;limited demos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXhMvA"&gt;Honestly, it’s still not as seamless as it could be. You still do have to sign in with that Google account (even if you’re &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; signed into your Google account for Gmail, Drive, etc), you still have to click through a health and safety screen, and another screen to verify access, and then wait a tad for the game to load. We’re still not at the magical “click an ad for a game to instantly be playing that game” quite yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzFzE8"&gt;But it’s a step in the right direction, particularly if this becomes a standard feature of Stadia titles. And why not? From a game developer or publisher’s standpoint, there’s no work needed to create a demo, and the fact that it’s a cloud game should alleviate any privacy concerns. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993828/sony-playstation-now-cloud-gaming-gaikai-onlive-google-stadia-25th-anniversary"&gt;When Gaikai arrived on the cloud gaming scene over a decade ago&lt;/a&gt;, it demonstrated the your-game-ad-can-be-a-game concept right from the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MW1HV1"&gt;If you enjoy &lt;em&gt;Hello Engineer&lt;/em&gt;, you can buy it for $19.99 on Stadia, or sign up for a Stadia Pro subscription that includes it for free. Other completely free options on Stadia include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571699/google-stadia-destiny-2-free-to-play-game-chromebook-phone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21757835/google-stadia-super-bomberman-r-online-free"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Bomberman R Online&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so there’s no point in wondering whether cloud gaming technology actually works for you: you can just try it right now with three different games, no strings attached, to find out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNDKYl"&gt;Just don’t necessarily expect Google to put its full weight behind Stadia anymore. I wrote &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738550/arkham-knight-google-stadia-att"&gt;how Google seemed more interested in its whitelabel potential&lt;/a&gt; in February, and last week we learned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738550/arkham-knight-google-stadia-att"&gt;how AT&amp;amp;T has taken Google up on the offer&lt;/a&gt; with its own free trial of &lt;em&gt;Batman: Arkham Knight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRJvET"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 11:27PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional context from a Google Stadia rep.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="hphf2u"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/whatsapp-chat-history/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that WhatsApp’s chat history migration feature to bring your messages from iPhones to Android is now available on “all Pixel phones” and that it’ll “become available on new smartphones that launch with Android 12.” The feature was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619664/whatsapp-android-ios-chat-history-transfer-cross-platform"&gt;already available for Samsung phones&lt;/a&gt; but will make the experience of switching from iOS to Android easier, as you won’t have to give up your messaging history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwYNJK"&gt;The process should be relatively simple, as long as you’ve got WhatsApp up to date on both your iPhone and Android phone, and you’ve got a USB-C to Lightning cable handy. Google says that while setting up your Android phone, you’ll be prompted to scan a QR code with your iPhone, which will let you start the transfer process.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A wired connection and QR code scan are all that’s required to start the process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

Google says that your iPhone won’t receive any WhatsApp messages while your messages are moving, so you shouldn’t lose anything in the switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdlIkh"&gt;Google says that phone OEMs can add support for the feature when updating their phones to Android 12, so it’s possible those with existing phones will gain access to it at some point. The company says that it’s working with phone makers to ensure that phones that ship with Android 12 support the transfers out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aN3V75"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated October 26th, 8:34PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added information from Google about support for the feature on existing phones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
