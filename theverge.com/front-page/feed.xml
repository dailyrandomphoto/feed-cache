    <title>Here’s how to get the Google Play Store running on Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oAeQobD1JWnJusncAuCgFIr_MP0=/0x0:2880x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70050875/Hdh35Ti.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Play Store running on Windows 11.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AOm0Dj"&gt;A developer and design student has managed to get the Google Play Store working on Windows 11. Google’s Android app store is fully functional within Windows 11 using this method, allowing you to install a game or app and run it alongside traditional Windows apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tCVfpn"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22737102/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-feature-hands-on"&gt;started testing Windows 11 Android app support&lt;/a&gt; last week, but the official implementation is limited to the Amazon Appstore and less than 50 apps during the preview phase. Getting the Google Play Store installed opens Windows 11 up to every Android app or game you’d want to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQbJkp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ADeltaXForce"&gt;ADeltaX&lt;/a&gt;, an Italian UX design student, has successfully installed the Google Play Store on Windows 11, and detailed all the steps required to get it working. If you’re not familiar with Linux commands or command prompts, then the install process won’t be the most straightforward, but ADeltaX &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIt00xDp0tM"&gt;has created a video guide&lt;/a&gt; for those who really want to get this running.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1MbraUscY8eA6o1PTn0OJm5zwhA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22959042/aAxYUbo.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Gmail Android app running alongside a mobile Android game.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QNZ6wk"&gt;I managed to get the Google Play Store up and running on Windows 11 in about 30 minutes, after downloading all the necessary tools, enabling the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), and installing Ubuntu. The result is a fully functional Play Store that you can use to install any Android app on Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPVrLm"&gt;The full instructions for the install process are &lt;a href="https://github.com/ADeltaX/WSAGAScript"&gt;available on GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, or through the YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIt00xDp0tM"&gt;walkthrough video&lt;/a&gt;. We’re expecting Microsoft to make the Windows Subsystem for Android available to all Windows 11 users in the coming months, alongside Amazon Appstore support.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify expects to have over 400M users by the end of the year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6i3rDyGYPtbolEPJ6WhFZMW-stA=/1x0:1888x1258/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70050857/VSQGmW0.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An infographic released by the company.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G3VsMd"&gt;Spotify now has 172 million paid subscribers and 381 million monthly active users, the &lt;a href="https://investors.spotify.com/financials/press-release-details/2021/Spotify-Technology-S.A.-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Third-Quarter-2021/default.aspx"&gt;company announced today&lt;/a&gt; in its latest earnings release. That’s up from 165 million paid subscribers and 365 million monthly active users last quarter, with both figures up 19 percent year-over-year. Those are in line with what Spotify was expecting this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5t3DO1"&gt;The growth means that Spotify continues to be the biggest music streaming service in the world. Although competitors Amazon Music and Apple Music don’t regularly release subscriber numbers, figures &lt;a href="https://musically.com/2020/07/28/spotify-apple-how-many-users-big-music-streaming-services/"&gt;compiled by &lt;em&gt;Music Ally&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;put their subscriber counts at around 55 million and 60 million respectively. By the end of the year, Spotify expects to have in excess of 400 million monthly active users, and over 177 million premium subscribers, which is in line with previous projections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KkA2pm"&gt;Notably, this quarter saw Spotify’s average revenue per user increase to €4.34 (around $5.03), which is up from €4.29 (around $4.98) last quarter, and represents an increase of 4 percent year-over-year. Overall the company made a profit of €2 million up from a loss of €101 million in the same quarter the previous year. Both are relatively unusual for Spotify, given its emphasis on growth rather than quarterly profit or revenue. Average revenue per user has been helped by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403813/spotify-price-increase-subscriptions-2021"&gt;price increases from the company&lt;/a&gt; over the last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GF6fF4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Over half a year has passed since the announcement of its lossless HiFi streaming tier&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x29YxJ"&gt;Earnings were buoyed by growth in podcast advertising, rising from 10 to 13 percent of total revenue, according to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-ad-business-boosted-by-podcasts-11635328801"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Spotify says that the amount of its users engaging with podcasts is accelerating, and that podcast share of overall consumption hours reached an “all-time high” this quarter. The amount of podcasts on the platform now sits at 3.2 million, up from 2.9 million at the end of the previous quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNOsmn"&gt;The figures come at the end of a relatively quiet quarter for Spotify, which hasn’t been marked by any major acquisitions or launches. There’s also still no sign of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;Spotify HiFi&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s new CD-quality streaming tier announced in February that’s supposed to launch by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GgFPxE"&gt;Instead the company has made more minor tweaks to its service this quarter, like widely rolling out the ability for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22701219/spotify-interactive-podcast-polls-question-answer-feature-launch-anchor"&gt;podcasters to add interactive polls and Q&amp;amp;A’s to their shows&lt;/a&gt;, releasing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638628/spotify-offline-playback-wear-os-now-rolling-out"&gt;Wear OS app with support for offline playback&lt;/a&gt;, and adding a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664655/spotify-enhance-feature-recommended-songs-playlists"&gt;new “Enhance” feature&lt;/a&gt; that automatically adds songs to users’ pre-existing playlists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XdyoVJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oy6tA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now ask Google to remove images of under-18s from its search results</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06Y4BMIHxGCyne6lHxoNneskq4o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70050740/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VAwTSr"&gt;Google has launched a new safety feature that lets under-18s request the removal of images of themselves from the company’s search results. The feature was originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617976/google-children-ad-targeting-youtube-default-privacy-safesearch"&gt;announced in August&lt;/a&gt; (along with new restrictions of ad targeting of minors) but is now widely available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ia2pIe"&gt;Anyone can start the removal process from &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/10949130?hl=en"&gt;this help page&lt;/a&gt;. Applicants will need to supply the URLs of images they want removed from search results, the search terms that surface those images, the name and age of the minor, and the name and relationship of the individual that might be acting on their behalf — a parent or guardian, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5RfO9s"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google will make exceptions for “cases of compelling public interest or newsworthiness”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l59Xr6"&gt;As ever with these sorts of removal requests, it’s hard to say exactly what criteria Google will be applying in its judgements. The company notes it will remove images of any minors “with the exception of cases of compelling public interest or newsworthiness.” Interpreting how these terms apply in different situations is difficult territory, as we’ve seen with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/22/18192626/eu-right-to-be-forgotten-dutch-surgeon-medical-negligence"&gt;controversial&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/right-to-be-forgotten"&gt;cases&lt;/a&gt; involving the EU’s “right to be forgotten” law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aiTbRf"&gt;It also seems from Google’s language that it won’t comply with requests unless the person in the image is &lt;em&gt;currently&lt;/em&gt; under 18. So, if you’re 30, you can’t apply to remove pictures of you when you were 15. That limits the scope of the tool to prevent abuse or harassment, but it presumably makes the process of verification much easier. It’s hard to prove what age you are in any given photo as opposed to proving how old you are right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zy5FMD"&gt;Google also stresses that removing an image from its search results does not, of course, remove it from the web. The company encourages those going through the application process to contact the webmaster directly. Though in cases where doing so has been unsuccessful, removing information from Google’s index is certainly the next best thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epAesN"&gt;In addition to these new removal options for images of minors, Google already offers other avenues for requesting the removal of &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/troubleshooter/3111061?hl=en"&gt;specific types of harmful content&lt;/a&gt;. These include non-consensual explicit imagery, fake pornography, financial or medical information, and “doxxing” information including home addresses and phone numbers. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 11’s new Microsoft Store is now available for Windows 10 testers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IT_jI5F9yqhZtzn_Vt_VWxxwoMk=/60x0:1860x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70050736/windows11store.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Windows 11 store running on Windows 10.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Rudy Huyn (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/RudyHuyn/status/1453248154183286796/photo/1" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QgCOV4"&gt;Microsoft is close to releasing Windows 11’s new Microsoft Store for Windows 10 users. The software maker has now released this new app store to Windows 10 testers in the Release Preview ring, alongside a final version of the upcoming &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/10/21/preparing-the-windows-10-november-2021-update-for-release/"&gt;Windows 10 November 2021 Update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3iSBZ"&gt;The updated Store is identical to the one found on Windows 11, offering greater access to win32 apps, a more modern design, and all of the new apps that have made their way into Microsoft’s store recently. This new Microsoft Store is also more open that before, allowing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698196/microsoft-store-third-party-app-stores-epic-games-amazon"&gt;third-party stores&lt;/a&gt; like the Epic Games Store to be listed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pzv6dO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Exciting news today, the new &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MicrosoftStore?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MicrosoftStore&lt;/a&gt; (modern design, support for win32 apps, Disney+ movies and way more) is now available to Windows 10 Insiders! &lt;a href="https://t.co/O9zSZ8pudp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/O9zSZ8pudp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rudy Huyn (@RudyHuyn) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RudyHuyn/status/1453248154183286796?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8YUAvl"&gt;Microsoft’s new approach to its Store has also meant a deluge of apps have finally arrived, including Discord, Zoom, VLC, TeamViewer, and Visual Studio Code. Any browser can also be listed in the store now, and so far Opera and the Yandex Browser are available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVENB6"&gt;If you want to test the new Microsoft Store on Windows 10 you’ll need to be on the Release Preview Insider ring. We’re expecting the new Store update to arrive for all Windows 10 users in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro will arrive with a day-one update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wpk4c4JfW3PHhZKTdttIMKn8QzM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70050227/bfarsace_211014_4802_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KAHsOx"&gt;Assuming you managed to order a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, then you should know that once the phone is in your possession, you’ll need a little extra time to get everything set up and working. That’s because, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/132599975/update-your-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-to-the-latest-software-to-get-all-the-features"&gt;as a post on the Google support forums points out&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/26/pixel-6-day-one-update/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), there is a software update to install. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rqmypE"&gt;The post indicates you’ll need it to get all of the features, although it’s unclear what would be missing if you simply started using the phone without it other than the November security update. According to Google, the build number is the same for both phones, and it should display SD1A.210817.036 or SD1A.210817.036.A8 for Verizon customers. If your phone arrives early, then the update might not available at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBbf5b"&gt;According to our team, all the review units are running the same build present after the device installs its day-one update, so any impressions you see here or elsewhere are using the same software. For a device that must be connected to a network, this approach isn’t surprising — it allows production to ramp up even as the launch software is finalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ikbi0b"&gt;The day-one update installs after you complete your device setup, and Google says it can take about 25 - 50 minutes to download and install in the background. The Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are scheduled to start shipping on October 28th, so first-hand experiences with the update (and our reviews of both phones) aren’t far away.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Theranos FOMO kept the DeVos family from doing its investment homework</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes Attends Criminal Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pg_h7SRn4TWLtv5gHu6SpNMuuw8=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70050146/1235841569.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The family office took Elizabeth Holmes at her word&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="0rZcRt"&gt;Theranos said a lot of things to Lisa Peterson that made the company seem credible when she evaluated it on behalf of the crazy-wealthy DeVos family. One of the things that stood out as a reason to trust Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes? Its devices didn’t need FDA approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfHrWj"&gt;That made it seem more credible that the machines worked, said Peterson, who works on investments for the DeVos clan (including former secretary of education Betsy DeVos), and who testified today during &lt;em&gt;US v. Elizabeth Holmes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="F9pVVG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The DeVos’ approach to Theranos seemed to be more about shiny things and FOMO&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X19IrU"&gt;Okay, some background: it’s true that Theranos didn’t need FDA approval to start using its tests and devices. That’s because they were considered “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/17/9750048/ldt-loophole-fda-hearing-theranos-lab-tests"&gt;lab-developed tests&lt;/a&gt;” — a category of tests developed and used within a single lab, which means they don’t have to go through the typical FDA process. Just because something is a lab-developed test isn’t necessarily a reason &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;to trust that it works as well as advertised. But it’s definitely not a reason to have &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; trust that a test is reliable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDIHQP"&gt;Treating the lack of FDA approval as a reason to bet on Theranos was a small aside in Peterson’s testimony; it was just one reason she thought Theranos seemed like a good investment. (A skepticism of the regulatory process is also one of the reasons &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22689083/elizabeth-holmes-trial-james-mattis-testimony-theranos-fraud"&gt;Theranos board member General James Mattis&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t concerned with some of the company’s actions — something the powerful conservatives seem to have in common). But it set the tone for a day of testimony about the DeVos family’s approach to its $100 million investment in Theranos — which seemed to be more about shiny things and FOMO than about the science behind the blood testing devices Holmes promised would change the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUS4jv"&gt;Peterson volunteered to take the lead on assessing Theranos after hearing about the company (and Holmes) from Jerry Tubergen, the CEO of the DeVos’ family office, which is called the RDV Corporation. The company sent her two large binders with information on the blood testing tech, and she sat on a call with Holmes in early October. Then she took a trip with members of the family out to Palo Alto, where they spent five hours at Theranos headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TVpbs"&gt;There was a lot to bolster the case for Theranos. Peterson said the documents and conversations with Holmes gave the impression that the company could perform hundreds of tests using just a finger stick of blood. A document with the Pfizer logo seemed to show that the Theranos tech was used and validated by major pharmaceutical companies. The company had major contracts with Walgreens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qHW7VZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The documents looked science-y and apparently that was good enough&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J4Ocx5"&gt;Nothing about any of those materials raised red flags with Peterson. But Peterson didn’t look that closely. The relatively poor due diligence was a theme that Lance Wade, Holmes’ attorney, hammered during cross-examination. Wade showed her charts from the Pfizer-branded report, asking if she understood the types of scientific tests the document showed. She said she didn’t. He asked if she scrutinized Theranos’ list of patent filings. She hadn’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQLFVL"&gt;“I’m not a scientist,” Peterson said. “I can’t figure out if those things were lending credibility to what they’re saying.” The documents looked science-y, and apparently, that was good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aOxl2"&gt;The DeVos family didn’t hire any scientists to review the materials, either, Wade pointed out. They didn’t bring in regulatory experts or lawyers. They didn’t go visit one of the Walgreens stores in Arizona that were supposedly using Theranos devices. Peterson didn’t even call Walgreens, even though she said she knew the chief information officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uP4BWS"&gt;Peterson said that was partly because she was afraid of upsetting Holmes. Holmes was vetting investors at the same time as investors were vetting her, and the family didn’t want to miss out on the opportunity to throw their money into the pot. “We felt if we circumvented the process we would be uninvited to participate,” Peterson said. “We were very careful not to circumvent things and upset Elizabeth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="HRebzS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They were telling us that it worked.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NM1cz8"&gt;Wade dug in harder. Holmes wouldn’t have necessarily found out if they had made calls to Walgreens or asked a scientist about the data from Theranos, he said. So why didn’t Peterson do more than the bare minimum? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSQvtW"&gt;Her answer was that she didn’t think she needed to. “They were telling us that it worked,” Peterson said. “We were relying on what we were told.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIqfTB"&gt;Peterson — and the DeVos family office — didn’t come off here looking like the most thoughtful stewards of billions of dollars. During the site visit, they were more interested in top-level takeaways than the actual details of how the Theranos tests worked. Holmes’ and Theranos’ assurances that everything worked great were enough for Peterson and the DeVos family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgzOtE"&gt;But treating that credulousness as a problem also seems like a risky strategy for the defense team. After all, their argument is that Holmes didn’t mislead investors. If she &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; misleading investors, why would the DeVos family need to do extensive independent evaluation? In the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663723/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-trial-opening-arguments-day-one"&gt;defense’s opening statement&lt;/a&gt;, Wade made a case that the people who invested in Theranos were sophisticated and knew what they were getting into. Peterson’s testimony seems to suggest otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="go50nu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Whatever it was Theranos was selling — outright lies, or smoke and mirrors — the DeVos family fell for it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wklkGG"&gt;The defense posited that Peterson and the DeVos family just misunderstood Theranos’ capabilities as described by Holmes. Wade showed a slide in the Theranos documents that didn’t specify that all its tests were done using finger sticks. He pointed to articles where Theranos didn’t &lt;em&gt;directly &lt;/em&gt;claim its testing devices were used in military helicopters, just that it might happen in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gRdMLj"&gt;But whatever it was Theranos was selling — outright lies, or smoke and mirrors — the DeVos family fell for it. And they were left scrambling when John Carreyrou published his first articles in the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;questioning the Theranos technology. In August 2016, Peterson even took a trip to the annual meeting of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, where Holmes was &lt;a href="https://www.aacc.org/meetings-and-events/resources-from-past-meetings/theranos-presentation"&gt;presenting&lt;/a&gt; on the Theranos tech. Belatedly, she had started asking some questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MtLOdk"&gt;“The whole point was to figure out if the technology worked or not,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Stadia tries something new: a free 30-minute game trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Cl1mUMKhDjym7ai2Zy9mpGJ_j0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70050003/akrales_191113_3779_0163.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5WW5LY"&gt;Google’s Stadia cloud gaming service is still coming up with new ways to attract gamers, and it’s finally trying one that we’ve suggested for years: free time-limited trials of entire games, so you can see whether it’s for you. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/26/stadia-free-trial-games/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, you can now hop on over to Stadia, sign in with your Google account, and be playing a 30-minute free trial of &lt;em&gt;Hello Engineer&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://stadia.google.com/u/1/store/details/e85d550899de407e996a8a2d9dfbc7efrcp1/sku/4db0c5af19c74032beb90d083dfb9431p?"&gt;just by following this link&lt;/a&gt; and scrolling down to the “Free trial” button you see below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIOYtz"&gt;A Stadia rep tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this is an experiment Google’s running over the next couple of months, and it’ll come to other select titles in the weeks to come. It won’t always be 30-minute sessions, and you may not see the same games as everyone else, though.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TjUfE3GL2MXP9g9tQPcMs3yhi5I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22958321/stadia_free_trial_30_minutes.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xGSkxx"&gt;Google also has &lt;a href="https://stadia.google.com/u/1/store/list/47"&gt;this dedicated webpage&lt;/a&gt; for other free trials that it might offer in the future, though you’ll only find &lt;em&gt;Hello Engineer &lt;/em&gt;there right now. Google previously tried some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525074/google-stadia-free-game-demos-cloud-gaming"&gt;limited demos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXhMvA"&gt;Honestly, it’s still not as seamless as it could be. You still do have to sign in with that Google account (even if you’re &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; signed into your Google account for Gmail, Drive, etc), you still have to click through a health and safety screen, and another screen to verify access, and then wait a tad for the game to load. We’re still not at the magical “click an ad for a game to instantly be playing that game” quite yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzFzE8"&gt;But it’s a step in the right direction, particularly if this becomes a standard feature of Stadia titles. And why not? From a game developer or publisher’s standpoint, there’s no work needed to create a demo, and the fact that it’s a cloud game should alleviate any privacy concerns. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993828/sony-playstation-now-cloud-gaming-gaikai-onlive-google-stadia-25th-anniversary"&gt;When Gaikai arrived on the cloud gaming scene over a decade ago&lt;/a&gt;, it demonstrated the your-game-ad-can-be-a-game concept right from the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MW1HV1"&gt;If you enjoy &lt;em&gt;Hello Engineer&lt;/em&gt;, you can buy it for $19.99 on Stadia, or sign up for a Stadia Pro subscription that includes it for free. Other completely free options on Stadia include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571699/google-stadia-destiny-2-free-to-play-game-chromebook-phone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21757835/google-stadia-super-bomberman-r-online-free"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Bomberman R Online&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so there’s no point in wondering whether cloud gaming technology actually works for you: you can just try it right now with three different games, no strings attached, to find out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNDKYl"&gt;Just don’t necessarily expect Google to put its full weight behind Stadia anymore. I wrote &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738550/arkham-knight-google-stadia-att"&gt;how Google seemed more interested in its whitelabel potential&lt;/a&gt; in February, and last week we learned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738550/arkham-knight-google-stadia-att"&gt;how AT&amp;amp;T has taken Google up on the offer&lt;/a&gt; with its own free trial of &lt;em&gt;Batman: Arkham Knight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRJvET"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 11:27PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional context from a Google Stadia rep.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp’s iPhone-to-Android chat transfer is now available on Pixels and new phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eokNaSp9B-H9bsj4lLIBmWdnKU=/193x0:1246x702/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70049386/Screen_Shot_2021_10_26_at_13.51.42.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hphf2u"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/whatsapp-chat-history/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that WhatsApp’s chat history migration feature to bring your messages from iPhones to Android is now available on “all Pixel phones” and that it’ll “become available on new smartphones that launch with Android 12.” The feature was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619664/whatsapp-android-ios-chat-history-transfer-cross-platform"&gt;already available for Samsung phones&lt;/a&gt; but will make the experience of switching from iOS to Android easier, as you won’t have to give up your messaging history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwYNJK"&gt;The process should be relatively simple, as long as you’ve got WhatsApp up to date on both your iPhone and Android phone, and you’ve got a USB-C to Lightning cable handy. Google says that while setting up your Android phone, you’ll be prompted to scan a QR code with your iPhone, which will let you start the transfer process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VsnZRcl9RuhTCPdNKO3gbNGB6OQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957797/WhatsAppBlogAsset_LightTheme.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A wired connection and QR code scan are all that’s required to start the process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XZ4fwZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655753/migrate-iphone-whatsapp-data-chat-history-samsung-phone"&gt;Check out our how-to&lt;/a&gt; for more detailed instructions (they’re written for Samsung, but the process should be similar) and to read into the few caveats with the transfer. Google says that your iPhone won’t receive any WhatsApp messages while your messages are moving, so you shouldn’t lose anything in the switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdlIkh"&gt;Google says that phone OEMs can add support for the feature when updating their phones to Android 12, so it’s possible those with existing phones will gain access to it at some point. The company says that it’s working with phone makers to ensure that phones that ship with Android 12 support the transfers out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aN3V75"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated October 26th, 8:34PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added information from Google about support for the feature on existing phones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Niantic’s Pikmin Bloom is rolling out globally starting today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AQ9A-Y9OwlL9N6mUrzrPVwT0gp4=/0x171:1024x854/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70049845/PikminBloom_AppIcon_iOS.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a5je6p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt;, the next game from &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; creator Niantic, is starting its global rollout today. The developer says that the app — which is billed as a joint project with Nintendo — “will be available on the App Store and Google Play over the coming days.” The rollout will start with Australia and Singapore before gradually hitting the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bgNCxE"&gt;The new &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345472/niantic-nintendo-pikmin-partnership-collaboration-ar-mobile-game"&gt;first announced in March&lt;/a&gt; as part of a new collaboration between Niantic and Nintendo. Like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, the game is designed to get people outdoors and walking. In &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom,&lt;/em&gt; players can collect the titular plant creatures by gathering and planting seeds; in order for them to grow, you have to walk a certain distance, sort of like hatching an egg in &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;. Players can feed their pikmin to make them bloom and then collect the petals, which let you create a trailer of flowers as you walk for other players to see. (Among other Nintendo-like touches, your in-game avatar is a Mii.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVCbW8"&gt;One of the more interesting features in &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; is a sort of daily journal. The game saves information about how much you’ve walked, the pikmin you’ve collected, and places you’ve visited and then shows you a little video at the end of the day. You can even add notes and photos to make it more personal. There’s also, of course, an AR mode so that you can see the cute little guys crawling around the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gqJePB"&gt;While Pokémon Go was and remains a big hit, Niantic has struggled to replicate that success with other properties. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18716146/harry-potter-wizards-unite-pokemon-go-review-ar-augmented-reality-game-foundable"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Wizards Unite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; never really took off, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680166/niantic-catan-world-explorers-shutdown-early-access"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catan: World Explorers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; only lasted around a year. (It’s not just Niantic that’s struggling to replicate that success, either; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215253/minecraft-earth-closing-down-june-2021-microsoft"&gt;Microsoft also shut down its real-world &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; game earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.) The studio is also making &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22529378/transformers-heavy-metal-niantic-pokemon-go-location-game-ar"&gt;an AR take on Transformers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKNdlS"&gt;All of this is to say that &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; will be a big test for the ongoing viability of real-world AR games beyond just &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; — and players around the world should be able to check it out in the coming days.

    <title>Pikmin Bloom hands-on: a cute app that tries to make walking a little more magical</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9SPesFWSpuqNOO8lYLcVCD_R92k=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70049857/Key_art_with_English_logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xr19bh"&gt;There’s something strangely satisfying about leaving a trail of colorful flowers in your wake as you explore a neighborhood. It’s also one of the main hooks of &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt;, the next release from the creator of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, and another app designed to get you moving in the real world. I’ve been able to play the game for the past few days, and while it’s less of a game than &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, it definitely adds some magic and fun to a daily walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEIWDj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22510468"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; is starting its gradual rollout today&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345472/niantic-nintendo-pikmin-partnership-collaboration-ar-mobile-game"&gt;part of a new partnership between Nintendo and Niantic&lt;/a&gt;. The game is billed as a collaboration between Nintendo and Niantic’s Tokyo studio, and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto even appears in the launch trailer. &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; isn’t necessarily the most obvious choice to kick off the partnership, as it’s one of Nintendo’s more obscure franchises. But in a meeting with reporters, Niantic CEO John Hanke said that it’s also a fictional world that fit well with the type of game the studio wanted to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="we17In"&gt;“We experimented with a variety of different gameplay types and different characters with Nintendo,” he explains. “And after a lot of experimentation and discussion, we settled on &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; as the perfect vehicle to express what Nintendo does well and what Niantic does well in a single game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jyli99"&gt;For the uninitiated, pikmin are sentient plant creatures that work well in groups and have unique abilities depending on their color. In the main games, players control large groups of them to solve puzzles. It’s sort of a mix between a puzzle game and real-time strategy. In &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; — at least early on — the goal is primarily to collect and grow new creatures. You do this, of course, by walking. You can gather new seeds to plant in your backpack (for some reason), and each requires a certain number of steps to grow into a full-on pikmin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8M6hLz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10828821"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SFZGt1"&gt;You can also feed your pikmin nectar, which causes them to bloom, netting you petals, which can then be used to plant flowers on your walks. This has two benefits. From a gameplay perspective, your little pikmin seedlings will grow faster while you’re also leaving a flower trail. But they also just make things look pretty. Just like in &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, the main in-game view is a cartoon-ish map of the world around you. It’s mostly empty aside from some pikmin sprouts you can collect at specific locations. But you’re able to spruce things up with those trails of flowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XbLT0l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The perfect vehicle to express what Nintendo does well and what Niantic does well in a single game.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QyESp7"&gt;From what I’ve played, &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; is much less of a traditional game than &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;. (This is especially true if you look at the current version of &lt;em&gt;Go&lt;/em&gt;, which has changed a lot since its debut in 2016.) It’s a more passive experience. So far, I’ve mostly left it on in the background as I’ve gone about my day, checking in periodically to see if any pikmin have bloomed or to turn on the flower trail when I go outside. To go along with this, &lt;em&gt;Bloom&lt;/em&gt; has an interesting journal-like feature that sums up your activities for each day. At the end of the day, you’ll get to see what you did and how much you walked in a little video, and you can access that info from a calendar. There’s even the option to add photos or notes to personalize things further, so you can go back and see what you really did on a particular day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JX4Kq"&gt;So while there are some obvious similarities between &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; — that includes an AR feature so you can see the cute plant creatures walking around in the real world — philosophically, they seem to be going in slightly different directions. Whereas &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; was an attempt to turn a beloved fictional world into an IRL experience, &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; instead uses a cute Nintendo franchise as a way to gamify walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbytXK"&gt;That said, I’m still very early in the game, and there’s also a very good chance it will be regularly updated with new features in the coming weeks and months. In fact, it sounds like more game-like elements are already in the works. During a call with reporters, Madoka Katayama — UX director at Niantic’s Tokyo studio — mentioned more perilous elements that could potentially put your pikmin in danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZD5RC"&gt;“Most of the time, it’s pretty safe, but there will be certain gameplay where some of them may not return,” she says. “But it’s something that rarely happens in the game, and it happens a little bit further into the gameplay.” Which raises a very important question: &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/22407549/pikmin-gamecube-nintendo-switch-miyamoto"&gt;death has always been a part of the &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; experience&lt;/a&gt; — so will it be present in &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9UtoXR"&gt;“We don’t use the term death,” Katayama says. “They never actually die conceptually.”&lt;/p&gt;
