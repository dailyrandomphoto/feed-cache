    <title>Samsung will help you turn your old Galaxy phone into a smart home sensor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HMKZW7exSYWuuiHTrP72mMxRLlc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163892/Galaxy_Upcycling_at_Home.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The feature can alert you to the sound of a crying baby or turn on a lamp when light levels dip.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cXHVnM"&gt;Samsung has launched a beta program to help put some older Galaxy phones to new uses. Owners of certain phones can download an update to turn the device into a smart home sensor with some neat functions — it can detect the sound of a crying baby or turn on a lamp when it gets dark. The program is limited to certain models launched in 2018 or later, which is fairly limited, but it’s a nice, accessible offering that could help users get a little more use out of their old devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iczh9A"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-introduces-latest-innovations-for-a-better-normal-at-ces-2021"&gt;Announced at CES&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, the company is launching the program in the US, UK, and Korea starting today. By downloading a software update through the &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/support/owners/app/smartthings" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SmartThings app&lt;/a&gt;, users can access two basic functions. The first is an audio sensor that detects the sound of a baby crying, pet barking or meowing, or a knock at the door. When it detects one of these, it sends an alert to your phone with a recording of the sound. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mb2b7M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Galaxy S, Note, and Z-series phones launched from 2018 onward are eligible&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HX79N0"&gt;The other function is a light level sensor that can turn on a connected light automatically when brightness levels in a room fall below a certain threshold. Samsung says the update includes battery optimization necessary to keep the phone powered and functioning as a sensor for long periods of time, though the company doesn’t specify how long it would be able to run between charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E93Ex7"&gt;Galaxy S, Note, and Z-series phones launched from 2018 onward are eligible, provided they’re running Android 9 or later. Samsung says more devices will be supported in the future, which hopefully includes more budget-oriented devices that owners may be less likely to trade in. And if those limited functions don’t appeal, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21542079/phone-reuse-android-iphone-how-to"&gt;a lot more you can do with your old phone&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t mind a DIY approach.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What we’re learning from the rare cases of COVID-19 in vaccinated people</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of several vaccine vials over a pink and purple background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xoIh5z6tnvRpOrt8hCGCNhx1n28=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163881/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lbKwgt"&gt;Among the more than 75 million people fully vaccinated against COVID-19 in the United States by the second week of April, there were only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html"&gt;5,814 reports&lt;/a&gt; of coronavirus infections — a staggeringly low number that shows just how effective the shots are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxSCIo"&gt;Because the vaccines aren’t 100 percent effective, some breakthrough infections were inevitable and expected. Still, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is watching them closely. Studying those cases will&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;help experts make sure the vaccines are working as expected and understand any factors that make it more likely that a vaccinated person would get sick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RpLIDf"&gt;Currently, the CDC has a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html"&gt;national database&lt;/a&gt; where state health departments can send reports of any cases of COVID-19 in people who have been vaccinated. Because COVID-19 is a notifiable disease, which means every case has to be reported to the CDC, the agency will eventually use a different system, called the National Notifiable Diseases Surveillance System (NNDSS) to find breakthrough infections. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html"&gt;Right now&lt;/a&gt;, it’s working to make sure that states can include vaccination history in NNDSS reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kdg1gf"&gt;Almost a third of the breakthrough infections reported to the CDC were asymptomatic. Only &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/health-departments/breakthrough-cases.html"&gt;396 people&lt;/a&gt; were hospitalized, and a third of that group was in the hospital for a reason other than COVID-19 — that is, the disease was not the reason they were seriously ill, they just happened to also test positive for the virus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0EntBS"&gt;“Most of those have been mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic. That’s exactly what we were hoping for,” Tara Smith, a professor of epidemiology at the Kent State University College of Public Health in Ohio, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/cdc-about-5-800-breakthrough-infections-reported-fully-vaccinated-people-n1264186"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKa3Ml"&gt;Two new reports from the CDC published today gave more details about outbreaks of COVID-19 in vaccinated people. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7017e2.htm?s_cid=mm7017e2_w"&gt;One described a Kentucky nursing home&lt;/a&gt; where 90 percent of residents and around half of staffers were fully vaccinated. After an unvaccinated staffer came down with COVID-19, a total of 46 people tested positive for the virus. Four cases were in fully vaccinated staffers and 18 were in fully vaccinated residents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="acmSkX"&gt;Notably, the Kentucky&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;outbreak was linked back to a variant form of the coronavirus referred to as the R.1 lineage. It has a number of mutations in common with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255198/covid-vaccine-variant-update-mutation-south-africa-moderna"&gt;variant viruses&lt;/a&gt; first identified in South Africa and Brazil, which experts think might partially evade antibodies produced by the vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tws792"&gt;The infections by the R.1 virus found in vaccinated people support some of those concerns, the CDC said in &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7017e2.htm?s_cid=mm7017e2_w"&gt;its report&lt;/a&gt;. But the vaccines still worked: unvaccinated nursing home residents were three times as likely to get infected during the outbreak as vaccinated residents. During this outbreak, the shots were around 87 percent effective against symptomatic COVID-19, the report found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFjTLs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7017e1.htm?s_cid=mm7017e1_w"&gt;The second report&lt;/a&gt; tracked infections in vaccinated people at 75 Chicago nursing homes. Across nearly 8,000 vaccinated residents and 7,000 vaccinated staffers, there were only 22 coronavirus infections. Fourteen were asymptomatic and five had only mild symptoms. None of the 22 people appeared to pass the infection on to anyone else. That shows how important high levels of vaccination can be in settings like nursing homes, the report noted. Even if a vaccinated person gets sick, they’re not likely to set off a chain of infections that could spread through a facility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xq8EqT"&gt;That’s key in stopping the spread of disease overall. People who have their shots might still get sick, even though it happens very rarely, but they probably won’t pass the virus to anyone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bahNEa"&gt;Vaccinated people who get COVID-19 may find the experience &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fnews%2Four-columnists%2Fthe-mystery-of-breakthrough-covid-19-infections&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22395551%2Fcovid-vaccine-breakthrough-infection-rare-cdc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;disorienting&lt;/a&gt;, but the close investigations into the circumstances around these cases highlight just how powerful the vaccines are. &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;Over half of adults&lt;/a&gt; in the US have had their first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. As more and more people get vaccinated, the pool of people who will catch COVID-19 steadily shrinks, and less of the virus will circulate around a community. And when levels of the virus drop, vaccinated and unvaccinated people alike are less likely to be exposed to it and less likely to catch it themselves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3tfiW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s AirTags will work with Android... sort of</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An AirTag in a blue, leather holster, attached to a black bag." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bCSMVEWYmDfbODYngQNfZfM47FA=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163879/Apple_airtag_accessories_bag_042021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An AirTag. | Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f6Gqeg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/20844326/apple-airtags-bluetooth-tracker-keys-tile-features-price"&gt;Apple’s AirTags&lt;/a&gt; have one feature not mentioned during the announcement yesterday: they’ll work with Android to a limited extent. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/20/lost-airtag-can-be-read-by-any-other-nfc-enabled-iphone-or-android-device/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; noted&lt;/a&gt;, there’s a &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212227"&gt;support article&lt;/a&gt; on Apple’s site that details how AirTags will work with an Android device if you don’t have your iPhone handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k02FLB"&gt;The way AirTags function is by securely communicating with Bluetooth devices and iPhones equipped with ultra-wideband that are in the area. If AirTags exclusively worked with Apple devices it would severely limit their effectiveness, particularly in regions where iPhones aren’t as popular as Android. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A moving image of a phone tapping an AirTag and a link appearing in the notifications on the phone." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yinUHviyNXw9xFiPoJMZhbSjFrA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459713/ios14_iphone12_pro_nfc_notification_animation_crop.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Any NFC-equipped phone should be able to just tap the AirTag to get more details.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9sFmtd"&gt;AirTags won’t work out of the box with an Android device, nor can you use an Android device in lieu of an iPhone with one. Instead, it will only work with Android devices equipped with NFC and only communicate when the AirTags are in Lost Mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93EfhH"&gt;First, you’ll need to use your iPhone to activate Lost Mode, which is supposed to show you on a map where your AirTag has wandered off to. Then if someone with an Android device finds your lost AirTag, they can hold it up to their NFC-equipped phone and get details on how to contact you. They’ll only be able to get details if the Lost Mode is activated, which should help with privacy concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZskdY"&gt;The Android support makes AirTags way more useful, but if you want the full experience on an Android device, you’ll probably want to take a gander at Tile’s offerings. The company is reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215381/tile-ultra-wide-band-tracker-apple-airtags-samsung-smartthings"&gt;working on an AirTag competitor&lt;/a&gt; that should work on both iOS and Android. Samsung also has its own AirTag competitor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;Galaxy SmartTags&lt;/a&gt;. Like the AirTags and planned Tile offering, the Galaxy SmartTags use UWB to provide a more exact location for a lost tag. The Galaxy SmartTags only work with Samsung Galaxy phones, but unlike AirTags and the Tile tag, Galaxy SmartTags are available now and start at $29.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lL9XiQ"&gt;Related:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus’ gaming triggers for Android and iOS phones are now available in India</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="OnePlus Gaming Triggers" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9IBv8bhhJPS1DIoqPBTiuPKee3Y=/0x0:1061x707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163839/oneplustriggers2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These can snap onto any phone thinner than 11.5mm&lt;/em&gt; | OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DJWt7y"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1384771145606451205"&gt;OnePlus CEO Pete Lau tweeted pictures&lt;/a&gt; of some attachable gaming triggers the company has created, and they’re made for more than just OnePlus’ phones. &lt;a href="https://www.slashgear.com/oneplus-gaming-trigger-may-confuse-your-senses-23665133/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;SlashGear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.androidheadlines.com/2021/03/oneplus-mobile-gaming-trigger-accessory-oneplus-9-pro-video-games.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Headlines&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;noticed them being teased during the unveiling of the OnePlus 9 back in late March, but they’re available online now &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.in%2Fproduct%2Foneplus-gaming-triggers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22395588%2Foneplus-gaming-triggers-ios-android-phone-mobile-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in India from the OnePlus site&lt;/a&gt; for 1,099 rupees, which converts to roughly $15. OnePlus hasn’t confirmed that these gaming triggers will be releasing globally, and the company wouldn’t comment on pricing and availability when I reached out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAJVet"&gt;These triggers can be clipped around the edge of most phones (any Android or iOS device, so long as they’re less than 11.5mm thick with a case on). If you want to do some mobile gaming but hate touch controls, these could provide a more intuitive, controller-like alternative to tapping on your screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bQs958"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We designed the OnePlus gaming triggers to be solid, responsive, pleasingly “clicky,” and, yes, beautiful. We also made sure they work with many other phones—because the best product design is one that leaves you free to make your own choices. &lt;a href="https://t.co/hJNa4Dsa5s"&gt;pic.twitter.com/hJNa4Dsa5s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Pete Lau (@PeteLau) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PeteLau/status/1384771145606451205?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f227p8"&gt;Each trigger appears to have just one shoulder button with an Omron switch that Lau says are “pleasingly clicky” to tap. Some of the pictures make it seem like there’s also a rear trigger, which would give you a second button to map, but OnePlus didn’t provide any further details on how the mechanism worked when I asked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qLkTjQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.in%2Fproduct%2Foneplus-gaming-triggers&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F21%2F22395588%2Foneplus-gaming-triggers-ios-android-phone-mobile-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;According to the product page&lt;/a&gt;, these triggers are interchangeable and can be fastened to your phone in whatever way is most comfortable to you. To use them, though, your game of choice needs to allow for deep customization of its touch controls, to the level of allowing you to move touch-activated zones to where these triggers’ conductive silicon pads clip onto your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6DdWb"&gt;If you’re serious about mobile gaming, these triggers could level the playing field if you’re up against gamers who are playing on phones like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;Asus ROG Phone 5&lt;/a&gt; or others that feature ultrasonic sensors laid along their edge to mimic physical shoulder buttons. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346594/black-shark-4-pro-gaming-phone-shoulder-buttons-specs-price-release-date"&gt;Black Shark 4 lineup&lt;/a&gt; features actual mechanical shoulder buttons built into the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f8sP6Y"&gt;OnePlus’ option seems to be a solid, budget-friendly option for making your phone easier to game on, though there’s a downside if you value your phone’s expansive screen real estate: these clamps obscure parts of the screen. But if they’re as easy to clip on and remove as OnePlus’ photos indicate, I can live with that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus says it will add always-on display option to the OnePlus Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n3297xMoqQPuj3F8euqK5ZzrOx0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163740/dseifert_4521_oneplus_watch_12.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qbcnOa"&gt;OnePlus has announced that it plans to bring new features, like an always-on display mode, a 12-hour watchface, and more to its new smartwatch with future software updates. The news came &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oneplus-watch-software-update-b-40-change-log-and-upcoming-ota-updates-plan.1422840/"&gt;with the announcement of the Watch’s first software update&lt;/a&gt; after its release, which OnePlus says it’s starting to roll out. This release aims to fix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22380322/oneplus-watch-review-price-specs-features"&gt;the issues we experienced with heart rate and activity tracking&lt;/a&gt;, among other bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ag7hq1"&gt;The lack of an always-on display was one of the ways we found the Watch to be lacking when we reviewed it, so it’s a standout feature among the planned updates. While that feature alone won’t make the device a great smartwatch, it will at least make it more useful as a timepiece. However, it will be interesting to see how always having the screen on affects the Watch’s almost two-week-long battery life.&lt;/p&gt;

OnePlus doesn’t provide a time frame as to when these updates will come out. But when they do, they’re sure to be a tad more exciting than the current update, which appears to mostly fix some of the larger bugs rather than add new features. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Two classic Ace Attorney games are finally coming out in English</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PZCekcHdcrYUz-P7vhc-y43E4hc=/80x0:944x576/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163733/TGAAC_Blog_09_Deduction_1024x576.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;The Great Ace Attorney Collection&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Capcom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VopO47"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.capcom-unity.com/2021/04/21/kurae-the-great-ace-attorney-chronicles-summons-you-to-court-on-july-27th/"&gt;Capcom announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will be releasing two classic games in the &lt;em&gt;Ace Attorney&lt;/em&gt; series in English for the first time this July. The new collection, titled &lt;em&gt;The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles&lt;/em&gt;, bundles &lt;em&gt;The Great Ace Attorney: Adventures&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Great Ace Attorney 2: Resolve &lt;/em&gt;in one package that will be available on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Steam for $39.99 on July 27th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kcDhgW"&gt;Unlike the &lt;em&gt;Ace Attorney&lt;/em&gt; games starring Phoenix Wright, which take place in modern day, &lt;em&gt;The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles&lt;/em&gt; are set in the late 19th century during the Meiji period and the Victorian era. You play as Ryūnosuke Naruhodō, a defense attorney and an ancestor of Wright, to try to prove that your clients are innocent in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FCclpn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s a character named Herlock Sholmes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wtkPS1"&gt;Like other &lt;em&gt;Ace Attorney&lt;/em&gt; games, you’ll team up with a motley crew of characters along the way, including a detective that’s actually named Herlock Sholmes. &lt;em&gt;The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles&lt;/em&gt; games also introduce a new element to the classic courtroom action: you’ll have to persuade a jury as part of your case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLd1iH"&gt;Capcom released a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aceattorneygame/status/1384884633893052419"&gt;six-and-a-half-minute video about the collection&lt;/a&gt;, which you can watch below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VlzCn1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="ja" dir="ltr"&gt;くらえ! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheGreatAceAttorneyChronicles?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TheGreatAceAttorneyChronicles&lt;/a&gt; collects the novel courtroom antics of two previously Japan-only games! Join Phoenix Wright’s ancestor Ryunosuke in thrilling court cases at the turn of the 20th century. Coming to Switch, PS4, and Steam July 27th!&lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="https://t.co/D1HjMzrLRP"&gt;https://t.co/D1HjMzrLRP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/t5cDIh5K7O"&gt;pic.twitter.com/t5cDIh5K7O&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ace Attorney (@aceattorneygame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aceattorneygame/status/1384884633893052419?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HvXZyr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles&lt;/em&gt; also offers a Story Mode that lets the game play itself so you can follow along with what’s going on as if it were a TV show or visual novel. The mode can be toggled on or off whenever you want, so I could see myself using it to get past a particularly tricky section. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IRHMao"&gt;The collection will have 10 episodes and “8 mini escapades” to play through, which Capcom says will offer more than 50 hours of gameplay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OP7A51"&gt;Capcom will also sell a digital bundle of &lt;em&gt;The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles&lt;/em&gt; with &lt;em&gt;Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy&lt;/em&gt; for $59.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom update delivers more emoji reactions and new annotation features </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IKWrpIKZeM_3wHoQCFuxbBEuIMk=/121x0:1495x916/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163606/Emoji_Set_GIF.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s now a much greater range of emoji to react with.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Zoom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Nt0iPJ"&gt;This week’s &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360059667111?_ga=2.82392468.323175728.1619014441-1917483163.1587296428"&gt;Zoom update&lt;/a&gt; includes a couple of quality of life improvements for anyone using its annotation or emoji reaction features, &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/updates-vanishing-pen-informacast-new-meeting-reactions-zoom-chat-management/"&gt;the company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Meeting participants can now use any emoji that was previously available in Zoom chat to react during a meeting, up from the six meager options that were available previously. These include emoji with different skin colors. Hosts can also restrict emoji reactions to the standard six, if they prefer, and for larger accounts the full emoji set must be manually enabled by admins or account owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9EUwl"&gt;The service’s annotation feature is also being enhanced. Anyone who’s used Zoom’s annotation feature to draw text on the presentation screen will know how annoying it quickly becomes when you have to erase each scribble before you can move on. Now, a new “Vanishing Pen” tool on Windows, macOS, and Linux allows annotations to automatically disappear within “a couple of seconds.” If you’re drawing annotations on an Android or iOS tablet, there’s a new auto-shape feature to turn them into straight lines, rectangles, and ovals. Combined, these should keep Zoom presentations looking neater.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WtU-84zqwcqva8X0r8a7yfY9jNw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459599/Vanishing_Pen_GIF.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Zoom&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Annotations with the Vanishing Pen disappear within a couple of seconds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DGsu6O"&gt;A year ago, as Zoom exploded in popularity, it was hard to talk about the service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202584/zoom-security-privacy-issues-video-conferencing-software-coronavirus-demand-response"&gt;without mentioning the privacy and security issues&lt;/a&gt; that were plaguing it at the time. Its encryption &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201234/zoom-end-to-end-encryption-video-chats-meetings"&gt;wasn’t actually end-to-end&lt;/a&gt;, and its default settings led to a wave of so-called “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21207260/zoombombing-crime-zoom-video-conference-hacking-pranks-doj-fbi"&gt;Zoombombings&lt;/a&gt;.” But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/4/3/21203720/zoom-backlash-apology-zoom-bombings-eric-yuan"&gt;in the year since&lt;/a&gt;, the company has rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21535818/zoom-end-to-end-encryption-e2ee-security-privacy-video-conferencing"&gt;fix&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570302/zoom-security-temporarily-shut-down-suspend-meetings-stop-zoombombers"&gt;fix&lt;/a&gt; for its biggest issues, and now here we are talking about new emoji reaction features. What a way to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the company’s founding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FFZLcs"&gt;

    <title>Big iPad, Mini LED: why Apple’s new iPad Pro display is better and brighter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/84SmiG_awBbaB7etdE6k2AxvGSg=/0x0:1668x1112/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163536/ipadprocrop.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6EkwEH"&gt;Apple’s latest iPad Pro might look very similar to the model it’s replacing, but it contains &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;several major upgrades on the inside&lt;/a&gt;. It’s got the same powerful, energy-efficient M1 chip as the latest MacBook Air, 13-inch MacBook Pro, Mac mini, and now the redesigned iMac. Cellular models have made the jump to 5G. The front-facing camera can zoom and pan to keep you in focus on video calls. But aside from the processor, the biggest technical leap is exclusive to the 12.9-inch iPad Pro: it’s what Apple calls the “Liquid Retina XDR,” a new display that adopts Mini LED backlighting to achieve higher brightness and greater contrast than any iPad (or Mac) that the company has ever made. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNYMdt"&gt;Apple says the 12.9-inch iPad Pro can reach 1,000 nits of full-screen brightness — on par with the ultra-expensive Pro Display XDR — and portions of the screen can hit an eye-searing 1,600 nits when playing HDR content. That’s brighter than many 4K HDR TVs on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLF1Xe"&gt;For comparison’s sake, the previous iPad Pro topped out at 600 nits. Full stop. These measurements also obliterate Apple’s Mac lineup. The 16-inch MacBook Pro can go up to 500 nits. The flashy 24-inch iMac introduced yesterday? Also 500 nits. Things move a little closer when you look at the iPhone 12 Pro’s OLED screen, which can hit a max brightness of 800 nits and 1,200 in HDR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbvOqZ"&gt;But Apple isn’t yet ready to make the switch to OLED for its tablets, and the reasoning probably comes down to the brightness advantage of Mini LED — plus the company’s promise that this iPad Pro, with its fancy display, still has the standard 10-hour battery life that iPad users have come to expect. Either way, this is an upgrade that should be plainly evident to the eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="20XTTP"&gt;What is Mini LED?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FRsI6s"&gt;Unlike OLED, where individual pixels are self-illuminating and can fully turn off when not needed, Mini LED is more of a natural progression from the LCD screens that have become such a mainstay of consumer electronics. But where this new approach differentiates itself is in the size and quantity of LEDs behind the screen. During its Spring Loaded event, Apple’s Heidi Delgado said that the previous iPad Pro had 72 LEDs, but the new “Liquid Retina XDR” manages to pack in over 10,000 of them. Apple accomplished this by miniaturizing the LEDs to a size “120 times smaller in volume than the previous design.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TynE4-W6Ht5SEGThE4vS914xSVI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459379/MiniLED.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple says the 12.9-inch iPad Pro has over 10,000 LEDs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9enWaW"&gt;The Mini LEDs are grouped into over 2,500 local dimming zones that can individually brighten and dim based on whatever’s being shown on the display. This granular level of control, according to Delgado, results in customers “seeing the brightest highlights along with subtle details in the darkest parts of an image.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UY5ocq8wXmPsr70iTw_OQ_biAp4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459369/Zones.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The dimming zones can light up and dim based on what’s on-screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lcvwE6"&gt;Apple isn’t first to Mini LED&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BW7aSj"&gt;Though this might be the first time Mini LED has found its way into a tablet, the technology has already appeared in TVs. &lt;a href="https://www.tcl.com/us/en/blog/article/mini-led-technology"&gt;TCL really sparked the trend&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, and apparently Samsung and LG took notice: their higher-end 2021 LCD TVs now utilize Mini LED backlighting as well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1aYqdAc47IEWfHdrjCihYfXLEjU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459345/Screen_Shot_2021_04_21_at_9.36.17_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A visualization of TCL’s Mini LED implementation on its TVs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FOPASo"&gt;Here’s how TCL explains the visual improvements:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="JlVqsN"&gt;LED LCD TVs have two parts of the display that combine together to create an image. The “LCD” (liquid crystal display) part of the display creates a picture and the “LED” (light-emitting diode) part of the display makes light that shines through the picture so your eyes can see it. So the benefit of thousands of precisely controlled mini-LEDs in an active matrix backlight is more powerful light that is more smoothly distributed across the screen, more precisely controlled for sharp contrast and more effective in creating vividly saturated colors that dazzle the eye. Mini-LED simply delivers dramatically better picture performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="iOxYD4"&gt;The huge uptick in LEDs could also result in improved panel uniformity; some owners of the previous 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPad Pros &lt;a href="https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/uneven-backlight-on-11-ipad-pro.2154729/"&gt;have observed uneven backlighting&lt;/a&gt;. Having exchanged one or two for this very reason, I can vouch. The “panel lottery” is a thing with pretty much any device — TVs, laptops, tablets, etc. — but making the move to Mini LED should help with consistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zn1jun"&gt;What’s this I hear about MicroLED?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ebps60"&gt;MicroLED is seen as the next major leap in TV display technology and the potential successor to OLED. It shares many of OLED’s best traits (like self-emissive LEDs), ups the brightness, and comes without most of the associated drawbacks since the technology is inorganic. But right now, MicroLED is extremely cost prohibitive and really only found in ultra-premium luxury TVs from Samsung. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4I43B"&gt;Final impressions on the new iPad Pro will need to wait until we get it in our hands. But as someone who uses the previous 12.9-inch model daily for productive and creative purposes, I’m very curious to see what Mini LED adds to the iPad experience.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Meet is getting a UI refresh next month with smarter meeting features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FqqxuTTSK1z1KxluRqBqTS12So8=/0x0:1980x1320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69163540/googlemeetnewui.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Meet’s new user interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PZLbIv"&gt;Google is refreshing its Meet user interface next month for desktop and laptop users. The new Meet for web interface includes improvements to video feeds, how you view or present meetings, and the navigation bar. While some of Google’s changes are playing catch-up to what’s offered in Zoom or Microsoft Teams, they are much-needed additions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EbRoIh"&gt;If you’re fed up of seeing your own face during calls, you’ll soon be able to minimize or hide it entirely. New options will also include the ability to place your own video feed in a tile in the grid of meeting participants, or a floating picture that can be resized and repositioned. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/leYGYyMH1lJi1ScV2VNUINZ4hUc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459260/image001.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Meet will soon let you adjust your own video feed position.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u6o7e9"&gt;If you’re busy presenting, Google is also improving how content is pinned and unpinned. You’ll soon be able to quickly unpin a presentation tile, and it resizes into the same size as other participants so you can see more people on a call or figure out if people were impressed by your slick slide transitions. In the coming months, Google Meet will also let participants pin multiple video feeds during a call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OOjczX"&gt;One of the most useful changes is improvements to the bottom bar of meetings to put all controls in a single place. That means chat, attachments, and the participants list are all at the bottom so there’s more space to see people and whatever is being presented during a call. Google is also moving the end call button away from the camera and microphone buttons so you don’t accidentally leave a call instead of mute.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ioEb817hHVhc255jla0AqT3u99E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22459261/image004.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Meet will improve webcam brightness and visibility.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CdCIZ7"&gt;Alongside these UI improvements, Google is bringing its low-light mode from Meet on mobile over to the web version. This feature will automatically adjust your webcam video to make you more visible if you’re in a dark room. It will also adjust your video if you have too much light blasting in from a window behind you on a sunny day. This light adjustment feature will be available to all Meet users on the web in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LCSBre"&gt;Google Workspace (paid) subscribers will also get access to a new autozoom feature in Google Meet in the coming months. This AI-powered feature will follow you and position you squarely in front of your camera if you move around. Google is also adding video background replacement to Meet in the coming weeks, allowing you to pick between a classroom, a party, and a forest to replace your background. More video backgrounds will be available in the future, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VsVAsZ"&gt;A bipartisan group of lawmakers has proposed banning police from buying access to user data from data brokers, including ones that “illegitimately obtained” their records — like, its sponsors say, the facial recognition service Clearview AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YySg5R"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/The%20Fourth%20Amendment%20Is%20Not%20For%20Sale%20Act%20of%202021%20Bill%20Text.pdf"&gt;The Fourth Amendment Is Not For Sale Act&lt;/a&gt; is sponsored by a bipartisan group including Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), and 18 other members of the Senate. The bill would make law enforcement agencies obtain a court order before accessing people’s personal information through third-party brokers — companies that aggregate and sell information like &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/federal-agencies-use-cellphone-location-data-for-immigration-enforcement-11581078600"&gt;detailed user location data&lt;/a&gt;, surreptitiously gathered from smartphone apps or other sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yKJ5cG"&gt;Wyden announced the bill last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21354244/ron-wyden-fcc-nomination-section-230-trump-order-vergecast-interview"&gt;in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, following reports that several government agencies had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303190/congress-data-smartphone-tracking-fbi-security-privacy"&gt;purchased citizens’ location data&lt;/a&gt; through a service named Venntel rather than obtaining it through a warrant. “There’s no reason information scavenged by data brokers should be treated differently than the same data held by your phone company or email provider,” Wyden said in a statement today. “This bill closes that legal loophole and ensures that the government can’t use its credit card to end-run the Fourth Amendment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5DIUx"&gt;The bill also takes aim at services that scrape and repurpose social media data for tracking purposes. It bars paying for what it calls “illegitimately obtained information,” including information that was gathered through deception and hacking or in a way that’s inconsistent with the privacy policy of the platform where people posted it. &lt;a href="https://www.wyden.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/The%20Fourth%20Amendment%20Is%20Not%20For%20Sale%20Act%20of%202021%20One%20Pager.pdf"&gt;In a press release&lt;/a&gt;, the sponsors say that would prohibit buying facial recognition services from Clearview AI, which trains its models on photographs that users posted on social networks. Currently, “Clearview AI uses these illicitly obtained photos to power a facial recognition service it sells to government agencies, which they can search without a court order,” the release says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pD4619"&gt;Reps. Jerry Nadler (D-NY) and Zoe Lofgren (D-CA) introduced equivalent legislation in the House of Representatives.&lt;/p&gt;
