    <title>One of our favorite gaming laptops is $330 off at Dell today</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kbdl0T"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328344/dell-g5-15-se-review-2020-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen"&gt;Our review of the Dell G5 15 SE&lt;/a&gt; cemented it as one of our favorite gaming laptops of last year. More than a year later, however, this laptop still packs plenty of power and its most powerful configuration is &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-14349898?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeals.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fproductdetail%2Fafwn" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Dell for just $900&lt;/a&gt;. While Dell’s gaming laptops typically use Intel-based architecture, the G15 SE instead relies entirely on AMD hardware. A Ryzen 7 4800H CPU capable of delivering speeds up to 4.2 GHz and a 6GB RX 5600M GPU deliver excellent performance for 1080p gaming. While we weren’t thrilled with the aesthetics of this laptop, we couldn’t argue with the overall performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PvHMuh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best gaming laptops for 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="9yWRfR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505968"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9whHo3"&gt;A favorite among &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features"&gt;our review of the Xbox Elite Series 2&lt;/a&gt; should give you some idea about how much we love this controller. Right now, you can add this beast to your gaming arsenal for $158, its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07SFKTLZM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lowest price ever at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This model brings back the backside paddles of its predecessor, as well as the swappable thumb sticks and a D-pad. Perhaps the controller’s biggest improvement, however, is its built-in rechargeable battery, which can last up to 40 hours on a single charge and can be recharged via the clamshell case, which doubles as a charging dock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DJoSrB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10763457"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2E0Riz"&gt;Looking to upgrade your aging gaming setup at home? If so, the curvaceous Razer Iskur gaming chair has received a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Iskur-Gaming-Chair-Multi-Layered-High-Density/dp/B08WVT8TYQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hefty discount on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, making it just $400 for a limited time. While it definitely raised some eyebrows last year with its snakeskin aesthetic, the Razer Iskur has proven itself to be one of the most comfortable gaming chairs in its class. The Iskur has a wide variety of adjustment options, as well as uniquely pronounced lumbar support that can be moved based on your height and posture. While its price point is certainly a bit on the high side, the Razer Iskur is a great investment for anyone who spends a considerable amount of time planted behind a desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="llmbZi"&gt;The cringe-inducing humor of &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3&lt;/em&gt; can be yours today for just &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfCIgvdH26e" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$10 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The writing of the Borderlands series has always been divisive, but regardless of your stance on poop humor, the gameplay remains extremely addictive. A staple of the loot-shooter genre, &lt;em&gt;Borderlands 3&lt;/em&gt; marries a virtually limitless number of weapon combinations with RPG-style character builds and its own unique brand of comedy. While it definitely has more than enough features and content for an engaging single-player experience, the game also supports up to four players via online co-op. Right now, Best Buy is offering $20 off the physical version of the popular title on &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfCIgvdH26e" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt; (PS4 and PS5 compatible) and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1752590262130868900" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; (Xbox One and Xbox Series S / X compatible).

    <title>Amazon’s new Kindle Paperwhite adds a bigger screen, longer battery life, and USB-C</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fsTn0JaJHG46SoYvY9qEuw0GbXI=/144x0:2547x1602/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69887568/Kindle_Paperwhite__Lifestyle_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="olqfaL"&gt;Amazon is refreshing the Kindle Paperwhite for the first time in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review"&gt;nearly three years&lt;/a&gt; with an updated model, adding a bigger 6.8-inch E-Ink display that’s brighter and has adjustable color temperature, USB-C charging, a faster processor, and weeks more in battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01lJ0F"&gt;The current Kindle Paperwhite has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/1/18245079/best-e-reader-amazon-kindle-kobo-ebooks"&gt;been Amazon’s best e-reader&lt;/a&gt; since it was released nearly three years ago, and Amazon isn’t messing with the formula too much. The new model’s design is similar to the old one, with a flush-mounted display, built-in backlight, 300 PPI resolution for crisp text, and IPX8 waterproofing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XWFMqa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Finally, a USB-C Kindle&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OzJVX8"&gt;The new model, however, looks to improve on virtually every aspect of the e-reader. The battery has been boosted from six weeks to approximately 10 weeks from a single charge. Charging itself is faster: thanks to USB-C, the device can fully charge in about two and a half hours. There’s a new SoC, which (combined with software improvements) Amazon says offers a 20 percent improvement in performance. And the color-temperature changing tech that Amazon debuted on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display"&gt;2019 Kindle Oasis&lt;/a&gt; has made its way down to the more affordable Paperwhite for reading at night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xo7qCc"&gt;The most noticeable change, however, is the bigger display, which is jumping from six inches to a 6.8-inch panel. Amazon is still maintaining the same 300 PPI pixel density, so text will look just as crisp despite the larger display.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A3BSA6SB6YuCKsbT_sVOctUjTvY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865670/Kindle_Paperwhite_Signature_Edition.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TT86zW"&gt;In order to achieve that minimal increase in size, Amazon has shrunken down the bezels on the new Paperwhite. Given that the bezels are the primary place that you generally hold a Kindle, we’ll have to see the new device in person to gauge how that change works, although generally smaller bezels are a good thing in the tech world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ql9JGt"&gt;The new Paperwhite models will also feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671844/amazon-kindle-e-reader-interface-design-changes"&gt;Amazon’s updated Kindle software&lt;/a&gt; that it announced earlier in September; at launch, they’ll offer the new smartphone-style swipe-down settings menu and a new menu bar at the bottom of the homescreen. An additional update is planned for later in the year that will more substantially update the homescreen and library menus with more scrollable interfaces. Additionally, Amazon is introducing a new log-on system with the new Paperwhites that will add the option to log in using a Kindle app on a smartphone instead of having to struggle with the Kindle’s on-device keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hXyRC"&gt;For the first time, Amazon is also introducing a pricier, upgraded version of the Paperwhite alongside the base model: the Paperwhite Signature Edition, which is identical to the standard version, with three differences. First, it adds Qi wireless charging to make it easier to recharge. Second, it offers 32GB of storage, compared to the 8GB on the standard model. And lastly, it offers the automatically adjusting light sensor that Amazon had previously only offered on the Oasis (whereas the base model has to manually adjust things). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8lcqDqRlXRVK9uC_C-3iNWRlaCM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865669/Kindle_Paperwhite__Covers.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MxtZsq"&gt;While the new Paperwhite — and in particular, the Paperwhite Signature — have gotten the top-tier Oasis model’s most obvious standout features, the $250 model still has a few additional differences that leave it at the top of the pack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6zfUWN"&gt;The Oasis still has the largest display of any Kindle (a seven-inch E-Ink panel, compared to the Paperwhite’s 6.8-inch display), and it features 25 LEDs for a brighter overall display. The Oasis also has its unique form factor, with an aluminum body, rotating display, and physical page turn buttons that Amazon’s cheaper models still lack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imH4sX"&gt;That said, hopefully Amazon will borrow a few features from the refreshed Paperwhites, like USB-C charging and the Paperwhite Signature’s wireless Qi charging, for its next Oasis refresh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iTqKtg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The updates come with a $10 price increase&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zh21BI"&gt;The new improvements do come with a cost, though: the new Paperwhite starts at $139 (a $10 increase from the 2018 model), and the Paperwhite Signature Edition starts at $189. Those prices are for the ad-supported models; getting a Paperwhite without ads will add $20 to the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgaH9g"&gt;Amazon is also selling a Kindlewhite Kids Edition with the new model for $159, which includes a Paperwhite, a kid-friendly cover, a year of Amazon Kids Plus, and a two-year extended replacement program, similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/7/20902588/kindle-kids-edition-amazon-bundle-young-e-reader-case-replacement-program-freetime"&gt;existing bundle Amazon has for the base Kindle model&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTkC0c"&gt;Orders for the new Paperwhite models start today, with the new e-readers expected to ship starting October 27th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N6wls9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aMGPL1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cJyzO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fitbit Charge 5 review: touchscreen fatigue</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The hardware is nice, but no physical button is a big step back&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="bEvTFr"&gt;Fitbit’s newest fitness tracker, the Charge 5, might be the biggest change to the Charge line yet. It has a color screen, the first for a Charge, and you can opt to keep the screen on all the time. It has a new rounded design that’s thinner than the Charge 4. New sensors measure how your body responds to stress. But all that change also comes at a higher $179.95 price, a $30 increase from the Charge 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="skm5ru"&gt;That more expensive cost edges the Charge line closer to the prices of many smartwatches. So in reviewing the Charge 5, I wanted to figure out if it offers enough at that price to make it a compelling fitness device than the more costly smartwatch competitors. To do that, after I got the Charge 5, I picked up an Apple Watch SE to compare it with, set them both up, put one on each wrist, and promptly went on a four-hour marathon training run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLAuzH"&gt;To my disappointment, the Charge 5 didn’t fare well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nzajz8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10763493"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dhyVIj"&gt;Before I go further, I should tell you what I need a fitness tracker or smartwatch for. I’ll be the first to admit that it’s a somewhat specific set of requirements and needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gTUFy"&gt;My favorite form of exercise is running. I happily submit myself to multi-hour runs many weekends of the year. I don’t really care about running fast; instead, I like to run far. So when I’m on a run, I want a fitness tracker to tell me how far I’ve run, how long I’ve been running for, what time it is, and my heart rate. The Charge 5 did tell me all of these things. However, it did so much less elegantly than the Apple Watch did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NaCo1s"&gt;Many of my frustrations come down to the Charge 5’s small 14.7mm x 21.9mm screen, which is surrounded by much bigger bezels than the official product shots would suggest, and its UI, which isn’t as easily glanceable as I would have liked. During a run, the Charge 5 shows three metrics at a time, and two of them are always visible in small font at the top and bottom of your screen: your mileage and how long you’ve been running. Handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s66bDH"&gt;But in the middle of the screen, you can only see one of &lt;em&gt;nine&lt;/em&gt; other metrics at a time, such as pace, heart rate, and step count. To get to the next metric, you have to tap the screen to advance them one by one. Infuriatingly, I couldn’t figure out a way to go &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; to a metric if I accidentally tapped past the one I was looking for, often meaning I would be tapping the screen repeatedly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FCpAEv"&gt;The Charge 5’s small screen is also poorly optimized for showing long run times. During my training run, I liked having the length of my run shown as the main metric in the middle of the screen. But after I crossed two hours, I noticed that the Charge 5’s screen cut off part of the time on both ends. It looks ridiculous — see for yourself below — though Fitbit tells me that this will be fixed for final retail units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sR4-svR_5kBBuhR96UhWAIw12ro=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864043/jpeters_210910_4757_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fitbit says that the time being cut off will be fixed in final retail units. Also, sorry to subject you to my sweaty arm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sOyNnh"&gt;Also annoying is the fact that the Charge 5 has no physical buttons, meaning you have to wake up the screen by raising your wrist or by tapping on the screen. Many times during my four-hour run, I would tap on the Charge 5’s screen a couple times to wake it, only to accidentally tap past the last metric I had up, forcing me to &lt;em&gt;keep&lt;/em&gt; tapping just to return to where I was before. This was very annoying, and I often had to completely stop running so I could tap the screen enough times to get my Charge 5 situated again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gr6rOa"&gt;The Apple Watch, on the other hand (pun intended), showed me all of the stats I care about on one screen, no extra tapping required. And because I can use the digital crown &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; the button on the side to wake it up, I never felt any risk of tapping something I shouldn’t that would mess up my run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RoCjHF"&gt;Interestingly, the Charge 5 and Apple Watch SE recorded some different metrics when I took them out on runs. The Charge 5’s metrics portrayed me as a better runner; across two runs, the Charge 5 recorded slightly longer distances and slightly faster paces than the Apple Watch SE did. But it’s hard to know which is truly accurate. According to MapMyRun, which lets you plot runs on Google Maps, one of my routes was 6.28 miles, but the Charge 5 recorded it as 6.1 miles and the SE tracked it as 6.02.  Both devices, however, tracked the exact same average heart rate across both runs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RYPian"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10759531"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KTVY9n"&gt;(Unfortunately, I don’t have comparative data for my four-hour run because at one point I accidentally paused run-tracking on the Charge 5 for 20 minutes. This was my fault, not the Fitbit’s.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63cbEm"&gt;Runs are my happy place — especially really long ones. I like to run in a forest while listening to podcasts or music. I haven’t relied on a fitness tracker in years, instead using a cheap Casio watch to track my time. But after a week of running with both the Fitbit Charge 5 and the Apple Watch SE, if I had to pick just one for future long runs, I’d grab the Apple Watch every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="kyXIVy"&gt;
&lt;p id="wLwefn"&gt;When I’m not running, I want my fitness tracker to be as inert as possible. I typically turn off as many notifications and buzzers as I can. I try to keep a relatively simple face. The Charge 5 works fine for this, though I have some annoyances with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VVpRwQ"&gt;I love that the Charge 5 is smaller and lighter than the Apple Watch; it’s much more comfortable to wear and I regularly forget that it’s on my wrist. But I think the change to remove any sort of physical button-like mechanism is a step back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJCEyw"&gt;The Charge 3 and 4 created the illusion of a button with a small capacitive ridge that had haptic feedback when you pressed it. When using the Charge 4, if I ever got buried in menus, I’d just mash the “button” a bunch of times until I got back to the main homescreen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pCaCTd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10763402"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jX2vcU"&gt;But without buttons on the Charge 5, diving into menus almost feels like you can get lost. There’s no clear way to return to the main watchface, which was frustrating at first. I eventually learned that you can double tap the screen to return to the homescreen (which, to Fitbit’s credit, is something the app tells you when you set up the Charge 5, but I missed it). Doing that double tap is nerve-wracking, though. Every time I was about to do the double tap, I’d hold my breath, tap twice quickly on the screen, and hope that I didn’t accidentally tap something I didn’t want to just to return home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnSqnD"&gt;I also wished there was a button I could use as a reliable way to turn on the screen. Sometimes, I’d rotate my wrist up or double tap the Charge 5 to wake it up, but it just wouldn’t turn on. That would force me to rotate my wrist a few times or tap the screen in frustration to try to turn it on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBB7kS"&gt;The always-on display isn’t the best fix because it has some annoyances, too. Like other always-on displays, when activated, you can’t actually interact with anything on the Charge 5 until you lift your wrist or tap on the screen. When you do that, the screen briefly flickers off and on again before you can use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gbHidk"&gt;Fitbit also estimates a dramatic reduction in battery life when you use the always-on display — from seven days to two — meaning you will have to charge the device a lot more if you use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z1St8u"&gt;That said, in my testing, the battery has been excellent. In the nearly two weeks I’ve been testing the Charge 5, I’ve only plugged it in three times&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; toggling on the always-on display for a few hours here and there throughout. (Though to be fair, when I went on the four-hour training run, I had accidentally turned off the heart rate monitor, which might have saved some battery.) If you don’t have the screen on all the time, you should get multiple days on a single charge. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WSdSi1"&gt;If you do want to use your Charge 5 like a smartwatch, there are some limitations. While the Charge 5 can notify you about calls, texts, meeting alerts, and updates from certain apps, you can only send quick replies to text messages and messages from some apps if you’re on Android. As an iPhone user, this provided a half-baked experience whenever a text message came in; while it was easy to look at texts, actually responding to them forced me to pull out my phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHIXac"&gt;There’s no native way to sync your Fitbit data to Apple Health or Google Fit, so your stats won’t show up on those platforms. There aren’t any third-party apps for the Charge 5. And there’s no built-in voice assistant, like you might find on an Apple Watch or a Wear OS smartwatch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v0C2gDJgcgpeBoRbjtuI8WrxZTg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864049/jpeters_210914_4757_0008.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Charge 4 (left) next to the Charge 5 (right). There’s nothing actually wrong with the Charge 4’s screen, it just photographed this way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oCmzx1"&gt;Fitbit is advertising a few new health features for the Charge 5, including the new electrodermal activity (EDA) sensor to measure how your body responds to stress. (Fitbit introduced this feature with last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21450123/fitbit-sense-review"&gt;Fitbit Sense smartwatch&lt;/a&gt;.) Once you’ve started the reading, you put two fingers on the sides of the Charge 5 and hold them there for two to seven minutes (you can customize the length). After, you’re asked to record your mood, and then the Fitbit will tell you more detail about your scan. Fitbit can also give you a Stress Management Score, but you’ll only be able to access a detailed report about it if you’re a Fitbit Premium subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vvdrdT"&gt;Two other features aren’t ready yet, though, so I couldn’t test them. One is the “Daily Readiness Score,” a Fitbit Premium-exclusive feature that recommends how hard you should work out based on factors like your recent activity and quality of sleep. Fitbit says that feature is “coming soon,” and it’s not a Charge 5-exclusive feature; it will also be available on the Fitbit Sense, Versa 3, Versa 2, Luxe, and Inspire 2. An ECG app is on the way, too, but that also has a vague “coming soon” release window. When I asked, the company wouldn’t give a more specific timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PD0w6u"&gt;The Charge 5 is available to preorder now, though Fitbit wouldn’t share a more specific timeline for shipping beyond “late September.” (Amazon’s listing &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Advanced-Management-Tracking-Included/dp/B09BXDZ9BD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for the Charge 5&lt;/a&gt; says it will be released on September 27th, however.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWOJlA"&gt;Overall, it’s hard for me to recommend the Charge 5. It’s a capable fitness tracker, and it offers a lot of features found on more expensive smartwatches at a lower price. But the small display, lack of a physical button, and sometimes poor UI mean it can be a hassle to use. For me, any annoyances are magnified when I have to deal with them in the middle of a run. Until Fitbit fixes those, you might want to consider something else.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 Pro review: a better display, the best camera, and incredible battery life</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Smooth operators&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="lVLDlO"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and 13 Pro Max are phones designed for people who care about the details. The improvements over last year’s iPhones are significant but not obvious at first glance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYOJiC"&gt;Just as with the regular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;iPhone 13 and 13 Mini&lt;/a&gt;, the most important upgrades on the 13 Pro are to battery life and the camera system. The 13 Pro adds a third major improvement with a high refresh rate screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZy42V"&gt;Upgrading the battery, camera, and screen sounds like an iterative, yearly update; they sound like the so-called “S” updates that Apple used to do for iPhones before its naming schemes became unpredictable. And it is true that the design is virtually identical to that of last year’s iPhone 12 Pros. But those assumptions — those words — don’t quite do justice to how big the changes really are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SieXlO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10764115"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HDtzdX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We will update this review with a full score and scorecard for the iPhone 13 Pro Max after further battery testing, but see below for initial impressions. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro is a bit thicker because of a larger battery, so iPhone 12 Pro cases won’t fit." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ny6ArzeT0abX7U_ZwlO2TJfb_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863285/vpavic_210916_untitled_0027.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro is a bit thicker because of a larger battery, so iPhone 12 Pro cases won’t fit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gMdpOS"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6BiRNN"&gt;The change that’s most likely to make the biggest impact for the most people is battery life. Apple is happy to tell you that the battery improvements come from a constellation of updates, including increased efficiency in the new A15 Bionic processor and changes to how the new display uses power. I am sure all that is true, but I’m just as sure that the biggest contributor is simply that the batteries are bigger than last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDhFmY"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22678607/iphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison"&gt;13 Pro has an 11 percent larger battery and the 13 Pro Max’s battery is an astonishing 18.5 percent larger&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s quoted improvements over the 12 Pro models are one and a half hours more usage on the 13 Pro and two and a half hours on the 13 Pro Max — and the 12 Pro Max was &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; a battery life monster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Scpobu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The battery life improvement isn’t complicated; it’s a bigger battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1ln2RL"&gt;I’ve only had the phones for a little less than a week, so I focused most of my use on the smaller iPhone 13 Pro as a kind of worst-case test. And my results are in line with Apple’s claims. On a day when we really pushed the phone with lots of 4K video and max brightness on the screen, it still lasted from early morning to 11PM with 20 percent remaining — with somewhere north of four hours of very heavy use in the screen time tracking app. A day with less intense usage clocked me at seven hours of screen on time before the low battery warning kicked in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G2OPp4"&gt;Although I haven’t used the 13 Pro Max as much, I expect it will do even better. A few times the past week I caught myself doing a double take, wondering why its battery was so full even though I’d been using it intensively. I will check back in to this review with an update after I’ve had a chance to do more testing with it (and with its opposite, the regular iPhone 13 MIni).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WII3Gv"&gt;Bottom line: I have much more confidence walking out of the house for a long day without carrying an external battery pack. For me, the line a smartphone needs to cross is that I trust I can get through a normal day without battery anxiety. Both the 13 Pro and the 13 Pro Max easily get there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max keep the major redesigns introduced last year — they still feel fresh and modern." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bLp7mtnBqNSAknvlWtvU99sTY0M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863286/vpavic_210916_untitled_0031.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max keep the major redesigns introduced last year — they still feel fresh and modern.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RQlOiN"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro design and specs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="occrhj"&gt;Last year was a big design update for the iPhone, with flat sides, 5G, and MagSafe charging. This year’s models inherit all of that, changing the design in only minor ways. The most obvious one is the notch on the screen. It’s slightly smaller, but only horizontally — it still pushes down into what you’re looking at to the same degree. Apple also didn’t do anything with that extra space at the top, meaning you still can’t see your battery percentage without pulling down the control center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JK7xVY"&gt;The other design change is that the new iPhones are almost imperceptibly heavier and also thicker across the entire body compared to last year’s models. But the camera bumps on both phones are significantly bigger, which means that 12 Pro cases are not going to fit on the 13 Pro. I think the tradeoffs are worth it for the improved battery life and camera system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="pcyWDI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The design is virtually identical to the iPhone 12 Pro models&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The smaller notch on the iPhone 13 Pro Max (left) compared to the 12 Pro Max (right)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l2z2yR_DeXfOX9MEg6-o6IBv9j8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863283/vpavic_210916_untitled_0004.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The smaller notch on the iPhone 13 Pro Max (left) compared to the 12 Pro Max (right)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PMFKfj"&gt;Unlike many Android phones with gently curving displays at the edges, Apple does still have a small bezel around the screen. The rails on the edges are glossy stainless steel that pick up fingerprints, the glass on the back is a smooth matte. The front uses Apple’s Ceramic Shield finish to prevent cracks and the camera lenses are sapphire. It’s a beautiful phone, and I think it’s a huge step up from the curved sides we’ve seen on iPhones from the 6 all the way up through the 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpGUZC"&gt;The important spec outside of the camera system and the screen is the new A15 Bionic processor, which is indeed fast. But as always with iPhones, the primary purpose of that speed is ensuring the phone will still feel fast in years to come, not making it seem faster than last year’s device. There are a bunch of camera features that seem to be enabled by the A15, however. I’ll also just point out that the 13 Pro models get five GPU cores to the regular 13’s four, but that extra core doesn’t seem to enable anything specific beyond more speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l76YW8"&gt;Base storage still starts at 128GB, but at the top end there’s a new 1TB option. That is a ridiculous amount of storage for a phone, but if you’re planning on shooting a bunch of ProRes video then it might be something to actually consider. Screen sizes and resolutions are the same: 6.1 inches at 1170 x 2532 pixels for the 13 Pro and 6.7 inches at 1284 x 2778 pixels for the 13 Pro Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hoSEK"&gt;In terms of networking, Apple is focused on expanding support for Mid-Band 5G — the kind that will actually matter more than the UWB version that’s only really available on certain street corners. All that really means is that in the US, the 13 Pro is ready for a 5G future that could come if carriers keep their promises (they haven’t so far, but maybe next year). As usual, if you travel a lot you should keep an eye on the bands available on the &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/watch-out-with-iphone-13-there-are-now-5-different-iphone-models-by-country"&gt;several variants that are sold in different regions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OPPFI"&gt;Finally, although I know it’s a lost cause and that I sound like a broken record, I still believe that Apple should switch the iPhone from the Lightning connector to USB-C. I also still believe Apple made a mistake by not taking advantage of the obvious opportunities to do so with the big iPhone X and iPhone 12 redesigns. I understand the reasons why it hasn’t switched and I disagree with them. Especially on a “Pro” phone, the standard cable would be incredibly convenient and useful for both charging and connecting other accessories without adapters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The camera system on the iPhone 13 Pro is a major upgrade." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G-51a5mInUeU_ZboyZk_s8FIAOU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863264/akrales_210917_4760_0441.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera system on the iPhone 13 Pro is a major upgrade.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8HH3XY"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro cameras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XjydBk"&gt;The camera systems on the iPhone 13 Pro and the 13 Pro Max are identical this year, which means you don’t have to buy the bigger and more expensive phone to get the best photos.  And I do mean best photos, because there isn’t another phone on the market that can match the iPhone 13 Pro. (Google’s upcoming Pixel 6 hasn’t been released as of writing this, of course, but it will have its work cut out for it.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qQNuIQ"&gt;Apple’s marketing for the camera system on the 13 Pro is that it’s the “biggest advancement ever.” I don’t know that I would go that far, but I also can’t remember the last time I’ve said “whoa, look at this photo” as many times as I have during this review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="f6FaKN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The best cameras on a smartphone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BwoSXP"&gt;I will start, however, by pointing out that this camera system is one of the things I’m referring to when I say that the 13 Pro is a phone for people who pay attention to the details. In bright sunlight or normal light, the pictures these phones take are very hard to distinguish from the iPhone 13 or even the iPhone 12. In good lighting, almost any high-end smartphone is very competent these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tB58i"&gt;Where the Pro 13 camera system shines is in low light. The main wide-angle sensor has seen a massive upgrade this year. Unlike Android phones that are chasing big megapixel counts and then “pixel binning” to achieve low light performance, Apple is sticking with 12 megapixels, the same resolution it’s used since 2015’s iPhone 6S. The sensor itself is much bigger now and features 1.9 µm pixels, which are about as big as anything we’ve seen on a smartphone. And on top of all that, the lens now has an f/1.5 aperture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9snyn"&gt;All of that adds up to a camera that can very quickly take in a massive amount of light relative to other phones. Combined with some tuning and improvements to Apple’s computational photography, the low light performance on the 13 Pro is simply second to none. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The 13 Pro and Pro Max have much better low light performance, but it’s not immediately obvious on smaller screens" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xNiF1qTIUPjGNK0aDdI0Hg4KaOQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864637/pro_IMG_387230.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 13 Pro and Pro Max have much better low light performance, but it’s not immediately obvious on smaller screens&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Color reproduction in darker scenes is much improved compared to last year" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qELZZp--7dGKjSn1RqYv3uJ8lTI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864636/pro_IMG_384027.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Color reproduction in darker scenes is much improved compared to last year&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xHDLat"&gt;There’s less image noise in low light and more dynamic range in low and even medium light. Apple also tells me it has adjusted how it handles the black point so shadow exposure is more accurate now too — the 13 Pro is just more willing to let darks be dark while accurately exposing lighter areas. In situations the 12 Pro would aggressively hop into night mode and lighten everything up, the 13 Pro often doesn’t need night mode. And when the 13 Pro does drop into night mode, it goes through that exposure process twice as quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0qEtF5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10763684"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JEN10O"&gt;We used this word last year in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;12 Pro Max review&lt;/a&gt;, but I think it applies even more this year. The camera on the 13 Pro is &lt;em&gt;confident.&lt;/em&gt; As computational photography has become the norm over the past few years, I have seen lots of camera systems — including on the iPhone — just sort of panic and do the wrong things with exposure or tone. The iPhone 13 Pro has almost never done that in my testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SsHBzJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10763672"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Is8rtY"&gt;Let’s bring things back to earth. Will most people notice the quality difference between the 13 Pro and the regular iPhone 13 or even last year’s iPhones? Most of the time, I think the answer is actually no. On phone screens, you really have to zoom in and pixel peep to see it. But if there’s any place where I think it makes sense to call an iPhone “Pro” as in “for professionals,” I think this main wide angle camera is it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrLtfy"&gt;The ultrawide camera also got an upgrade in terms of taking in more light, but it’s not as dramatic a difference. A more interesting upgrade is adding autofocus to that camera, which allows it to pick up a new trick: macro photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Macro mode kicks in automatically at around 10cm from a subject" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/idnl0a8E2FeczI16Oy53UzoyQbk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864666/pro_IMG_022307.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Macro mode kicks in automatically at around 10cm from a subject&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ultrawide camera has better low light performance, but not dramatically so" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JECJG9xniss22pVNWNxDdoZ_xlE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864676/pro_IMG_388931.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ultrawide camera has better low light performance, but not dramatically so&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6Bqd7"&gt;When you bring the phone in close to a subject, you can see the camera frame switch over to the ultrawide when it’s about 10cm away. It tries to keep the same basic framing with a crop, but apparently not everybody is enthused: Apple emailed us the night before the review to say it would ship a software update later with an option to disable the automatic switchover. Then you can keep pushing in until you’re as close as 2cm away and still have an in-focus shot. The photos it takes are better than the bespoke, throwaway macro lenses on many Android phones these days. It’s a fun feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6s3uz"&gt;The wide angle camera has gotten the most impressive upgrade, but my favorite is the new telephoto lens. Apple has set it to a 3X zoom, the equivalent of a 77mm focal length and up from the 2.5X / 65mm in the 12 Pro Max. That extended zoom does mean that it drops to an f/2.8 aperture (from f/2.2), but whatever low light losses that entails are more than made up for by the addition of night mode for this lens. Apple isn’t playing the superzoom 100X game; instead, it’s focusing on quality at the 3X optical zoom for things like portrait photography. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new telephoto lens takes amazing portrait photos, but takes some effort to get good shots in low light" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ylna0kEm-Pig_PHBswqpjhrljDE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864680/pro_IMG_016205.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new telephoto lens takes amazing portrait photos, but takes some effort to get good shots in low light&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Lxz8xA"&gt;And that quality is incredible. I simply love taking photos of people with the telephoto at 3X now, getting a natural bokeh effect without having to engage the software portrait mode. The telephoto lens gets the award this year for most improved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V3fn2f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10763698"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8hwkE4"&gt;Apple has held the crown for best smartphone video for a very long time now, challenged (but not losing) only briefly by the Samsung Galaxy Ultra series phones in the last year or two. This year, video quality is simply amazing, at least on the wide angle camera. That larger sensor and the fact that it’s using sensor-based stabilization instead of just OIS makes for stable and beautiful footage even in low light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QxNQn"&gt;Apple will also let you shoot video in ProRes this year. I didn’t have much time to test that and ProRes isn’t really a part of our video workflow. But it’s there if you buy an iPhone that has enough storage to handle it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFmse8"&gt;I’ll state it plainly because it bears repeating: the iPhone 13 Pro has the best camera system on any smartphone available as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photographic Profiles make the iPhone take photos that look more like what Samsung and Google’s phones take&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xNMM6c"&gt;Photographic Profiles&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TUVWr1"&gt;Apple has added two new camera modes to this year’s iPhones, both Pro and regular. Each is fascinating in its own way. Cinematic Mode is essentially Portrait Mode but for video, while Picture Profiles change the default way the iPhone takes photos. Picture Profiles are particularly interesting because they serve almost as an admission that Apple is feeling competitive pressure from the likes of Samsung and Google, so let’s start there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5cJno"&gt;Profiles are a new setting in the camera app that change the way your photos look by default. So instead of applying a filter after the photo is taken, you can set your iPhone to have a specific kind of “look” right away. In fact, Apple insists that Profiles are not filters at all, for reasons I’ll get into shortly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1v5ctq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10764311"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dad4CO"&gt;The default options for Profiles include Standard, Rich Contrast, Vibrant, Warm, and Cool. Each one has its own little sliders that you can manually tweak for both Tone and Warmth. If you tweak those sliders, the name of that profile cleverly changes to match your settings (my personal favorite name is “Rich Cool,” because I imagine that’s Apple’s target demographic). When you set one of these profiles, it becomes the new default way the camera takes pictures, though it will also pop up a button that lets you toggle it off. (The button is also clever, the way it looks changes based on what profile you’ve set). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rlWvlf"&gt;The TL;DR for Profiles is that “Rich Contrast” makes the iPhone’s photos look more like a Google Pixel, with bluer tones and deeper contrast. And “Vibrant” makes the iPhone look more like a Samsung phone, with more extreme colors all around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WbYvA"&gt;Historically, Apple has insisted that what it aims for in photography is the “truth” of what your eye would see. I will (regretfully) set aside philosophical questions about the nature of objective reality and what a photograph is and instead just point out that it’s fair to say that when it comes to photography, Apple is much less opinionated than the competition. Samsung and Google are both more willing to tune their images to be more pleasing to their customers than Apple is. With Profiles, Apple is essentially giving its customers the option to get pictures they like better without having to edit them after the shot.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photographic Profiles on iPhone 13 Pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="usyFdq"&gt;Understanding how Profiles actually works is a little complicated. Apple’s computational photography process is called Smart HDR, and what it does is standard across many phones these days: it takes a bunch of photos at different exposures all at once and then combines them into a single, final image. Part of that process involves making choices about white balance, color, contrast, and so on. Another part of that process is the iPhone semantically recognizing different things in the scene — things like faces, people, grass, sky, cats, or whatever and exposing them differently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qspoht"&gt;When you set a profile, the iPhone makes different choices during the Smart HDR capture about white balance, color, contrast, and so on based on the preference you set. It also uses that semantic recognition to make better choices for things like skin tone. That’s why it’s not a filter — it’s not applied evenly across the entire image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ye3iOb"&gt;Profiles are not something you can undo in the edit — though Apple does label them in the metadata when you view them in the Photos app. You should also know that you can’t shoot with profiles and have RAW output on at the same time. Unlike a RAW photo where you can make all sorts of choices in the edit, Photographic Profiles lock your choices in to the file as it’s saved. In theory it might be possible for the iPhone to save all of that extra data, but Apple tells us that it would create huge files that it wouldn’t be worth it for ordinary use, and that people who do want to edit after the fact can just shoot RAW.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pxIe2Z"&gt;Cinematic Mode&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="HkyZIA"&gt;Apple’s flashiest iPhone ads are for Cinematic Mode. It’s an entirely new mode for iPhone video that uses software to blur the background of a video, much as Portrait Mode does for photos. Unlike Portrait Mode, Cinematic doesn’t take advantage of the iPhone 13 Pro’s LIDAR sensor for creating a depth map — it just uses software to recognize human faces and bodies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5BFX5"&gt;The reason Cinematic mode makes for such a great demo is that it can automatically shift the focus when something happens in the scene. It locks on to the biggest face that it sees, but if that face turns away the iPhone can automatically shift focus to somebody else in the background. It is fun to play around with and works with both the rear and front-facing Selfie cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Es4aQ"&gt;You can also change the focus point as you’re shooting by tapping something in the background and lock focus by tapping again. And then after you’re done shooting, you can change your focus decisions moment-to-moment in the Photos app and even change the amount of background blur for the entire video. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Cinematic Mode is limited to 1080p and doesn’t work in low light, despite what Apple’s ads show" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6ANjnyRUm4phHT-0w1eXsBHm6Cg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22864316/cinematic.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cinematic Mode is limited to 1080p and doesn’t work in low light, despite what Apple’s ads show&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tY3mZT"&gt;Because it’s the equivalent of Portrait Mode for video, it can have the same problems as Portrait Mode for photos — it rarely works in low light, for example. (Apple’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/apple/status/1438955425265696775?s=21"&gt;own ads for Cinematic Mode show it working in low light&lt;/a&gt;, which I find misleading.) It can also have weird or bad cutouts around hair, which is a little less noticeable because it’s video, but it’s still there. Finally, Cinematic Mode &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; works in 1080p at 30FPS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E9nPrp"&gt;Cinematic Mode really only works well within Apple’s own ecosystem of apps. The depth map information is saved into an ancillary “sidecar” file that goes alongside the video, but only Apple apps like Photos or Final Cut can do anything with it right now. If you AirDrop it to a Mac that isn’t running MacOS Monterey, the iPhone will bake all your depth choices into the file before sending it along. Apple tells us that it hasn’t worked with third party companies like Adobe or Lumafusion to make that data editable in those apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPU6ht"&gt;I think Cinematic Mode is crazy fun but I’m not sure how much value it really adds to people who want to use their iPhone for actual, professional video work. I’m not going to say it’s a gimmick, but it is gimmick-adjacent. Like Portrait Mode in photos was at the beginning, Cinematic Mode feels like it’s a few years away from being truly useful for anything beyond casual use. Despite Apple’s promos, I have a hard time believing real movies will be made with this in its present state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The LTPO displays on the 13 Pros have high refresh rates — finally" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E01KlIJ2W7CxDhf2e731K95T_C0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863263/akrales_210917_4760_0384.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LTPO displays on the 13 Pros have high refresh rates — finally&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5NYQWg"&gt;iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max displays&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="T0cjec"&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max finally offer iPhone users a screen feature that flagship Android phones have had for quite a long time: higher refresh rates. Apple’s branding for its screen is “Super Retina XDR display with ProMotion,” and the important part is the ProMotion, which previously has only been on the iPad Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xCwRPY"&gt;Historically, the iPhone has been able to refresh its screen at 60Hz (or 60 times every second), but the new iPhone 13 Pros can vary the refresh rates from as little as 10Hz all the way up to 120Hz. Apple is using a type of OLED display called LTPO (&lt;a href="https://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/article/666267/what-an-ltpo-display/"&gt;Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Oxide&lt;/a&gt;) panel, technology &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251977/samsung-display-ltpo-display-power-efficient-panel-galaxy-s21-ultra-debut"&gt;first seen on Samsung phones&lt;/a&gt;. It has a wide dynamic range, can get much brighter, and also uses less power because it can ratchet down the refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcoWDq"&gt;What all this means practically is that scrolling and animations look much smoother. It also has battery life benefits because if nothing’s moving on the screen, the screen needs to refresh less often and therefore uses less power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4Ni8VQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple waited to long to introduce high refresh rate displays on its Pro phones, but it has implemented them well&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T22XNY"&gt;None of this is news to Android users, but if you haven’t used a high refresh rate display on a phone before it can be a little hard to explain why it makes a difference. This is doubly true on iPhones, because Apple has gotten away with not putting a high refresh rate screen on an iPhone for so long because iOS is itself a very smooth OS without very much jank in its animations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7on6Wr"&gt;When I scroll on the iPhone 13 Pro, the text stays readable instead of turning into a blur. Things moving on the screen are smoother. It feels more like a direct interaction with my finger because the iPhone can literally change its refresh rate to match my movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mv2at6"&gt;Apple’s implementation is also smart: iOS keeps an eye on what activity is happening on the screen and adjusts the refresh rate to match. So the screen matches the 24FPS frame rate in video apps, for example. Apple tells me apps coded with its default tools like Swift will get these benefits for free and that developers will have access to tools to update their apps to support ProMotion if they like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ved8rg"&gt;I get if all this sounds very silly. It is very much a premium feature that is more about experience than anything practical. That’s exactly what ProMotion is and it is exactly what I think we should expect from a phone that costs more than a thousand dollars. It was a similar story when Apple’s own high-density Retina Displays hit the scene. Once many people experienced the nicer thing, they were bothered by its lack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59ronC"&gt;I have heard all the speculation about why Apple waited this long to implement this feature and I don’t really buy any of them. I admit that high refresh rates are the epitome of “nice to have,” but part of the point of Apple’s extravagant Pro phones is to provide the nicest experience. Now, finally, they do. Crucially, Apple did an excellent job with its implementation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Pro (left) and Pro Max (right)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ekFDxMXU0-GMcxYU4CYwEStQFpE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863288/vpavic_210916_untitled_0058.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Pro (left) and Pro Max (right)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qLs5Lq"&gt;The ProMotion display is the perfect example of what you get with the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max. It’s an improvement that may only matter explicitly to a few but will subtly make life nicer for everybody who uses it. The battery life upgrade isn’t quite so subtle, of course. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4679X"&gt;As for the camera, I can see it both ways. When you’re sharing photos and videos to social media and looking at them on a phone, the differences &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; subtle at most — but they’re there if you look for them. And if you use your iPhone’s camera for more than just Instagram, you’ll appreciate the updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nf4R3E"&gt;The list of significant things I have to complain about with these phones is almost astonishingly short. (Though, as you might expect, I can quibble for days about little things like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;lack of a meaningful MagSafe ecosystem&lt;/a&gt;, the lightning port, or how iOS 15 handles notifications). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ven5Ti"&gt;The story of the iPhone 13 Pro is a story of iteration, sure, but iteration &lt;em&gt;matters&lt;/em&gt;. iPhone 12 Pro owners will have to pay a lot of attention to see some of the differences and an upgrade probably doesn’t make a lot of sense. But if you’re using something older, all that iteration comes on top of the major improvements from the iPhone 12 Pro — the upgrades will be very noticeable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="tk2gK9"&gt;Either way, when you start to pay attention to the details, prepare to be impressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hi9GQZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10764169"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>iPhone 13 review: yep, bigger batteries are better</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;So are bigger cameras&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ar2R52"&gt;What, really, do you want out of a new phone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAdrAJ"&gt;Assuming you’re starting with a good foundation, I think the list of what really makes a big difference in phone upgrades is actually short. The first thing on the list is improved battery life. The second is an improved camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmuVya"&gt;Those are the two things that make a fundamental difference in your day-to-day experience of a smartphone (assuming, again, that the basics don’t stink). Those are also exactly the things Apple tried to make better in the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLmhHh"&gt;Those two improvements come on top of the major changes the company introduced last year with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;. If you already have an iPhone 12, this year’s update looks iterative because it is. If you have an older iPhone, the full list of what’s better on the iPhone 13 is almost too long to enumerate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zm6VCR"&gt;The iPhone 12 brought new technologies and a fancy new design (and a new, Mini-sized version). The iPhone 13’s battery and camera updates aren’t so flashy, but they’re more important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jTlL1X"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10764114"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="POELcK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We will update this review with a full score and scorecard for the iPhone 13 Mini after further battery testing, but see below for initial impressions. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13, in pink." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_1xWz-QZRgEvQvbddJAlZgt-Pxw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863269/vpavic_210916_4760_0069.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13, in pink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IL8t4x"&gt;iPhone 13 and 13 Mini design and specs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="5SAQtt"&gt;Unless you look very closely, it’s difficult to tell the difference between the iPhone 13 devices and their predecessors. The iPhone 12 and 12 Mini introduced a striking and new flat-edged design that I still believe is a massive improvement on what came before. And of course, the iPhone 12 Mini was the first phone in a long time to bring a truly great experience to a smartphone with a smaller form factor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jOAz8c"&gt;They also switched over to OLED screens, which offer a superior experience to the LCDs that came before in several ways: contrast ratio, brightness, and power efficiency. They added 5G. They added the MagSafe charging system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHf9VU"&gt;It’s worth revisiting all those big changes because people are hanging on to their smartphones for a longer time now — especially iPhones. I think it’s fair to give the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini credit for the design they’re based on since so many of the people that are likely to buy them will be new to what the iPhone 12 offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="fnVRC3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini keep last year’s new design, which is still beautiful and modern&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ad7gks"&gt;There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; some changes to that design, however. The newer iPhones are just a tiny bit thicker  overall with substantially bigger camera bumps. That means that cases designed for the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini are unlikely to fit the newer phones. The camera bump is not only thicker but the lenses have been rearranged to accommodate the giant new sensor that’s in the main wide-angle camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOjSnL"&gt;The last change is that the notch housing FaceID and the selfie camera has been shrunk down by 20 percent — but don’t get too excited by that. It’s only been reduced on the horizontal axis, so the extra screen you get doesn’t amount to much (and Apple isn’t using it to show more info, like battery percentage).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijCuBt"&gt;There is a new processor inside the iPhone 13, the A15 Bionic. As usual with iPhones, it’s difficult to discern significant speed improvements, but that is only because there’s so much headroom that iPhones tend to feel fast for longer. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684033/apple-iphone-13-pro-max-review"&gt;Pro&lt;/a&gt; models get one more GPU core than the regular models, but I haven’t noticed that make a difference at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGFILf"&gt;One difference that does matter this year: the base storage on the least expensive iPhone 13 and 13 Mini has been increased to 128GB. I’m frankly impressed that Apple actually managed to proactively increase the base storage on its own — historically it’s always done it far too late. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNUALy"&gt;Finally, my favorite design improvement over the iPhone 12 is that there’s a new pink color option. Of all the colors offered on the iPhone 13 and 13 Pro lines, it is the best one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UzmY4E"&gt;iPhone 13 battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="DyoBG1"&gt;Battery life on last year’s iPhone 12 wasn’t quite what I had hoped for. Battery life on last year’s iPhone 12 Mini was sadly exactly what I was expecting: not very good. So for this year’s iPhone 13, Apple did the obvious thing: it made the batteries bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7i3hCp"&gt;Those larger batteries (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22678607/iphone-13-reported-battery-sizes-increase-laptop-comparison"&gt;9 percent on the iPhone 13 Mini and 15.1 percent on the iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;) are the main driver behind Apple’s battery claims this year. It says that the regular iPhone 13 should last for a whopping two-and-a-half hours of usage longer than the iPhone 12 while the Mini will last an extra one-and-a-half hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjzzSH"&gt;Of course, if you don’t have an iPhone 12 then the 13 lasting more than two hours longer is kind of meaningless. My takeaway for the regular iPhone 13 doesn’t require relative comparisons, though: battery life is &lt;em&gt;excellent&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="D80PRl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Battery life on the regular iPhone 13 is excellent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best iPhone 13 color is pink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SZq1pC"&gt;On one day of my testing, the regular iPhone 13 made it from 7am to midnight before it tuckered out. That was with some camera testing, watching some video, the usual doomscrolling, emails, work, and some games. It was an intense set of work for the five hours of screentime that day, so that’s impressive. On another day with lighter usage, I didn’t see the battery warning until the following morning. But the iPhone 13’s battery isn’t magic. When we had a day of a lot more 4K video testing, I was looking for a charger by 7 or 8.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EixJP9"&gt;As for the iPhone 13 Mini, I just have to admit that I haven’t had a chance to fully test it yet. We don’t do video rundown tests here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, instead preferring to base our results on as much real world use as we can do. There are only so many phones I can actually use in the real world at a time. I will be doing a full, longer term battery test on the iPhone 13 Mini over the coming weeks and I will publish a full rundown — and update this review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hoFcnE"&gt;However, I do have an early impression of the iPhone 13 Mini’s battery life. It’s that Apple’s one-and-a-half hour longer claim seems reasonable, but that is faint praise. I used the iPhone 12 Mini a lot over the last year, and what I said when I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555295/iphone-12-mini-review"&gt;first reviewed it&lt;/a&gt; turned out to be true: if you use this little phone like it’s a big smartphone, you will drain the battery by early afternoon or even lunch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VycbIf"&gt;The iPhone 12 and 13 Minis are meant to be minimalistic both in size and also in how much you use them. If you are constantly using your phone all day, the smaller battery in the Mini isn’t likely to be enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuXlBF"&gt;My takeaway on the Mini is to not assume the improvements are enough to overcome the fundamental physics of smaller batteries. My takeaway on the regular iPhone 13 is also based on fundamental physics: a big battery means good battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini have the same camera sensor as last year’s iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mx8zAg"&gt;iPhone 13 cameras&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="we6MM5"&gt;Both the iPhone 13 and the 13 Mini have the same camera system: a regular wide-angle camera and an ultrawide. Both have been upgraded, but the major improvement comes to the wide angle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VsoUUi"&gt;Just like the battery, the improvement to the wide-angle camera sensor is simple: make it bigger. A bigger camera sensor is able to take in more light more quickly and produce better results. Apple happened to have just such a sensor lying around: the one from last year’s iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fL0gC"&gt;That’s notable because the 12 Pro Max stood apart from all the other iPhones last year by having a larger sensor, and now that sensor is the new default this year. And from the moment the 12 Pro Max was released up until now, it has been the best smartphone camera on the market for both photos and video. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In bright light, it can be difficult to see the improvement over last year’s iPhone 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VjTrGuWAMFmPyScPTB9djo0A8Yo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865823/reg_IMG_349707.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In bright light, it can be difficult to see the improvement over last year’s iPhone 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fs2dYr"&gt;I am happy to report that the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini match or improve on those results. Details are sharp and accurate, colors are rich without being oversaturated, focusing is fast and reliable, portrait mode is good enough to use day to day, and low light and night sight are both exceptional. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Since the 13 and 13 Mini have the best camera sensor from last year’s 13 Pro Max, night mode performance is excellent" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wK3aL7SdxtoZdNYIDKstB8elqXI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865828/reg_IMG_353019.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Since the 13 and 13 Mini have the best camera sensor from last year’s 13 Pro Max, night mode performance is excellent.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 has good color reproduction at night, though it can tend to yellows sometimes" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5JM7TdrsrLJYm9dbvXOZlnwz7cg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865827/reg_IMG_352918.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 has good color reproduction at night, though it can tend to yellows sometimes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vOttW3"&gt;Video quality is great. The main camera has sensor stabilization, which helps when you’re walking around. It can do all the modes that matter in terms of 4K and slow mo and handles them all super well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZvLuN"&gt;Really, the only way to be unhappy with this camera is to compare it head to head with an iPhone 13 Pro — and even then I think you’d probably need to do it on a big screen with images taken in low light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBEaB7"&gt;The ultrawide sensor was also updated for better low-light performance, but it’s fairly minor. What I mostly see is improved white balance and color when it’s in night mode. That’s something I’ve noticed across the board, actually. Especially in low light, colors are a bit more true to life than last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ultrawide is much less noisy in dark photos" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WQUFAlvJMYpW4d7efE8tKjYWaL0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865826/reg_IMG_352216.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ultrawide is much less noisy in dark photos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The 13 and 13 Mini have the exact same camera system" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IATdIRnXlBrQ6psXbjhzPFBu__M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865825/reg_IMG_351411.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 13 and 13 Mini have the exact same camera system.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lw3g2e"&gt;My main wish is that the selfie camera sensor had been updated. It has some software improvements just like the other cameras and it’s inside a smaller notch now, but the selfie camera is too important for Apple to just leave the same this many years in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qRzGOJ"&gt;Apple has also introduced two new camera modes with the iPhone 13: Photographic Profiles and Cinematic Mode. I have gone in depth on both of those features in the iPhone 13 Pro review, so you can read the full details on how they work there. But I’ll briefly describe each here, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="diFHrJ"&gt;Photographic Profiles are a new option in the camera that change the default look of the picture you’re taking. You can customize the tone and contrast of how all the pictures you take look instead of doing it in edit after the fact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJvyOk"&gt;You may know that Samsung phones take super vivid photos or that Google Pixel phones take photos that are more contrasty and blue. With Profiles, Apple is essentially admitting that people may prefer those looks and is providing an option to get them automatically.  You can also customize each one to your own personal preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EAxJoO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10764403"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="14G7Xz"&gt;Profiles aren’t like filters in that they don’t apply tone and warmth settings to the whole picture. The iPhone knows when it sees grass or faces or sky and so it adjusts how it applies those color preferences accordingly, so you don’t get weird looking skin tones or purple skies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s27evH"&gt;Photos taken with a Profile can’t have adjustments removed or changed (beyond normal editing) after the fact, and you can’t use RAW at the same time as profiles. It’s handy sometimes to think of them as presets, and I think I will use them from time to time. Apple claims that the A15 Bionic is necessary for the whole Profiles experience to work, but my feeling is that it ought to be possible to get this feature on older iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXGPhT"&gt;Cinematic Mode is a new feature that is essentially the equivalent of Portrait Mode but for video. It locks on to a face and blurs the rest of the scene, just like if you were using a lens with a big aperture. But it then tries to change the focus as it sees fit, shifting over to a face in the background if a face in the foreground turns away, for example. As you shoot the video, you can manually change focus yourself or you can do it after the fact in the edit — but only inside Apple’s own apps like Photos or Final Cut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSqAOZ"&gt;The results from Cinematic Mode are nowhere near as good as Apple’s own commercials would have you believe. It doesn’t work well (or really, at all) in low light and it has the same problems you may remember from the early days of Portrait Mode photos: weird cutouts around hair and glasses. It also only works in 1080p at 30fps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="37B8pX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10764406"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="czKzIA"&gt;But don’t let the fact that Cinematic Mode doesn’t live up the hype distract you. The camera systems on the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini are excellent. If there wasn’t also the iPhone 13 Pro in the world, they’d be the best you could get on a phone as of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Mini and iPhone 13" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4G3eE5B21Pg_Xg9awwQwwBAsnHE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22863273/vpavic_210916_4760_0240.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 13 Mini and iPhone 13.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="RAOPHA"&gt;I think it’s all too easy to look at the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini and not think much of the updates this year. Cameras get better every year and every company promises good battery life, after all. And compared to the massive changes we saw on the iPhone last year, the 13 looks iterative, more like an iPhone 12S than truly new models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="KV4QJn"&gt;I won’t pretend that reading is totally wrong, but I also think it misses the point. Fancy new features are fun, but the fundamentals of battery life and camera are more important. Because if you focus on the fundamentals, your whole game gets better. And the iPhone 13 has got some good game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="llBFDZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10764169"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>PayPal’s updated app helps it act more like your bank account</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uxzi7FTPHSnF9zw5uSmlbfUSzic=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69887349/Dashboard1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: PayPal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5NM7Fd"&gt;PayPal is &lt;a href="https://newsroom.paypal-corp.com/2021-09-21-PayPal-Introduces-Customers-to-the-Next-Digital-Payments-Era-with-the-New-PayPal-App"&gt;updating its mobile app with a new visual design&lt;/a&gt;, support for a high-yield savings account, and a way to find coupons in-app. In the past, the company prioritized sending and receiving money and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527288/paypal-cryptocurrency-support-buy-sell-venmo-bitcoin"&gt;cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt;, but its new app is trying to be a little bit of everything to everyone, and it’s available today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDrQHb"&gt;The immediately noticeable change is a visual one.  The old payment-focused PayPal app put sending and receiving money at the forefront, with your account balance the first thing you see when you open the app. The PayPal app’s new “homepage” is a dashboard of sorts with quick access to your balance, the amount of crypto you own, and your frequent contacts. It sorts other options under dedicated tabs and hubs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="su0Sr4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/srSPlNz8NIY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rTr9xA"&gt;Direct deposit and features like PayPal’s credit and debit cards are under the wallet tab. The payments hub where you’ll find peer-to-peer payments, bill pay, charitable donations, and messaging. The shopping tab keeps track of coupons and loyalty programs. And finally, the finance tab features cryptocurrencies and the new high-yield savings account.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dowBxc--OATebhFS2PQTj_7g-Oo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865578/Savings1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: PayPal&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PayPal app’s new high-yield savings account can be found in the finance tab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WXJtt8"&gt;In terms of new features, rolling out a savings account is a notable one. The automatic money-saving app Digit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22533664/digit-automatic-savings-online-bank-ai-subscription"&gt;added banking in beta earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, but PayPal has even more reach. This new PayPal app supports direct deposit — with the option to receive deposits two days early — and save the money you add to a PayPal Savings account provided by Synchrony Bank. PayPal says its accounts will come with an annual percentage yield (APY) of 0.40 percent and no minimum balance or monthly fees. PayPal is also adding access to bill pay, so you can set up automatic payments to service providers and use “eligible funding sources” from your PayPal wallet to pay them. PayPal hasn’t shared what steps you need to take to open a savings account, and when asked, referred us to the features listed above.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QyT-XWQcG7d7YSAHs8KLqosQdlM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865579/Deals2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: PayPal&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PayPal plans on surfacing coupons and discounts from various brands for use in transactions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z1WUSD"&gt;PayPal is also emphasizing coupons and in-store discounts with a new dedicated shopping hub. “Shoppers will be presented with discounts and offers on hundreds of popular brands,” PayPal says, and along with the ability to “shop through the in-app browser.” Those savings extend outside of PayPal as well. You can clip coupons for use anywhere PayPal is a payment option online. PayPal is also working on a loyalty program that offers cashback and “shopping credit” on eligible purchases made with PayPal. The addition of coupons is similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21571806/google-pay-relaunch-money-payments-finances-deals-offers-banking-plex"&gt;the one Google made with Google Pay last year.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0OE7c"&gt;PayPal’s new app is jam-packed with features, to the point that there’s a good chance that not everyone is going to use or even be aware of all of them. A more focused approach would probably be better for the average user, but the new PayPal app seems just as focused on making casual users reliant on more PayPal features as it is pleasing power users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BoIm5"&gt;The new Paypal app is available today. PayPal Savings accounts are coming later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Bh4fy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 8:50AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated headline to clarify that PayPal Savings accounts are provided through Synchrony Bank.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpPYGu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4z20O"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP’s Spectre x360 16 uses AI to make you look glamorous on video calls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A user in a red dress types on the HP Spectre x360 16 in an evening room at a small wooden table. The screen displays a photo of a group of urban dancers in an outdoor scene in an editing program. To its left is a small lit lamp." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w26EX2bR_hTAaD0F1Wo7NFzw1Ls=/562x111:1705x873/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69887367/1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the HP Spectre x360 16.&lt;/em&gt; | HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZfbWEP"&gt;HP makes some of the most gorgeous laptops you can buy, and its Spectre line is the most beautiful of them all. But the new Spectre x360 16, a 16-inch 2-in-1 touchscreen laptop, will flip that dynamic around. Not only is this laptop beautiful — this laptop wants to make &lt;em&gt;you &lt;/em&gt;beautiful. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YENE3Q"&gt;That’s the idea, at least. The Spectre x360 16, starting at $1,639, is the first 16-inch laptop to include an “integrated, intelligent” 5MP webcam, HP claims. But that’s not all. It also comes with a program called — and I love this name — HP GlamCam. It’s not entirely clear what GlamCam will do, but HP claims that one of its main features, Beauty Mode, will “touch up skin, teeth, and eyes” during video calls. The goal, HP says, is to “keep your focus on what you’re saying, not your looks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLBWkY"&gt;There are also, of course, very &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/04/02/1021635/beauty-filters-young-girls-augmented-reality-social-media/"&gt;legitimate reasons&lt;/a&gt; to object to widespread use of beauty filters, which are available on many social media apps and have been popular for decades (though their use in real-time video is a recent advance). Some experts have warned that their prevalence on social media could contribute to unrealistic beauty standards among children and teenagers. On the other hand, this is a feature that Zoom itself has offered for &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/03/how-to-look-better-during-zoom-video-calls.html"&gt;over a year&lt;/a&gt;, and one that plenty of grown-up &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/zoom-video-conferencing-filter-touch-up-work-from-home-coronavirus-2020-3"&gt;workers&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://www.thecut.com/2020/03/how-to-look-better-during-zoom-video-calls.html"&gt;heralded as a savior&lt;/a&gt; during a stressful period of time when it was difficult for many to make primping a priority. (The Spectre x360 16, as a premium workstation, also isn’t the type of laptop I’d expect to see too many children using.) It will certainly be an interesting feature to test.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user participates in a video call on the HP Spectre x360 16, pointing to the right. The laptop sits on a white desk. To its left are a book and a smartphone. To its right are a small potted plant, an earbuds case, a pencil case, and a full bookcase." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gAXl4rjz6Mduxsz8vhmoxFcmR5s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22866427/HP_Spectre_x360_16_lifestyle_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t you want to be like these happy people?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user participates in a video call on the HP Spectre x360 16. The laptop is seen from the side and sits on a marble table. A hydroflask is to its right, as is a shelf populated with two potted plants, a stack of books, a number of glass cups and jars, a pencil pot, and a speaker." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gwZycN5dR8dC70qdwr6Ie_LP32w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22866433/HP_Spectre_x360_16_lifestyle_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GLAMCAM!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2OcYGC"&gt;GlamCam includes some other features to simplify your video calls, like Auto Frame (which will keep the camera’s focus on you if you get up and move around) and Lighting Correction (which will adjust your feed to keep lighting consistent if you’re moving from indoors to outdoors). The laptop can auto-lock when the camera sees you leave your desk and unlock itself when you return, dim its screen when you’re looking away, and add blur by itself if someone is behind you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcKT9w"&gt;Software aside, it’s worth noting that HP has been putting 5MP webcams on some of its other high-end devices. I just tried one out on the $2,600 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675550/hp-elite-dragonfly-max-2021-review-tile-test-specs-price-features"&gt;Elite Dragonfly Max&lt;/a&gt;, and while it delivered a better picture than you can generally expect from laptop webcams, I didn’t see a mind-blowing jump in quality. This one does support Windows Hello facial recognition, though, and has a physical privacy shutter. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a beauty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="socW6K"&gt;Webcam aside, the new Spectre can come in either “nocturne blue with celestial blue accents” or “nightfall black with pale brass accents.” It has a 16:10 aspect ratio and a 91 percent screen-to-body ratio, with up to a UHD+ OLED panel. It’s HP’s first consumer notebook made from recycled CNC aluminum, as part of a broader sustainability focus that HP has brought to many of its recent premium models. Inside, it comes with up to an 11th Gen Intel Core i7 processor, a Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 graphics card, and support for Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.2. It will be available in October on HP’s website.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Slack launches clips, video messages that help you avoid meetings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l6mYZSJ4I3i-T89LU5FbgHGWt2E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69887355/acastro_190412_1777_slack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AiMsEo"&gt;Slack is launching its new clips feature today, allowing coworkers to record video messages that exist in Slack channels. Clips supports audio from a microphone, alongside video and screen recordings. They’re designed to help teams communicate across various time zones, and cut down on the amount of meetings that are now taking place in a hybrid work era.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtuF8J"&gt;In addition to clips, Slack is also expanding Slack Connect to allow paid organization to partner with companies on free plans. It’s also announcing GovSlack that will run in a government-certified cloud environment when it launches in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MEkePK"&gt;Clips can be shared in channels or through DMs on Slack, and they even include live captions and a transcript that’s searchable in the Slack interface. Because they’re just like sharing an image or a text message in Slack, coworkers can reply with text, audio, video, or emoji. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iniznU"&gt;Slack has been working on this feature for more than a year, and initially it sounded more like Instagram Stories that might disappear after a day rather than video voicemails that persist in channels. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505519/slack-instagram-stories-push-to-talk-audio-calls-new-features"&gt;Initial prototypes involved a stories-like interface&lt;/a&gt;, but the feature has developed into something that fits more with the way people use Slack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P_SV0rQnXYBT3aY8RvAalQ8F9cU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22866685/Clips_GIF_2.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slack’s new clips feature lets you record video and voice messages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pJ0VQb"&gt;“We were inspired by how people are using video in consumer apps,” explains Tamar Yehoshua, chief product officer at Slack, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We actually prototyped a lot of different versions of this internally, and now we’ve settled on this as a means of communicating into your work repository.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nU1GE5"&gt;Clips feels like the next step in Slack attempting to address the needs of businesses adjusting to working from home alongside a renewed mix of office work. Huddles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556992/slack-huddles-audio-calls-feature-launch-discord-like"&gt;a Discord-like audio calls feature&lt;/a&gt;, launched earlier this year and it’s already Slack’s “fastest adopted feature,” according to Yehoshua. Clips will begin rolling out today and will be available for all paid teams this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYEWtx"&gt;Alongside the clips feature, Slack is also improving the way Slack Connect works. Slack Connects lets partner organizations work together in Slack and communicate, and now Slack is extending this to companies that aren’t on paid Slack plans yet. Slack Enterprise Grid customers will be able to invite anyone to use Slack and communicate with them instantly this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mujwPjR06uG3DmZyCfmHGT1yt3w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22866669/Clips_GIF_1.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Slack&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clips also supports screen recording.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TYgYxi"&gt;GovSlack is also launching in 2022, a version of Slack that runs in a government-certified cloud environment. While Slack can already be used by the US government, this new version complies with federal government requirements like FedRAMP High and DoD IL4 certifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8uRV3"&gt;SalesForce closed its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22587666/slack-acquisition-salesforce-closed-messaging-cloud"&gt;$27.7 billion deal to acquire Slack&lt;/a&gt; in July, and we’re now starting to hear more about the company’s ambitions for its communication service. It certainly sounds like SalesForce sees Slack as its digital hub, and the company is moving to integrate more of its services into Slack. “SalesForce has about 10 million developers in our ecosystem, and so what we’ve focused on with our platform work is connecting our platform to Slack for the SalesForce developer ecosystem,” explains Rob Seaman, senior vice president of Slack at SalesForce. “We consider Slack as the new engagement layer for SalesForce. We think the greater majority of users will be staying in Slack to do their work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYzrUe"&gt;The concept of putting Slack at the center, or as a work hub, is very similar to what Microsoft has been doing with Teams. Most of Microsoft’s biggest services plug into Teams somehow, and the company has been pushing Office integration to convince businesses to use Teams. SalesForce will certainly help Slack respond to Teams here, all while keeping Slack’s APIs open for others developers to integrate apps and services.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP’s new all-in-one has an ultrawide display and an RTX 3080 GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C3V_oJ4W0fSor1UbxYRO0wbBESU=/0x0:3234x2156/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69887414/HP_ENVY_34_AiO_1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ultrawide all-in-one with its magnetically attached webcam.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aynlV8"&gt;HP’s new Envy 34-inch All-In-One Desktop PC is a self-contained Windows 11 machine that’s available with comparable specs to a standalone gaming PC. It has a large 34-inch ultrawide IPS display (5120 x 2160), which can be powered by Nvidia’s RTX 3080 GPU and Intel’s 11th Gen Core i9 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eqh3RA"&gt;Externally, the all-in-one is also equipped with a number of neat quality-of-life features. It’s got a magnetically-attached 16-megapixel webcam which can be reoriented to sit on any of the monitor’s four sides, and a 15W Qi wireless charger built into the stand to charge your phone or other compatible accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nSKqBfO6ZdNiHHP1J9Ovkj_Gfxc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22866671/HP_ENVY_34_AIO_10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PC’s stand has a Qi wireless charger built in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a_ug-uEPS83FQ1Hug3pE_NR8jhw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22866672/HP_ENVY_34_AiO_3.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The webcam can be placed anywhere around the display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FNL6nj"&gt;Around the back there are four USB-A ports and two Thunderbolt 4 ports, with an additional pair of USB-A ports on the side alongside an extra USB-C. There’s also an HDMI out, as well as a headphone / microphone combo port. Internally, the Envy All-In-One has four RAM slots and two M.2 SSD slots, and HP says its RAM and storage are user upgradeable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czoIHZ"&gt;It’s a pretty decent spec list for an all-in-one, and offers nearly all the features you could want out of a productivity or even gaming machine. The downside is that it won’t come cheap, HP says the Envy All-In-One will cost $1,999 when it ships next month, and that’s just the starting price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bq4Z1Q"&gt;If that’s too expensive for your tastes, HP also has a pair of other all-in-ones it’s announcing today. First up is the Pavilion All-in-One Desktop PC which is available with either a 24- or 27-inch display, a 5-megapixel pop-up webcam, and an AMD Ryzen 5000 series CPU. It goes on sale next month at a starting price of $799. There’s also the similarly named HP All-in-One Desktop PC, which lacks the Pavilion branding, and comes with a choice of AMD or Intel processors starting at $749.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Launch startups Astra and Firefly ink secret rocket engine IP deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yng8_IhGFVMxvZJI_9BsBuU7HDo=/78x0:923x563/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69887360/Reaver_Engine_Test.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firefly’s Reaver engine being test-fired.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Firefly Aerospace&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A roughly $30 million handshake between two rivals is the latest display of consolidation in the small launch industry&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="QzFZNA"&gt;Astra, the small launch company that recently went public, has signed a roughly $30 million deal for the rights to manufacture Firefly Aerospace’s Reaver rocket engines in-house, according to a document seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and people familiar with the arrangement. The agreement is part of a growing trend of consolidation in an industry of small rockets, where companies are cutting new deals to stay competitive as private capital abounds, more players take the field, and demand for small launch services shifts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1l0uQZ"&gt;Under the deal, which closed earlier this year, Firefly will send up to 50 of its Reaver rocket engines to Astra’s rocket factory in Alameda, California, where a development engine was already delivered in late spring for roughly half a million dollars, according to an internal Firefly document viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and a person briefed on the agreement. Astra engineers have been picking apart the engine for detailed inspection, said a person familiar with the terms, who, like others involved in the deal, declined to speak on the record because of a strict non-disclosure agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdlLST"&gt;Astra’s vice president of communications Kati Dahm declined to discuss the agreement when asked by &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;for comment on specific details, but disputed as incorrect the number of engines that the deal covers, as well as the cost of roughly a half million dollars for the initial development engine that’s sitting in Astra’s factory. Dahm declined to provide any additional information to back up those disputes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nFJUMBNzHV7hhmjMMh_jOzX71jo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21876184/astra_launch.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: John Kraus / &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/Astra/status/1304626075251556353?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;Astra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first of a series of three Astra rocket iterations lifts off in September 2020 from the company’s launch site in Kodiak, Alaska.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3x9gMh"&gt;Fusing Firefly’s engines with Astra’s own rocket technology would help Astra reach its publicly stated “500kg to 500km” goal, or the capability to send 1,102 pounds of satellites&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;into the most popular orbital altitude for mega-constellations. The company’s current rocket — simply called Rocket, nothing else — has been test-launched through various iterations, and after three main attempts, has yet to reach orbit. The latest rocket iterations use five of the company’s own Delphin engines, which are designed to lift up to 331 pounds to low-Earth orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lSWLbw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In the early throes of starting a rocket company — but moving faster than usual&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lDyrcX"&gt;Astra is one of a handful of new launch startups that has been drudging through the trials of starting a launch business. Roughly five years after its founding in 2016, the company reached space — but not orbit — during its second launch last year, a feat that came quicker than most rocket startups typically achieve. Its third and most recent attempt in August from its pad in Kodiak, Alaska &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647094/astra-rocket-lv0006-launch-failed"&gt;failed after one of its five core engines shut down&lt;/a&gt; nearly a second after liftoff, Astra co-founder and CEO Chris Kemp told reporters at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Abn2FD"&gt;Firefly, too, has struggled to reach orbit using its centerpiece Alpha rocket, which is powered by four Reaver engines. This month, the company’s first orbital launch attempt failed when one of Alpha’s engines shutdown after a fuel valve spontaneously closed, cutting off the rocket’s ability to steer itself vertically. It started tumbling and turning sideways mid-flight before Space Force officials, who help manage launch safety, stepped in and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655687/firefly-alpha-rocket-explodes-space-force-first-launch"&gt;detonated it&lt;/a&gt;. Alpha, as designed, can carry much more to orbit than Astra’s current rocket — some 2,204 pounds of satellites to low-Earth orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0vIecHfeT8NgJv07chHQJDZzge8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865637/liftoff_twitter.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Firefly Aerospace&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Firefly’s Alpha rocket lifts off for its first launch attempt in September 2021. An engine suddenly shut down over two minutes after liftoff, leading officials to terminate the rocket before reaching space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="neibpB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Astra is limited to two Reaver engines per rocket&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LYkTnH"&gt;The IP agreement includes a clause that aims to ensure Astra’s rocket doesn’t directly compete with Firefly’s Alpha. Astra, people involved in the deal said, is limited to using no more than two Reaver engines per rocket — just good enough to achieve the “500kg to 500km” goal. Kemp, Astra’s CEO, declined to comment on the specifics of the deal but emphasized Astra isn’t outright buying engines from Firefly. Doing so would be a major reversal for Astra’s brand of vertical integration, or the arrangement in which a company largely owns most of its supply chain to keep costs low and minimize production risks. Rather, according to the people briefed on the deal, Astra is buying the engine’s IP to manufacture them in-house and avoid being dependent on a supplier for its engines, which engineers regard as a rocket’s most important piece of hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuY3kD"&gt;“I can’t comment on any supplier agreements that we have, but I can tell you that we have said that all IP required to produce all of our technology will be owned by Astra, licensed by Astra, or developed by Astra,” Kemp told &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHei1c"&gt;A spokesperson for Firefly declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxP1uM"&gt;Firefly’s move to sell engine IP to Astra, a rival, is part of a broader strategy to diversify its rocket business, and an increasingly common tactic in the industry. In August, Firefly announced a “new line of business dedicated to supplying rocket engines and other spaceflight components to the emerging New Space industry.” Without naming Astra, Firefly CEO Tom Markusic &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/firefly-aerospaces-alpha-rocket-ready-for-first-launch/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;SpaceNews&lt;/em&gt; last month&lt;/a&gt; that Firefly has a contract to deliver about 50 rocket engines to a company developing its own launch vehicle. The Firefly document reviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; says the same, and adds that sharing IP is part of the deal. Multiple sources involved in and familiar with the agreement told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Astra is the undisclosed customer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="10lKqx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We would not want to be in a position where if they don’t supply us an engine, we can’t launch a rocket”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GBhwew"&gt;Swapping out Astra’s Delphin engines for Firefly’s Reaver engines isn’t as easy as it might sound. The existence of the deal between the two companies suggests Astra is planning a redesigned launch vehicle, which analysts say would have been necessary anyway to achieve its goal of sending 500kg to low-Earth orbit. But it’s unclear what rocket Astra is planning around the Reaver engines or when it would be ready to launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VU3EUBFvhoXKGQyQluzdjACIDlk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22865708/EwoYs5tUUAEvU_O.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: John Kraus / Astra&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Astra test-fires a Delphin engine at its Alameda, California facilities.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f3b15q"&gt;Firefly offered to sell Astra its Reaver engines directly earlier this year, people familiar with the talks said, but Astra, focused on bringing in new technology whose production lines it can control itself, didn’t want that kind of arrangement. “We would not want to be in a position where if they don’t supply us an engine, we can’t launch a rocket,” a person familiar with Astra’s strategy said. That might be the right move, as an example from the other end of the launch industry shows — United Launch Alliance (ULA), the Boeing-Lockheed Martin joint venture, is buying engines from Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin to power the company’s next generation rocket, Vulcan. But Blue Origin’s engine development delays &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/tory-bruno-says-the-challenges-with-be-4-are-real-but-the-engine-is-moving-forward/"&gt;have held up&lt;/a&gt; ULA’s timeline for Vulcan’s inaugural launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LCx0tc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Collaborating while competing is typical in the space industry&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Adj7k6"&gt;Overall, the agreement between Astra and Firefly “seems like a natural outcome of the increasing maturity of new entrants to the marketplace,” says Carissa Christensen, an industry analyst and founder of BryceTech. The small launch industry is flooded with new entrants — roughly 100 different small launch companies exist nowadays, with only a handful making meaningful progress toward space. Rocket Lab, a California-based firm that launches rockets from New Zealand, is the only small launch firm that’s conducting routine operations, using its Electron rocket to loft satellites into space for the Space Force and private companies. Rocket Lab went public this year through a SPAC merger, or a special-purpose acquisition company that’s listed publicly only to merge with a private company and take it public. That unlocked new capital for the company’s future rocket development plans and put its valuation around $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AEkwlC"&gt;“Historically, it’s typical that space companies collaborate and work together as well as compete,” Christensen said, partially because launch companies require large sums of investment and don’t generate constant streams of revenue or profit. And “because of the relatively limited demand,” there aren’t tens of thousands of launches a year that would keep operations busy and revenue coming in. Instead, there are roughly a hundred launches per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s4txdU"&gt;Like Firefly, Rocket Lab has also expanded into the components business in recent months, but on a different scale. The company announced it is selling reaction wheels — tiny components that help satellites maintain position in orbit — and plans to make up to 2,000 each year. Selling IP for engines like Astra and Firefly’s arrangement, Rocket Lab’s CEO Peter Beck tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, “doesn’t move the needle” in the small launch industry. “Providing thousands of reaction wheels across a large number of platforms and large constellations — that actually moves the needle for the whole industry,” he claims.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E8FJ9N"&gt;For small launch firms, “either they’ll go out of business or I definitely think there will be mergers and acquisitions,” Christensen said. Some of those mergers and acquisitions, she added, will be the result of a convenient deal two companies reached, or a desperate tactic for a company to stay alive. “It’s a high risk business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rq8zKq"&gt;Astra, founded in 2016, was the first launch company to go public earlier this year, accessing new capital by taking the route of a SPAC merger. Astra’s valuation was pegged at $2.1 billion. After its announcement to go public, the company acquired Apollo Fusion in July for $145 million, scooping up electric spacecraft propulsion technology designed to power satellite busses that Astra is planning to develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OKe0i9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Few will make it on their own”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s83BF1"&gt;Firefly, founded by Markusic in 2014 as Firefly Space Systems, went out of business in 2016 after a European investor pulled out, which Markusic said at the time was due to the Brexit referendum. The company was resurrected as Firefly Aerospace in 2017 when Noosphere Ventures, an investment firm founded by Ukrainian entrepreneur Max Polyakov, bought the bankrupt company’s assets. After a funding round in May, the company’s overall valuation is just over $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Pk5700"&gt;“We took Firefly from bankruptcy to a valuation of more than $1 billion in less than 5 years. We can increase that by a factor of 10 in the next 5 years,” Polyakov said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCjnkf"&gt;“Putting crazies and romantics aside, some of these companies have solid tech; others may have better access to capital. The inevitable result of a market situation like this is consolidation or mergers,” he said of the overall industry landscape. “Few will make it on their own.”&lt;/p&gt;
