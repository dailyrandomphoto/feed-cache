    <title>Facebook’s research on kids even considered turning playdates into growth drivers</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W1p7gL"&gt;Facebook’s interest in understanding and eventually acquiring younger users extends well beyond &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230822/facebook-messenger-kids-international-expansion-group-settings-friend-requests-supervised-friending"&gt;Messenger Kids&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696039/facebook-instagram-kids-app-pause-development-criticism"&gt;currently paused plans for a child-friendly Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. A new report in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s series on Facebook’s internal research &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-instagram-kids-tweens-attract-11632849667"&gt;shows the company’s focus on kids goes much deeper&lt;/a&gt;, including studying children younger than four years old in the hopes of better designing future products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6n5cm"&gt;The company’s child research is primarily motivated by the success of apps like TikTok and Snapchat in attracting younger users. “With the ubiquity of tablets and phones, kids are getting on the internet as young as six years old. We can’t ignore this and we have a responsibility to figure it out,” a confidential Facebook document viewed by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reads. Another possible cause for concern: the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;writes that the number of teenagers using Facebook daily has fallen 19 percent in the last two years and could drop an additional 45 percent by 2023, according to a document the publication saw. Suddenly, the directive to “imagine a Facebook experience designed for youth” makes more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aENaAv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Children could be converted to Instagram and Facebook users down the road&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CpzZ5c"&gt;Facebook’s child research has led it down several paths. The company reportedly explored encouraging children to use Messenger Kids in person, according to a presentation the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; viewed called “Exploring playdates as a growth lever.” Facebook researchers have also tried to introduce a more holistic understanding of childhood by breaking things down into six age brackets: “adults, late teens ages 16 to maturity, teens ages 13 to 15, tweens ages 10 to 12, children ages 5 to 9 and young kids ages zero to four,” a slide mentioned in the report reads. One presentation set a goal of transitioning younger users from Instagram to the original Facebook, or the “Life Coach for Adulting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmONm5"&gt;The idea that Facebook might consider newborns in its product decisions is an admittedly odd one. That the company has children in mind at all isn’t, though. As Instagram head Adam Mosseri notes in a statement included in &lt;em&gt;The Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s reporting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Vw4Vbf"&gt;It’s not new and it’s not a secret that social-media companies try to understand how teens and preteens use technology. Like all technology companies, of course, we want to appeal to the next generation, but that’s entirely different from the false assertion that we knowingly attempt to recruit people who aren’t old enough to use our apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2g40JO"&gt;The possible effects Facebook’s products could have on younger users are now coming to light. Earlier reporting on Facebook’s research shows that Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;can have negative impacts on younger users’ body image&lt;/a&gt;. Concern over how the app could potentially harm children is great enough that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675802/facebook-instagram-teens-harm-blumenthal-blackburn-markey-kids"&gt;Congress is getting involved&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696698/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-markey-blumenthal-blackburn-pause"&gt;Facebook representatives are slated to testify&lt;/a&gt; at a hearing this Thursday. Clearly, the social network will have plenty to answer for soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk to Jeff Bezos: ‘you cannot sue your way to the Moon’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ThZhFqH38qPCftOp0eIwHCLtL2c=/36x0:2016x1320/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69923005/FAZxtkCVgAEXlov.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LtVatt"&gt;Elon Musk isn’t happy that fellow mega-billionaire Jeff Bezos keeps suing to stop SpaceX’s projects, and he shared a message for the Amazon founder during the 2021 Code Conference on Tuesday: “you cannot sue your way to the Moon, no matter how good your lawyers are.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DNScTE"&gt;Musk was responding to a question from journalist Kara Swisher about how Bezos’ space company, Blue Origin, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22623022/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-sue-nasa-lawsuit-hls-lunar-lander"&gt;recently sued to block a contract NASA gave SpaceX&lt;/a&gt; to develop a lunar lander. Amazon has also protested SpaceX’s Starlink internet satellites with the Federal Communications Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3r11gL"&gt;Swisher asked Musk Tuesday if he has spoken to Bezos about the legal fights. “Not verbally, just... subtweets,” Musk said. (In August, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644158/elon-musk-jeff-bezos-spacex-blue-origin-lawsuits-complaints-starlink-tweet"&gt;Musk tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: “Turns out Besos [sic] retired in order to pursue a full-time job filing lawsuits against SpaceX …”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aUPdVe"&gt;Musk wasn’t all vinegar with regards to his billionaire space race cohort. When Swisher asked him about the suborbital flights that Bezos and Richard Branson recently took with their own companies, Musk said he “thought it was cool that they’re spending money on the advancement of space.” But, he was sure to point out, “suborbital is [just] a step in the direction of orbit.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now queue to purchase a PS5 at Sony</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q-JYJyp8wYnf3Sc7-RaUtK4ZzrQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69922999/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0zvUUE"&gt;Nearly a year after making its debut, the PlayStation 5 remains &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/23/22434905/ps5-restock-best-buy-walmart-sony-playstation-5"&gt;notoriously difficult to get your hands on&lt;/a&gt;. Sony has been one of the most reliable retailers when it comes to console restocks, however, and the company often opens its online queue for customers who don’t mind waiting for a chance to secure Sony’s next-gen console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7mhzE"&gt;If you want to have another go at it, Sony has reopened the queue for ordering the &lt;a href="https://direct-queue.playstation.com/?c=sonyied&amp;amp;e=aat3wy9opm&amp;amp;t=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%3Fqueueittoken%3De_e1i2kfmr0b~q_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000~ts_1632868237~ce_true~rt_afterevent~h_ad66b65148bec73c74619b4bf995e2b334a2ff4656222de0a44aa932936d2210&amp;amp;cv=1051601735&amp;amp;cid=en-US"&gt;disc-based PS5&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://direct-queue.playstation.com/?c=sonyied&amp;amp;e=aat3wy9opm&amp;amp;t=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%3Fqueueittoken%3De_e1i2kfmr0b~q_00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000~ts_1632868247~ce_true~rt_afterevent~h_587606887c82228abc91e48cf2864541531c1c1ec4b17c9871fb1c15535d6a85&amp;amp;cv=1051601735&amp;amp;cid=en-US"&gt;PS5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt; via its direct store. You don’t have to refresh the landing page once you’ve arrived — just wait it out — but we do recommend that you keep your PlayStation Network account info at the ready, just in case you’re allocated a spot to buy one when the countdown finishes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="cy1qnb"&gt;While you wait...&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8zFuNf"&gt;If you do manage to secure a PS5 — or simply want to prep for when you do — there are a few games and additional &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550907/ps5-wireless-controller-ssd-hard-drive-accessories-sony"&gt;accessories to consider&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736382577329371434?u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22210741%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s Pulse 3D Headset&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094WN6SY2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cosmic red DualSense controller&lt;/a&gt;, and one of the best games of the year: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DEATHLOOP-Standard-PlayStation-5/dp/B08NDYPWK7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix scoops up Oxenfree developer Night School</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Oxenfree" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CyK6kc7RcE31HHwg8XSrXQt0YVE=/106x0:1186x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69922839/Sreens_CYMK_House.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oxenfree.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WX5kXR"&gt;Netflix is continuing its push into video games with the acquisition of Night School Studio, the team best-known for 2016’s &lt;em&gt;Oxenfree &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20932270/afterparty-review-xbox-ps4-pc"&gt;2019’s &lt;em&gt;Afterparty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Oxenfree&lt;/em&gt;, it should be noted, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/27/12297852/oxenfree-game-stranger-things-pc-ps4-xbox-one"&gt;had strong &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; vibes&lt;/a&gt; — and Night School also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18510849/stranger-things-secret-games-telltale-studio-closed"&gt;previously worked on a canceled &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; title&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HiRsCW"&gt;“Night School wants to stretch our narrative and design aspirations across distinctive, original games with heart,” &lt;a href="https://nightschoolstudio.com/joining-netflix/"&gt;Night School’s Sean Krankel said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Netflix gives film, TV, and now game makers an unprecedented canvas to create and deliver excellent entertainment to millions of people. Our explorations in narrative gameplay and Netflix’s track record of supporting diverse storytellers was such a natural pairing. It felt like both teams came to this conclusion instinctively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YC64xK"&gt;The studio says it will continue to work on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382536/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-fez-oxenfree-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oxenfree II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as well as “cooking up new game worlds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nq5PUb"&gt;The acquisition is just the latest part of Netflix’s ongoing push into games. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577868/netflix-video-games-confirmed-mike-verdu-ea-oculus-facebook"&gt;the company hired Mike Verdu&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of EA and Oculus, to head up its gaming efforts, and it’s currently testing having games in its mobile app — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22689922/netflix-games-italy-spain-android-beta-mobile"&gt;just today, that test expanded to include Spain and Italy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SifBpe"&gt;“We’ll continue working with developers around the world and hiring the best talent in the industry to deliver a great collection of exclusive games designed for every kind of gamer and any level of play,” Verdu said as part of today’s announcement. “Like our shows and films, these games will all be included as part of your Netflix membership — all with no ads and no in-app purchases. Stay tuned for more.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk, live at the Code Conference</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9PXv2JIbYypjTkMELOSVwwSUqNM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69922752/acastro_191211_elon_decade_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Thus Sprach Technoking&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="BuwXrr"&gt;We’re at the &lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/code2021"&gt;2021 Code Conference&lt;/a&gt; here in Beverly Hills, California — and very soon, Elon Musk will take the stage in an interview with Kara Swisher. As always with Musk, there will be more than enough to talk about. There’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688377/tesla-steering-wheel-yoke-model-s-x-redesign"&gt;latest from Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22693610/tesla-opens-full-self-driving-beta-software-more-customers"&gt;self-driving&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615539/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed-2022-elon-musk"&gt;where Cybertruck development is&lt;/a&gt;. Just today, we learned that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698388/tesla-texas-lawsuit-cops-autopilot-crash-injury"&gt;Tesla is being sued by Texas cops&lt;/a&gt; after a Model X on autopilot slammed into five officers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0F5ly"&gt;Then we’ve got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675793/spacex-inspiration4-launch-first-all-civilian-private-crew"&gt;SpaceX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680152/spacex-inspiration4-first-private-crew-update-in-orbit"&gt;space tourism&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/18/22681185/spacex-ceo-elon-musk-starlink-internet-service-leaving-beta-october"&gt;satellite internet&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, we could talk about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/9/22427006/dogecoin-crashing-elon-musk-snl-host"&gt;Dogecoin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/25/21338456/tesla-elon-musk-twitter-memes-spacex"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and whether Musk is thinking much about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463920/elon-musk-stock-price-tweets-sec"&gt;the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; these days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBrIP1"&gt;Oh, and of course, we could revisit the topic of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/2/11837874/elon-musk-says-odds-living-in-simulation"&gt;whether we are still living in a simulation&lt;/a&gt; or if we can escape. (Hey, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22640826/matrix-4-trailer-resurrections-release-date"&gt;fourth &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; movie is coming&lt;/a&gt;, so why not?) So yeah, there’s a lot that could happen. We’ll be live-blogging his interview with Swisher right here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says the iPad Mini’s jelly scrolling isn’t a problem that needs to be fixed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1WEGUNYfPxzjse8L3u8t9hvwNPw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69922596/vpavic_210924_4766_0047.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NhqQno"&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/2021-ipad-mini-suffers-from-uneven-jelly-scrolling-in-portrait-mode/"&gt;Apple tells &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it thinks the “jelly scroll” effect some users have noticed on the new iPad Mini is normal LCD behavior that the company won’t have to fix. The effect, also known as skewing, can make it seem like one half of the display is slightly behind the other while you're scrolling, and it’s most apparent while using the iPad Mini in portrait mode. &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; executive editor Dieter Bohn noted the issue in a tweet and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;in his review&lt;/a&gt; of the device published this morning. Despite our requests before and after publishing the review, the company did not respond or comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8cFw9a"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars&lt;/em&gt; explains that the issue happens because the iPad starts drawing the lines on one side of the screen, and it takes time to go from one side to the other. A tiny amount of time, yes, but it can be noticeable depending on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3bKrD"&gt;You can see what it looks like below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="91zdci"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here is is slow-mo video of scrolling on the iPad Min i slowed down EVEN MORE in a frame-by-frame step through. Notice how the right moves up faster than the left.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In normal usage you barely see it, but every now and then it become noticeable. In landscape it goes away entirely &lt;a href="https://t.co/iq9LGJzsDI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iq9LGJzsDI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1440678843589689346?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lmPztH"&gt;If you want to see how LCD screens refresh in shocking detail, The Slow Mo Guys on YouTube &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/3BJU2drrtCM?t=250"&gt;have done a video&lt;/a&gt; showing how it works with TVs and iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CW2ggO"&gt;Apple is correct in stating this effect is common in LCD displays. It’s very possible that the screen you’re reading this on right now would display the same effect if you &lt;a href="https://www.testufo.com/scanskew"&gt;loaded up a webpage that tests for it&lt;/a&gt; — my laptop shows it quite strongly. The reason it sticks out on the iPad Mini, though, is that it’s frequently used in alignments where the problem is most apparent — it’s not likely to be an issue on a landscape display where you’re scrolling vertically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCjgTe"&gt;This effect also happens with many video cameras, for largely the same reasons: if you pan fast enough, straight items like poles and trees will slant to one side, as the data is read from the top of the camera’s sensor to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lRD3l"&gt;While the effect is common (and subtle on the iPad Mini, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;we don’t think it’s a deal-breaker&lt;/a&gt; given how good the screen is otherwise and the inclusion of USB-C), it seems noticeably worse on this particular model than other recent iPads. It also feels unusual that Apple isn’t concerned about it while managing to avoid jelly scrolling on both higher-end iPad models and even my previous-generation iPad Mini (which retailed for significantly less than the new model). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s upcoming global music series will have an interactive experience for each artist</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FzSoLc2LxCzV5y-bwG0ahTzZ_jA=/0x0:1106x737/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69922515/SoundwaveHamaki_notext.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mohamed Hamaki will be featured in &lt;/em&gt;Fortnite&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4SbxOL"&gt;Epic Games has announced the next set of musical performances coming to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, called &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-presents-the-soundwave-series-musical-shows-kicking-off-with-mohamed-hamaki?sessionInvalidated=true"&gt;the Soundwave Series&lt;/a&gt;. The new series will feature artists from around the world, and players will be able to experience music from each artist in an interactive experience in-game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YjOCTq"&gt;Epic is well known for bringing musical performances to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;including spectacular shows for huge artists like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling"&gt;Ariana Grande&lt;/a&gt; and concerts hosted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21423004/fortnite-party-royale-concert-series-dominic-fike"&gt;on the non-violent party royale island&lt;/a&gt;. But Epic is increasingly working with its community to create signature experiences for the game in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s Creative mode, such as with this summer’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550240/fortnite-easy-life-concert-o2-arena"&gt;Easy Life virtual concert&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22679754/fortnite-balenciaga-collaboration-epic-games-unreal-engine"&gt;Balenciaga-themed “Strange Times” hub&lt;/a&gt;. The first show in the Soundwave Series, featuring Egyptian artist Mohamed Hamaki, will continue that trend, as will the future shows in the Soundwave Series, Epic tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vVPFGm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hamaki’s show kicks off on October 1st&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s1Toti"&gt;Hamaki’s show kicks off on October 1st at 2PM ET and will be available until October 3rd at 2PM ET. Interestingly, there will be multiple ways to see the event: you can attend by jumping into a dedicated playlist or watch it during a typical battle royale match via a picture-in-picture mode, which has been used in the past &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20706969/fortnite-world-cup-picture-in-picture-pip-live-event-viewing-in-game"&gt;to show competitive &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;in game&lt;/a&gt;. (This picture-in-picture feature will only be available for certain times during the 48-hour Hamaki event.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6IXt8"&gt;The new series seemingly marks Epic’s next initiative to make &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; something more than just a game. The concerts not only offer something else for players to do, but the picture-in-picture feature could keep players locked into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s universe for music instead of turning to something like Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0xyyi"&gt;In the coming months, the Soundwave Series will also feature Australian singer-songwriter Tones And I, Brazilian rapper Emicida, Japanese pop artist and music producer Gen Hoshino, and French-Malian singer Aya Nakamura, Epic says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sable is an adventure made from the most chill parts of Breath of the Wild</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZZzEoWSWL2TjxYTWxs2bvU72Qvo=/300x0:1920x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69922326/2021_09_20__12_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Shedworks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Zoom through sandy dunes vibing to the sounds of Japanese Breakfast&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="gG22Am"&gt;When I think of &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt;, trying to conjure for it an elevator pitch that I might use to convince my friends to play, my mind settles on describing it as: what if the pod-racing sequence from &lt;em&gt;The Phantom Menace&lt;/em&gt; made a baby with &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild &lt;/em&gt;in a world where no one suffers, and everyone’s needs are met? It’s an unwieldy description, but it gets at the heart of what I love about the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shJNSx"&gt;Developed by Shedworks, a small team based in London, &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt; generated a lot of interest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/14/17462494/sable-xbox-preview-moebius-zelda-e3-2018"&gt;at its E3 2018 preview&lt;/a&gt; with its &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=moebius&amp;amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enCA717CA718&amp;amp;sxsrf=AOaemvICNzk50BwPfnqvgdtRD1RkPoUIvg:1632857515176&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;sqi=2&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwj5mqShtKLzAhV-Q_EDHWeCC4MQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;amp;biw=1274&amp;amp;bih=798&amp;amp;dpr=1"&gt;Moebius-inspired art style&lt;/a&gt; and similarities to &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;. Comparisons between &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;BotW&lt;/em&gt; are inevitable but welcome, according to its developers, who said they took heavy inspiration from 2017’s nigh universally acclaimed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/13/16771360/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-game-of-the-year-2017"&gt;game of the year&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt;, as in &lt;em&gt;BotW&lt;/em&gt;, the seemingly endless world lies open to you, demanding no more from you than your attention and appreciation. Almost anything can be scaled, there are hundreds of bugs, clothing items, and cosmetics to collect, and, predictably, there’s a paragliding feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="55quoi"&gt;But that’s where the similarities end. Rather than being driven to defeat an ancient enemy, you are the engine in &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt;. There is no combat, no evil to outwit, nor any grand mystery the game demands you solve. Instead, &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt; gifts you with a pod-racer and some encouraging words of self-determination and discovery, then lets you go. I didn’t think I’d enjoy such a game. I’m a creature of structure, preferring an objective be clearly spelled out for me. Without that kind of guidance, I grow bored of aimless wanderings or become so paralyzed with choice that I simply decide to do nothing and turn off the game. But &lt;em&gt;Sable’&lt;/em&gt;s desert world, hiding discoveries buried within and above the dunes, enticed me into a state of pleasant and quiet contentment instead of mindless wanderings. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m1jUpUiyRj9bBSvbwy3JO9b2FzY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22885447/Sable_4.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Shedworkds&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bnmoLZ"&gt;You play as the titular Sable, a person on the cusp of adulthood who embarks on their coming of age journey called “The Gliding.” In Sable’s culture, young people are sent out alone to experience the world and learn their place in it. To figure that out, they must earn masks that denote a particular profession, and at the end of their Gliding, they must choose a mask to lock in the vocation they will be bound to for the rest of their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5tV5mB"&gt;To earn masks, Sable is given tasks by the people they encounter on their gliding, the reward for which is usually a badge. The tasks are simple, usually involving you collecting some kind of item, which requires a bit of creative platforming, and that’s it. Collect three of the same type of badge and exchange them for a mask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQW5NJ"&gt;Do not approach &lt;em&gt;Sable &lt;/em&gt;expecting it to be a bunch of side-quests strung together to form a full game. Though there are the characters who give you badge quests, the majority of what you experience in the game is because of your own exploration, and therein lies its charm. There were often times when I was heading between objectives that I noticed something interesting-looking on the horizon. The landscape unfurled like a kicked piece of carpet, revealing a visually distinct piece of land or a structure that begged to be explored. You’re rewarded for your inquisitiveness with money, clothing, or a bike cosmetic. There are also little Korok-like creatures called Chums that, if you turn them into their mother, will reward you with an increased stamina bar. There are no quests that point to these areas, so you’d never know they existed without wandering into them. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hScgLG7JOPlWR--IUz9sUj8iZ7A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22885450/2021_09_24__3_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Shedworks&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Sable meeting the chum queen.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lauRak"&gt;You may run into some problems playing &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt;. The game suffers from frustrating bugs that occur just often enough to distract from an otherwise lovely experience. Quest objectives sometimes don’t spawn or trigger. Saving and quitting usually fixes the issue, but it doesn’t always happen on the first try. Also,&lt;em&gt; Sable&lt;/em&gt; can clip through surfaces you want to climb, which can undo some healthy progress if you’re in the middle of some creative platforming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lx9U5d"&gt;I also appreciate that the point of &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt; is for you to cruise on your hoverbike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688375/sable-soundtrack-music-composer-japanese-breakfast-interview"&gt;vibing to music&lt;/a&gt; that wouldn’t sound out of place on a “lofi beats to chill to” playlist, but sometimes, I wish there was just a little bit more in the world for you to see. The landscape is the attraction, and it is breathtaking, but there were times that after cresting a dune, I had hoped to see a hidden town or a temple to explore instead of just more sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQhv0N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt; is a soft, slow game that only asks of you to be present in your surroundings. I learned that lesson acutely and by accident. At one point, I noticed that I didn’t know what I could do with the menagerie of bugs I collected. To find out, I fast-traveled to the nearest vendor to see if I could sell them or trade them for a badge. While speaking to the vendor, I noticed smoke billowing in the distance — indicative of some kind of settlement. &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt; refuses to give you explicit direction but will hint at where you can visit on your map. When I saw the smoke, I checked my map to see if there was a village I somehow missed in my travels, but I couldn’t see any of the usual visual cues the map uses to denote a place of interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="71c1y6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Sable&lt;/em&gt; is a soft, slow game that only asks of you to be present in your surroundings.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V3Rg8R"&gt;The village was far away and situated atop a plateau too tall for my stamina bar. Since most of my enjoyment of&lt;em&gt; Sable&lt;/em&gt; came from figuring out, “How do I get up there?” — I decided to try. It took a fair bit of planning and stamina management, but I made it to the settlement to find a lone NPC. I opened my map again since, once you visit a place in Sable, it gets named on your map and becomes a fast-travel destination. It was then I noticed that this place was indeed marked on my map, but I was too far zoomed out and covered in quest waypoints to see it. It felt like a bell going off in my head, in which the premise of &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt; revealed itself to me: f you focus too much on the forest, you miss the trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1Ker7"&gt;At the beginning of the game, your mother figure says that your Gliding can be as long or as short as you want it. Functionally, this means there is no set number of masks you must collect before you can “end” the game. After earning only one, you can simply return home, select a mask, and complete your Gliding. I didn’t focus too much on acquiring masks, knowing I could return home at any time, figuring there would be some point at which all the wandering would finally get to me enough to “end” the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwxWHh"&gt;While exploring, I found the wreckage of a spaceship. Inside, it was like the shrines in &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;, requiring you to complete a simple puzzle to gain access to the ship’s control room. There, you meet an AI who shares with you a piece of a recording from the long dead crew. The AI suggests you find other ships to piece together the whole recording but can’t tell you where they are. As I went about earning badges and climbing the highest peaks, I slowly found each of the spaceships, and through them, I learned the story of this world and how its people got there. Once I learned the secret of the world, I was satisfied that I had reached a natural ending point. That knowledge was what my Gliding was supposed to show me, and more than that, I had gotten all that I needed out of the game. So I returned home, chose my mask, and ended the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYM9of"&gt;Most video games are about “beating” them, giving you an objective to satisfy or a quest to complete. &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t need you to complete it. That might be why the game’s best moments don’t happen along some questline but are experienced only through dogged exploration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phgDSx"&gt;Sable is available now on Steam, Xbox, and Xbox Game Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gc0uqr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="5A0wRE"&gt;Even as more and more people in the United States start to have access to their medical records online, most are still far more likely to use their computers to log in to patient portals than a smartphone app, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2021-09/HINTS_2020_Consumer_Data_Brief.pdf"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Pt07z"&gt;Almost 40 percent of US adults said that they accessed their health records through a patient portal in 2020, according to the report, which analyzed data from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) run by the National Cancer Institute. That’s up from 25 percent in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5aHy5"&gt;The survey only collected data from January through April 2020. That captures the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when doctors started to transition to telehealth — which often requires patients to log in through a portal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EAcPee"&gt;Of the people who did use a portal during the study period, around 40 percent said that they only or sometimes used a smartphone app to access it. That lines up with a trend that started even before the pandemic. People have been slow to start using apps for their health records, even though tech companies have been trying to generate interest for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LPX7kj"&gt;Apple, for example, has a health records section in its Health app, and it is available to patients at around 700 hospitals. It’s hard to tell how many patients are actually using it: most hospitals aren’t tracking that data, &lt;a href="https://medcitynews.com/2021/09/546989/"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;MedCity News&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; found, and Apple declined to tell &lt;em&gt;MedCity News&lt;/em&gt; how many people use the feature. But one hospital that did have the information available, UC San Diego Health Sciences, said that only a small fraction of its patients used Apple’s health records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOYWuZ"&gt;Google is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379846/google-health-record-data-app-android"&gt;working on a medical records tool&lt;/a&gt;. It would be Google’s second attempt in this space — it launched Google Health in 2008 before shutting the program down in 2012, citing low adoption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7YLOEE"&gt;The report was not able to differentiate third-party apps, like the Apple feature, from apps directly distributed by a healthcare organization or electronic medical record company. The Office of the National Coordinator told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it is testing additional questions that it hopes capture that nuance on the 2022 survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKw1SZ"&gt;The HINTS data also showed that more and more people are messaging their doctors through their portals. Just under 60 percent of people in the study said they used the systems to send messages in 2020, up from 48 percent in 2017. Again, though, this data only captures the very start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Other analysis of data from electronic health records in 2020 shows that use of the messaging feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679239/patient-messages-health-record-epic-doctor-burnout"&gt;spiked around April 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and that it stayed high through the rest of the year. Doctors say they’re overwhelmed by the volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azukBd"&gt;The reasons people &lt;em&gt;don’t &lt;/em&gt;use their online medical records have stayed consistent: people said that they’d rather speak to a doctor directly, and that they don’t see a need to access their medical records online. Around a quarter of people said they found it difficult to log in, and 20 percent said they were uncomfortable with computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PeBEe5"&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic, though, accelerated efforts to make digital health and telemedicine more accessible. Doctors spent the past year helping patients set up online access so that they could get the care they needed without leaving home. This report outlines a baseline comfort level with online records before that work took place. Additional analysis on the rest of 2020 could help show how successful those efforts may have been. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla asks owners to share fewer clips of ‘Full Self-Driving’ beta mistakes</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xuJIR4"&gt;Tesla is making owners who opt in to the controversial beta version of its “Full Self-Driving” software sign non-disclosure agreements and is also discouraging them from sharing video clips that show the driver assistance system making mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwf56r"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ezxq/how-teslas-self-driving-beta-testers-protect-the-company-from-critics"&gt;a copy of the NDA obtained by &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Tesla tells those who sign the document that “there are a lot of people that want Tesla to fail; Don’t let them mischaracterize your feedback and media posts.” The company also says owners in the beta should “share on social media responsibly and selectively” and “consider sharing fewer videos, and only the ones that you think are interesting or worthy of being shared.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmTZoS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice’s&lt;/em&gt; report comes as Tesla is now working on expanding access to the “Full Self-Driving” software, all while the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673497/tesla-nhtsa-autopilot-investigation-data-ford-gm-vw-toyota"&gt;National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigates&lt;/a&gt; the company’s less-advanced Autopilot driver assistance system currently available on its cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HuF5P3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“there are a lot of people that want Tesla to fail”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="STU5Pi"&gt;Tesla has allowed a small group of die-hard owners to test the beta version of the “Full Self-Driving” software for about a year now. Some of them take their roles as “beta testers” quite seriously and try to find flaws in the system in an effort to help Tesla make the software better. Many also film themselves traveling around with the software running. Some compress their longer drives into supercuts, speeding up the footage to emphasize just how far the software can take them without human intervention. Others post the raw footage, warts and all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phvdHD"&gt;(As always, to be clear: this software does not make Tesla’s cars fully autonomous. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has himself even said that he believes the “feature complete” version of the software his company calls “Full Self-Driving” will, at best, only be “&lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/01/13/tesla-full-self-driving-feature-complete-soon-elon-musk/#:~:text=When%20Musk%20talks%20about%20a,features%20with%20city%20driving%20capability.&amp;amp;text=So%20feature-complete%20means%20it's,it%20would%20still%20be%20supervised."&gt;likely&lt;/a&gt;” to drive someone from their home to work without human intervention and will still require supervision. That does not describe a fully autonomous car.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="urkwCl"&gt;This whole process — the years of unfulfilled claims of being able to make fully autonomous cars, the idea of beta testing in-development drivers assistance software on public streets with untrained owners behind the wheel — has drawn Musk and Tesla a lot of scrutiny. Recently, though, a clip from a video originally shot by Tesla owner and investor Galileo Russell went viral and charged the conversation even more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="TdLSlV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A few people in the “Full Self-Driving” beta show the software with no edits, warts and all&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A5ZAlF"&gt;In it, Russell’s car should be merging left, but it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DavidZipper/status/1439681683880546306"&gt;suddenly takes a dive to the right&lt;/a&gt;, eventually pointing straight at pedestrians in a crosswalk. A hedge fund owner shared this clip on Twitter, where many people (rightfully) were aghast at how close the car came to running over pedestrians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfP9N9"&gt;In a follow-up video, Russell made a passing mention about how Tesla “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/gvgsoRPiWA8?t=118"&gt;doesn’t want&lt;/a&gt;” people in the beta sharing clips that look bad while making a larger point explaining why he posted the video to begin with. But it wasn’t until &lt;em&gt;Vice &lt;/em&gt;reported on the NDA this week that it was clear what he meant.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3djub"&gt;Tesla is using this language to try and control the public perception of its “Full Self-Driving” software as the company starts to open up access to a much wider group — despite the software still being in development. Tesla added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22693610/tesla-opens-full-self-driving-beta-software-more-customers"&gt;a button to the user interface of its cars&lt;/a&gt; this past weekend that lets owners request to be a part of the beta. It also launched a “safety score” system, which monitors drivers who apply and evaluates them on a number of metrics, like braking habits or aggressive acceleration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZtQfgS"&gt;At the moment, Musk says drivers with a perfect safety score of 100 will be accepted into the beta, though he tweeted that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1442707528924684293"&gt;Tesla will lower that bar&lt;/a&gt;. He also said Tesla will soon start adding up to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1442706542839701510"&gt;1,000 new owners per day&lt;/a&gt; to the beta, a dramatic expansion of who will be able to test the driver assistance software out on public roads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vertcf"&gt;Expanding access is sure to bring even more attention to Tesla and Musk’s patchwork approach to rolling out the “Full Self-Driving” software. In fact, it already has. Last week, National Transportation Safety Board chair Jennifer Homendy told the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; that she wished the company would address “basic safety issues” before allowing new owners into the program. Homendy was one of the more outspoken board members during a 2020 hearing that found Autopilot to be partially at fault for the 2018 death of a driver in Mountain View, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U6AHce"&gt;Tesla doesn’t appear to be changing course, though. Over the weekend, in response to a blog post about her comments, Musk tweeted a link to Homendy’s Wikipedia page — which eventually &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/tesla-tsla-trolls-attack-the-wikipedia-page-of-the-ntsb-director-after-her-stance-on-the-fsd-labeling-was-validated-by-an-mit-study/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter"&gt;had to be locked&lt;/a&gt; after a sudden rush of edits.&lt;/p&gt;
