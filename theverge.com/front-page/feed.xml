    <title>Renewable energy production beat fossil fuels in Europe</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Wind Energy" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/60jSFMLe4UeCGdbGc5h87St-7Ow=/0x0:4868x3245/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68718435/1229754006.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TR0Qzi"&gt;Renewable energy became the biggest source of electricity in the European Union in 2020, beating fossil fuels for the first time. Germany and Spain also hit that milestone individually last year — so did the UK, which officially left the EU in January 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbTaZ9"&gt;Renewables powered 38 percent of electricity in the EU last year, according to a &lt;a href="https://ember-climate.org/project/eu-power-sector-2020/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released today by energy think tanks Ember and Agora Energiewende. That gives renewable energy a narrow lead over fossil fuel-fired generation, which accounted for 37 percent of Europe’s electricity. The remaining quarter comes from nuclear energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="nM8R8g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“An important milestone in Europe’s clean energy transition”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WSFDEs"&gt;The rise of renewables is good news for the health of the planet. Still, renewable energy will need to grow at an even faster rate to stave off a future with more climate change-induced disasters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZeOdGn"&gt;“Renewables overtaking fossils is an important milestone in Europe’s clean energy transition. However, let’s not be complacent,” Patrick Graichen, director of Agora Energiewende, said in a statement. “Post-pandemic recovery [programs] need to go hand-in-hand with accelerated climate action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2oWQx"&gt;The European Union recently set a goal of roughly halving its carbon dioxide emissions &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22169776/eu-emissions-target-cut-un-paris-agreement"&gt;by 2030&lt;/a&gt; (compared to 1990 levels) and virtually eliminating them altogether &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal_en"&gt;by 2050&lt;/a&gt;. That’s in line with what &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;United Nations scientists&lt;/a&gt; believe will be necessary to keep climate change at a relatively manageable level. Europe will need to double the speed at which it deployed renewables in 2020 to fulfill that EU commitment, according to Graichen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rCahTJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Europe will need to double the speed at which it deployed renewables in 2020&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TKkcbT"&gt;Wind and solar energy drove the growth in renewables last year, as the growth of other forms of carbon-free energy, like hydropower, stagnated. Together, wind and solar generation saw an increase of 10 percent in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0JPvdO"&gt;Coal generation, on the other hand, tumbled a whopping 20 percent last year. About half of that decline was because of new wind and solar capacity, according to the report. The rest can be attributed to an uptick in natural gas and a drop in electricity demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. That left coal generation in 2020 at about half of what it was in 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9y1NsS"&gt;Nuclear energy generation also fell dramatically last year. It saw a record 10 percent drop, following the permanent closure of reactors in Sweden and Germany. Nuclear energy is projected to keep shrinking as more countries phase out their facilities, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LhGK1u"&gt;Taking all of these trends into account, Europe’s electricity in 2020 was 29 percent cleaner than it was five years ago. In 2015, each kilowatt-hour of electricity used resulted in roughly 317 grams of carbon dioxide. Now, that same amount of electricity only creates about 226 grams of CO2. And the race to get that figure down to zero is just heating up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvOn1V"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uz2FLl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon prepaid customers can now access fast 5G Ultra Wideband </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qZZpbDEc25r3ju_2LnklEcThvHc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68718427/aurora.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Verizon’s 5G UW delivers truly impressive speeds. | Verizon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Eyl0jj"&gt;Verizon is extending access to its fast mmWave 5G network to its prepaid customers for the first time. A &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fprepaid%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F25%2F22248705%2Fverizon-prepaid-5g-uw#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new unlimited plan&lt;/a&gt; starts at $75 a month — $10 more than the standard unlimited prepaid plan — and includes access to Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband network. Previously, 5G UW access was limited to postpaid customers on certain unlimited plans. All prepaid and postpaid plans continue to include access to Verizon’s slower Nationwide 5G network, which is currently only a bit faster than LTE.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZ1kp0"&gt;The 5G UW network does offer impressive speeds, but it’s limited by very short signal range. Currently, Verizon offers the service in parts of 64 cities, so if you’re thinking about upgrading to a plan that includes UW, you’ll definitely want to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fcoverage-map%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F25%2F22248705%2Fverizon-prepaid-5g-uw#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;consult the coverage map&lt;/a&gt;. Bear in mind also that the signal doesn’t penetrate walls, so don’t expect to pick it up in your living room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JqRMhk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"So you got a 5G phone, but is your plan ready? ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22194419/5g-phone-plans-us-carriers-guide"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="u1STAx"&gt;It’s also worth noting that not all 5G phones support 5G UW, particularly budget devices. Compatible phones sold by Verizon are often indicated by a UW in the model name, but if you plan to bring your own device, that’s something worth checking. 5G phones that don’t support UW will still work with the company’s Sub-6GHz Nationwide 5G network.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think is worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model.

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple makes a 64GB and 256GB model of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="WEZSI9"&gt;Amazon also has the 256GB model on sale for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07NHN9W4J/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=30c1a3c3ccf23b03df2946eb45259688&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$529 in space gray&lt;/a&gt; or for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PSK4LGQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=db5f47b2ffdf2f269e41ab38b0916322&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$530 in silver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to last year’s 10.5-inch display, and features thinner bezels around the display. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;

The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749 respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also has Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; it also has a high refresh display. In fact, the iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, which comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="B73hce"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Pro review 2020: small spec bump, big camera bump","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch model with 128GB of storage starts at $800; bumping the screen size up to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8em56"&gt;If you are looking to pick up the 11-inch model at a discounted price, Amazon has the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08631S3BP/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=ec9f3ab0f5e7827303dfa0d2a8efa4c7&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model with Wi-Fi in silver marked down to $759.05&lt;/a&gt; (with a coupon applied) and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08639YQTV/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=5de51a395ed06fc6671cc2868597f47a&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB configuration as low as $845&lt;/a&gt;. If you are okay with spending $1,000 or more, you can get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B0863BD9FH/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4b8c5406e9ab9be0673877af4a14e335&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for as low as $1,040 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5QUP2"&gt;Of course, if you have money to spend and want a ton of storage, you can buy the 11-inch &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08631TDC3/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=f9ea03b10d85b158021643fd4d952af6&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB configuration in space gray for only $1,230&lt;/a&gt;; that’s $69 off its usual retail price of $1,299.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eK4A7f"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="48UoRv"&gt;If you want a slightly bigger screen, Amazon has the 12.9-inch iPad Pro on sale &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0863D15R6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=be14269e1a91e1c17130d0142bcbd230&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting at $949&lt;/a&gt; for the base model, which includes 128GB of storage. If you need more storage, you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862HNWGK/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=ffc689de651b8297993943adb5f6d337&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $999&lt;/a&gt; or you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JK4BQ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=b440c8822358c1aa20675aa6d537973a&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB for $1,224 in space gray&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08638ZQKT/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=c7f8f5e2a5b422641d971efd26e586e2&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $1,225 in silver&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2My51r"&gt;The 12.9-inch 1TB model with Wi-Fi only is also discounted at Amazon.

    <title>Apple adds walking with celebrities to Fitness Plus’ features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YuCK6A5BdasQpfqhR_YfyzebpWc=/0x110:653x545/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68718208/Apple_TimeToWalk_DollyParton.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jung1b"&gt;Apple is adding &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F01%2Ftime-to-walk-an-inspiring-audio-walking-experience-comes-to-apple-fitness-plus%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F25%2F22248678%2Fapple-time-to-walk-celebrity-guided-audio-dolly-parton-shawn-mendes#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;celebrity-guided walking workouts to Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt; today, with new walks to  be added every Monday through the end of April. The new feature, called “Time to Walk,” pairs music and inspirational monologues from famous musicians, athletes, and actors with the exercise tracking that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163126/apple-fitness-plus-launch-date-subscription-service-price"&gt;Apple Watch and Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt; are known for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InwhMS"&gt;Today’s launch includes walks with Shawn Mendes, Dolly Parton, Draymond Green, and Uzo Aduba. Apple says each Time to Walk episode features “personal, life shaping moments” from each influential person’s life and career, along with lessons, memories, and moments of levity. The celebrities will also introduce a playlist of songs after their talk to keep the motivation going for the rest of your walk and beyond. Also interesting to note, Apple says each episode was recorded as the celebrity guests walked in a place that was personally meaningful to them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JpXS0TDlTIL6olsbFThBuANHHkk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258447/apple_time_to_walk_apple_watch_portrait_mendes_01252021_carousel.jpg.large_2x.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the kind of photos that can appear during a Time to Walk workout.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aHvc34"&gt;On the technical side of things, Time to Walk episodes will be automatically downloaded to Fitness Plus subscribers’ Apple Watches and will play over Bluetooth headphones. Walkers will have access to the usual exercise metrics like time, pace, heart rate, and distance, and Apple says Time to Walk will display photos on your Apple Watch timed to moments in each guest’s story. Time to Walk is called Time to Push for wheelchair users, and it relies on watchOS’s wheelchair workout tracking to provide fitness information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1qXSl"&gt;In terms of subject matter and tone, Time to Walk episodes sound like they’re more in the TED Talk school of inspirational audio than something you might hear on a laidback podcast, but for fans of each star or influential guest, they might be worth a listen and stroll.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter launches Birdwatch, a fact-checking program intended to fight misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WPRjHqeCwO3MiOJoF4_-qMqCtC8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68718182/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AH6GQo"&gt;Twitter has launched its Birdwatch program, meant to address misinformation on the platform by allowing users to fact-check tweets, the company &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/product/2021/introducing-birdwatch-a-community-based-approach-to-misinformation.html"&gt;announced Monday&lt;/a&gt;. Users in the pilot program, which will only include about 1,000 users in the US to start, will eventually be able to add notes to tweets to provide context. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rb5k8"&gt;For now, users participating in the pilot can write notes on individual tweets, but the notes won’t be publicly visible on Twitter itself, only on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/birdwatch/download-data"&gt;the public Birdwatch website&lt;/a&gt;. Pilot users can also rate notes submitted by other participants in the program there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qa1G27"&gt;Here’s an example of what a tweet with the Birdwatch notes would look like: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iZT3Yny_RJZkLX5G2WKRgR0nHbQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258551/example_birdwatch.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of what tweets with Birdwatch notes would look like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0XU8Zk"&gt;“We believe this approach has the potential to respond quickly when misleading information spreads, adding context that people trust and find valuable,” Twitter VP of product Keith Coleman wrote in a blog post. “Eventually we aim to make notes visible directly on Tweets for the global Twitter audience, when there is consensus from a broad and diverse set of contributors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdjKiZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/4/21500687/twitter-birdwatch-misinfo-tool-propaganda"&gt;Twitter first confirmed it was working on Birdwatch&lt;/a&gt; last year, but it was not expected to release the program ahead of the US presidential election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="njmWyW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  Today we’re introducing &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/birdwatch?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Birdwatch&lt;/a&gt;, a community-driven approach to addressing misleading information. And we want your help. (1/3) &lt;a href="https://t.co/aYJILZ7iKB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/aYJILZ7iKB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1353766523664531459?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4crues"&gt;Like most social media companies, Twitter has grappled with the spread of misinformation and propaganda across its platform. The company took steps to try to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21509439/twitter-election-trump-quote-tweet-labels-rules-election"&gt;combat election misinformation&lt;/a&gt; during the US presidential campaign and after by labeling tweets with wrong or misleading information about the election. The program had mixed results, however, and did not appear to act as a deterrent to former President Trump, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22218753/twitter-bans-trump-permanently-realdonaldtrump"&gt;whose account was permanently suspended&lt;/a&gt; in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1uHsd"&gt;Twitter says it has interviewed more than 100 people across the political spectrum, who told the company that the Birdwatch notes provided useful context to better understand the tweets. “Our goal is to build Birdwatch in the open, and have it shaped by the Twitter community,” Coleman wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NydzGj"&gt;All data contributed to Birdwatch will be available and downloadable in TSV files, and Twitter will publish the algorithms that power the program publicly in a Birdwatch Guide, the company said. The initial ranking system is &lt;a href="https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch/about/ranking-notes/"&gt;available at Twitter’s GitHub page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKGZlv"&gt;“We know there are a number of challenges toward building a community-driven system like this — from making it resistant to manipulation attempts to ensuring it isn’t dominated by a simple majority or biased based on its distribution of contributors,” Coleman noted. “We’ll be focused on these things throughout the pilot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0t8Eq"&gt;To sign up to participate in Birdwatch, users can &lt;a href="https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch/contributing/signing-up/"&gt;apply here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFHE8Z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DQbwL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFA6gj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nTXaJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="aSYpH7"&gt;After pressure from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/slpng_giants/status/1351584021705228289"&gt;activist group Sleeping Giants&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon has banned groups tied to the Oath Keepers and the Three Percenters militia movements from its AmazonSmile charity program, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Members of the Oath Keepers and the Three Percenters &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/18/us/politics/capitol-riot-militias.html"&gt;have been arrested&lt;/a&gt; for their suspected involvement in the January 6th attack of the US Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XpNsP"&gt;Through its &lt;a href="https://org.amazon.com/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AmazonSmile program&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon donates 0.5 percent of eligible purchases on the site to a user’s chosen charity. Users can pick from more than 1 million charities — a list that, until recently, included the Oath Keepers and Three Percenters groups. AmazonSmile’s &lt;a href="https://org.amazon.com/agreement?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;participation agreement&lt;/a&gt; says that groups that engage in or support hate, terrorism, or violence aren’t eligible for AmazonSmile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazonsmile?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@amazonsmile&lt;/a&gt;, why are you helping the Oath Keepers, a militia group, raise money?? &lt;a href="https://t.co/MTmrfMqHnI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/MTmrfMqHnI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sleeping Giants (@slpng_giants) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/slpng_giants/status/1351584021705228289?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cjMhbp"&gt;Amazon banned a total of five groups in response to the pressure, including Delaware III Percent, the Texas wing of the American Patriot Vanguard III Percent group, Oath Keepers United, Indiana Oath Keepers Inc., and Oath Keepers Educational Foundation, according to Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCegBb"&gt;Three people with ties to the Oath Keepers who were involved in the January 6th riots were charged with conspiracy to commit federal crimes &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/19/us/politics/oath-keepers-capitol-riot.html"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;. The FBI has also &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/oath-keeper-three-percenter-arrests/2021/01/17/27e726f2-5847-11eb-a08b-f1381ef3d207_story.html"&gt;filed charges&lt;/a&gt; against a man believed to be affiliated with the Three Percenters due to his connection with the riots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvkAsf"&gt;This isn’t the first time Amazon has come under scrutiny for groups that are a part of AmazonSmile. Last February, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/feb/22/amazon-to-donate-to-drug-charity-linked-to-scientology"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; revealed&lt;/a&gt; that people could select a drug rehabilitation charity linked to the Church of Scientology to receive donations through AmazonSmile. In December, &lt;a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/dozens-anti-lgbt-groups-fundraising-amazon/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;openDemocracy&lt;/em&gt; found dozens&lt;/a&gt; of US-based anti-LGBT groups fundraising on AmazonSmile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Elpt9G"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: phones, MagSafe or not, should be kept away from your pacemaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The magnets mean you can use the phone while it’s wirelessly charging instead of leaving it on the pad." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bTVeOfs4DCjFTU5QWruINBqgQZo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68718105/dbohn_201019_4243_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ccalXT"&gt;When it comes to whether MagSafe-enabled iPhones are safe around pacemakers or other implanted medical devices, Apple and medical device makers have the same advice: it should be okay, but it’s best not to risk it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9UKid"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/23/apple-updates-iphone-magnet-support-document/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; spotted an update&lt;/a&gt; to one of &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211900"&gt;Apple’s support documents&lt;/a&gt;, where the company advises that iPhones should be kept at least six inches away from a pacemaker or implanted defibrillator during normal use and a foot away if the device is actively using wireless charging (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/01/24/iphone-12-magsafe-pacemakers-support/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOq33f"&gt;This advice isn’t specific to the MagSafe phones. Apple says the additional magnets shouldn’t make the phones any more likely to turn off your implanted medical device than any other phone, a sentiment Medtronic, the manufacturer of such devices, seems to agree with. The company &lt;a href="https://news.medtronic.com/Medtronic-Statement-Magnets-in-iPhone-12-Heart-Rhythm-Journal"&gt;released the following statement&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="0romen"&gt;Medtronic has analyzed iPhone technology and found that it presents no increased risk of interference with Medtronic implantable cardiac rhythm devices, such as pacemakers, implantable defibrillators (ICDs), and cardiac resynchronization therapy defibrillators (CRT-Ds), when used according to labeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Xn1MbM"&gt;Both Apple’s update and Medtronic’s statement come after &lt;a href="https://www.heartrhythmjournal.com/article/S1547-5271(20)31227-3/fulltext"&gt;a recently released study&lt;/a&gt; in which a researcher was able to deactivate a patient’s implanted defibrillator by holding an iPhone 12 directly over the device. It’s worth noting that the study was only carried out on one person and didn’t show if the same results would have occurred with a non-MagSafe device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4exIs6"&gt;Implanted medical devices deactivating when magnets are held over them isn’t anything new. In fact, it’s expected behavior. The devices are built to deactivate when a magnet is held over them, and doctors should always inform patients about the risks and necessary precautions when they’re using an implanted medical device. Apple’s documentation advises you to “consult with your physician and your device manufacturer for specific guidelines.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="REhcB0"&gt;But in case it’s been a while since you talked to your doctor, here’s your reminder: it’s best to keep any electronic devices away from your implanted medical devices, whether or not they explicitly include magnets. There’s never a good time for your heart to stop beating like it should.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will let researchers study how advertisers targeted users with political ads prior to Election Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sXZoPKn_krFttL0XsFkwmr_GAZg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68718016/mdoying_180411_2400_0043still.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ob6dTN"&gt;Facebook is aiming to improve transparency around political advertising on its platform by opening up more data to independent researchers, including targeting information on more than 1.3 million ads that ran in the three months prior to the US election on November 3rd of last year. Researchers interested in studying the ads can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/28/18201361/facebook-political-ad-transparency-tools-blocked-user-data-privacy"&gt;apply for access to the Facebook Open Research and Transparency (FORT) platform here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVlX8f"&gt;The move is significant because Facebook has long resisted willfully allowing access to data around political advertising, often citing user privacy. The company has gone so far as to even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/28/18201361/facebook-political-ad-transparency-tools-blocked-user-data-privacy"&gt;disable third-party web plugins&lt;/a&gt;, like ProPublica’s Facebook Political Ad Collector tool, that collect such data without Facebook’s express consent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="04O4iW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook wants to help researchers better understand how its products are used for political ads&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MXwQtn"&gt;Numerous research groups around the globe have spent years now studying Facebook’s impact on everything from democratic elections to news dissemination, but sometimes without full access to all the desired data. Only last year, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/6/18531060/facebook-data-researchers-social-science-one-first-studies"&gt;partnering with Harvard University’s Social Science One&lt;/a&gt; (the group overseeing applications for the new political ad targeting initiative), did Facebook better formalize the process of granting anonymized user data for research studies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVDAnL"&gt;In the past, Facebook has made some crucial political ad information in its Ad Library available to the public, including the amount spent on certain ads and demographic information about who saw those ads. But now the company says it wants to do more to improve transparency, specifically around how advertisers target certain subsets of users with political advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XdfZum"&gt;“We created this tool to enable academic researchers to study the impact of Facebook’s products on elections, and included measures to protect people’s privacy and keep the platform secure,” reads a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/28/18201361/facebook-political-ad-transparency-tools-blocked-user-data-privacy"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Sarah Clark Schiff, a Facebook product manager, published on Monday. “By making the targeting criteria, such as location and interests, selected by advertisers running social issue, electoral or political ads available for analysis and reporting, we hope to help people better understand the practices used to reach potential voters on Facebook.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cofSLB"&gt;Schiff says Facebook is open to partnering with academics to “further understanding of the impact of digital advertising on the US 2020 elections.” The company will also be retaining its &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;amp;ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;sort_data%5Bdirection%5D=desc&amp;amp;sort_data%5Bmode%5D=relevancy_monthly_grouped"&gt;US 2020 Election Spend Tracker&lt;/a&gt;, but it will be moved to its &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/actions/preparing-for-elections-on-facebook/"&gt;Elections page&lt;/a&gt;, where it will still be available for download. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wByqHN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this story about how r/WallStreetBets triggered a huge rise in GameStop’s stock price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A man wearing a face mask leaves Game Stop with the new..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pxMisllxPUz5f44fsDdbnkjdFrE=/0x74:4427x3025/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68717808/1229823860.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Aimee Dilger/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uzeQ7N"&gt;The market, like Soylent Green, is made of people. That’s never more clear than when there’s something bonkers happening — like what’s happened with video game retailer GameStop’s stock since last September. Back then, it was trading at around $6.68; by this morning, however, it was trading at $146.97. (Since that astounding high, it fell to $61.13 as of 12:26PM EST.) What happened? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6U83H"&gt;For that, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-25/how-wallstreetbets-pushed-gamestop-shares-to-the-moon"&gt;check out this wild story from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which reported exactly how the subreddit &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/"&gt;r/WallStreetBets&lt;/a&gt; grabbed hold of a huge opportunity — found, naturally, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22244900/game-stop-stock-halted-trading-volatility"&gt;in the mass shorting of GameStop stock&lt;/a&gt;. As writer Brandon Kochkodin explains, the stage for the rise was set in 2019, when two important things happened. “One was Michael Burry — of &lt;em&gt;Big Short&lt;/em&gt; fame and the veritable &lt;a href="http://csinvesting.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Michael-Burry-Case-Studies.pdf"&gt;spirit animal&lt;/a&gt; for internet stock gurus hoping to hit the big time — saying he was &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761919004198/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml"&gt;long&lt;/a&gt; the shares through his fund &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/quote/1298866D:US"&gt;Scion Asset Management&lt;/a&gt;,” writes Kochkodin. “Second was the surfacing of an idea, first in jest, that eventually evolved into the blueprint for the crowd-sourced short squeeze that has blown up in January. Could GameStop fall so far as to make a takeover possible — by WallStreetBets itself?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmMbO7"&gt;The rest of the story involves ballsy moves from a cadre of retail investors with, as they say over on r/WallStreetBets, “diamond hands.” These Reddit users managed to move the needle — to change the stock price — with their distinct brand of semi-disciplined investing. The whole thing is worth a read, as Kochkodin deftly explains the market conditions that led to at least one person becoming a millionaire (at least on paper).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077’s new 1.1 update introduces a game-breaking bug</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q2kglE-JlozGJdNXjZIOgrs_eOc=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68717653/foW7FiHncAEnBbTu6d7KKA.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xksLTj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;’s big new 1.1 patch has introduced a game-breaking bug. &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-01-25-cyberpunk-2077-players-report-1-1-patch-adds-game-breaking-bug"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the “Down on the Street” quest appears to be broken for some players. The quest includes a holocall that’s supposed to trigger progress through the main part of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;’s storyline. Unfortunately, some players are reporting that the call remains silent, and it blocks progress of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3GIO7"&gt;Developer CD Projekt Red has &lt;a href="https://support.cdprojektred.com/en/cyberpunk/pc/gameplay/issue/1895/quest-down-on-the-street-takemura-holocall"&gt;published a workaround&lt;/a&gt; for the issue, but it requires players to have an earlier save of the game to try to get the holocall to work correctly. Here are the steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="zjoTxy"&gt;Load a gamesave before Takemura and V leave Wakako’s office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="klYjRg"&gt;Finish the conversation with Takemura outside the office right away&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kMmb8u"&gt;Right after the finished conversation and when the quest was updated, skip 23h&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="s8S2d7"&gt;See if the holocall triggers and the dialogue with Takemura starts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="PyqK6m"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; has been plagued by bugs since its release on December 10th, and CD Projekt Red has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22170547/cyberpunk-2077-update-hotfix-cd-projekt-red-epilepsy-risk-braindance"&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189893/cyberpunk-2077-update-patch-hotfix-bugs"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22198029/cyberpunk-2077-106-update-patch-corrupted-save-file-crashes"&gt;hotfixes&lt;/a&gt; to try to fix some of the early problems. Thankfully, most of the bugs and issues haven’t been game-breaking like the one players have discovered this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYtKXP"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22239765/cyberpunk-2077-update-patch-bug-fixes"&gt;new 1.1 update&lt;/a&gt; was supposed to be the first big patch to introduce stability improvements, not game-breaking bugs. CD Projekt Red is &lt;a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/37298/our-commitment"&gt;also planning&lt;/a&gt; another major 1.2 patch that is supposed to be a “larger, more significant update” that will arrive “in the weeks after” this latest 1.1 patch. It’s not yet clear if there will be a quick hotfix to resolve this latest issue, though.&lt;/p&gt;
