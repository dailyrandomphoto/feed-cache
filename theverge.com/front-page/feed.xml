    <title>You probably shouldn’t eat cicadas if you’re allergic to shellfish</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Five cicadas hanging out on some lush green leaves. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pcaduiW0DQhAPdf_AewOnROwIdM=/0x0:4511x3007/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69379630/1321221870.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Magicicada periodical cicadas, members of Brood X, cluster on a plant at Fairland Recreational Park June 01, 2021 in Burtonsville, Maryland.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pWLEhs"&gt;Brood X is back and ready for action. After a 17 year nap, the cicadas of the Eastern US have emerged to scream, mate, and perhaps pick up a fungus that turns them into “&lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-this-zombie-fungus-turns-cicadas-into-horror-movie-sex-bots/"&gt;horror movie sex bots.&lt;/a&gt;” While some people have been dreading the return of the screeching multitudes, others have eagerly awaited the brood with tasty &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/eating-cicadas-brood-x/"&gt;bug recipes in hand&lt;/a&gt;. But before you run to the nearest cicada cookout, be aware that you’ll probably want to avoid these crunchy morsels if you have a shellfish allergy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h1kgWn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yep! We have to say it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don't eat &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cicadas?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#cicadas&lt;/a&gt; if you're allergic to seafood as these insects share a family relation to shrimp and lobsters. &lt;a href="https://t.co/UBg7CwrObN"&gt;https://t.co/UBg7CwrObN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/3qn7czNg53"&gt;pic.twitter.com/3qn7czNg53&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— U.S. FDA (@US_FDA) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/US_FDA/status/1400135267269414914?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5fT2Ld"&gt;If you’re allergic to shellfish, it’s entirely possible that you’ll have a reaction to eating certain insects. After all, what are shrimps and lobsters but bugs of the sea? Seriously, in the colonial era lobsters were only food &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/lobsters-were-once-only-fed-to-poor-people-and-prisoner-1612356919"&gt;for poor and incarcerated people&lt;/a&gt;, because they were seen as bottom-dwelling roaches rather than a delicacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CgLdul"&gt;Like their ocean-based cousins, cicadas are arthropods. Their bodies contain similar proteins, which is what the body overreacts to in an allergic response. Their chitinous exoskeletons can also irritate your (&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22445929/dogs-eating-cicadas-brood-x-fish-bait-birds"&gt;or your pet’s&lt;/a&gt;) gut in larger quantities, even if you’re not allergic. But generally, insects are a perfectly good source of nutrition that are eaten around the world and might be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/science/2019/10/8/20835352/cricket-farms-edible-insect-snacks-farming-food-security-robots"&gt;the future of food&lt;/a&gt;. So if you’ve never had a problem with seafood, go ahead and chow down &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/kidspost/cicadas-inspire-works-of-art/2021/05/28/fe2cc04e-b7e4-11eb-a6b1-81296da0339b_story.html"&gt;while the buffet is still open&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s newest euphemism for overworked employees is ‘industrial athlete’ </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8XpOwZys4hDJaucPMFW0ED904y0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69379529/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IseoFD"&gt;Amazon tells its warehouse employees to think of themselves not as overworked cogs in an enormous, soul-crushing machine, but&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;as “industrial athletes,” and to prepare their bodies for that experience like someone training for a sporting event, according to &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/epnvp7/amazon-calls-warehouse-workers-industrial-athletes-in-leaked-wellness-pamphlet"&gt;a pamphlet obtained by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The comparison is a troubling euphemism for a company whose workers have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463132/amazon-injury-rate-warehouses-osha-data-report"&gt;almost double the amount of serious injuries&lt;/a&gt; as the rest of the warehousing industry and who reportedly are often &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365330/amazon-apology-pee-bottles-worker-warehouse-union-pocan"&gt;unable to take bathroom breaks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xDtIcu"&gt;The pamphlet tells employees that some of them will walk up to 13 miles throughout the course of the day, burning an average of 400 calories an hour. It also suggests all sorts of ways to help workers prepare for the athlete life, including changes to their diets and sleep schedules and making sure they’re not dehydrated throughout the day by keeping an eye on the color of their urine. It also suggests that employees buy shoes “at the end of the day when [their] feet are swollen” to avoid tightness and blisters&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;— advice that will be familiar to distance runners or multi-day hikers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="radXV6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon’s 2020 injury rates are an improvement from years past&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z16BCe"&gt;One thing Amazon doesn’t bring up is that athletes train &lt;em&gt;for an event&lt;/em&gt; with a definite end date. Athletes aren’t competing day in and day out, and they have time to rest and recuperate in between. The comparison becomes even more ridiculous when you look at what a pro athlete’s day is actually like: significant time is spent warming up to avoid injuries, practice may be only a few hours out of the day (read: not in eight or 10-hour shifts), there’s time made for rest or &lt;a href="https://www.runnersworld.com/advanced/a26964907/a-day-in-the-life-of-one-of-the-nations-fastest-milers/"&gt;even naps&lt;/a&gt;, and significant effort is spent on nutrition. It’s safe to say that most Amazon warehouse workers don’t have &lt;a href="https://www.joe.co.uk/sport/day-in-the-life-professional-footballer-210911"&gt;professional nutritionists and / or chefs&lt;/a&gt; taking care of their dietary needs. If an employee wanted to make up the calories they might expect to burn in a given shift, they would have to eat almost 40 apples, or over 1,000 baby carrots if they were assigned one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266369/amazon-ten-hour-overnight-shifts-warehouse-workers"&gt;the company’s 10-hour “megacycles.”&lt;/a&gt; Amazon does say that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210517005300/en/From-Body-Mechanics-to-Mindfulness-Amazon-Launches-Employee-Designed-Health-and-Safety-Program-called-WorkingWell-Across-U.S.-Operations"&gt;trying to provide workers with healthy snacks&lt;/a&gt;, but that’s not exactly reassuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IVNqqe"&gt;Unlike actual athletes — who have a lifetime of physical experience that allows them to train and compete at a high level — many Amazon workers have no background in doing highly physical work. It’s little wonder then that reports continue to find Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463132/amazon-injury-rate-warehouses-osha-data-report"&gt;comparatively high injury rates&lt;/a&gt;: Amazon’s warehouse workers had almost double the number of serious injuries compared to other warehouse workers in 2020, which is actually a “marked” improvement compared to the numbers from 2017, 2018, and 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nLB3Dv"&gt;Amazon told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; that it had immediately removed the pamphlet after it was created, but the worker who provided it said it had been around since November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEuP7n"&gt;If Amazon wants its workers to think of themselves as “athletes,” the solution isn’t wellness programs or pushing employees to check the color of their pee. Instead, it should let them work at a reasonable pace and provide them with support and personnel to keep them healthy. Trainers don’t seek to extract the maximum value from an athlete only to discard them if they’re hurt. In the case of a worker who spoke to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;, though, he said out of all the Amazon employees he had to consult during the process of recovering from a workplace injury, only one person even asked how he was feeling. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If you play Fortnite right now, you might get abducted by aliens</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RpAp0v24MTBr8M1zgixeUG0s2Hc=/16x0:978x641/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69379422/fortnite.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A promotional image for &lt;/em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;em&gt; next season.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CGD5Or"&gt;If you hop into a game of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; right now, you might get teleported across the map by a mysterious laser beam that appears out of the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGNxRz"&gt;Yes, seriously. Watch it happen &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lIHjp-TgGDI"&gt;in this video&lt;/a&gt; from streamer Ali “SypherPK” Hassan, which I’ve also embedded below at the right timestamp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lc4ogm"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lIHjp-TgGDI?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=431&amp;amp;start=431" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tNM0zk"&gt;While it’s hard to tell exactly where the laser beam is coming from, it’s hard to think that it isn’t coming from some kind of UFO or alien... thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Igtbu2"&gt;The abductions started happening in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Tuesday evening, just one week before the game’s next season &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/what-to-do-before-fortnite-chapter-2-season-6-ends-and-7-starts"&gt;begins on June 8th&lt;/a&gt;. And a few other hints seem to indicate that Chapter 2 Season 7 could be alien-themed in some way, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUkxEb"&gt;Check out &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iFireMonkey/status/1400142779670577157"&gt;this video teaser&lt;/a&gt; that apparently is on TikTok, for example, which features the tagline “they’re coming” and mysterious alien-like sounds (headphone warning, the sound is a little harsh):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="emuxJI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Chapter 2 - Season 7 teaser videos are starting to be posted as ads on TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Video VIA: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Christo61905189?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Christo61905189&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/NLMphmHeU9"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NLMphmHeU9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— iFireMonkey (@iFireMonkey) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iFireMonkey/status/1400142779670577157?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LGBwCd"&gt;And you can see an image that’s similar to what’s in that TikTok ad on &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/home"&gt;Epic Games’ &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; website&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TII9xxMtfZjoVAStvp_AjQ_bHDI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22555516/Screen_Shot_2021_06_02_at_1.02.10_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DhBfzM"&gt;It’s also not out of the ordinary for Epic to change things up at the end of a season. In May 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/4/18529463/fortnite-unvaulting-volcano-eruption-tilted-towers-destroyed-season-9"&gt;a volcano erupted&lt;/a&gt; and destroyed Tilted Towers, one of the most beloved spots on the map. And last June, a mysterious device blew up the island’s central landmark and transformed the ever-present storm &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21291458/fortnite-device-event-agency-explosion-water-storm"&gt;into a wall of water&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrVJfc"&gt;So far, these new abductions don’t seem to have quite the map-shifting impact that those changes did — but with a few days left in the season, who knows what else Epic might have up its sleeve?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Apple Card outage has been resolved after five hours</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q4n0npO9Hc_laGzjqgNIRTMSivI=/201x0:2349x1432/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69377427/Screen_Shot_2019_03_26_at_1.49.46_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QPBOUA"&gt;The Apple Card experienced an outage on Wednesday that reportedly affected users’ ability to make payments, manage their cards, and see recent transactions, according to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupport%2Fsystemstatus%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F2%2F22465000%2Fapple-card-outage-cant-make-payments-recent-transactions" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s status page&lt;/a&gt;. Interruption in service appears to have started at 6:17AM PT today and lasted for a little over five hours, ending at 12:19PM PT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2J5kgD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/25/18277417/apple-pay-credit-card-announcement-goldman-sachs-event-2019"&gt;Apple’s credit card solution&lt;/a&gt; is managed almost entirely through the built-in Wallet app in iOS, where users can pay off their credit card bill, see recent transactions, and make payments through Apple Pay. Apple said that all users were affected by today’s outage, but it wasn’t clear if every user experienced all of the possible issues the company reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jd8AY4"&gt;My colleague Mitchell Clark was able to pay off a portion of their bill and see the transaction show up in the Wallet app during the outage, so it’s possible the issues were slowly fixed over time, or never as widespread as Apple warned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCZcu2"&gt;Apple never provided comment on the actual size or scope of the problem, but the status page says the issues is resolved, and you should be able to use your card like normal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1n6ui"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 2nd, 2:25PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added information about Apple Card usage and updated the duration of the outage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YB8vd6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 2nd, 4:34PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that the outage has ended.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will stop testing most employees for weed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kvYxUHolEbO9Dnh-aHrjV2O9nUA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69379145/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UfFDai"&gt;Amazon is relaxing its policy around employees using weed, according to &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/update-on-our-vision-to-be-earths-best-employer-and-earths-safest-place-to-work"&gt;a new blog post&lt;/a&gt;, and will no longer enforce marijuana drug tests for any employee who isn’t also regulated by the Department of Transportation, like a delivery driver. In the past, Amazon used positive tests as a reason to disqualify applicants during the hiring process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVQkua"&gt;Dave Clark, Amazon’s CEO of worldwide consumer, announced the change as part of the company’s goal to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22386992/amazon-is-finally-realizing-it-has-a-labor-problem"&gt;“Earth’s Best Employer,”&lt;/a&gt; a strategy that so far has been characterized by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440385/amazon-workingwell-worker-health-guided-meditaiton"&gt;new programs&lt;/a&gt; like WorkingWell that seem to view employees as things that need to be maintained and trained, rather than people who should be treated fairly. Still, as weed is legalized for recreational and medicinal use state by state &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/4/12/22371929/marijuana-legalization-new-mexico-virginia-new-york-biden"&gt;across the US&lt;/a&gt;, acknowledging that the average employee probably uses marijuana in the same casual way people drink alcohol is good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIdQxQ"&gt;Clark also announced that Amazon’s policy team will be “actively supporting” the reintroduced Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act of 2021 (&lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/3884"&gt;MORE Act&lt;/a&gt;) which seeks to legalize weed at the federal level, along with expunging the criminal records of people who were arrested for marijuana possession.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ScvNVg"&gt;In a statement provided to &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; Kassandra Frederique, executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, supported Amazon’s change:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="y87v3c"&gt;We implore Amazon and other employers to let this be the starting point and not the goal post. This change can and should be the catalyst to a much larger move—ending drug testing for all drugs—that would ensure a more just and equitable future for millions of people, especially Black, Brown and Indigenous communities who have been disproportionately impacted by these policies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="k37r2m"&gt;However helpful Amazon’s tweaks to its employee policies are, they’re still not as good as actual representation for its workers. Luckily, in the fallout of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;union drive&lt;/a&gt; in Alabama, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22445940/amazon-union-nlrb-hearing-mailbox-bessemer"&gt;that’s possibly still on its way, too&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMC is giving free popcorn away to meme stonk investors</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Burbank Exteriors And Landmarks - 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3bbvln3lxtli5isHtUekMKtcG3c=/0x74:3100x2141/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69378775/1231701895.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X73aOx"&gt;Look, when the internet learns a new trick — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;like it did in January, with GameStop&lt;/a&gt; — it’s a pretty safe bet that people will play the trick again. So AMC is through the roof right now: it touched $72.62, a 91 percent increase from its open and an all-time high. That’s because AMC has embraced the trolls, and now the stock price is going &lt;em&gt;brrr&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvcXNt"&gt;AMC &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000110465921075395/tm2117897d3_defa14a.htm"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it was creating AMC Investor Connect, “an innovative, proactive communication initiative that will put AMC in direct communication with its extraordinary base of enthusiastic and passionate individual shareholders to keep them up to date about important company information and to provide them with special offers.” This represents “a groundbreaking new approach” to communicating with retail investors, the company says. It’s a shame they didn’t put a bunch of rocket emojis in the announcement — after all, there’s no need to be coy. We all know exactly who AMC is speaking to, and if they sign up today, they’re getting free popcorn. &lt;em&gt;I can’t make this shit up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="am9aGt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;lol nothing matters money is made up&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GtdiwP"&gt;This is also, essentially, the opposite of what GameStop did, which was &lt;em&gt;say absolutely nothing&lt;/em&gt;. You got the sense that maybe the exec team was nervous that anything they said might potentially be securities fraud. AMC, though, they’ve elected to really embrace the whole meme thing. I’m hoping there are more announcements where they get meme-ier. Like, retail investors get a free Lego rocket in the fourth quarter or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DzsKg2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/editorials/meme-insider/weekend-meme-roundup-explaining-the-lingo-and-memes-of-wallstreetbets-and-the-gamestop-stock-surge"&gt;The apes&lt;/a&gt; of r/WallStreetBets have been good to AMC. The in-person theater company had been suffering due to the coronavirus — but the r/WallStreetBets excitement in January  &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000110465921008352/tm213880d2_8k.htm"&gt;essentially wiped out $600 million of debt by&lt;/a&gt; letting the holders convert them into stock. Meme enthusiasm essentially &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2021/02/02/amc-wallstreetbets-stock-debt/"&gt;saved the company&lt;/a&gt;. (AMC &lt;a href="https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2021/AMC-Raises-917-Million-of-Fresh-Investment-Capital-Since-Mid-December-of-2020/default.aspx"&gt;also issued new stock&lt;/a&gt; because why not. “Apes together strong,” as they say at WallStreetBets!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZE7T1"&gt;A lot of the meme stocks are shooting up again. CNBC even has a “meme stock” graphic now.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="“Meme Stocks” chart from CNBC" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t7VLgJRWTeHQQ9weHhVVpzWnQ1A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22555337/E24_NrSWYAAhODE.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ooooh, a CNBC graphic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d0S1WN"&gt;Meme trading didn’t originate with stocks — it’s a strategy jump. You know what trades heavily on memes? Cryptocurrency! (You remember “HODL,” right?) And you know what makes you go &lt;em&gt;lol nothing matters money is made up&lt;/em&gt;? Also cryptocurrency! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YXfc8z"&gt;It was probably inevitable that traders would bring cryptocurrency’s nihilistic insights to the broader market. This real question is what the finance normals plan to do about it. Like, you can make cute little risk models and fill out your Excel spreadsheets, but how do you take into account the possibility that a roving band of irony-poisoned redditors &lt;em&gt;can blow you up at any minute?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7p55tk"&gt;You could say, “Hey, this is bull-market exuberance.” You could also say, “Hey, interest rates are effectively zero right now so there’s a lot of money sloshing around.” Those things are true and they help. But what the internet learned in January is that it can meme stocks into going up, and some people will make money when that happens, and there’s nothing anyone can do to stop it. It &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-01-26/will-wallstreetbets-face-sec-scrutiny-after-gamestop-rally-kke9fpzq"&gt;may not even be fraud&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;because no one is lying.&lt;/em&gt; This started somewhere, and that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-08-06/crypto-pumps-are-just-for-fun?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;somewhere was cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt;. Of course, when you bring this strategy to the broader market, you can also potentially fuck over a bunch of big, serious companies, which makes the trolling &lt;em&gt;even more fun&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvotj1"&gt;Anyway, I hope the AMC investors enjoy their popcorn.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX signs bulk deal for three private Crew Dragon missions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fEsYslv2Pz-luC3XRjdku0f4f6w=/162x0:1887x1150/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69378487/51117111424_a170f2cf95_k.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule is seen docked to the ISS in April, 2021 after a port relocation manuever with its crew of four Crew-1 astronauts on board. | NASA/JSC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4oJwkQ"&gt;SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule will launch three more private astronaut missions tentatively through 2023 under a bulk deal signed this week with mission manager Axiom Space, the companies announced on Wednesday. Though specific terms weren’t disclosed, it marks one of the biggest deals yet in the burgeoning private spaceflight industry and makes for a busy ISS schedule for the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87xQTD"&gt;The three missions, paced roughly six months apart, will come after Axiom’s first ride on Crew Dragon in January next year flying an “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250327/space-tourists-axiom-private-crew-iss-price"&gt;all-civilian&lt;/a&gt;” crew to the International Space Station for eight days. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22451779/nasa-astronaut-peggy-whitson-axiom-space-private-iss-mission"&gt;Ax-2, the second mission&lt;/a&gt;, will be led by former NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson. Crews for Ax-3 and 4 haven’t been announced yet. All flights will involve similar stays on the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qJUMEP"&gt;Axiom declined to disclose the value of the agreement, which had been in the works for months and was officially signed with SpaceX in recent weeks. SpaceX didn’t return an email seeking comment. The timing and parameters of missions are subject to approval from NASA, which manages the ISS schedule, as well as a panel of NASA’s international space station partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FleHQU"&gt;“A new era in human spaceflight is here,” SpaceX president Gwynne Shotwell said in a statement. “The growing partnership between Axiom and SpaceX will enable more opportunities for more humans in space on the road to making humanity multiplanetary,” SpaceX said of the Axiom deal on its website, referring to its founder Elon Musk’s main goal of colonizing Mars. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/it_Y9qQlMfJ4EI7YPy_VNnTVFI8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22555141/32376934667_bb5c9ed7f7_k.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NASA / Joel Kowsky&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule sits mounted atop a Falcon 9 rocket on the company’s 39A launch pad in Cape Canaveral, Florida.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uP11nf"&gt;For Houston-based Axiom, founded in 2016 by veteran NASA ISS manager Mike Suffredini, these initial Crew Dragon treks to the space station will serve as “precursor missions” ahead of the company’s core project of building commercial ISS modules, the first of which is planned for installation in 2024. Suffredini, Axiom’s CEO, said these missions keep the company on track for those commercial space station plans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09xC2P"&gt;“All four crews will receive combined commercial astronaut training from NASA and SpaceX, with SpaceX providing training on the Falcon 9 launch vehicle and Dragon spacecraft, emergency preparedness training, spacesuit and spacecraft ingress and egress exercises, as well as partial and full simulations,” SpaceX’s statement said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeQTUz"&gt;SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule was developed under a mix of private funds and a roughly $3 billion NASA contract in the agency’s Commercial Crew Program, which was started to revive America’s ability to launch crews to space from US soil after a decade-long dependence on Russian rockets. SpaceX has launched three crews of government astronauts under that program since May 2020, with four more planned in the future. Boeing, the second company under that program, is further behind with its Starliner capsule, which is slated to fly its first astronaut crew by year’s end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXa8ig"&gt;Adding four private Axiom-arranged Crew Dragon missions on top of SpaceX’s commercial crew cadence would make for a busy schedule for the ISS, which only has two docking ports that are&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;compatible with Crew Dragon, a cargo-only version of Crew Dragon, and Boeing’s Starliner. With Starliner flights planned ahead, and NASA stating it allows only two private astronaut flights to the ISS per year, it’s unclear whether all four Axiom missions would get approved for flight through 2023. NASA didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j6AVDI"&gt;“We continue to be extremely busy onboard the International Space Station,” NASA’s ISS program manager Joel Montalbano said Wednesday during a press conference on SpaceX’s cargo mission launching tomorrow. “NASA’s partnership with the commercial industry is changing the way we look at low Earth orbit.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max’s cheaper $10 ad-supported plan is finally here </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HBO Max logo against a dark background with white circles around it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QwJFiXG_ZzVeuVhWnukT496wBqU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69378412/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HBO Max logo.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nr4sZL"&gt;HBO Max’s ad-supported streaming option has officially launched on the platform. The new tier will be priced at $10 per month, which shaves $5 off HBO Max’s regular cost of $15 per month. How exactly HBO Max planned to successfully introduce ads on its premium content has been a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/hbo-maxs-ad-plan-is-a-disaster-1844957510"&gt;bit of a head-scratcher&lt;/a&gt;, as premium and ad-free content was sort of the entire point of HBO to begin with. But to hear the company justify it, ads on the platform’s content will be both “elegant” and “respectful” of the subject matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wOUrgW"&gt;“Advertising is a time-tested way to reduce the cost of great entertainment and reach a wider audience,” Andy Forssell, EVP and general manager at HBO Max, said in a statement. “We’ve worked hard to create an elegant, tasteful ad experience that is respectful of great storytelling for those users who choose it, and which we’re confident will deliver for our advertising partners as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqPxDg"&gt;While significantly cheaper, users who subscribe to this budget tier will be missing out on some of HBO Max’s more premium features. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21813364/wonder-woman-1984-4k-ultra-hd-dolby-vision-atmos-announced"&gt;introduced 4K streaming&lt;/a&gt; to its service last year with the premiere of &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;, but video quality on the budget tier will be capped at 1080p — much like Netflix does with its cheaper tiers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjlbaU"&gt;Additionally, titles will not be available for offline viewing on the more affordable plan, and users will lose the ability to access &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;same-day movie premieres&lt;/a&gt; on the service. Subscribers will eventually be able to view these titles, just in the months after their theatrical release windows end. Everyone on the cheaper with-ads plan will have full access to the service’s originals, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKos2C"&gt;WarnerMedia said in a press release that ad time will be capped at a max of four minutes per hour. In addition, ads will not play on HBO originals — a smart move on WarnerMedia’s part if it hopes to maintain its relationships with high-profile talent and creators. The company said that as users continue using the service, “subscribers can expect to see greater personalization in the ads they do see with more innovation in formats to come.” The ad experience kicks off this month with more than 35 brands at launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WszavM"&gt;Given that its originals are sort of the entire point of subscribing to the service, and taking into account the fact that these titles will remain free of ads, it’ll be interesting to see how HBO Max’s subscriber numbers change in the months ahead. I, for one, am looking forward to cutting $5 per month off my subscriptions tab now that I know I’ll be able to stream &lt;em&gt;Mare of Easttown&lt;/em&gt; in peace.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Next God of War delayed until 2022 but will come to PS4 too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eks3XJAURJTE4NhAnPspSmZJvQM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69378237/gow_screens_review_03.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="152qgb"&gt;The next &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; game has been pushed to 2022. The game, intended for PS5, was originally planned to launch sometime in 2021. Head of PlayStation Studios Hermen Hulst confirmed the news &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/06/02/hermen-hulst-qa-whats-next-for-playstation-studios/#sf246401757"&gt;in a post shared on the PlayStation blog&lt;/a&gt;, saying “we’ve made the decision to push that game out to next year, to ensure that Santa Monica Studio can deliver the amazing &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; game that we all want to play.” We also learned today that a PS4 version of the next &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; is in development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFtQaA"&gt;The studio posted a tweet confirming the delay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gGj6Kh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/LLXnEof2Lg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LLXnEof2Lg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Santa Monica Studio Is Hiring (@SonySantaMonica) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SonySantaMonica/status/1400135437763584002?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TMBPVz"&gt;Where does this leave Sony’s other big-budget single-player game, &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;? Hulst says the team is tentatively planning on a holiday 2021 release, but the team won’t nail down a release date. He says that the development of both &lt;em&gt;Horizon &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; have been “affected by access to performance capture and talent.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVKKyC"&gt;While the news of &lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;’s delay and uncertainty surrounding the release window of the next &lt;em&gt;Horizon &lt;/em&gt;title might be disappointing, Hulst made a statement about avoiding crunch at its studios. “With these things, something’s gotta give. It cannot be the quality of our titles, and it surely won’t be the health of the wellbeing of our amazing team.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this story about the rise and fall of a $77 million game cheating empire</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="PUBG" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NkOePz3-lV_2eNBGe9CRC-IqQCw=/124x0:1474x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69378134/PUBG_Deadshot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: PUBG Corp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JjZWOo"&gt;Free-to-play games are hugely successful (in 2020, &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/pubg-mobile-five-billion-revenue"&gt;reportedly made $2.8 billion&lt;/a&gt; in China alone), but that success attracts unscrupulous developers who earn their own small fortunes helping players cheat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3fiTWP"&gt;If you’ve ever wanted a peek inside that kind of operation before it implodes, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93ywj3/inside-the-worlds-largest-video-game-cheating-empire"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;’s feature&lt;/a&gt; on the rise and fall of an infamous game cheating ring for &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; which authorities call &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/93weq8/chinese-police-dismantle-worlds-largest-video-game-cheating-operation"&gt;Chicken Drumstick&lt;/a&gt; is worth a read. It features a rare account from “Catfish,” the software engineer who claims to be behind the $77 million business — and who ultimately decided to bring it to an end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWHhJn"&gt;Catfish became interested in making cheats for &lt;em&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;) on PC after dealing with cheaters himself, &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;’s Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai writes. When the PUBG Corporation released the mobile version of the game, Catfish made a cheat for it that he and his business partner eventually sold. The cheat was very popular — “it sold thousands of copies within a few days,” Catfish told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; — but also started a “cat-and-mouse game.” PUBG Corporation would patch the game; Catfish and his partner would adapt the cheats so players could still see through walls or aim perfectly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlAkVJ"&gt;The group — actually called Sharpshooter and then Cheat Ninja, but referred to by police as Chicken Drumstick — would grow into a business that authorities claim earned tens of millions of dollars, even though in China, the sale of these sorts of cheats is considered a hacking crime. Tencent, which is a partial owner of &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, ultimately reported Cheat Ninja to authorities in 2020, prompting an investigation and the arrest of the group’s lead salespeople. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lg4w0q"&gt;Catfish went into hiding earlier this year and ultimately decided to shut down the multi-layered, international cheating operation he had spent years building.
