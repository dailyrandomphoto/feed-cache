    <title>Save hundreds on one of the best TVs for gaming today</title>

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/430IObsd1R9Mr9miC61Z9z_xDBw=/5x0:1460x970/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70056365/Screen_Shot_2021_10_27_at_2.37.12_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can save up to $700 on LG’s brilliant C1 OLED today at multiple retailers.&lt;/em&gt; | LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Chp932"&gt;You can save up to $700 on one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;best TVs for gaming&lt;/a&gt; today, the LG C1. Right now, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F313720184065%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeDeals102821%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F10%2F28%2F22748849%2Fapple-airpods-pro-samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-lg-c1-oled-roku-streaming-stick-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BuyDig’s digital storefront on eBay&lt;/a&gt; is selling the 55-inch model for $1,297 instead of $1,500, while adding $120 of eBay credit and a four-year extended warranty. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/lg-65%2522-class---c1-series---4k-uhd-oled-tv---allstate-3-year-protection-plan-bundle-included-for-5-years-of-total-coverage*.product.100761679.html"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WG4HKKY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; have the 65-inch versions for $1,800 and $1,797, respectively, though you’ll need to be a Costco member to take advantage of its discount. If you are a Costco member, however, the OLED TV comes with an Allstate Protection Plan —  an extended three-year warranty for your TV — and a $100 streaming credit toward Google Play, Paramount Plus, Showtime, or several other services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5d3TKA"&gt;No matter which C1 model you buy, however, all sport several features gamers in particular will love, including a 120Hz refresh rate and Dolby Vision HDR compatibility. All of the configurations also offer support for VRR (variable refresh rate), along with FreeSync and G-Sync adaptive sync technologies, meaning you can enjoy high frame rates without screen tearing. Their HDMI 2.1 support means all of these specs will work well with next-gen consoles, including the Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, while the “Game Optimizer” dashboard makes it possible to quickly apply your ideal settings for specific game genres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id="OhS6mS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10782874"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6gdwhB"&gt;It’s only been a week since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733183/apple-magsafe-charging-case-airpods-pro-qi"&gt;Apple quietly announced them&lt;/a&gt;, yet Amazon is already offering a discount on the latest &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MLWK3AM-A-New-AirPods/dp/B09JQMJHXY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro, which come with Apple’s new MagSafe charging case&lt;/a&gt;. Typically $249, you can currently buy the latest version of one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best pairs of wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; for $220. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5amXM"&gt;As the name suggests, the updated charging case for the AirPods Pro is compatible with Apple’s MagSafe charging system. Despite this, it still works with Qi chargers and Lightning cables, and provides for up to 24 hours of playback. The earbuds boast deep integration with iOS and excellent noise cancellation, too, the latter of which silences background noise so you can concentrate more easily on what you’re listening to. They also support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;Apple’s spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;, which can make for a more immersive listening experience. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our full review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dTxNYR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10826178"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="uO3HIC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Which AirPods model should you buy?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733797/airpods-2-3-pro-max-which-to-buy"},{"title":"Apple AirPods (third-gen) review: new design, same appeal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="sIzbeu"&gt;Android users, we also have a great earbuds deal for you. Right now, Amazon is selling the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWY75DH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt; at their lowest price to date. Regularly $200, the wireless earbuds are just $141 in the phantom violet style and slightly more in different colorways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDo9su"&gt;As noted in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;, we found the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro had the best sound quality yet of any of the company’s earbuds. Like the AirPods Pro, Samsung’s earbuds also support active noise cancellation and 3D audio, which is essentially Samsung’s version of Apple’s spatial audio feature. However, the Galaxy Buds Pro are rated IPX7 for water and sweat resistance — beating the AirPods Pro’s IPX4. They also allow you to automatically switch between your Galaxy smartphone and tablet, though this feature doesn’t apply to laptops. In addition, their Qi-enabled charging case also allows for 28 hours of playback without noise cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lfXmFG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="viLELE"&gt;Samsung’s 43-inch M7 Smart Monitor is selling at its lowest price ever on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096MY3BN8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now, going for $520 instead of $600. The smart 4K monitor, which is also selling for the same price at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfSvKg0ylwZ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, acts as a TV for your PC that you can even mount to your wall or a monitor arm using Vesa mounts. It can stream HDR10 content from a host of popular apps without additional hardware, too, and supports Apple’s AirPlay 2, meaning you can easily cast content from a host of Apple devices. The monitor also comes with a solar-powered remote control and support for Google Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa, as well as USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V5VbmD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10745870"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3KtZxA"&gt;If you have an iPhone 12-series or iPhone 13-series phone, perhaps picking up Apple’s MagSafe Battery Pack has come across your mind before. It’s the company’s battery that magnetically snaps onto the back of those phones and begins charging. You can also charge devices like the AirPods Pro with it. Now is officially the best time to buy, since the battery pack is cheaper than ever at Amazon. Regularly $99, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MJWY3AM-A-MagSafe-Battery/dp/B099BWY7WT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s just $80&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jlfMWw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10782055"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l6wWl5"&gt;The latest Roku Streaming Stick 4K just launched last month, yet Amazon is already selling the 2021 model at a record low. Normally $50, the retailer is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCDXZC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently offering the streaming device for $35&lt;/a&gt;. While it’s not dramatically different from its predecessor, Roku’s latest streaming stick is faster, comes with improved Wi-Fi performance, and supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus. Roku’s players also now support AirPlay 2, so you can also use your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to easily cast content to the device. And, of course, the stick continues to offer access to popular streaming services, including Netflix, Hulu, Disney Plus, Vudu, Prime Video, HBO Max, Apple TV Plus, and Sling TV. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla owners can now remotely stream live footage from their car’s cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TJN6ITWJ1XBvLEZjcfLLSULIRoE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70056020/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ug6xHa"&gt;Tesla’s Sentry mode, the feature that uses the car’s cameras as a surveillance system to catch would-be thieves and vandals, has been upgraded to let owners view a livestream, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/10/27/tesla-launches-remote-sentry-mode-live-view-premium-connectivity-feature/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Electrek &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The “Sentry Mode Live Camera Access” feature is rolling out with Tesla’s 2021.36.8 software update, but only appears to work with the manufacturer’s iOS app at present. An Android release is yet to be confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P2S1Je"&gt; “You can now remotely view your car’s surroundings when parked to confirm the safety of your environment before returning to your car,” is how Tesla’s release notes describe the new feature. It’s a significant upgrade for the vehicle’s Sentry Mode feature, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18224568/tesla-dog-sentry-mode-software-update"&gt;originally launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Although there have been &lt;a href="https://www.storj.io/blog/automatically-store-your-tesla-sentry-mode-and-dashcam-videos-on-the-decentralized-cloud"&gt;workarounds&lt;/a&gt;, Sentry Mode has until now recorded footage locally, which is great for having a record of incidents after the fact, but doesn’t give much of an indication of what’s currently happening to your car. In &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1453476666379014154"&gt;a tweet&lt;/a&gt;, CEO Elon Musk adds that the feature also lets owners remotely talk through the car’s speaker when enabled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Fctjq8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You can also talk through the car speaker. Great for practical jokes :)&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1453476666379014154?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ezSg7Q"&gt;The feature is included with &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/en_GB/support/connectivity"&gt;Tesla’s Premium Connectivity&lt;/a&gt; subscription, which costs $10 a month after &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/10/15/tesla-reduces-premium-connectivity-free-period-30-days-all-model-3-model-y/"&gt;an initial free trial&lt;/a&gt; (currently 30 days for Model 3 and Y purchases, and one year with the Model S and X). Other features of the Premium Connectivity feature include access to video and music streaming services via the car’s infotainment center, as well as other features like live traffic visualization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VQa6o5"&gt;According to Tesla’s release notes, footage streamed from the car is end-to-end encrypted, which means only you’re able to view the footage. Just watch out for increased battery drain, which Tesla owners have reported &lt;a href="https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/sentry-mode-battery-usage-7-per-day.222979/"&gt;can increase when using Sentry Mode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s notch ‘fix’ brings fat bezels back to the MacBook Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wiu7VIMuMSoYQiWrrLF65mrNB_E=/0x0:2672x1781/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70055755/Screen_Shot_2021_10_28_at_1.13.50_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Twitter user @Jatodaro demonstrates how to use the new ‘Scale to fit below built-in camera’ feature.&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/Jatodaro/status/1453382287328874497" target="_blank"&gt;@Jatodaro&lt;/a&gt; via Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sQKkP1"&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212842"&gt;support document&lt;/a&gt; released yesterday details a “&lt;em&gt;Scale to fit below built-in camera”&lt;/em&gt; option in macOS that will forcibly scale apps to only use the display below the notch. It’s a temporary workaround for apps that don’t currently play nice with the notch on Apple’s new MacBook Pros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FC8ZmZ"&gt;The camera notch cutout on Apple’s latest laptops was meant to enable a more expansive edge-to-edge screen. But as we saw yesterday, owners of the new MacBook Pro models have seen both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22748371/apple-macbook-pro-notch-issues-inconsistencies-apps"&gt;apps and the OS misbehave&lt;/a&gt;, whereby app menus and status bar items can get hidden under the camera cutout. The scale-to-fit workaround fixes this, but results in the type of large bezels the notch was meant to negate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98Uor4"&gt;The scaling feature was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Jatodaro/status/1453382287328874497"&gt;demonstrated&lt;/a&gt; by artist @Jatodaro on Twitter, showing how checking the box for &lt;em&gt;‘Scale to fit below built-in camera’&lt;/em&gt; in an app’s &lt;em&gt;Get Info&lt;/em&gt; window will shrink the display for all apps. The full-sized display (with notch) will only return if either the app is closed or if the box is unchecked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuSL5X"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Good news for notch haters! If you've got an app (or apps) with menus that collide with the notch, just Get Info on the app, and enable "Scale to fit below built-in camera". &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While the app is running (even in the bg), your display is scaled.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Apple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Apple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/M1Pro?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#M1Pro&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/M1Max?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#M1Max&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MacBookPro2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MacBookPro2021&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/nlGqkFkXAH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nlGqkFkXAH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Joseph from Sketch (@Jatodaro) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Jatodaro/status/1453382287328874497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X7Qhs5"&gt;Apple also mentions in the support document that this scaling feature will disappear once developers update their apps to deal with the notch correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="b57Egm"&gt;Photographs from a historic moment in tech news history, the day a &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; reporter &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-is-apples-next-iphone-5520164"&gt;published hands-on pics of the then-not-yet-announced iPhone 4&lt;/a&gt;, are now missing. And they’re not alone — vast quantities of pictures from G/O Media sites like &lt;em&gt;The Onion&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Jalopnik&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Deadspin&lt;/em&gt; (as well as &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;) have been removed, reportedly intentionally, &lt;a href="https://www.gawker.com/media/go-media-staffers-confused-about-missing-photos"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymnN8z"&gt;A recent &lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.gawker.com/media/what-happened-to-buzzfeeds-old-photos"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; highlights that &lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed&lt;/em&gt; has also been wiping many older images from the web. Still, Buzzfeed’s reason for doing so is relatively apparent after management explained the copyright claims on old photos deemed some of them “high-risk.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oKBZ8g"&gt;Both cases are examples of “link rot,” where content on the internet is drastically changed because it either disappears entirely or because essential pieces have gone missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Sl171W"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Link rot hits a landmark story in tech news history&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zua7sU"&gt;As a crash history course, a prototype iPhone 4 ending up in the hands of tech journalists was a huge deal in 2010, and a key element of the moment was the &lt;em&gt;pictures&lt;/em&gt;. People got to see the phone’s brand-new design and its internal components before Steve Jobs could even &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/z__jxoczNWc?t=95"&gt;get on stage and announce it&lt;/a&gt;. It turned into a fiasco &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/police-seize-jason-chens-computers-5524843"&gt;involving the police raiding an editor’s home&lt;/a&gt; (all the legal documents &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; posted in that article are gone, by the way), but now those photos are caught up in a drama of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qHrLt"&gt;G/O Media workers seemingly haven’t been given a reason as to why the photos and artwork have disappeared from their articles, and the company’s leaders reportedly didn’t warn them that it would be happening. &lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt; speculates that it could be due to copyright concerns, citing its report about &lt;em&gt;Buzzfeed&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.gawker.com/media/what-happened-to-buzzfeeds-old-photos"&gt;doing the same thing&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="U9w4BU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10831751"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1t9uSV"&gt;There’s also some interesting timing regarding the sites’ ownership, which could affect copyright in other ways. &lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt; reports that the images that were removed seem to be from articles that were published on the sites before they became part of G/O Media. Before they were purchased by their current owner, a private equity firm, many of the sites had been part of Gizmodo Media. That entity spun out of the ashes of Gawker Media (of some relation to the new-&lt;em&gt;Gawker&lt;/em&gt; reporting on this). To make a long and complicated story short, the affected articles seemingly predate the company’s &lt;a href="https://deadspin.com/this-is-how-things-work-now-at-g-o-media-1836908201"&gt;heavily-criticized-from-within&lt;/a&gt; current owners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DiJpo"&gt;G/O Media didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wLqlqR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With that much content gone, someone’s bound to have lost something they loved&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dElkrS"&gt;Whatever the reasons for it happening are, the disappearance of so much internet history has clearly touched a nerve.&lt;em&gt; Verge&lt;/em&gt; alum Bryan Menegus &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bryanmenegus/status/1453475895000305669?s=20"&gt;pointed out on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that a &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; article showcasing an Amazon anti-union video is missing its vital images. Another&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/transgamerthink/status/1453460189672263682?s=20"&gt; Twitter user points out&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/why-some-video-games-are-in-danger-of-disappearing-fore-1789609791"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; article about game preservation&lt;/a&gt; (ironically) is now missing its art. There are other examples as well: Uncountable numbers of &lt;em&gt;Onion&lt;/em&gt; articles that have had their jokes ruined, a &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;colleague pointed out that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/14/4622148/inside-the-glamorous-ruins-of-hungary-kelenfold-power-plant"&gt;rare photos of a decommissioned power plant we had once admired&lt;/a&gt; are now gone, and former reviewers have been talking about how &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/patbits/status/1453470969205510148?s=20"&gt;the effort they put into taking photos&lt;/a&gt; now seems wasted. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X4Djdl"&gt;We’ve seen massive cases of link rot before, with one notable example from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22222371/trump-ban-twitter-link-rot-embedded-dead-posts"&gt;what happened when Twitter banned then-president Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; — news articles that embedded his tweets as context or proof suddenly showed nearly empty boxes instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BUbYCf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447690/link-rot-research-new-york-times-domain-hijacking"&gt;A recent study showed&lt;/a&gt; that a quarter of the “deep links” (or links to specific pages) in the New York Times’ digital articles no longer lead to the content that they were supposed to. In many cases, the explanations aren’t dramatic: a page might’ve changed URLs or been deleted, or a website could’ve gone down because nobody cared to keep working on it. There have been cases where scammers intentionally hijacked dead links to get unsuspecting clicks, but often it’s just a case of internet entropy. The end result, though, is the same — the content readers once knew is no longer available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LU0mTH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The web’s constantly changing, for better and worse&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="keOmIM"&gt;Link rot may be common, but it’s still a massive problem if we’re going to use the internet as a global repository of knowledge. If you pick up a magazine from 50 years ago and read it, you’ll more or less get the exact same experience as someone who bought it the day it was published. Do the same with an internet article from just a couple of years ago, and you’re rolling the dice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ALVAM"&gt;There have been valiant efforts from the likes of the Internet Archive to try and save pieces of internet history (and indeed, you can still read the iPhone 4 article with photos intact &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140831165208/http://gizmodo.com/5520164/this-is-apples-next-iphone"&gt;on the group’s WayBack Machine&lt;/a&gt; after hunting down the article’s original URL), but there’s only so much that single organizations can do. Important things will fall through the cracks unless something fundamental about the web changes or companies take preservation seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung earnings record fueled by chips, OLEDs, and foldables</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hVR10gufzv-iPmhvWBN1yCpz-Ho=/266x77:2858x1805/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70055022/dseifert_4711_samsung_z_flip_3_25.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VdKi5A"&gt;In 2020, Samsung weathered the pandemic by&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21539702/samsung-q3-earnings-record-revenue-phone-sales"&gt; posting a record high for revenue in the third quarter of 66.96 trillion won&lt;/a&gt;. The company &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-3q-2021-results?utm_source=nr_twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;just revealed&lt;/a&gt; that it set another record for the same period in 2021, reaching 73.98 trillion won, or about $63 billion. While its revenue was up about 10 percent, Samsung says its profits grew by 26 percent from last year to hit 15.82 trillion won ($13 billion).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1sfTHO"&gt;Despite a shortage of key chips worldwide, the memory chips and processors Samsung makes that go into everything from servers to mobile phones are in as much demand as ever. Shifts to hybrid work mean have companies buying more SSDs, CPUs, and RAM for servers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="P0v4PQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung will “reorganize” to focus on quantum dot  4K TVs instead of LCDs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mC4z7d"&gt;As the world’s largest chipmaker, high prices for memory chips mean high profits for Samsung, even if rising costs for raw materials and logistics cut into the profits of its consumer electronics division. Sales for its memory division specifically were up 46 compared to the same period last year, while profits for the semiconductor division as a whole nearly doubled, going from 5.54 trillion won to 10.06 trillion won (~$8.5 billion) (&lt;a href="https://images.samsung.com/is/content/samsung/assets/global/ir/docs/2021_3Q_conference_eng.pdf"&gt;pdf&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5APSg"&gt;Samsung is also the world’s largest phone maker and says that it saw strong demand for foldable like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; and the low- to mid-range Galaxy smartphones it produces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SRWhAJ"&gt;Despite reports of possible production issues and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723209/apple-iphone-13-chip-shortage-manufacturing-report"&gt;slashed manufacturing targets&lt;/a&gt; for Apple’s iPhone 13 lineup, Samsung says its mobile display earnings rose “driven by demand for newly launched products from major smartphone customers.” The most major customer that Samsung provides its mobile OLED displays to is Apple, and that company will report its quarterly earnings tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DtJlcR"&gt;Looking into the future, Samsung expects solid earnings for its mobile displays in Q4, and not just because of phones. There’s demand for OLED in larger devices like laptops, tablets, and especially game consoles like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"&gt;Nintendo’s new Switch OLED&lt;/a&gt;, which uses a Samsung-made panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3Nd1N"&gt;As far as its TV business, the company is focused on the high-end, saying that it is on track to start producing new quantum dot-based sets that will continue Samsung’s fight against OLED TVs from LG.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alienware’s new Aurora R13 comes with Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake CPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Alienware R13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JldSxs0mUjsN3pSktk-oAhS9uDA=/0x575:3900x3175/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70054246/alien_ware_aurora_r13.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Alienware&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1LEDHy"&gt;Alienware’s new Aurora R13 gaming desktop comes with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22747271/intel-12th-gen-alder-lake-chips-hybrid-architecture-price-release-date-i9-12900k"&gt;Intel’s newly released 12th Gen Alder Lake chip&lt;/a&gt; and a brand-new design. You can choose anything from the Core i5-12600KF up to an i9-1200KF, as well as a range of Nvidia graphics cards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware R13 Legend 2.0 case" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g6Ujik1JVq7D4oqjsbbAPvXnKQE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960599/alienware_aurora_r13_legend_case.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Alienware&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8pwJjZ"&gt;The R13 also shows off Alienware’s redesigned Legend 2.0 chassis, which comes with an increased amount of internal space that’s supposed to promote better airflow. It also offers the option of a clear side panel that tacks on an extra $70 to your purchase. You can still open the case without any tools, making it easy to upgrade components or start customizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3qzPM"&gt;On the AMD side of things, Alienware introduced the Aurora Ryzen Edition R14 that ships with up to an AMD Ryzen 9 5950X chip — but the processor isn’t the only thing that’s different about this machine. While the R13 comes in white (“lunar light”) and black (“dark side of the Moon”), you can only purchase the R14 in black. Despite the color difference, the R14 will still sport the Legend 2.0 case.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware R13 open case" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r07_smgKor4ivdcnUv8StNxhdJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960631/r13_open_case.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Alienware&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GCnaHG"&gt;Having the 12th Gen Alder Lake chip gives the R13 access to more hardware options when compared to the R14. For example, while the R13 can support up to 128GB of DDR5 RAM, the R14 only supports up to 128GB of DDR4 RAM. The R13 also gives you the option of installing the Alienware Cryo-Tech Special Edition CPU liquid cooler, which has a 120mm radiator with a pump speed of 2800RPM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipRJlw"&gt;The highest-rated power supply options are 750W Platinum for both builds. Storage is also the same on the R13 and R14 — you can choose up to a 2TB NVMe M.2 PCIe SSD and 2TB SATA HDD. Both the R13 and R14 ship with Windows 11. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware R13 side view" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C03pmq0pMiAGCnwTnntpOMoOYzE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960697/alienware_r13_side.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Alienware&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YxYGgk"&gt;The Aurora R13 is available on Alienware’s site right now, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/desktop-computers/alienware-aurora-r13-gaming-desktop/spd/alienware-aurora-r13-desktop/wdr13aur30h" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with pricing starting at $1,479.99&lt;/a&gt;.  Meanwhile, the R14 is slightly cheaper, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/desktop-computers/alienware-aurora-ryzen-edition-r14-gaming-desktop/spd/alienware-aurora-r14-desktop/wdr14aur30h" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with a starting price of $1,249.99&lt;/a&gt;. But if you’re not into the flashy look of these two PCs, Dell has also revealed &lt;a href="https://www.delltechnologies.com/en-us/blog/beauty-meets-brawn-unleashing-the-new-xps-desktop/"&gt;its first XPS Desktop that comes with a liquid cooling option&lt;/a&gt;. Like the R13, it also comes with the 12th Gen Intel Core processor but has a much more low-key look. The XPS will become available sometime this fall, starting at $919.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOEh50"&gt;Since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21503001/nvidia-rtx-3080-and-3090-supply-issues-2021"&gt;RTX 3080 and 3090 graphics cards are in short supply&lt;/a&gt;, it might be tempting to purchase a prebuilt Alienware PC just to get your hands on one — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385261/nvidia-gpu-shortage-rtx-3080-warning-comments-2021"&gt;especially since the shortage shows no sign of stopping&lt;/a&gt;. Both the R13 and R14 builds give you the option to choose from an Nvidia RTX 3080, 3080 Ti, and 3090. Price will vary depending on the one you choose, of course, but it will still probably be cheaper than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;if you decided to buy one from a scalper&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use SharePlay to share your FaceTime screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vVae-cS6Azvyc1ojvyhJoeTGAOg=/151x0:1708x1038/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70054096/Screen_Shot_2021_10_27_at_3.39.30_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1rVwYI"&gt;One of the new features that iOS 15 has promised to offer is the ability to share your iPhone and iPad screen during FaceTime sessions so that you can enjoy films, music, and other media along with friends and family. While this new feature, called SharePlay, did not ship with the first version of iOS 15, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22732647/apple-ios-15-1-download-release-available-now"&gt;it has been included in iOS 15.1&lt;/a&gt; and can now be enjoyed — to a limited extent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoTigL"&gt;Currently, you can share content from Apple TV and Apple Music — assuming both of you are subscribers — and a few other apps. I had no problem sharing a YouTube video, for example; other apps that are supported include HBO Max, Hulu, and Disney Plus (but not Netflix). It can be presumed that the list of shareable apps will continue to expand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B82Gs8"&gt;It’s quite easy to use the new SharePlay feature, once you’ve installed iOS 15.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="6YTBHh"&gt;Start a FaceTime session. Make sure whoever else is on the session also has iOS 15.1 installed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gnLi6x"&gt;You should see a new icon on the upper right side of the screen that resembles a small figure in front of a screen. Tap on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ApbjOw"&gt;You’ll see a drop-down button that says “Share My Screen.” Tap on that and you’ll be sharing your screen with your friend.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap on “Share My Screen” to start using SharePlay." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uVCThijIWn6KU7YrpNwga9zSr58=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960467/IMG_DD5C33FA0874_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap on “Share My Screen” to start using SharePlay.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="SharePlay lets you both watch the same YouTube video." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Njh9Kxf8AiYyMVmvf0mlfAzZptA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960468/IMG_60BC16B3DB0E_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SharePlay lets you both watch the same YouTube video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gOH64r"&gt;Now you can show off your homescreen to your FaceTime friend, play a YouTube video, or listen to the same Apple Music track. If you want to switch to the other person’s screen, all they have to do is tap on their SharePlay icon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NkI9Sr"&gt;Another way to share an app is to simply go to that app during a FaceTime session and start it up. If SharePlay is possible, you will get a pop-up menu asking if you want to use SharePlay, or if you want to play the video or music only for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ox15m"&gt;And at any time, you can go back to your FaceTime app, tap on the SharePlay icon, and select End SharePlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can see your friend’s home screen in miniature, or tap on it to maximize it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oIJXzKVleBy8TbXilrjRe4y9D28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960470/IMG_B56CC427212E_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see your friend’s homescreen in miniature, or tap on it to maximize it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Unfortunately, some apps are not yet supported." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YmKZe1FqMkh6pCpIlWooRMI5wDw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960475/IMG_B3896698408C_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unfortunately, some apps are not yet supported.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XHryBS"&gt;The new SharePlay feature in iOS 15.1 is probably going to be very popular. It will allow friends and family to chat together while watching videos or listening to music; let business associates discuss a spreadsheet while out and about; or make it easier to share and comment on your latest group photos. And as Apple adds more apps that can make use of SharePlay, it should just get better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s system to tell on creepy apps just arrived in beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JTD-U2p-SrpiBi62HoKVK65tcPk=/223x0:2416x1462/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70054031/Screen_Shot_2021_10_27_at_12.46.16.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q1L2lT"&gt;Apple’s App Privacy Report, announced at WWDC 2021, has &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=n5jlz7ox&amp;amp;1635379062"&gt;made its way onto iPhones&lt;/a&gt; with the first release of the iOS 15.2 beta, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/27/everything-new-ios-15-2/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The new screen in Settings gives users an overview of what information their apps have access to and what they’re sharing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HY1At2"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/0TD96VTf0Xs?t=3053"&gt;Apple’s WWDC announcement&lt;/a&gt;, the feature will show you what permissions apps have and how often they accessed them over the past week (for example, it could show that your weather app accesses your location every hour). The report will also show you which other web domains the app contacted and let you compare that with the sites you visited directly in the app to give you a better idea of who could be seeing your data. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ajuZM4lbuJsxSChLwSIK-RBGslA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22960619/Screen_Shot_2021_10_27_at_12.32.28.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s Safari Privacy Report, which shows similar data but for the websites you visit instead of the apps you use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NXYzhT"&gt;Some of Apple’s other privacy initiatives haven’t sat well with all developers. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22296309/google-gmail-ios-app-privacy-labels"&gt;took Google almost two months&lt;/a&gt; to adopt iOS App Store privacy labels, and both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745381/facebook-reality-labs-10-billion-metaverse"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738940/snap-q3-2021-earnings-ios-ad-tracking"&gt;Snap&lt;/a&gt; partially blamed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;iPhone’s Ad Tracking Transparency feature&lt;/a&gt; (which lets users easily opt out of certain forms of ad tracking) for missed revenue goals. It’s possible that we’ll see more complaints from developers if the App Privacy Report paints them in a negative light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYgl6K"&gt;As always with betas, it’s not a sure-fire thing that this feature will make it into the final 15.2 release. However, Apple’s SharePlay feature, which showed up in the 15.1 beta (after being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;taken out from an earlier beta&lt;/a&gt; release), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22732647/apple-ios-15-1-download-release-available-now"&gt;did end up shipping with the final version&lt;/a&gt;, so there’s a good chance we could see the privacy report soon. Whether we like what shows may be another story entirely.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A major Hollywood union could vote soon on a deal for better streaming pay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="IATSE members were planning to strike over working conditions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-R81Hbkbf_VnauFckRu1_CwoSzM=/0x0:6265x4177/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70053723/1235538501.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TI8YYA"&gt;A Hollywood union representing tens of thousands of production workers will soon decide whether to ratify agreements that will, among other labor protections, enforce better pay from streaming services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f13TRF"&gt;The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) announced Tuesday that it reached a tentative three-year “area standards” agreement with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP) that “delivers our members a fairer deal on streaming,” according to the union’s international president Matthew Loeb. AMPTP represents major Hollywood studios that include, among others, Netflix, Apple, Amazon, Disney, Paramount, and Warner Bros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tnJaZ0"&gt;A spokesperson for the union told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that lawyers are still working out details of the agreement, which could “take a few days.” After that, members will need time to review the terms. A vote should then be scheduled in the next few weeks, the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v6sjec"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you don't have the budget to prioritize safety, then you don't have the budget to make movies. Full stop.&lt;/p&gt;— IATSE // #IASolidarity (@IATSE) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IATSE/status/1453036345899814917?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7V5shp"&gt;The tentative deal reached this week will cover some 20,000 workers on productions in TV and film — including crew, artists, editors, and other behind-the-scenes roles — from 23 local unions across the US. Earlier this month, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/17/22731087/hollywood-union-reaches-contract-agreement-iatse-avoids-strike"&gt;tentative deal&lt;/a&gt; was reached for separate “basic” and “videotape” contracts that cover another 40,000 workers represented by 13 West Coast-based local unions that are part of IATSE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dprLne"&gt;That earlier agreement narrowly avoided a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711567/iatse-strike-authorization-negotiations-resume-streaming-pay"&gt;major Hollywood strike&lt;/a&gt;, which was supported nearly unanimously by the union’s members and would have had an industry-wide impact. The union’s members supported the strike authorization after negotiations stalled with AMPTP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bcNGzb"&gt;The proposed “area standards” agreement will improve pay “significantly” by up to 60 percent for its lowest-paid workers, according to the union. All members who operate under the new contracts will see their pay increase by a minimum of 9 percent over the three-year term. The proposed agreement also covers rest periods, breaks, wage terms, and payouts from streaming services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xBJPD"&gt;“We were able to achieve gains in all of our core areas,” Loeb said in a statement. “Quality of life issues were at the top of our priority list. The protective terms we negotiated in this agreement and the agreement reached earlier establish a defined weekend with the studios for the first time. The two agreements incorporate stiff penalties for failing to provide meals and breaks. Taken together, the improvements we made at the bargaining table are very significant and directly due to the solidarity of our members.”&lt;/p&gt;
