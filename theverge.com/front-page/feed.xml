    <title>Tripwire CEO out 53 hours after tweeting his opinions on Texas abortion law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NTKkQceU4M8irOIk5IpDyGMvPL4=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69827424/d70494e0_963b_11ea_b479_2d2989941d85_ManeaterLaunchScreen2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tripwire Interactive&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="giAsa9"&gt;John Gibson, CEO of Tripwire Interactive — the studio known for making horror games like &lt;em&gt;Killing Floor&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/5/22/21266348/maneater-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maneater&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — was made to step down a blisteringly quick 53 hours after he tweeted in favor of the controversial Texas abortion law. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFswgk"&gt;In the tweet, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RammJaeger/status/1434245886670901250"&gt;Gibson says&lt;/a&gt;, “Proud of&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/USSupremeCourt?src=hashtag_click"&gt; #USSupremeCourt&lt;/a&gt; affirming the Texas law banning abortion for babies with a heartbeat. As an entertainer I don’t get political often. Yet with so many vocal peers on the other side of this issue, I felt it was important to go on the record as a pro-life game developer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCABeB"&gt;The tweet drew sharp criticisms from across the gaming industry with many consumers stating they would no longer buy Tripwire games and sharing how to block the developer from showing up in Steam recommendations. Detractors also noted that Gibson’s pro-life opinion wasn’t the problem but that he chose to voice it publicly in his capacity as a CEO and in support of a law that essentially offers $10,000 bounties on abortion seekers and the people who help them.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zF4Tn"&gt;The Texas law, known as &lt;a href="https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB8/id/2395961"&gt;SB 8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/01/health/texas-abortion-law-facts.html"&gt;bans abortion&lt;/a&gt; when a “fetal heartbeat” is detected. While the term “fetal heartbeat” is not medical in nature, the phrasing of the law effectively bans abortion around six weeks into the pregnancy, which can be before a person even knows they are pregnant. A critical component of the &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/09/01/1033202132/texas-abortion-ban-what-happens-next"&gt;law deputizes private citizens&lt;/a&gt;, not the state, to enforce it, granting people the ability to sue abortion providers and anyone accused of abetting abortion seekers. For any person who wins such a suit, they can be awarded $10,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yob66U"&gt;Gibson tweeted his support for the law on September 4th. The next day, Shipwright Studios, a co-development services studio, tweeted that they would be canceling any contracts they had with Tripwire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6eaOMS"&gt;“We cannot in good conscience continue to work with Tripwire under the current leadership structure,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/shipwrightstdio/status/1434609166560202754"&gt;Shipwright Studios wrote&lt;/a&gt; a mere 24 hours after Gibson’s tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHJBni"&gt;By September 6th, Tripwire announced that Gibson would be stepping down as CEO, effective immediately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8toNo"&gt;“His comments disregarded the values of our whole team, our partners and much of our broader community,” &lt;a href="https://www.tripwireinteractive.com/#/news/tripwire-appoints-new-interim-ceo-alan-wilson"&gt;Tripwire wrote on their website&lt;/a&gt;. “Our leadership team at Tripwire are deeply sorry and are unified in our commitment to take swift action and to foster a more positive environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUuYSN"&gt;Alan Wilson will replace Gibson as interim CEO. It is unknown if Gibson will continue to be employed by Tripwire. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qV1UQc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UclEP3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hulu’s monthly prices increase by $1 as Disney pushes its streaming bundle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YZvQWmAPZBSWRc8YBsvUH4Hguwc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69827049/acastro_200320_1777_huluStock_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yI15ID"&gt;Hulu’s streaming plans cost $1 more starting on October 8th, with its ad-supported tier going up to $6.99 each month and its ad-free tier going up to $12.99 monthly. &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/hulu-price-increase-streaming-plans-1235057717/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the price of Hulu’s live TV service, which also includes access to its streaming content, isn’t increasing. Disney, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21117502/hulu-ceo-randy-freer-disney-plus-kevin-mayer-dtc-espn-marvel-studios"&gt;the majority owner of Hulu&lt;/a&gt;, has increased the prices of its other streaming services over the past year, making its bundle that includes all of them look more and more attractive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5zLgZe"&gt;The price of the Disney bundle, which includes Hulu, Disney Plus, and ESPN Plus, doesn’t appear to be going up along with Hulu’s prices — however, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348169/disney-price-increase-united-states-bundle-date"&gt;already went up by a dollar&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348169/disney-price-increase-united-states-bundle-date"&gt;Disney Plus got a $1 per month price hike&lt;/a&gt;. It currently costs $13.99 per month for a version with ad-supported Hulu and $19.99 a month for ad-free Hulu. If you want all the services, the bundle is a good deal — it’ll save you almost $8 a month versus buying the services separately (after the Hulu price change) whether you go with the ad or ad-free plans. Disney’s CEO &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/hulu-price-increase-streaming-plans-1235057717/"&gt;has reportedly said&lt;/a&gt; that the company is pushing the bundle.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of Hulu’s website reading: Upcoming price increase. Hulu (no ads)’s price will increase from $11.99/mo to $12.99/mo on 10/08/2021.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screen Hulu subscribers are shown when logging in. Subscribers have also been sent emails.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5e5M8j"&gt;For those who had existing Hulu subscriptions before signing up to the Disney Bundle, billing is handled by &lt;a href="https://help.disneyplus.com/csp?id=csp_article_content&amp;amp;sys_kb_id=fe020c3edbb12c1032f7c28d13961906#i"&gt;charging the regular price for Hulu&lt;/a&gt; then giving the user a discount on their Disney Plus subscription. Hulu’s support Twitter account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hulu_support/status/1435327411923533824"&gt;has confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that the price of the Disney Bundle will not change due to the price increase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UoSK4t"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hey there, Justin! No — the Disney Bundle and Live TV plan prices will not change as a result of the above price changes. Let us know if you have any other questions!&lt;/p&gt;— Hulu Support (@hulu_support) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hulu_support/status/1435327411923533824?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gTpEzc"&gt;Hulu hasn’t been resting on its laurels since its last price increase, though. In recent months, subscribers have gotten access to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639273/hulu-hdr-original-shows-movies-4k-picture-quality"&gt;HDR for some original shows and movies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22092452/hulu-watch-party-now-available-all-subscribers"&gt;a Watch Party feature&lt;/a&gt; that lets friends watch shows together. Whether these features and the content available on the service add up to something worth $7 or $13 a month will be up to you, but come October, that’s the price of admission.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter tests a new timeline with edge-to-edge picture and video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OTYgC7iqA7Mh4QXf7S9KReQLDLA=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69826841/pasted_image_0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Fb6Ju"&gt;Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1435287486411022337?s=20"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s testing edge-to-edge media in tweets on iOS, creating a more full-screen, almost Instagram-like experience for the photos and videos in your timeline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TtXp3"&gt;In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Twitter writes that it’s testing the change because it wants to better support conversations that are both visual and text-based. You can get a sense of what that looks like in a video posted to Twitter’s support account:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YwKkUT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Now testing on iOS:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Edge to edge Tweets that span the width of the timeline so your photos, GIFs, and videos can have more room to shine. &lt;a href="https://t.co/luAHoPjjlY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/luAHoPjjlY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1435287486411022337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XQBidj"&gt;This change, if it rolls out beyond a select group of iOS users, also helps Twitter address concerns over image cropping that it’s been dealing with over the last few years. Image cropping algorithms have been informally shown to have a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/20/21447998/twitter-photo-preview-white-black-faces"&gt;bias toward white faces&lt;/a&gt;, something Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617972/twitter-photo-cropping-algorithm-ai-bias-bug-bounty-results"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. Twitter has attempted to address that problem by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"&gt;eliminating photo cropping&lt;/a&gt;, but this design test takes things a step further with an Instagram-style emphasis on visuals. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421574/twitter-crop-issue-bigger-images-rollout"&gt;Entire joke formats get lost in the process&lt;/a&gt;, but such is the cost of progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Etpe4B"&gt;Naturally, some people have already taken issue with Twitter’s design. Searches for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%22New%20Twitter%22&amp;amp;src=trend_click&amp;amp;f=live&amp;amp;vertical=trends"&gt;“New Twitter”&lt;/a&gt; bring up plenty of complaints, like that the new layout &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gibbsgirl00/status/1435311605005406212?s=20"&gt;is headache-inducing&lt;/a&gt; and that edge-to-edge screenshots of tweets &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Sambruho/status/1435311573732577281?s=20"&gt;can confusingly look like an actual tweet&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly, Twitter might have some more tweaking to do before this test becomes something official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="xbhjgk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter is changing the contrast of buttons again after complaints of eye strain ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623717/twitter-buttons-contrast-design-changes-eye-strain"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Apple’s car chief is heading to Ford</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6hUYMbv4AhDt5Klk1Gx5stqaVTc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69826815/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Exti0B"&gt;Ford has hired away Apple’s car chief, Doug Field, to become its chief advanced technology and embedded systems officer. “Field will lead Ford’s efforts to develop the next-gen Blue Oval Intelligence tech stack to deliver smart, connected vehicles and services that improve over time through constant updates,” &lt;a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/09/07/doug-field.html"&gt;according to Ford’s press release&lt;/a&gt;. He’ll report to Ford’s president and CEO, Jim Farley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVwOTp"&gt;Field was a VP of special projects at Apple, where he was the de facto head of the company’s confused efforts to make an autonomous electric car — known as Project Titan. He had a previous stint at Apple where he was once the VP of Mac hardware engineering, but he left the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/25/5027970/doug-field-leaves-apple-mac-hardware-engineering-for-tesla-motors"&gt;in 2013&lt;/a&gt; to become Tesla’s chief vehicle engineer, where he helped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/2/17528484/tesla-doug-field-model-3-production-elon-musk"&gt;oversee troublesome development of the Model 3 sedan&lt;/a&gt;. He left Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/2/17528484/tesla-doug-field-model-3-production-elon-musk"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/10/17673712/doug-field-apple-tesla-project-titan"&gt;rejoined Apple&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K7uoWw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The departure is the latest shake-up for Apple’s car division&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1xBWRX"&gt;The departure is the latest shake-up for Apple’s car division, which has undergone numerous shifts over the past several years. Despite starting the project in 2014, work on an autonomous electric vehicle is still in an early stage, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-07/apple-s-aapl-tesla-tsla-killer-won-t-ship-for-at-least-half-a-decade?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported in January&lt;/a&gt;. That approach is a change from an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/17/13303710/apple-car-project-titan-self-driving-focus"&gt;earlier plan&lt;/a&gt; to develop self-driving software that would be utilized by other carmakers — which itself was a change from trying to build a car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0HaDcw"&gt;“We’re grateful for the contributions Doug has made to Apple and we wish him all the best in this next chapter,” an Apple spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9QSvFb"&gt;It’s unclear who will take Field’s place, though in June, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528448/apple-ulrich-kranz-canoo-bmw-electric-car-autonomous"&gt;hired Ulrich Kranz&lt;/a&gt;, a former BMW executive who worked on the i3 EV and i8 hybrid sports car, to work under Field. Kranz had recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397356/canoo-cofounder-ulrich-kranz-resign-new-ceo-tony-aquila"&gt;stepped down as CEO of Canoo&lt;/a&gt;, an EV startup he co-founded that Apple was interested in acquiring in 2020, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev"&gt;exclusively reported earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s car efforts were reportedly moved under the purview of John Giannandrea, the company’s SVP of machine learning and AI, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163939/apple-self-driving-car-john-giannandrea-ai-siri"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIIY6R"&gt;Field joins Ford as the company has steadily been building out its electric vehicle efforts, most notably with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442777/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;Ford F-150 Lightning, an all-electric version&lt;/a&gt; of the hugely popular pickup truck, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22265570/mustang-mach-e-review-electric-ford-ev-photos-video"&gt;as well as an all-electric Mustang&lt;/a&gt;. The company is rallying behind a business plan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454728/ford-plus-pro-electric-explorer-suv-investment"&gt;it calls Ford Plus&lt;/a&gt; and intends to create more cars that are fully networked and can be updated over the air, like Teslas. Ford has also said that Google’s Android will power infotainment systems in “millions” of its cars &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260176/ford-google-android-infotainment-os-2023"&gt;starting in 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG claims its ‘Real Folding Window’ beats folding glass, will ship in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1u4QfWnyjomjhiJqSwTaxDhj11w=/16x0:835x546/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69826689/lg_chem_folding_glass.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sY01G8"&gt;Bendable glass was supposed to unlock &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18088620/samsung-foldable-phone-science-fiction-movies-television-westworld-star-trek"&gt;a future straight out of science fiction&lt;/a&gt;: phones that fold. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;the actual glass we got&lt;/a&gt; wound up relying on factory-installed plastic screen protectors to avoid shattering when you fold it. Now, LG wants to cut out the middleman by improving the plastic instead: the company &lt;a href="https://www.lgchem.com/company/information-center/press-release/news-detail-8713?lang=en_GLOBAL"&gt;just announced&lt;/a&gt; its “Real Folding Window,” a cover material it claims will be as hard as glass but without the whole cracking issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ms8LSb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More PET, less glass&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5GWUE2"&gt;What’s the secret? Well, LG doesn’t quite say in its press release, only that it’s a “new material” that it uses to coat both sides of a sheet of plastic film — PET film, to be precise. (PET is probably best known as the plastic in your soda bottle.) The idea is that if you apply that coating to the plastic and then apply that cover material to a flexible OLED panel, you’ll have a folding screen that lasts longer and with a less noticeable crease than today’s folding devices. LG says it should be more competitive on price, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8m2GD"&gt;In fact, LG says the coated PET should work with tablets, laptops, and rollable-screen phones, too, like the one we’re still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22296298/lg-rollable-denial-not-on-hold-or-cancelled"&gt;waiting for LG to decide whether it will cancel&lt;/a&gt;. Also, it sees potential for devices where the screen folds &lt;em&gt;outward&lt;/em&gt;, not just inward like we’ve seen with Samsung’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Z Fold&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;Moto Razr&lt;/a&gt;. LG also says it sees “significant improvements to the fold lines that occur on the folding parts of the screen.” Maybe it could unlock a lot more of the wacky folding phone designs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266637/folding-phones-bendable-screens-names-illustrated-guide"&gt;we’ve seen in prototypes and patent applications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vqLyt3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"A field guide to the wacky future of foldable phones","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/15/18266637/folding-phones-bendable-screens-names-illustrated-guide"},{"title":"Folding phones are the stuff of science fiction","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18088620/samsung-foldable-phone-science-fiction-movies-television-westworld-star-trek"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DczbVu"&gt;LG’s current timeline doesn’t see it commercializing this tech until 2023, though, and it’s not clear how it’ll actually stack up to glass in other ways (like clarity) when it arrives. Samsung’s on the PET train, too; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;as we’ve written&lt;/a&gt;, the Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Galaxy Z Fold 3 cover their ultra-thin glass (which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142728/samsung-foldable-glass-galaxy-z-flip-explained-schott-corning"&gt;technically made by German manufacturer Schott&lt;/a&gt;) with a “Stretchable PET” layer that we found far superior to the gummy screen protector Samsung had to ship on prior models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGplI1"&gt;Samsung is reportedly ramping up production of folding screens for other phone makers as well, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;including Google&lt;/a&gt;. And it has been reportedly &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2077"&gt;working with Corning&lt;/a&gt;, which has been building its own folding glass to compete with Schott. Having even more competition from LG is a good thing if you’re a gadget lover hoping foldable prices will come down to earth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qszr7b"&gt;Even without the additional suppliers, Samsung is already pushing folders hard: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;we called Samsung’s $1,000 Galaxy Z Flip 3 “the first folding phone for normal people”&lt;/a&gt; and thought the more expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"&gt;Z Fold 3&lt;/a&gt; was “nearly normal” as well. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s Perseverance rover finally snatched its first Mars rock sample</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TBkHcUqT9oZX-Op42BCa3D9rvCk=/0x64:1584x1120/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69826616/Mars_Perseverance_ZL0_0190_0683808231_053EBY_N0070000ZCAM05076_1100LUJ.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;One of the clearest pictures available of the rock core captured by Perseverance, as photographed by the rover’s Mastcam-Z&amp;nbsp;camera | NASA/JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="45yWJg"&gt;NASA’s Perseverance rover captured its first sampling of rocky Mars material last week after its first attempt in August &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22633888/nasa-perseverance-rover-second-mars-soil-sample"&gt;mysteriously turned up empty&lt;/a&gt;. The new rock sample, about the size of a small cigar, checks off a crucial first step in a broader decade-long effort to bring humanity’s first Martian samples back to Earth in pristine condition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LCObFW"&gt;The rover’s successful sample grab happened last Wednesday at 5:36PM ET, digging into a rock scientists nicknamed “Rochette.” Using a hollow, tube-like drill bit that traps rocky material inside, Perseverance drilled a hole a few inches deep using a rotary-percussive drill installed at the end of its seven-foot sampling arm. A twisting mechanism inside the drill bit snapped the rock core off of Rochette and kept it snug inside a sample tube. To confirm it was safe inside, Perseverance maneuvered the five-jointed sampling arm to bring the drill bit in front of the rover’s Mastcam-Z camera — one of its primary eyes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EqbWZWyQzlX79dXOCZ_oDZuf7-E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22831993/drill_head.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perseverance’s drilling system, attached to the end of a seven-foot arm with five joints.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JqJ61Q"&gt;Perseverance, a car-sized science lab on wheels, landed at Mars’ Jezero Crater in February with a core mission to look&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;for ancient signs of microbial life and collect dozens of samples for a future Mars robot to retrieve and send back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMXKW1"&gt;After the rover’s drill bit captured the rock and scientists visually confirmed a successful sampling, the sampling hand handed the rock tube off to another mechanism inside Perseverance’s main body for processing. Another camera, the Sample Caching System Camera, snaps photos of the rock samples before it gets plugged into an air-tight container.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_F12AOjfRqxdh8m9qkZsbSNgtO8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22832125/Sep_07_2021_14_09_33.gif"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AaMELg"&gt;The air-tight container will be&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;stored in a mini garage in the rover’s underbelly until it’s time for Perseverance to plop the sealed tube back on the surface for collection.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x0LALhI22qqtSy-mtdBadKg4bjY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22831998/Mars_Perseverance_ZL0_0190_0683808932_104EBY_N0070000ZCAM05068_0630LMJ.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The drill bit, facing upward after grabbing a rock sample.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ofuE50"&gt;Where Perseverance drops the rock samples is yet to be determined. Someday, a future NASA robot will collect the tubes from their resting places on the surface and launch them into Mars’ orbit, where another spacecraft built by the European Space Agency will catch and carry them the rest of the way home for arrival sometime in the 2030s.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activists push to delay most high-profile climate summit since Paris agreement </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="INDIA-ENVIRONMENT-COP26" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tXywgeRLgm_P02PG8jtRtZZW4Nk=/1x0:2587x1724/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69826560/1234739239.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;UN Climate Change Conference or COP26 President Alok Sharma during a meeting with India Minister of Environment, Forest and Climate Change Bhupender Yadav in New Delhi on August 18th, 2021.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Prakash Singh / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Qed3P5"&gt;Environmental activists, including Greenpeace and the Climate Action Network,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;around the world are calling on the United Nations to further delay a pivotal climate conference scheduled for this fall. The uneven&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;rollout of COVID-19 vaccines around the world could prevent many delegates and advocates from attending, they say, especially representatives of countries hardest hit by both COVID-19 and the climate crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U1GlNx"&gt;The UK is preparing to host the climate talks in Glasgow in November, a year after they were supposed to take place. But the virus that delayed the talks in the first place is still killing thousands of people across the world daily, many of whom are living in countries where it’s hard to get a vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="MJhv4i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Not only unfair but prohibitive”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H0rR6b"&gt;“Expecting already disadvantaged people to attend without access to vaccines, healthcare, and financial support to overcome the risks of participation, is not only unfair but prohibitive,” Juan Pablo Osornio, senior political lead for Greenpeace International, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/international/press-release/49353/greenpeace-cop26-postponement-uk-fails-safe-equitable-access/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3yatC3"&gt;While the UN climate talks typically take place every year, this is no ordinary session. It’s been billed as the most consequential international negotiations on climate change since 2015 when nearly every country on Earth adopted the Paris agreement. Five years later, those countries were due to report on their progress and submit ramped-up commitments to curb climate pollution from fossil fuels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VLYFtp"&gt;Crucially, 2020 was also the deadline for the world to reach an important milestone when it comes to helping poorer nations adapt to the already devastating effects of climate change. Well-off countries were supposed to come together to offer $100 billion a year in climate financing for developing nations. That goal &lt;a href="https://www.un.org/sites/un2.un.org/files/100_billion_climate_finance_report.pdf"&gt;fell by the wayside&lt;/a&gt; as the pandemic strained the budgets for countries on both giving and receiving ends of climate finance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFLnne"&gt;That gives delegates and activists from the countries hardest hit by climate change all the more reason to worry about what will happen next if they don’t have a seat at the table at this year’s climate talks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VBjpgu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There has always been an inherent power imbalance within the UN climate talks”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2U1ZFU"&gt;“There has always been an inherent power imbalance within the UN climate talks and this is now compounded by the health crisis,” Tasneem Essop, executive director of the Climate Action Network, said in a &lt;a href="https://climatenetwork.org/2021/09/07/can-cop26-postponement-statement/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; issued today by the group made up of 1,500 organizations&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;across the world. “It is difficult to imagine there can be fair participation from the Global South under safe conditions and it should therefore be postponed until such time it can be,” Essop said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwIUID"&gt;Organizers for this year’s UN climate talks — called the 26th Conference of Parties, or COP26 — are so far still pushing ahead with plans for an in-person meeting. “COP26 has already been postponed by one year, and we are all too aware climate change has not taken time off,” COP26 president-designate Alok Sharma said in a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/cop26-president-statement-on-covid-measures-for-delegates-coming-to-glasgow"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; today. “If we are to deliver for our planet, we need all countries and civil society to bring their ideas and ambition to Glasgow.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ly6S4o"&gt;Conference organizers said that they would get vaccines to delegates that needed them. But vaccine rollout and communication have been &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/climate-cop-covid-glasgow-vaccines/2021/08/16/24db356e-faab-11eb-911c-524bc8b68f17_story.html"&gt;slow and unclear&lt;/a&gt;. Those who requested a vaccine will begin receiving their first dose this week, according to UK officials, less than two months before the talks are set to begin. The UK also offered to cover the costs of hotel stays during mandatory quarantine periods for travelers coming from countries the UK has placed on a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/red-amber-and-green-list-rules-for-entering-england#red-list-rules"&gt;“red-list”&lt;/a&gt; because of COVID-19 surges. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PImdvO"&gt;Activists say much more needs to be done to tackle unfair advantages wealthy countries have when it comes to access to vaccines &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; climate negotiations. The Climate Action Network is pushing for broad support on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421558/us-covid-coronavirus-vaccines-patent-waiver"&gt;patent waivers for vaccines&lt;/a&gt;, which they say is key for safe, inclusive talks to take place in person in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LpxP2r"&gt;In the meantime, the climate crisis looms heavy. Communities from the US to the Caribbean and &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/down-to-earth/2021/8/27/22639885/amazon-rainforest-fires-climate-change-2021"&gt;Brazil&lt;/a&gt; are coping with intense hurricane and fire seasons. &lt;a href="https://www.wnyc.org/story/climate-change-is-the-greatest-threat-to-public-health-top-medical-journals-warn/?j=27661&amp;amp;sfl=29_HTML&amp;amp;u=650199&amp;amp;mid=526001388&amp;amp;jb=14002&amp;amp;sf"&gt;Hundreds&lt;/a&gt; of medical journals declared the world’s inability to stop global warming the “&lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMe2113200?query=featured_home"&gt;greatest threat to global public health,&lt;/a&gt;” in a September 5th joint statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5Av44"&gt;Heads of the Catholic, Orthodox, and Anglican churches similarly released a &lt;a href="https://www.vatican.va/content/francesco/en/messages/pont-messages/2021/documents/20210901-messaggio-protezionedelcreato.html"&gt;plea&lt;/a&gt; today to “listen to the cry of the Earth and of people who are poor” as “extreme weather and natural disasters of recent months reveal afresh to us with great force and at great human cost that climate change is not only a future challenge, but an immediate and urgent matter of survival.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R0WyW7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4T5IT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Crypto exchanges struggle as El Salvador adopts Bitcoin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nEZ8-Ys-dfxnH8hHtMzGvR3HEj8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69826428/acastro_181126_1777_bitcoin_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fECv4r"&gt;Today, Bitcoin is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22660457/el-salvador-bitcoin-legal-tender-currency-cryptocurrency-chivo-wallet"&gt;becoming an official currency in El Salvador&lt;/a&gt;, and the markets and crypto exchanges seem to be struggling. On Tuesday morning, the price of Bitcoin plunged from around $50,000 down to under $43,000 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coinbase.com%2Fprice%2Fbitcoin&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F7%2F22660932%2Fcrypto-exchanges-el-salvador-bitcoin-price-dip" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;according to Coinbase&lt;/a&gt; — it seems that the country’s official Bitcoin app also hasn’t been able to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PnTFN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/07/bitcoin-retreats-from-the-highest-level-since-may-as-el-salvador-adopts-it-as-legal-tender.html"&gt;CNBC reports&lt;/a&gt; that El Salvador’s official crypto app, Chivo, was unavailable for new users to install on Tuesday morning. The country’s president, Nayib Bukele, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1435280500801904644"&gt;has since announced&lt;/a&gt; that the app would be reopening for signups, though he did call the new uptime a “test.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t1jFZs"&gt;Major exchanges like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CoinbaseSupport/status/1435263641087971333?s=20"&gt;Coinbase&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://status.kraken.com/"&gt;Kraken&lt;/a&gt; have also reported having issues with payments or transactions not going through or being delayed. Not everyone is having issues with trading, though: Cash App &lt;a href="https://status.cash.app"&gt;reports no problems&lt;/a&gt; with its Bitcoin services, and Robinhood &lt;a href="https://status.robinhood.com"&gt;hasn’t reported&lt;/a&gt; any problems trading crypto assets either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QeGB0u"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re aware transactions are currently delayed or cancelled at elevated rates and our apps may be experiencing errors.

&lt;p id="n5uvDa"&gt;El Salvador &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526808/el-salvador-bitcoin-currency-first-country-cryptocurrency"&gt;passed a resolution to adopt Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; as an official currency in June. President Bukele has championed the currency both in policy and on Twitter, though it won’t be the country’s only currency. (El Salvador has historically used the US dollar, which will continue to be accepted in the country.) Vendors who are able to will have to accept both currencies. The Salvadorian government argues that Bitcoin will help citizens who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22660457/el-salvador-bitcoin-legal-tender-currency-cryptocurrency-chivo-wallet"&gt;don’t have access to traditional banking&lt;/a&gt; or who often send or receive money from family in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5B2FII"&gt;The plan has provoked some significant backlash within the country. The country’s capital &lt;a href="https://cointelegraph.com/news/el-salvador-president-announces-infrastructure-already-being-built-ahead-of-country-s-bitcoin-adoption"&gt;has seen protests&lt;/a&gt; from hundreds of retirees and veterans concerned about pension payments, as well as unions and workers. Demonstrators have cited concerns about the potentially unstable price of Bitcoin and how that could affect its use as an everyday currency. In response, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nayibbukele/status/1429615971283648516?s=20"&gt;President Bukele said&lt;/a&gt; that citizens were free to continue using the US dollar if they didn’t want to use the cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook and Ray-Ban tease smart glasses announcement on September 9th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Facebook / Ray-Ban teaser" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9ArHqJ2WAgZGu1vSK8DByEgMorw=/17x0:1673x1104/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69826334/Screen_Shot_2021_09_07_at_1.22.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Ray-Ban&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DkdOX9"&gt;Facebook and Ray-Ban are teasing an announcement around their upcoming smart glasses on September 9th. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ray-ban.com%2Fusa%2Fc%2Fray-ban-facebook&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F7%2F22661109%2Ffacebook-ray-ban-luxottica-smart-glasses-teaser" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ray-Ban posted&lt;/a&gt; a promotional page with a silhouette of a pair of glasses, the date “09.09 2021,” and the text “sign up now to get your release notification” — although it doesn’t specify whether that’s news &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; the release or the release itself. Ray-Ban’s homepage also promises that “this is one story you’re going to want to follow,” plausibly a reference to &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/lessons/facebook-stories-creators"&gt;Facebook Stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNuXT2"&gt;The announcement coincides with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1434947706393223168"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1435285259503898625"&gt;apparent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/4/videos/282323160005193/"&gt;teaser&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/4/videos/2316429598489106/"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and virtual and augmented reality head Andrew Bosworth. The posts show point-of-view video clips from Bosworth and Zuckerberg, including Bosworth playing golf and Zuckerberg paddling a boat — all of it seemingly designed to highlight physically active and all-weather scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5ReXHQ"&gt;
&lt;div class="iframely-embed"&gt;&lt;div class="iframely-responsive" style="padding-bottom: 56.2%;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/4/videos/2316429598489106/" data-iframely-url="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F4%2Fvideos%2F2316429598489106%2F&amp;amp;key=9ef4a209439e42bc59783ba959d50197"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jomKcu"&gt;Facebook has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599599/facebook-ray-ban-smart-glasses-next-product-launch-specs"&gt;called its glasses&lt;/a&gt;, developed in partnership with Ray-Ban parent company EssilorLuxottica, a stepping stone toward “full augmented reality glasses.” Zuckerberg confirmed in July that the glasses would be Facebook’s next hardware launch, although he didn’t announce a date at that time. He specified that the glasses would “have [Ray-Ban’s] iconic form factor, and they let you do some pretty neat things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDvjjS"&gt;The glasses are part of a larger Facebook initiative to build glasses that augment the world visually and aurally. But they won’t have features that are commonly associated with AR glasses like the ability to project images into the environment. Facebook is likely also saving its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338008/facebook-reality-labs-emg-wristbands-ctrl-labs-ar-interface-demo"&gt;neural wristband technology&lt;/a&gt; — which it sees as the future of AR interaction — for a later release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Matrix: Resurrections teases a full trailer on Thursday with a familiar choice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2oBm1-riCf--nu7govJyyU2i-no=/95x0:1466x914/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69826307/Screen_Shot_2021_09_07_at_9.43.48_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9t2dtu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix: Resurrections &lt;/em&gt;is still a ways off &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/08/matrix-4-trailer-unveiled-during-warner-bros-cinemacon-reel-1234821127/"&gt;with a premier date of December 22nd, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but you can watch two (and maybe more) teasers for the highly anticipated film today, in advance of a full trailer on Thursday. The teasers appear on the recently revived &lt;a href="https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/"&gt;“What is The Matrix” website&lt;/a&gt;, gated by the film franchise’s all too familiar choice — red pill or blue pill?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaAcwt"&gt;The red pill teaser, after pushing through recognizable threads of vertical green scrolling code, makes immediate callbacks to the revolutionary conflict at the heart of the series, with clips of what looks like returning star Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity, Keanu Reeves as Neo, and new cast member Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. A voiceover directed at you, the viewer, notes the real-life time of day, and how “it could be this is the first day of the rest of your life, but if you want it, you gotta fight for it.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/If4JgbcxDTvzSAucltT2Z2NNPn0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22831811/Screen_Shot_2021_09_07_at_9.48.02_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Warner Bros. Pictures&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I could not tell you what’s happening here other than it looks sick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UwPXVD"&gt;The blue pill teaser, featuring the vocal stylings of another new cast member, Jonathan Groff, admonishes you for “losing the capacity to discern reality from fiction” along with clips of copious amounts of blue pills. “It becomes a problem when fantasies endanger us. We don’t want anyone to get hurt, do we?” Groff’s voicer concludes. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cplTwrHVLpvD9XcdeSeXpq6fqv0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22831812/Screen_Shot_2021_09_07_at_9.49.44_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Warner Bros. Pcitures&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prescription blue Matrix pills?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EWfHWR"&gt;The teasers don’t offer a whole lot to go on, but they are admittedly very exciting. Not just because Warner Bros. has apparently jerry-rigged a way for the teaser to somewhat robotically call out the time of day wherever you are, but also because the teasers themselves seem somewhat fluid, slotting in new clips — Keanu’s hand here, Groff smiling smugly at a city skyline there — depending on the time of day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5kK16"&gt;You can see all the variations of the teasers yourself by heading to &lt;a href="https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/"&gt;The Matrix website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
