    <title>Microsoft’s high-end Surface Pro 8 is $300 off</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9goddc"&gt;After a string of big shopping holidays, we landed on the first big tech event of 2022. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22870203/ces-2022-best-of-gadgets-concepts-tech"&gt;I’m talking about CES 2022&lt;/a&gt;, for which &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; produced dozens of articles. All sorts of new, exciting products were announced, and hopefully, some of them may show up in this deals newsletter once they launch later in the year. As for this weekend’s deals, we’re focusing on some hot products that we think will make your life a little better. Stay warm out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="osVjbv"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zyMlHe"&gt;A specced-out Surface Pro 8 costs $1,599.99 at Best Buy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xBrEB9"&gt;Look, it’s never affordable to get the most high-end version of a sought-after tablet. That’s why most people choose to get the most affordable one and call it a day. However, if you are after a Windows tablet that can offer big performance, a 120Hz refresh rate display, and other fine qualities highlighted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22709876/microsoft-surface-pro-8-review"&gt;in our Surface Pro 8 review by Monica Chin&lt;/a&gt;, check out Best Buy’s current deal. Normally $1,899.99, Microsoft’s Surface Pro 8 with 16GB of RAM, 512GB of storage, and Intel’s Core i7-1185G7 processor &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgnoBPoYOfv" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is just $1,599.99&lt;/a&gt;. Note: you’ll need to supply &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgnoCODEP6M" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Type Cover&lt;/a&gt; if you want an accessory that can provide a keyboard and a screen cover, which usually costs about $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vRbMcG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10771697"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="qF40gQ"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Z4oC78"&gt;For something cheaper, Lenovo’s Chrome OS 10e tablet is just $100&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uldiB3"&gt;There are people who are ready to pay $1,599.99 on a tablet, and those who aren’t. Whether you need a tablet for entertainment, or just one to pass off to your kid, Lenovo’s 10e might be a better fit. First off, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Flaptops%2Flenovo%2Flenovo-edu-chromebooks%2Flenovo-10e-chromebook-tablet%2F22ed10e10e1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F8%2F22872077%2Fmicrosoft-surface-pro-8-windows-oneplus-9-nintendo-switch-chrome-tablet-airpods-apple-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s on sale at Lenovo for $99&lt;/a&gt; instead of $334 (discount applies at checkout), which is about 6 percent of the Surface Pro 8’s total cost. The 10e isn’t trying to compete with the best of them, though, it’s a better deal than most 10-inch tablets offer these days (especially if you’re trying to avoid Amazon’s Fire tablets). It has a glossy, 1920 x 1200 IPS touchscreen that can get plenty bright with 400-nit peak brightness, as well as 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. It can also handle video calls and photos with its front- and rear-facing cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aoSNcp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10966390"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="xOXyz8"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Fire Emblem: Three Houses" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I8mLpFQ-n3BvHEUu0gHAxjQ8V-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16343458/SW_FireEmblemThreeHouses_ND0213_SCRN_10.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UJVr9O"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/em&gt; (a real gem of a Switch game) is $40 at Walmart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OZ9FZl"&gt;If you’re striking out on ideas for your next game, I’ll go to bat for &lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/em&gt; to anyone who will listen. It’s a turn-based strategy game that never gets so deep that its mechanics become entangled, and outside of battles, its gripping stories takes place at a university where, as their teacher, you’ll befriend many of your fellow soldiers as you strengthen them for battle. The writing is stellar, as is the music. Normally $59.99, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FFire-Emblem-Three-House-Switch-Nintendo-Digital-Download%2F301066340&amp;amp;sharedid=vergedeals01082022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart has digital copies of this game for $39.99&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726336/fire-emblem-three-houses-review-nintendo-switch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oGWzkL"&gt;The OnePlus 9 is $599.99 through January 22nd&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="raIA5f"&gt;The OnePlus 9 is a fine phone if you value having some of the most capable specs — including a Snapdragon 888, a 120Hz refresh rate screen, and a great ultrawide camera —without spending flagship-level prices. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Our reviewer Allison Johnson thinks&lt;/a&gt; most people should be happy with the OnePlus 9 over the 9 Pro, though it won’t please photographers who crave main camera stabilization and a telephoto lens. Otherwise, this phone can give the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google’s Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;, which normally starts at $599, a run for its money. Right now, you can pick up an unlocked, 128GB model with 8GB of RAM at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf17Og6sSZa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Smartphone-Hasselblad-Wireless/dp/B08Y73NTXY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $599.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DZ6TLp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10454529"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ffVPXA"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MyMl4W"&gt;Apple’s latest AirPods Pro are 26 percent off at Woot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3tvn7"&gt;It’s possible that you may have missed out on the many great deals happening on Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds that support active noise cancellation and MagSafe charging. If that’s the case, check out Woot’s deal that knocks the price &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13142092?sid=vergedeals01082022&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fnew-apple-airpods-pro" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;all the way down to $184.99&lt;/a&gt;, a 26 percent discount off their original $250 price. You may recall better prices than this on the AirPods Pro, but that was likely the previous-gen model that omitted the MagSafe feature. All AirPods Pro models support spatial audio, and they can easily pair with Apple devices with their H1 wireless chip.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Computer monitors were inventive and interesting at CES 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-0ZNZVbyi87YE0nsyM2mPNv257Q=/93x0:1085x661/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70363336/LG_DualUp_Lifestyle_00.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cR05b2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22871243/ces-2022-recap-biggest-news"&gt;CES had a pretty good year&lt;/a&gt;, and that extends to computer monitors, which thankfully were about more than mere ports. What’s better is that this year’s interesting, feature-packed monitors are for more than just gamers. Monitors play an even more important role during the pandemic as the centerpiece of the home office, and manufacturers have responded to that demand with designs that suit a larger audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eIdlKi"&gt;We got a quirky-looking, nearly-square creative- and productivity-focused monitor from LG that some people will find useful. Samsung debuted its Odyssey Ark, a 55-inch curved 4K gaming monitor that I’d feel safe floating on when the waters come. Speaking of Samsung, the company’s display division found a suitable monitor to debut its new QD-OLED screen tech in: Alienware’s 34-inch curved gaming monitor. This is just the tip of the iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzJuzc"&gt;Last year’s CES show was mostly about HDMI 2.1, since the new wave of consoles, the PS5 and Xbox Series X, had recently arrived with the promise of displaying games in 4K at up to 120 frames per second (ironically, few games can achieve this a year later). We still love seeing that port popping up in new monitors and TVs since higher-bandwidth HDMI ports will futureproof your big investment and make your content look the best that it possibly can. But, at the end of the day, it’s just a port. And thankfully, many of CES 2022’s best monitors come with it in tow, in addition to some more unique talking points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oRRM0V"&gt;Here are the most interesting monitors to come out of CES this year.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AlwL_oQcjdP17xFJe9jfsu7I1UE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23128704/cwelch_211209_4929_0027.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s new 42-inch OLED TV.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="miZrD1"&gt;One model that’s sure to be popular isn’t technically a gaming monitor but a TV. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22856102/lg-97-42-inch-oled-4k-8k-qned-tvs-announced-features"&gt;LG’s 42-inch C2 OLED&lt;/a&gt;, and that size is the smallest TV panel that LG has produced yet — a far more reasonably-sized desk mate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22815110/lg-c1-48-oled-samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-review-monitor-tv"&gt;than its 48-inch C1 model&lt;/a&gt; from 2021. Even though it’s a TV, it has all of the most important gaming monitor specs, like HDMI 2.1 ports, variable refresh rate, auto low latency mode, a 120Hz refresh rate, and a near-instant response time. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus PG42UQ gaming monitor" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Alv_hpbpCwVN6K70RpEKMHJGig=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145180/pg42uqdisplay.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s Asus’ take on the 42-inch OLED in its upcoming monitor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yW4EFp"&gt;Given its gaming credentials, several brands will likely utilize LG’s 42-inch OLED panel in their monitors. &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6yZXFDWTD19IBSZOaUAG2Ouu-Us=/0x0:2040x1360/920x613/filters:focal(857x517:1183x843):format(webp)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70347297/pg42uqdisplay.0.jpg"&gt;Asus is the first&lt;/a&gt;, announcing a 42-inch OLED gaming display at CES 2022, with a design and stand that looks different from LG’s TV design. It seems similar in most ways, though it has the all-important DisplayPort for more connectivity options, in addition to its HDMI 2.1 and HDMI 2.0 ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GrBn6s"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Alienware CES 2022|105442" data-volume-uuid="a7605bbcb" data-volume-id="105442" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-237" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h6uWR3"&gt;There are still burn-in concerns among those who want to use an OLED for productivity or gaming. The verdict’s not yet out on some of these newer models until either they release and people have a chance to test them or until manufacturers make assurances. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855531/alienware-curved-34-inch-qd-oled-samsung-gaming-monitor-specs"&gt;Alienware’s 34-inch QD-OLED gaming monitor&lt;/a&gt;, coming out in March 2022, is setting a high bar for those assurances, coming with “improved OLED reliability” and a three-year premium warranty that covers OLED burn-in. Importantly, we don’t know the price of this model, but perhaps its warranty will balloon the price a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lXQdqs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here is a first look at the INSANE Odyssey Ark from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Samsung?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Samsung&lt;/a&gt;! This is a curved 55" 4K Monitor with a 16:9 aspect ratio... Can do some serious gaming/multitasking on this! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ces?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ces&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/samsung?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#samsung&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Y82hbeY9gg"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Y82hbeY9gg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Schofield (@qbking77) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/qbking77/status/1478555909068505088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 5, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QmWdkK"&gt;I touched on it earlier, but I can’t talk about gaming without again &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22867790/samsung-odyssey-arc-curved-gaming-monitor"&gt;mentioning Samsung’s gargantuan Odyssey Ark monitor&lt;/a&gt;. It has Samsung’s signature 1000R curve, which is as curvy as mainstream monitors come these days, but it brings that curvature in a 55-inch screen — the biggest it has produced yet — with a 16:9 aspect ratio that makes it look like a big, curved TV right in front of your face. It won’t be a surprise if the Ark can provide an unmatched gaming experience, but its form factor seems like a boon for multitasking productivity, too. The Ark’s stand allows the screen to rotate vertically, allowing you to stack applications as you see fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ug78HV"&gt;There’s a lot that Samsung hasn’t shared about the Ark yet, but it apparently features quantum dot color and Mini LED backlighting. The Ark seemed like a good monitor for Samsung to debut its QD-OLED tech in, but alas. That honor goes to the aforementioned Alienware’s 34-inch curved (1800R) QD-OLED gaming monitor coming out in March. The Ark, on the other hand, is coming out in the second half of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="moMngn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung announced a smaller 4K version of its curviest, best-looking gaming monitor","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22860012/samsung-odyssey-neo-g8-4k-240hz-refresh-rate-monitor-mini-led-specs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="E7c9po"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10960910"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dWijZn"&gt;CES 2022 also saw the debut of Asus’ ROG Swift PG27AQN, the world’s first 27-inch QHD display that has a 360Hz refresh rate (that speed was previously limited to 1080p). So, now gamers don’t need to sacrifice visual quality to see titles running at the fast speeds necessary to remain on the top of their game. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866475/nvidia-g-sync-esports-monitors-1080p-1440p-support"&gt;Nvidia also had some cool display announcements that were geared toward competitive gamers&lt;/a&gt;. Some of these QHD 360Hz gaming monitors from AOC, MSI, and ViewSonic have Mini LED panels for more vibrance and more accurate colors and lighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yV32kV"&gt;And with Nvidia software, they support what the company’s calling dual-format resolution (illustrated above), letting gamers take full advantage of these 27-inch displays in QHD if they want, with the option to shrink the screen real estate to see games running in 1080p, which is still a popular resolution for pro gamers. The latter option emulates the experience of playing on a 25-inch 1080p monitor without worrying about having the image stretched on a QHD screen, which can reduce the image quality. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Samsung Smart Monitor M8" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g6MKWL4bOX__PWSkVGsWhP-jsz0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23139309/m82.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SlimFit camera can be magnetically attached for video calls, then detached afterward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ilLp80"&gt;CES 2022’s monitors weren’t all about gaming, though. Samsung’s smart monitor lineup got a new model, the 32-inch 4K M8, which touts new features that look useful. Despite being a monitor, it requires no extra hardware to stream TV shows and movies, as most TVs are equipped to do these days. What’s new for this model is the included SlimFit camera that can attach to it magnetically for video calls. The M8 can serve as a SmartThings hub for your connected IoT devices at home. Samsung is also debuting Game Home, a feature that essentially turns the M8 into a could game streaming monitor, capable of connecting to various services and to various controllers. Samsung hasn’t nailed down those final details yet, but it could be exciting.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3hm-icD2LZYwj9YPX5IGVnLxIKg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23118778/dualup.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG’s DualUp monitor rocks a 16:18 aspect ratio, which is a rarity in the industry.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7xZjZx"&gt;Swinging back to the monitor that I mentioned first in this post, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848957/lg-dualup-32-inch-4k-ultra-fine-monitors-announced-specs"&gt;LG’s squarish 16:18 aspect ratio monitor called the DualUp&lt;/a&gt; has a lot of our readers excited. LG says that it offers “the same screen real estate as two 21.5-inch displays and has a vertical split view function that lets users see more in one glance.” This one isn’t for me, but it’s still easy to see how it could benefit people who need a tall display that’s also high-res with a 2560 x 2880 resolution. LG says that its form factor has ergonomic benefits since you don’t need to move your neck from side to side. It looks similar to the monitor featured in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22750729/teenage-engineering-computer-1-mini-itx-case-features-price"&gt;Teenage Engineering’s marketing for its Computer-1 DIY PC case&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MoS5z6"&gt;The best thing about monitors that debuted at CES 2022 is that there was something for everyone, creatives, gamers, or those who just appreciate big, beautiful, and capable displays that they want to hook up to a PC, macOS computer, or a console. Thinking about all of these announcements has put me in a good mood, and I’ll probably exist in this delightful honeymoon bubble until manufacturers share prices (&lt;em&gt;none &lt;/em&gt;of them will be cheap). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why clean energy advocates are divided over California’s plan to slash solar incentives</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Solar panels are installed on the roofs of zero energy model homes, as seen on Thurs. May 17, 2018 in Clovis, Ca.

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e7a9vz"&gt;California could soon end the perks it has been giving to residents with rooftop solar on their homes, even as it pledges to move entirely to &lt;a href="https://www.energy.ca.gov/news/2021-03/california-releases-report-charting-path-100-percent-clean-electricity"&gt;clean electricity&lt;/a&gt;. While the move might seem counterintuitive, environmental advocates are divided on whether the changes will help the state meet its climate goals and benefit lower-income residents or harm both efforts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BaMBgs"&gt;They’re split on a &lt;a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/news-and-updates/all-news/cpuc-proposal-aims-to-modernize-state-decarbonization-incentive-efforts"&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; made last month by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) that would slash solar incentives for customers of investor-owned utilities, implement a new monthly fee to connect solar customers to the grid, and create a $600 million fund to help underrepresented communities gain access to solar panels and batteries. Industry and some conservation groups say the changes would end California’s solar boom. Tesla recently went so far as to send its employees &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2022/01/03/tesla-asks-employees-fight-back-against-new-proposal-destroy-solar-market/"&gt;talking points&lt;/a&gt; on how to fight back against the proposal. But other environmental and consumer advocates support the proposal and say California needs to do things differently to help lower-income residents who haven’t received as many benefits from rooftop solar to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QpT4Dt"&gt;California has more homes with rooftop PV panels than any other state. That’s thanks in part to a history of generous incentives for people with home solar systems. If someone doesn’t use up all the solar energy their panels collect, they can sell it back to the grid. Under the state’s “net metering” program, they can sell it at the same retail rate at which they would buy electricity. The program is supposed to help people recoup the costs of installing their solar system. But if the CPUC ultimately votes to approve its new proposal, the selling price would drop dramatically to better reflect the commission’s estimates of what that energy is actually worth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Lwg42x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People are almost in tears”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KSYPXV"&gt;That has solar industry folks freaking out. “People are almost in tears, you know, like grown men that built their whole life around their business and their company,” says Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar &amp;amp; Storage Association. Her group is one out of about &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eB85J3qRSeFn6dz5mPG_un34s7Q5IJ4c/edit"&gt;600 organizations&lt;/a&gt; that have put together a coalition to stop the CPUC’s proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsESLM"&gt;Opponents of the proposal worry that if people don’t earn as much by selling energy back to the grid, they won’t be able to recoup the tens of thousands of dollars they might have spent installing the system. While the CPUC thinks solar customers could recoup those costs within ten years, critics say the new proposal would greatly stretch out the amount of time it would take to do so. On top of that, the CPUC wants to impose a new monthly “grid participation charge” of $8 per kW that could come out to several hundred dollars a year, to go toward maintaining the grid. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;People take part in an event to hand-deliver 100,000 public comments from Californians throughout the state calling on Governor Newsom to reject proposals that slash solar incentives for consumers outside the California State Capitol Museum in Sacramento, California, United States on December 8th, 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qrpEZA"&gt;Cost is already a big barrier for middle and lower-income people who might otherwise be interested in solar panels. And critics of the CPUC’s proposal say their plan makes things much worse — putting solar even more out of reach for middle and lower-income households. “It would devastate any efforts to increase equity and inclusion that would make solar for everybody,” says Del Chiaro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IZtUp"&gt;The CPUC, on the other hand, says that the net metering program “disproportionately harms low-income ratepayers” and “negatively impacts” customers without rooftop solar. It, and proponents of its new proposal, say the policy shift will keep electricity rates lower for people without home solar systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4brAK1"&gt;Today, utilities are charging more for electricity across the board to pay for net metering. That’s because the rates that early solar adopters earned from selling energy back to the grid are up to six times higher than its actual value, according to the CPUC and environmental group Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC). They &lt;a href="https://www.nrdc.org/experts/mohit-chhabra/rooftop-solar-california-ready-take-next-step"&gt;estimate&lt;/a&gt; that the actual value to the grid is about 5 cents per kW. But someone with a home solar system might earn 30 cents per kW because they’re selling it at the retail rate, which is higher because &lt;a href="https://energyathaas.wordpress.com/2021/06/01/rooftop-solar-inequity/"&gt;it includes costs&lt;/a&gt; like maintaining the grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uhLIN6"&gt;To make that money back, utilities drive up electricity rates, including for people who don’t own solar panels. Non-solar customers pay between $60 to $200 more on their bills each year as a result, according to one &lt;a href="https://www.next10.org/sites/default/files/2021-02/Next10-electricity-rates-v2.pdf"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="aPO0ak"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Greening the grid should not be cutting off vulnerable communities because the bills are too damn high.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3LLfAn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=37072"&gt;One in three&lt;/a&gt; Americans already struggles to pay their electricity bills. And consumer advocates who support the CPUC proposal don’t want the net metering program to exacerbate the problem. “Greening the grid should not be cutting off vulnerable communities because the bills are too damn high,” says Mark Toney, executive director of the consumer advocacy group The Utility Reform Network (TURN). “Our thing is we want the most green for the least green.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkzLGx"&gt;The NRDC supports the CPUC’s decision to slash net metering payouts because it says keeping electricity as cheap as possible is crucial to transitioning the economy over to renewable energy. Experts see electrification as key to weaning cars and homes off oil and gas. But that’ll only happen if electricity is affordable in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRsK7Q"&gt;“The first priority really is clean, affordable power for everyone,” says Mohit Chhabra, a senior scientist at NRDC. Home solar systems aren’t the only way to achieve that, he points out. It might come from more utility-scale solar and wind farms. “Everybody needs to be able to pay their bills, meet their energy needs — it needs to be clean and pollution free [energy] — and then figure out where rooftop solar belongs in that mix,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Y9MQc"&gt;Del Chiaro’s coalition of opponents &lt;a href="https://calssa.org/blog/2021/6/5/debunking-the-cost-shift-debate"&gt;disputes&lt;/a&gt; the CPUC’s estimates of how much utilities are overpaying solar customers through net metering. These groups say that utilities are already charging customers too much for things like wildfire liability and building out more power lines, and that the CPUC’s proposal reflects another money grab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="526VrF"&gt;All the stakeholders — even though they disagree on what should happen to net metering — say they want to see more equitable access to home solar systems, especially for neighborhoods that have been disproportionately saddled with the pollution from fossil fuels. Net metering as it’s currently structured “has not enabled rooftop solar to adequately penetrate” those communities, the California Environmental Justice Alliance, a key group that represents those communities, said in a &lt;a href="https://caleja.org/2021/09/california-ej-organizations-issue-statement-on-rooftop-solar-and-distributed-generation-in-california/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E1Svjw"&gt;A small percentage of low income households that qualify for assistance on their bill have rooftop solar and participate in net metering. But Toney says that they got an unfair deal under the old program. Since they qualify for up to a 35 percent discount on their electricity bills, and net metering pays people based on how much they pay for electricity, they also earned 35 percent less than other households in the program. That’s no longer a problem under the CPUC’s new proposal. Del Chiaro agrees that it was a problem that needed to be fixed, but says that it can be addressed without making the other drastic changes CPUC has proposed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrfsuI"&gt;The California Environmental Justice Alliance has yet to weigh in on the CPUC’s new proposal, but some of its recommendations for improving equity seemingly make it into the CPUC’s proposal. For one, the monthly grid participation charge won’t apply to low-income and tribal households. Low-income households and buildings under &lt;a href="https://www.pge.com/en_US/small-medium-business/energy-alternatives/private-solar/understand-the-solar-process/multifamily-affordable-solar-housing-program.page"&gt;certain affordable housing programs&lt;/a&gt; would also be able to stay on their current net metering program for now, while the program would be phased out for other existing customers in 15 years. To make the shift easier for new solar customers, the proposal includes a Market Transition Credit of up to $5.25 per kW for people who sign up within four years, which would then be applied for the next ten years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bq9sY3"&gt;Del Chiaro says the exemptions still don’t cover everyone who might struggle more to pay for rooftop solar under the CPUC’s new plan. That includes low and moderate income households and apartment buildings that don’t qualify for financial assistance.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The CPUC says that if its proposal is implemented, it will evaluate the program’s impact on equity over five years and determine if it needs to broaden eligibility requirements for financial assistance or make other changes.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bt47Zg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The up-front installation cost of solar panels also presents a major barrier&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P6AFzz"&gt;For low-income residents, the up-front installation cost of solar panels also presents a major barrier. The CPUC’s proposal creates a $600 million fund to improve access to solar panels and batteries in low-income communities, which could help them get over that hurdle. Details of how the fund will be set up are still in the works, but that money could potentially come from adding an extra charge to solar customers who are not enrolled in financial assistance programs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cB0ozM"&gt;The CPUC proposal also includes rebates for existing solar customers who pair their panels with batteries and transition off the old net metering program over the next four years.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Encouraging solar customers to buy batteries is supposed to help reduce pressure on the grid whenever it’s at peak demand — which is usually in the evenings when people come home from work and when the sun is no longer shining. Batteries can also help keep the lights on at home if people lose power due to bad weather, which has been happening more often in California because of the risk of power lines sparking wildfires when conditions are hot, dry, and windy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HDx5TT"&gt;But the California Solar and Storage Association, which represents businesses that sell solar panels and batteries, thinks the CPUC’s plan will backfire. Making it more expensive to have a solar system at home will only be a disincentive for people wanting to install panels or batteries, Del Chiaro says. Still, not all future homeowners will have a choice: in 2020, a state &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/9/17335832/california-solar-panel-housing-politics-renewable-energy"&gt;mandate&lt;/a&gt; kicked in that requires newly constructed homes to include solar panels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjnfZ6"&gt;While there’s still a long way to go to close disparities in solar access, Del Chiaro points to &lt;a href="https://emp.lbl.gov/solar-demographics-tool"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; showing that in recent years, solar adoption has grown more quickly in lower income brackets than in higher income brackets. That’s the trend she wants to keep going, which might lead to a legal battle if the CPUC ultimately votes to approve its proposal. That vote could happen as soon as January 27th, after a period for the public to give their comments — which are flowing into the &lt;a href="https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/news-and-updates/all-news/cpuc-proposal-aims-to-modernize-state-decarbonization-incentive-efforts"&gt;CPUC website&lt;/a&gt; with fervor from nervous solar customers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Matter was a major star at CES 2022, but can it maintain its shine?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EBXir3kjq9I1d6ytDmFpibP4X-g=/70x14:1825x1184/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70363131/Matter_Samsung.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung touted its plans for Matter compatibility in its pre-show keynote at CES 2022.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6lClSD"&gt;Two years ago, on the floor of CES 2020, there was a lot of buzz about a chip — not the latest AMD or Intel announcement, but a new alliance of major tech companies that called itself Project Connected Home over IP, or CHIP for short. Its promise was to develop an open-source smart home standard that would make every connected home device work together, simply and securely, regardless of who made them. The buzz was: “That’s never gonna happen.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wa3xPc"&gt;Fast forward to CES 2022 (yeah, we all skipped 2021) and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt; — as CHIP is now called — was the darling of the show, with a full dance card and a line of admirers that stretched to the virtual Starbucks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OHlrak"&gt;Practically every smart home device announcement this week had the tagline “and we announce our support for Matter.” Plus, the infrastructure gained significant support. There were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865815/nxp-tri-radio-chip-wi-fi-6-bluetooth-5-2-thread-smart-home-gadgets-ces-2022"&gt;new chips designed for Matter&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon announced device makers can now add &lt;a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2022/01/ces-amazon-announces-new-matter-support-device-makers.html"&gt;Frustration-Free Setup on their Matter-certified devices&lt;/a&gt; with just the Matter SDK— no Amazon-specific SDK required. And Google showed off its own version of a simplified setup, &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/android/CES2022-bettertogether/"&gt;Fast Pair&lt;/a&gt; with built-in support for Matter. Both these announcements mean that as developers build new smart home products, all you’ll have to do once you get them home is plug them in and they’ll be ready to go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2nN2Fd"&gt;“The wave of Matter news at CES from our CSA members is a testament to the hard work that has gone into the development and testing of Matter in 2021,” Tobin Richardson, president of the Connectivity Standards Alliance that oversees Matter, told me during the show. “Hundreds of companies and thousands of engineers are at the heart of this global solution, creating a more open and innovative IoT, and I’m really excited by what is to come in 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="k6m8A0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Matter’s plan to save the smart home ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="tXGQyS"&gt;The other interesting announcement was confirmation from Amazon that Alexa will share your smart home with other voice assistants. The main promise of Matter has been cross-platform compatibility, that you will be able to control your smart devices with the app or voice assistant of your choice. Now we’re seeing exactly how that will be done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9BgVq"&gt;Amazon introduced &lt;a href="https://developer.amazon.com/en-US/blogs/alexa/device-makers/2022/01/ces-amazon-announces-new-matter-support-device-makers.html"&gt;new tools for developers&lt;/a&gt; that let them add Alexa as an additional way to control a device already set up in another system. While today you can control, say, a Philips Hue lightbulb with multiple apps and voice assistants, you currently have to set it up with each one individually. With Matter, it’ll be one and done. As a nice bonus, this new capability also adds local connectivity to the device, allowing for quicker response times and the chance to use your devices even if the internet is down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="FPnLz9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;We want smart home products to work together. Now make it happen.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6wok4m"&gt;In all, close to 30 companies showcased their involvement and / or pledged their support for the new smart home standard backed by Apple, Google, Amazon, Samsung, and others. Many of whom represent a broader slice of the industry — &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/tuya-officially-announces-support-for-matter-smart-home-standard-301456017.html"&gt;Tuya Smart&lt;/a&gt;, an IoT development platform service provider based in China that supports over 446,000 developers with over 1,100 smart home products, said it will support Matter. We also saw a number of new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22870187/smart-home-gadget-ces-2022-roundup-samsung-wemo-eve"&gt;products debut with Thread&lt;/a&gt;, one of the main protocols of Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KOGnkK_kkDT3_uSTqNPGdKOLscM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23153148/nxp_advances_iot_connectivity_with_industrys_first_secure_tr.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NXP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;NXP’s new tri-radio chip (Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.2, and Thread) is designed for Matter hub devices —Matter Controllers (such as smart speakers) and Thread Border Routers (such as smart displays).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LGPzDp"&gt;All of this gives us a much better feel for what Matter will bring with it when it finally arrives, it’s currently scheduled for June 2022. But let’s take a step back and assess now that CES is over and we’re faced with a bleak mid-winter before Matter gets here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XIL21L"&gt;It seems like there is significant momentum, minimal in-fighting (that we’ve seen), and a clear directive from the consumer and direction for the manufacturers and platforms: We want smart home products to work together. Now make it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="Bxhpcb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s imperative that Matter doesn’t leave existing smart homes in the dark. &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Fr5p9"&gt;The momentum is big enough that it appears to have convinced the major appliance companies of the world to do the same thing. They went off and created their own alliance aimed at making sure your Samsung dishwasher can talk to your GE Appliances fridge. &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-joins-home-connectivity-alliance-to-drive-the-future-of-connected-home-experiences"&gt;The Home Connectivity Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, announced at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865808/samsung-smartthings-smart-home-hub-dashboard-ces2022"&gt;Samsung’s CES keynote&lt;/a&gt;, was specifically formed to make sure legacy home appliances can move into the IoT future, Yoon Ho Choi of Samsung and president of the HCA told me at CES. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umR8eR"&gt;This issue of upgradability of existing devices is still an area Matter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22832127/matter-smart-home-products-thread-wifi-explainer#mEr5qU"&gt;has largely skirted&lt;/a&gt; and one that it really needs to address. There’s been talk about firmware updates for existing hubs and bridges, and we know that the newer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761340/amazon-matter-smart-home-standard"&gt;Amazon Echo smart speakers&lt;/a&gt; and Google Nest Hub devices have an upgrade path. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sy5VEKRo5Q3ojyVWy45l45YLya8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23154560/matter_echo.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon has committed to bringing its existing smart speakers and displays into Matter when it arrives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GPxWcn"&gt;But, based on many of the announcements coming out of CES this week, it is looking increasingly like creating a Matter smart home is going to require users buying a fair number of new gadgets. As Mitch Klein of the Z-Wave Alliance told me late last year, “We can’t leave devices behind, or this whole program won’t work. The idea that everyone has to throw everything out and start again is just not going to work.” It remains imperative that Matter doesn’t leave existing smart homes in the dark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="2zRbNm"&gt;More Matter announcements from CES &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id="imNXll"&gt;Which will be the lucky lock?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2SkAG8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21255026/august-wifi-smart-lock-review-test-price-specs-features"&gt;August&lt;/a&gt; and Yale committed to making their smart locks work with Matter. Jason Williams, president of August and Yale Real Living, told me they plan to bring the first Matter lock to market when the standard launches in 2022. The company already has one Thread-enabled lock, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/3/17312166/nest-hello-yale-lock-smart-home-review"&gt;aging Nest x Yale smart lock&lt;/a&gt;, and is looking at other ways to introduce the technology, says Williams. While he said its Wi-Fi powered August locks won’t be among the first to be updated (Matter over Wi-Fi is only for hard line-powered devices currently, not battery-powered devices), they are actively looking at ways to bring their existing products into the new smart home standard. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Schlage Encode Plus smart lock is the company’s first Thread-enabled lock.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RSZDNK"&gt;Schlage may beat Yale to the punch with its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22860197/apple-home-key-schlage-encode-plus-smart-door-lock-thread-ces2022"&gt;Schlage Encode Plus lock&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s first Thread-enabled product. While the Thread radio supports HomeKit over Thread specifically, Donald Beene of Schlage told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the hardware is there for Matter. “This will be the first [lock] product with the hardware on board to support something like that, but we still don’t know where those tech specs will land,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FEaWyW"&gt;All the lights&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jHzhV5"&gt;If you make smart lights, switches, and plugs, Matter was on your mind this week. Belkin Wemo announced its working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2022/1/4/22865546/wemo-homekit-video-doorbell-price-specs"&gt;Thread versions of the Wemo Smart Plug,&lt;/a&gt; Wemo Smart Light Switch, and Wemo Smart Dimmer that will support Matter over Thread. Cync, the GE Lighting company, told me that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22860472/cync-gelighting-smart-bulbs-thermostat-camera-ces2022"&gt;its color A19 bulb and light strip will be Matter-compatible&lt;/a&gt; over Wi-Fi, and smart lighting company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22864783/sengled-smart-health-monitoring-smart-bulb-ces2022"&gt;Sengled said&lt;/a&gt; that it will have its first Wi-Fi A19 bulb ready to go when the standard launches. Nanoleaf, which has been all-in on Thread for over a year now, confirmed at CES that its mains-powered lighting panels, the Nanoleaf Shapes, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22466594/nanoleaf-elements-light-panel-smart-home-price-release"&gt;Elements&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22758017/nanoleaf-lines-review-smart-light-bars"&gt;Lines&lt;/a&gt;, will become Thread border routers, initially for Thread over HomeKit but with an eye to Matter-compatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WEqu5i"&gt;Smart home hubs are still here&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DTyUeX"&gt;While Matter should mitigate the whole multiple hub / gateway / bridge issue down to one teeny little box that’s hopefully also your router, that is going to take a while. In the meantime, we’ve still got hubs galore, and going forward, we will need Matter Controllers to act as remote controls for your home (think Google Nest Hub smart displays, but hopefully better). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pk7pn6"&gt;There were a few new hubs announced this week, including the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865808/samsung-smartthings-smart-home-hub-dashboard-ces2022"&gt;Samsung Home Hub&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung has committed to adopt Matter across Samsung devices, so when this smart home controller makes it to the US (it’s launching in Korean in March), it’s likely to be part of that. Aqara, makers of inexpensive Zigbee sensors and decent HomeKit cameras that double as hubs, said it will update its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523877/aqara-smart-home-review-m2-hub-homekit-alexa-google-assistant"&gt;M2 and the M1S hubs&lt;/a&gt;, making all compatible connected sensors move over to Matter. It also announced it’s developing Thread versions of its popular motion and contact sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWOEtD"&gt;Smart home security camera company Arlo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22865040/arlo-smart-home-security-system-price-availability-ces2022"&gt;announced its home security system&lt;/a&gt;, which is based around its “modular hub.” The word modular has us intrigued, as does the company’s decision to finally join Matter. While we’d love to think this is a sign of cameras coming into Matter sooner (they’re currently not part of the Matter spec), the first product of Arlo’s to get Matter support is more likely to be those spiffy new all-in-one sensors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SqAjG2"&gt;Speaking of modular, edge-computing company &lt;a href="https://www.veea.com/stax-and-bolt"&gt;Veea&lt;/a&gt; showed off an intriguing smart home hub that it announced will be Matter compatible. The Veea STAX Smart Hub is a Wi-Fi 6 Mesh router and smart home hub in one, with the option of adding LTE or 5G cellular connection through stackable modules. A smart speaker module with directional mics is in the works, and STAX modules also feature Lutron and Philips Hue bridge tech (among others), along with HomeKit and Alexa compatibility. While the initial launch is targeted at communications companies as a white label SHaaS (Smart Home as a service) solution, the company says it will soon be available directly to consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXXAva"&gt;		&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google launches Ripple, an open standard that could bring tiny radars to Ford cars and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GwUwCUysecpEsGyh-4au6L2JzJU=/100x0:1153x702/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70362232/Screen_Shot_2016-11-10_at_11.35.55_AM.0.0.1478777840.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m0fiKN"&gt;Google has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/28/8682957/touch-sensitive-fabric-and-tiny-radar-chips-hands-on-with-ataps"&gt;publicly building tiny radar chips&lt;/a&gt; since 2015. They can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22331567/google-nest-hub-new-2021-smart-display-sleep-tracking-soli-price-specs-features"&gt;tell you how well you sleep&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/20/11720876/google-soli-smart-watch-radar-atap-io-2016"&gt;control a smartwatch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/4/18168083/google-project-soli-radar-hardware-applications-radarcat-solinteraction-university-of-st-andrews"&gt;count sheets of paper&lt;/a&gt;, and let you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/10/11904036/project-soli-tiniest-violin-design-io"&gt;play the world’s tiniest violin&lt;/a&gt;. But the company’s Soli radar hasn’t necessarily had commercial success, most prominently featuring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20908083/google-pixel-4-project-soli-radar-motion-sense-explainer"&gt;in an ill-fated Pixel phone&lt;/a&gt;. Now, Google has launched an open-source API standard &lt;a href="https://cta.tech/Ripple#hub"&gt;called Ripple&lt;/a&gt; that could theoretically bring the tech to additional devices outside Google — perhaps even a car, as Ford is one of the participants in the new standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXipNt"&gt;Technically, Ripple is under the auspices of the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), the same industry body that hosts the CES tradeshow in Las Vegas each January, but there’s little question who’s actually behind the project. “Ripple will unlock helpful innovation that benefits everyone. General purpose radar is a key emerging technology for solving critical use cases in a privacy-respecting way,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleATAP/status/1479165003076968454"&gt;reads a quote from Ivan Poupyrev&lt;/a&gt;, the man who led the team at Google’s ATAP skunkworks that came up with Soli in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GImrC6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Standard Radar API” appears to be the original name&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MFmQ29"&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href="https://github.com/CTA-Ripple"&gt;the Ripple project at Github&lt;/a&gt; is filled with references to Google, including several instances of “Copyright 2021 Google LLC,” and contributors have to sign a Google open source license agreement to participate. (One commit points out that the project was updated “to include CTA.”) Ripple appears to be a rebranding of Google’s “Standard Radar API,” &lt;a href="https://www.tdcommons.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=5099&amp;amp;context=dpubs_series"&gt;which it quietly proposed one year ago (PDF)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFQGQa"&gt;None of that makes it any less exciting that Soli might find new life, though, and there may be something to the idea that radar has privacy benefits. It’s a technology that can easily detect whether someone’s present, nearby, and/or telling their device to do something without requiring a microphone or camera. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8fv0u"&gt;Ford, for its part, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that indoor radar might become part of its driver-assistance technologies. Right now, the automaker says it’s using “advanced exterior radars” to research those features instead (which sounds expensive to me). Here’s a statement from Ford’s Jim Buczkowski, who’s currently heading up the company’s Research and Advanced Engineering team:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="wxOAob"&gt;We are researching how to use interior radar as a sensor source to enhance various customer experiences beyond our leading Ford Co-Pilot360 driver-assist technologies that use advanced exterior radars today. A standard API, with semiconductor industry participation, will allow us to develop software independent of the hardware sourcing and give the software teams latitude to innovate across multiple radar platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JzPs8H"&gt;Other gadget companies are also researching radar: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573807/amazon-echo-radar-sensor-sleep-tracking-google-soli"&gt;Amazon is similarly exploring&lt;/a&gt; whether radar might help it monitor your sleep patterns; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22857166/invoxia-pet-tracker-smart-collar-heart-rate-dogs"&gt;this smart dog collar&lt;/a&gt; uses miniature radar to monitor vitals even if your dog is super furry or hairy, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22864783/sengled-smart-health-monitoring-smart-bulb-ces2022"&gt;this light bulb&lt;/a&gt; does the same thing for humans. But most of the participants listed under Google’s initiative are chip and sensor suppliers, for now. Only Ford and Blumio — &lt;a href="https://www.blumio.com/"&gt;which has a dev kit for a radar based blood pressure sensor&lt;/a&gt; — stand out. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Scott Pilgrim anime adaptation is reportedly in development for Netflix</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7IiScW-8sDbNVI2M5gmfKTlDDRo=/121x0:1159x692/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70362011/Scott_Pilgrim_Vs._The_World___Official_Trailer_0_8_screenshot.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An anime adaptation of the cult comic book series could be a perfect fit.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wd5KEaOtm4" target="_blank"&gt;Universal Pictures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jILi0Y"&gt;Netflix is developing an anime adaptation of the &lt;em&gt;Scott Pilgrim&lt;/em&gt; graphic novel series, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/scott-pilgrim-anime-series-netflix-1235071580/"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The adaptation doesn’t have a series order yet, &lt;em&gt;THR&lt;/em&gt; says, and there aren’t any details about when it could hit the streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtXpe0"&gt;Bryan Lee O’Malley, who created the &lt;em&gt;Scott Pilgrim&lt;/em&gt; graphic novels, one of the writers and executive producers for the adaptation, reports &lt;em&gt;THR. &lt;/em&gt;Edgar Wright, who directed the 2010 film &lt;em&gt;Scott Pilgrim vs. the World&lt;/em&gt;, will also reportedly be serving as an executive producer. If the series gets the green light, animation would be done by the animation studio Science Saru, which produced two shorts for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/star-wars/22684843/star-wars-visions-anime-anthology-disney-plus-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Visions&lt;/em&gt; anime anthology&lt;/a&gt; released in September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMe3IM"&gt;This potential anime adaptation isn’t the only recent &lt;em&gt;Scott Pilgrim&lt;/em&gt; revival. In 2021, Ubisoft brought back the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228652/scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-the-game-review-switch-stadia-ps4-xbox"&gt;long-lost cult hit video game &lt;em&gt;Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, releasing it on new platforms including the Nintendo Switch, PS4, Xbox One, PC, Google Stadia, and Amazon Luna.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon workers will now get only a week of COVID PTO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YI135cppwXY049Mt9G4chpuRcFU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70361975/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eUY2UE"&gt;Amazon has changed its PTO policy for workers forced to quarantine, as reported by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/07/amazon-cuts-paid-covid-leave-for-workers-as-cdc-guidance-shifts.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-trims-covid-19-isolation-period-for-workers-but-doesnt-mirror-cdc-11641582144"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The policy has shrunk to one week (or 40 hours) off, down from its initial length of 14 days, which is still mentioned on an &lt;a href="https://hiring.amazon.com/covid-19-updates#/"&gt;Amazon hiring page&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/amazon-covid-leave-policy-reduction-213033841.html?src=rss"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) but had already been shortened to ten days. &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;’s report includes an excerpt of Amazon’s notice to employees about the change, citing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/27/22856114/cdc-covid-isolation-guidelines-shortened-omicron"&gt;the CDC’s updated recommendations&lt;/a&gt; that people who have tested positive for COVID should isolate for five days, as long as their symptoms are gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZaF8H7"&gt;Amazon isn’t alone in changing its policies along with the federal government. As &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt; points out, Walmart &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/exclusive-walmart-halves-paid-leave-covid-positive-workers-extends-hybrid-work-2022-01-05/"&gt;has also cut down the number of PTO hours&lt;/a&gt; employees who contract COVID get. There have &lt;a href="https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2022/01/05/workers-with-covid-19-lost-pay/"&gt;also been reports&lt;/a&gt; of sick workers across the country losing protections after the American Rescue Plan expired on September 30th, leaving state and local governments (and individual employers) to decide the rules for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1IAt5C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some health experts have expressed concern about employees who are still sick having to work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bwLjev"&gt;The CDC’s new guidance, released at the end of December, took the recommended isolation time down from ten days to five. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/27/22856114/cdc-covid-isolation-guidelines-shortened-omicron"&gt;Public health experts have said&lt;/a&gt; it’s supported by research, but some have expressed concern about employees who are still sick being brought back to work. According to a copy of Amazon’s revised policy seen by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, there are “additional leave options are available for individuals who remain symptomatic beyond one week.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iigQIg"&gt;For some employees, their economic situations could force a return to work if they’re not paid to stay home, regardless of company policy about coming in sick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fC4P2W"&gt;Amazon doesn’t have one singular directive for how its office employees will return to in-person work, instead opting to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721096/amazon-work-from-home-policy-teams-decide-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;let individual teams decide&lt;/a&gt; how much of their work should be remote. This, of course, isn’t the case for jobs that have to be in-person, like Amazon’s warehouse workers, delivery drivers, IT staff working on AWS servers, and more. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22850036/amazon-mask-mandate-warehouse-employees-omicron-covid-19"&gt;reinstated its mask mandate for warehouse workers&lt;/a&gt; in December after lifting it in November. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TJI9n"&gt;Amazon didn’t immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says Tesla is raising the price of its ‘full self driving’ software to $12k</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iH_GDJU4Xzqf0eW_IK7fLYdsTh8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70361881/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tesla is raising the price of its “full self driving” software | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bNIMim"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk says the company is raising the price of its “full self driving” (FSD) software to $12,000. Musk tweeted Friday that the new price, which is an increase of $2,000, will take effect January 17th for customers “only in the US.” He said the monthly subscription price of $199 for FSD &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1479596403487916032?s=20"&gt;would rise&lt;/a&gt; as the software got closer to wide release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9NHWF"&gt;Tesla began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528508/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-first-reaction-video"&gt;testing FSD in beta in October of 2020&lt;/a&gt; — when it was priced at $8,000 — with a select group of customers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541571/tesla-full-self-driving-price-increase-10000-dollars-autopilot-beta"&gt;Tesla increased the price&lt;/a&gt; of FSD to $10,000 shortly after. The software does not make Tesla vehicles fully autonomous; Musk himself said &lt;a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/24/tesla-inc-tsla-q3-2019-earnings-call-transcript.aspx"&gt;during a 2019 earnings call&lt;/a&gt; that Teslas with FSD are “able to drive from one’s house to work, most likely without interventions. So it will still be supervised, but it will be able to drive.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tB4LJf"&gt;

&lt;p id="Jtk0zc"&gt;In September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22693610/tesla-opens-full-self-driving-beta-software-more-customers"&gt;Tesla opened the FSD beta&lt;/a&gt; to more drivers via a “request” button on vehicles’ dashboard screens, but to get access to the software, drivers have to have a good “safety score.” &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/safety-score"&gt;Tesla determines the safety score&lt;/a&gt; using five criteria that estimate “the likelihood that your driving could result in a future collision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0761vh"&gt;Musk has promised a wider release of Tesla’s FSD for several years. &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2018/06/10/tesla-version-9-software-update-fully-self-driving-features-elon-musk/"&gt;He said&lt;/a&gt; in 2018 that the “long awaited” version of FSD would begin rolling out that summer, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18512580/elon-musk-tesla-driverless-cars-lidar-simulation-waymo"&gt;projected  in 2019&lt;/a&gt; that “a year from now” there would be “over a million cars with full self-driving, software, everything.” Those dates came and went, but Tesla’s FSD remains in beta, available only to early adopters who bought the FSD package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hqUkRj"&gt;The FSD software has also drawn a fair amount of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724171/nhtsa-tesla-letters-fsd-beta-autopilot-recall-emergency-vehicles"&gt;scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528508/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-first-reaction-video"&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt;; in August 2021, US. Sens. Ed Markey (D-MA) and Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630954/markey-blumenthal-ftc-lina-khan-tesla-full-self-driving-musk"&gt;asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate&lt;/a&gt; how Tesla was marketing its driver assistance software, accusing the company of “deceptive and unfair practices.” &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="USGxSy"&gt;When it comes to true wireless earbuds, there are a ton of brands and products to choose from. Whether you enjoy the unconventional design of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live or prefer Jabra’s compact Elite 75t, there’s a pair of wireless earbuds for just about everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsWVXq"&gt;Regardless of which brand you prefer, we’ve compiled some of the best deals on wireless earbuds available right now. Of course, if you want to do more research before making a buying decision, we also encourage you to read our guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which can help you determine which pair of earbuds are right for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="c27rNd"&gt;Apple AirPods deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2vr3VH"&gt;If you own an iPhone or multiple Apple products, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; are likely the best true wireless earbuds on the market for you. Unlike the base AirPods, the latest Pros offer better sound quality and feature active noise cancellation, not to mention seamless integration with iOS and a MagSafe-compatible charging case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftMREv"&gt;While the AirPods Pro carry a lofty, $249.99 price tag, they also go on sale rather frequently. During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, for instance, we saw them drop as low as $160. They’re no longer available at that low of a price, but you can still get a pair with the MagSafe charging case for about $197 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MLWK3AM-A-New-AirPods/dp/B09JQMJHXY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/612734/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro-with-MagSafe-Charging-Case%2F975690481&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kPY6Vk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9766m"&gt;Alternatively, you can buy a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;second-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt; — now the entry-level model — with either a wired or wireless charging case. The base AirPods normally retail for $129, but you can currently get the version with the wired charging case for &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-2nd-generation%2F-%2FA-84852693%3Fpreselect%3D54191098%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeearbudsdeals"&gt;$115 at Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-2nd-Generation%2F604342441%3Fathbdg%3DL1600&amp;amp;subid1=vergeearbudsdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$119 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DcXNMK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eJgls2"&gt;If you prefer a little more convenience, you can also get a new pair of second-gen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods with a Qi-compatible wireless charging case&lt;/a&gt; for a few dollars more. We saw them drop to $99 at Walmart during the most recent shopping holiday, but at the moment, you can only get them for &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-2nd-generation%2F-%2FA-84852693%3Fpreselect%3D54191099%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeearbudsdeals"&gt;$159.99 at Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iGBbls"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9507432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vnM4qN"&gt;Last on the AirPods block is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;third-gen model&lt;/a&gt;. These are the latest addition to the AirPods line, blending a bit of the AirPods Pro look with the hard-plastic build of the second-gen, and packing a MagSafe wireless charging case. While they’re the newest model, they have seen a fair share of discounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vb6iWX"&gt;The third-gen AirPods normally sell for $179, but you can currently get them for $169.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-true-wireless-bluetooth-headphones-3rd-generation%2F-%2FA-77603772%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeearbudsdeals"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAirPods-3rd-generation%2F510546422&amp;amp;subid1=vergeearbudsdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. It may not be $140, the price we saw them going for around Black Friday, but if you like the newer design with MagSafe charging case, it’s worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Live.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HGCqrw"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5RLzc"&gt;Samsung has a few different wireless earbuds to choose from, including its latest flagship wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds include active noise cancellation and some of the best sound quality of any Samsung earbuds to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyxi2K"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the Galaxy Buds Pro were more than $50 off, bringing the price down to around $150 — nearly an all-time low — in select colorways. They are still on sale at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfWifJWOA7P" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099X4HMV4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds-pro-true-wireless-bluetooth-earbuds%2F-%2FA-82244531%3Fpreselect%3D82026965%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeearbudsdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, but only for $169.99 ($30 off).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WZ42v1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x23GrZ"&gt;Samsung released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; — a good-sounding pair of earbuds with active noise cancellation, wireless charging, and a subtle design — back in August, and we’ve seen plenty of discounts since then at retailers like Woot and Amazon. Right now, for instance, you can get them at &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836602-13140759?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds2-true-wireless-anc-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot for $99.99&lt;/a&gt;, their lowest price to date. While these are in new condition, they only carry a 90-day warranty from Woot. If that gives you pause, they’re also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Lightweight-Graphite/dp/B094242FV1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $119.33&lt;/a&gt; with a one-year manufacturer’s warranty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Eo52gY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10707231"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jQroWm"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; were our top pick last year for the best wireless earbuds overall, but have since been discontinued with the arrival of the Galaxy Buds 2. A successor to the original Galaxy Buds, the Plus model extends the battery life by up to 11 hours and, unlike AirPods, comes in an assortment of colors. Right now, you can buy the $149.99 Galaxy Buds Plus in black for just &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Buds-Cosmic-Black-Charging-Case-Included%2F255407922" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$79 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is the lowest price we’ve seen in the last several months and likely one of the last major discounts we’ll see before the earbuds become unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MjZMZR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mPBmzD"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; are some of the more unconventional wireless earbuds on the market right now, but don’t let their bean-shaped design fool you. The Buds Live is a good option if you want earbuds that produce powerful sound and showcase marathon battery life. Right now, you can purchase a pair of the $169.99 Galaxy Buds Live in the red colorway for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J3Y4W5J/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$97.37 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, about a $73 discount, or in an assortment of colors for $109.99 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9wI2v49bF" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds-live-true-wireless-bluetooth-earbuds%2F-%2FA-81111923%3Fpreselect%3D80785948%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeearbudsdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="qWuBwy"&gt;Sony WF-C500 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LKm4yz"&gt;While the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; and their predecessors, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WF-1000XM3&lt;/a&gt;, are usually our favorite picks when it comes to Sony’s wireless earbuds, their usual sale prices have chilled in the new year. The WF-1000XM4 may still be worth it to some at their regular price of about &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM4-Industry-Canceling-Headphones/dp/B094C4VDJZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$280&lt;/a&gt; — after all, they are our top pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;best earbuds you can buy&lt;/a&gt; — but if you’re seeking a deal, it’s best to now look elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dtinQ3"&gt;Enter the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22828293/sony-wf-c500-earbuds-review-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony WF-C500&lt;/a&gt;. These affordable buds came out at the end of 2021, and they prove their worth as a put-together set with very aggressive pricing. The wireless earbuds feature good sound quality and excellent battery life, and you can currently pick them up for about $69 ($30 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Wireless-Bluetooth-Headphones-resistance/dp/B09CFP6J6D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm5INFe0Vm" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fsony-wf-c500-truly-wireless-in-ear-bluetooth-earbud-headphones%2F-%2FA-84783666%3Fpreselect%3D83702943%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeearbudsdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-WF-C500-Truly-Wireless-In-ear-Headphones-Black%2F985519962%3Fathbdg%3DL1700&amp;amp;subid1=vergeearbudsdeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. You may not get ANC with these earbuds, but they’re an exceptional value for solid performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="58GOfq"&gt;Compared to the competition, Jabra’s wireless earbuds have a rare feature that has yet to become standard in the true wireless earbud market: the ability to connect to two devices concurrently. Ideally, this is great for users who switch between two devices often (like, say, a phone and a laptop).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="P0sP2n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Jabra overhauls true wireless earbuds lineup with three new models","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22649800/jabra-elite-7-pro-active-3-features-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vJ5wIC"&gt;In 2020, Jabra released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 85t wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which are the highest-tier model in Jabra’s current lineup. They offer more advanced noise cancellation than the 75t, however, they also feature less bass and an inferior fit. That said, you can currently buy the $229.99 Jabra Elite 85t for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$183.24 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not quite the best price of $140 that we have seen in the past, but Amazon currently has the only sizable discount on this model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L8bJWl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10355180"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TBz3wY"&gt;Beats Powerbeats Pro deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PJ3wLT"&gt;If you’re currently in the market for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds for your workouts, you also can’t go wrong with the predecessor to the Studio Buds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds have an over-ear hook that keeps them in place while exercising; they’re also IPX4 sweat- and water-resistant, so you don’t have to worry about ruining them should your workout get intense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aryAiB"&gt;Currently, there are a few different discounts available for the Powerbeats Pro. The lowest we see right now is at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Powerbeats-Pro-Totally-Wireless-Earphones/dp/B07W5JZBVJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgm5XKI8Lp1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which are selling the earbuds in a handful of colorways for $179.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0RcdxX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10058925"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="s5FT0v"&gt;UF Fits deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="m5v8fu"&gt;After testing a pair for ourselves, we remarked in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21537150/ue-fits-review-wireless-earbuds-review-custom-fit-ear-tips" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt; that the UE Fits were the most comfortable consumer earbuds on the market. That’s because, unlike the other wireless earbuds on this list, the UE Fits are uniquely capable of permanently molding to the shape of your ears in just 60 seconds. They thus make great a choice for those concerned their earbuds may come loose or fall out. At the same time, we found they also offer good sound quality, as well as lengthy, eight-hour battery life. Normally $249.99, you can get them right now for just &lt;a href="https://ultimate-ears.dubn.net/c/482924/500013/8590?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcustom.ultimateears.com%2Fproducts%2Fue-fits%3Firclickid%3DwiuzeN2aXxyIU-LSYLyQdQ62UkG2ya3h1ykOzY0%26utm_source%3Dradius%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26irgwc%3D1&amp;amp;subid1=vergeBF2021earbuds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$169&lt;/a&gt; in various colors from Ultimate Ears.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California appeals decision regarding Activision Blizzard settlement</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x7v9cv"&gt;Activision Blizzard’s legal troubles just took another potential turn. The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) is appealing a judge’s decision that denies it from intervening in the $18 million settlement between the game developer and the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21175592-dfeh-appeal"&gt;according to a document filed Friday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHuoqG"&gt;Activision Blizzard and the EEOC settled a lawsuit regarding the developer’s allegedly toxic culture &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697341/us-eeoc-sues-activision-blizzard-sexual-harassment-discrimination"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;, establishing a consent decree that included Activision Blizzard creating an $18 million settlement fund to compensate employees. This case is separate from the DFEH’s lawsuit against Activision Blizzard filed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;in July&lt;/a&gt;, which is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2Fy0u"&gt;In October, however, the DFEH filed a motion to intervene, arguing that the consent decree could release Activision Blizzard from the state’s claims and potentially allow the company to destroy evidence relevant to the DFEH’s case. A judge denied the motion &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/14/22834691/judge-denies-california-dfeh-block-activision-blizzard-eeoc-lawsuit-settlement"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt;, and now, the DFEH is appealing that decision.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lBKNH"&gt;The game developer has been embroiled in controversy since the DFEH filed its lawsuit last summer. Employees have petitioned to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789679/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-employees-petition-removal"&gt;remove CEO Bobby Kotick&lt;/a&gt;, but he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/21/22795286/activision-ceo-bobby-kotick-is-not-resigning-yet"&gt;remains in his post&lt;/a&gt; despite a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"&gt;bombshell report&lt;/a&gt; alleging &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;he was aware&lt;/a&gt; of sexual misconduct allegations at the company for years. And some employees have been striking &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1478186596688179202"&gt;for weeks&lt;/a&gt; in response to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820549/activision-blizzard-raven-software-layoffs-walkout-call-of-duty"&gt;surprise layoffs of QA employees at Raven Software&lt;/a&gt;, which is known for its work on the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbxTYF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Casey Wasserman is on the board of directors for Activision Blizzard as well as the board of directors of Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
