    <title>Jake Paul will not face federal charges after FBI raid</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6nhD7h"&gt;The US Attorney won’t be filing any charges against Jake Paul, according &lt;a href="https://www.tmz.com/2021/08/12/jake-paul-no-federal-charges-arizona-mall-incident-george-floyd-protest-scottsdale-looting/"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;TMZ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and a statement sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by Paul’s lawyers. Paul &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366407/jake-paul-fbi-raid-comment-arizona-looting-absurd-rumors"&gt;was being investigated by the FBI&lt;/a&gt;, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21356047/jake-paul-fbi-federal-search-warrant-house-raided-guns"&gt;raided his house&lt;/a&gt;, for his involvement in an incident that took place at an Arizona mall in May 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3tuxpr"&gt;These particular legal troubles began when Paul was filmed in and around a mall in Scottsdale, AZ, which was being looted in the wake of police brutality protests sparked by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22529934/darnella-frazier-filmed-george-floyd-murder-phone-pulitzer-prize-citation"&gt;the murder of George Floyd&lt;/a&gt;. Paul denied participating in the looting (and wasn’t seen doing so in the videos that circulated on social media), but was still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280476/jake-paul-arizona-protests-riots-youtube-filming-scottsdale"&gt;charged with criminal trespassing and unlawful assembly&lt;/a&gt; by the Scottsdale Police Department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nDScL8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21356047/jake-paul-fbi-federal-search-warrant-house-raided-guns"&gt;According to police&lt;/a&gt;, the charges against Paul were then dropped to allow the FBI to carry out a federal criminal investigation. In a now-deleted video, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366407/jake-paul-fbi-raid-comment-arizona-looting-absurd-rumors"&gt;Paul said that investigation was why the FBI raided his home&lt;/a&gt; in California, in August 2020. At the time, the FBI confirmed that it did carry out “federal search warrants” in California related to the investigation, but would not comment on what they were looking for or what was found. Now, it seems, that investigation is over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zLBpFO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;same &lt;a href="https://t.co/hIo8Zk9X6C"&gt;https://t.co/hIo8Zk9X6C&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jake Paul (@jakepaul) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jakepaul/status/1424189582036373510?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nvxOmq"&gt;So far, Jake Paul himself seemingly hasn’t commented on the US Attorney’s decision. Last week, though, he made a reference on Twitter to running away from the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAUZ7J"&gt;Paul’s counsel told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that they “are pleased that the United States Attorney reached the conclusion that no criminal charges should be filed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIuQKo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amid Black Widow lawsuit, Disney boss defends its pandemic release strategy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AKO4Mc4mS-_UFEuGDEKIABO0kbw=/210x0:1230x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69718474/cc34ecb078c29957ad70d987b6b38121.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Marvel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nvwgHB"&gt;Following a high-stakes lawsuit over Disney’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600396/scarlett-johansson-suing-disney-black-widow-release"&gt;day-and-date release&lt;/a&gt; of Marvel’s &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; on its Premier Access streaming platform and the company’s compensation of the film’s star Scarlett Johansson, the head of Disney today defended both the company’s payouts to talent as well as its decisions around various pandemic movie releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VFRDSq"&gt;During the company’s third-quarter earnings call, Disney boss Bob Chapek explained the company’s multi-pronged approach to releasing its films throughout the pandemic, which included theatrical exclusives, straight-to-digital releases on Disney Plus, and a hybrid of both that saw films debut on Disney’s paid Premier Access platform the same day they premiered in theaters. Premier Access was chosen as the release model for several of its highly anticipated releases in the last year, including &lt;em&gt;Mulan&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KmUXIT"&gt;“Bob Iger and I, along with the leaders of our creative and distribution teams, determined this was the right strategy because it would enable us to reach the broadest possible audience,” Chapek said during the call. “And just to reiterate, distribution decisions are made on a film-by-film basis based on global marketplace conditions and consumer behavior. We will continue to utilize all available options going forward, learn from insights gained with each release, and innovate accordingly while always doing what we believe is in the best interest of the film and the best interest of our constituents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ye2TcM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Distribution decisions are made on a film-by-film basis.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vkiZ38"&gt;Chapek was asked by one shareholder on the call how the company thinks about the success of a film in the current pandemic environment as well as how the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611516/scarlett-johansson-disney-lawsuit-streaming-services-transparency"&gt;compensates its talent&lt;/a&gt;. (The &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; suit argued the film’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572613/black-widow-disney-plus-premier-access-theaters"&gt;box office performance&lt;/a&gt; was severely impacted by the hybrid release.) Chapek offered that the company is “reacting to a very fluid situation in terms of the marketplace,” but added that some of these films were “conceived under a time when we did not know what was going to be happening with consumer behavior three, four years later and certainly didn’t know about covid at the time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YcSDOk"&gt;“We’re dealing under a different set of conditions than we thought,” Chapek said. “What I will say is that just like we’ve done many times before as the business has evolved and transformed, we’ve figured out ways to fairly compensate our talent so that no matter what the business model is that we have to go to market with, everybody feels satisfied.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3uONhJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’ve figured out ways to fairly compensate our talent.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ptNB4H"&gt;While neither &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; nor Johansson were explicitly mentioned in Chapek’s responses, they appear to double down on statements previously made in response to Johansson’s suit, which the company said last month had “no merit.” As part of her complaint, Johansson argued that she lost out on substantial bonuses that were tied to the film’s performance at the box office and that Disney’s decision to release it on Premier Access cut into her earnings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jdt210"&gt;Disney said that the time that it “fully complied with Ms. Johansson’s contract and furthermore, the release of Black Widow on Disney Plus with Premier Access has significantly enhanced her ability to earn additional compensation on top of the $20M she has received to date.” Based on the fact that she’s suing the company, Johansson seems to disagree.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s $1.5 billion Air Hub opens in Kentucky to speed up deliveries</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qWmkExyBy-2qNBFE1A6c6dTcqpw=/51x0:609x372/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69717817/90.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YNFI2Y"&gt;Your Amazon packages may be getting an express ticket — &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/welcome-to-the-amazon-air-hub"&gt;Amazon has finished building&lt;/a&gt; its $1.5 billion air hub, located at the Cincinnati / Northern Kentucky International Airport, and has started operations there. Amazon started building the 800,000-square-foot facility in 2019, and it now boasts robots, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-air-hub-kentucky-photos-2021-8#amazon-air-hub-is-situated-on-600-acres-at-the-cincinnatinorthern-kentucky-international-airport-1"&gt;miles of conveyor belts&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZPRh7"&gt;A big benefit of having a centrally located place to process packages and get them on planes is speed — that’s why UPS has a hub in Louisville, Kentucky; FedEx ships many packages through Memphis, Tenessee; and DHL has a hub in the same airport as Amazon. Amazon’s press release says that the cargo hub will help with the “rapid transport of customer packages throughout the U.S.” Jeff Bezos also made that argument, tweeting that the hub would help customers get packages faster when the company broke ground on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x1BSZD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re investing $1.5 billion in our new air hub to get you your packages faster. Three million square feet, and it’s going to create 2,000 jobs. And if you’re guessing that driving a front loader was fun, you’re right! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/amazon?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#amazon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/prime?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#prime&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Cud4orKrC4"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Cud4orKrC4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JeffBezos/status/1128409227481964544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 14, 2019&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V2IPcR"&gt;Amazon has been working on expanding its air capabilities since it &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/04/amazon-to-launch-prime-air-its-own-dedicated-cargo-planes-to-speed-delivery/"&gt;started on its fleet in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. The company even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215279/amazon-buys-boeing-jets-planes-delta-westjet"&gt;purchased 11 planes for itself&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. In April 2021, Amazon had over 70 planes working as part of its transportation and logistics network, according to &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/amazon-air-launches-new-hub-in-southern-california"&gt;a press release put out by the company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAvs2b"&gt;Amazon’s estimates of processing “millions of packages every week” at its air hub once it becomes fully operational shows that it’s become a massive shipper in its own right, one that’s interested in keeping the packages within its control at every step. In 2019, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/7/20758346/fedex-amazon-ground-shipping-ending-contract"&gt;stopped working with FedEx&lt;/a&gt; for air and ground transportation of its packages, and its massive investment into the facility indicates that the company is looking to take even more control over the air portion of its logistics chain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tj254W"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/r-amazon-to-spend-149-bln-on-air-cargo-hub-fans-talk-of-bigger-ambitions-2017-2"&gt;Some analysts have speculated&lt;/a&gt; that Amazon could be looking to use its logistics prowess to deliver other company’s packages, not just its own. At the moment, Amazon’s messaging is focused mainly on how its air hub will impact consumers and the local Northern Kentucky area, but the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215279/amazon-buys-boeing-jets-planes-delta-westjet"&gt;has recently been investing in&lt;/a&gt; personal transportation companies like Zoox and Rivian. If Amazon is looking to become a transportation company for you and your packages, a centrally located logistics hub would certainly be an important investment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook shouldn't be allowed to buy Giphy, says UK regulator</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wbYiiZsjKgUw1Xi8NwG98B8EGHQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69717805/acastro_180806_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3bzKu1"&gt;15 months ago, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/15/21259965/facebook-giphy-gif-acquisition-buy-instagram-integration-cost"&gt;said it was buying&lt;/a&gt; the popular GIF search engine Giphy for about $400 million. Now the acquisition may be a bust, thanks to an antitrust probe by the UK’s Competition and Markets Authority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xT3GUM"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/facebook-s-takeover-of-giphy-raises-competition-concerns"&gt;preliminary findings report&lt;/a&gt; published Thursday, the CMA said the deal should be unwound because it will “negatively impact competition between social media platforms.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5qRjSJ"&gt;The CMA’s reasoning for wanting to block the Giphy deal is as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VedAea"&gt;“Millions of posts every day on social media sites now include a GIF. Any reduction in the choice or quality of these GIFs could significantly affect how people use these sites and whether or not they switch to a different platform, such as Facebook. As most major social media sites that compete with Facebook use Giphy GIFs, and there is only one other large provider of GIFs – Google’s Tenor – these platforms have very little choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69YocV"&gt;The CMA provisionally found that Facebook’s ownership of Giphy could lead it to deny other platforms access to its GIFs. Alternatively, it could change the terms of this access – for example, Facebook could require Giphy customers, such as TikTok, Twitter and Snapchat, to provide more user data in order to access Giphy GIFs. Such actions could increase Facebook’s market power, which is already significant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6MwhHO"&gt;Putting aside the logic that someone would switch to using Facebook because of GIFs (I love GIFs as much as the next person, but come on), the CMA argues that Giphy was in the process of building up an ads business that would have competed with Facebook. It claims that Facebook made Giphy end those plans after it announced the deal, thereby reducing competition in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fyMfg"&gt;Facebook has refuted this idea in past submissions to the CMA, citing internal documents it and Giphy both submitted to the agency for the probe. In May, Facebook wrote in &lt;a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/60c34db5d3bf7f4bcee709a0/_Non-Confidential_-_Facebook_GIPHY_Main_Parties_Initial_Submission_19_May_2021_.pdf"&gt;a filing to the watchdog&lt;/a&gt; that Giphy had “no meaningful audience of its own” and was already “reliant on Facebook for a significant proportion of its user traffic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULA0vx"&gt;Giphy raised $150 million in funding over its 8-year-history but had yet to turn a profit and was running out of money at the time it agreed to the deal with Facebook, according to people familiar the matter. After failing to raise a round of funding several months prior, it agreed to be sold for less than the prior valuation it had been given by investors—a sign that its viability as an independent business was in trouble&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7lgskX"&gt;“We disagree with the CMA’s preliminary findings, which we do not believe to be supported by the evidence,” a Facebook spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;adding that the company “will continue to work with the CMA to address the misconception that the deal harms competition.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="iLghe2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giphy’s employees have been stuck in a holding pattern&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9yCJKI"&gt;Meanwhile, Giphy’s more than 100 employees have been stuck in a holding pattern since the deal with Facebook was announced. They haven’t been allowed to become Facebook employees, though Facebook has been paying Giphy’s bills to keep the company running, according to a person familiar with the arrangement. Facebook has already paid for most of Giphy’s stock as part of the deal terms, but a percentage that was withheld for employee retention remains in limbo. (A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment on any financial-related matters with Giphy.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9iawPW"&gt;Whether Facebook is allowed to buy Giphy or not, the scrutiny on this deal shows how Facebook’s era of social media-related acquisitions may be over. Its more recent &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-nears-purchase-of-startup-in-deal-that-values-it-at-1-billion-11606750196"&gt;$1 billion acquisition attempt for Kustomer&lt;/a&gt;, a customer service platform for businesses,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;is under antitrust review in multiple countries and could also be blocked. The only types of acquisitions that Facebook has been able to get away with in the last few years are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537795/is-facebook-cornering-the-vr-market"&gt;related to its augmented and virtual reality efforts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wdgTN"&gt;The CMA’s final report on the Giphy deal is due in early October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s1V8Z7"&gt;&lt;div style="max-width: 87vh;"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 114.4828%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/9M5jK4GXmD5o1irGrF" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Apple updates Eddy Cue’s title to better reflect its turn to services</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jgwTry"&gt;Apple rolled out &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fleadership%2Feddy-cue%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F12%2F22622178%2Fapple-eddy-cue-job-title-update-senior-vp-services" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a small but meaningful update&lt;/a&gt; to senior executive Eddy Cue’s job title on Thursday that features an area of interest the company has long been focused on: services (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/12/eddy-cue-title-change-services-apple/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Eddy Cue is a longstanding veteran at Apple who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/4/26/4265172/itunes-store-at-10-how-apple-built-a-digital-media-juggernaut"&gt;helped build iTunes&lt;/a&gt; and the App Store, but his new title of “Senior Vice President, Services” reflects the company’s increasingly important side hustle, if not outright transformation into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/20/18273179/apple-icloud-itunes-app-store-music-services-businesses"&gt;a media business and subscription peddler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3iqBM"&gt;Prior to Thursday, Eddy Cue was senior vice president of internet software and services, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210303073700/https://www.apple.com/leadership/eddy-cue/"&gt;with responsibilities&lt;/a&gt; that included overseeing the iTunes Store, Apple Music, Apple Pay, Maps, Search Ads, iCloud, and iWork. His new job description emphasizes Apple’s subscription darlings:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6r296t"&gt;Eddy oversees the full range of Apple’s services, including Apple Music, Apple News, Apple Podcasts, the Apple TV app, and Apple TV Plus, as well as Apple Pay, Apple Card, Maps, Search Ads, Apple’s iCloud services, and Apple’s productivity and creativity apps. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ApPa26"&gt;Apple still makes a ton of money selling hardware and software — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596120/apple-q3-2021-earnings-iphone-ipad-mac"&gt;earning a total of $81.43 billion during the third quarter of 2021&lt;/a&gt; — but its services business has specifically been growing as of late, earning an all-time revenue high of $17.5 billion during the same quarter. Apple’s found major success &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394062/apple-tv-ted-lasso-season-2-trailer-premiere-date"&gt;in streaming hits like &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that may have helped, and seems primed to take even bigger, more &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;-sized swings &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547252/foundation-release-date-apple-tv-plus-september"&gt;with shows like &lt;em&gt;Foundation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; later this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mETswq"&gt;Cue’s had a hand in many pies over his time at Apple, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/1/16240584/apple-eddy-cue-siri-craig-federighi"&gt;managing Siri for a period&lt;/a&gt; before Apple began to actively compete with Google Assistant. He’s also now infamously known as one of the few executives &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406303/imessage-android-eddy-cue-emails-apple-epic-deposition"&gt;who pushed for Apple to bring iMessage to Android&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to an email exchange between Cue and senior vice president of software engineering Craig Federighi that was dug up as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; antitrust lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlhLGX"&gt;A title change might not mean that much in terms of what Cue does day to day, but it is yet more evidence that Apple’s services business is here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RotckP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sl1ehU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3lvlgv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook office return delayed until 2022 in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iE5oNK5RHQMoaeOffwnTwuNYjrg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69717460/jbareham_180405_1777_facebook_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VZyTmX"&gt;Specifically citing concerns about a rise in cases of the delta variant of COVID-19, Facebook confirmed a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-12/facebook-delays-return-to-offices-until-2022-for-u-s-employees?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; report that it has pushed back plans for US workers to return to the office until next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="kKTbOX"&gt;Data, not dates, is what drives our approach for returning to the office. Given the recent health data showing rising Covid cases based on the Delta variant, our teams in the US will not be required to go back to the office until January 2022. We expect this to be the case for some countries outside of the US, as well. We continue to monitor the situation and work with experts to ensure our return to office plans prioritize everyone’s safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="lcjC0S"&gt;Just a few weeks ago, Facebook was still planning to have fully reopened offices by October with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598818/facebook-vaccine-requirement-us-office-employees"&gt;requirements for vaccination and masking&lt;/a&gt;. Now, with an eye toward local data on infections, the 50 percent return in September and ramp up to full capacity are months further away. Offices outside the US may reopen later this year, depending on the situation locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6949Rs"&gt;In the spring we noted that, like Microsoft and Uber, Facebook was scheduling its office reopenings. Now, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611439/amazon-office-employees-postpone-back-to-work-january-2022"&gt;like Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, it’s responding to a new wave of infections by delaying pandemic reopenings until January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bill Gates wants in on Congress’ big climate infrastructure push</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Key Speakers At The One Planet Summit" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kiyzinFBqqIhjkbDFG7FX7RDTvE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69716975/1041349006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Bill Gates, billionaire and co-chair of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, speaks during the One Planet Summit in New York, U.S., on Wednesday, Sept. 26, 2018.  | Mark Kauzlarich/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ELGvZM"&gt;The bipartisan infrastructure deal could unlock a new stream of private funding for climate tech&lt;strong&gt; — &lt;/strong&gt;and Bill Gates wants in on the action. Gates’ climate investment fund says that if the infrastructure bill moves forward, it will match&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;$1.5 billion in government funds and put that money toward projects that are developing green technologies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2pz1m"&gt;Breakthrough Energy, Gates’ climate fund, laid out four different uses for the money: developing green hydrogen fuels, sustainable aviation fuels, energy storage, and technologies that take carbon dioxide out of the air. It said on Twitter that the money could “fast-track” commercial demonstration projects across the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="rJpcWj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Scale them up to a pretty gigantic level”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EBTzUR"&gt;“Critical for all these climate technologies is to get the costs down and to be able to scale them up to a pretty gigantic level,” Gates told &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bill-gates-pledges-1-5-billion-for-infrastructure-bills-new-climate-projects-11628769601?redirect=amp#click=https://t.co/Dfa8tXxdVM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was the first to report on the announcement. “You’ll never get that scale up unless the government’s coming in with the right policies, and the right policy is exactly what’s in that infrastructure bill.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AkciGN"&gt;The funding&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;depends on whether a bipartisan infrastructure package ultimately becomes law. The bill still needs to pass the House after it passed in the Senate earlier this week. The package includes $25 billion for the Department of Energy for public-private partnerships, &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reports. If the bill becomes law, Breakthrough Energy can apply for matching funds.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;If the bill fails, Breakthrough Energy could funnel its $1.5 billion toward projects in Europe and Asia instead, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PP4yXo"&gt;Breakthrough Energy tweeted that it wants to work with the Energy Department to spur up to $15 billion in investments in technologies that might be able to help the US bring its carbon dioxide emissions down to net-zero.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NlGuBo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Welcomed news!”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3iNZ5X"&gt;The news was met with excitement this morning from Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm. “Welcomed news! This shows the private sector is ready to answer the call to combat the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/climatecrisis?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#climatecrisis&lt;/a&gt;,” Granholm &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SecGranholm/status/1425805251345412098"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fusQrv"&gt;The Biden administration has pledged to get the US on track to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Leading climate scientists have &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;found&lt;/a&gt; that hitting that target globally could prevent some of the worst effects of climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3IKOh"&gt;To reach net-zero, economies have to drastically slash climate pollution that comes from burning fossil fuels. Any remaining carbon dioxide emissions would have to be pulled into natural carbon sinks like forests, or captured using a still-emerging suite of technologies that scrubs it out of smokestacks or pulls it out of the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WkeFUA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re talking about real money for real projects. We’ll be fast-tracking commercial demonstration projects across the country in four promising, climate-smart technologies: sustainable aviation fuel, green hydrogen, direct air capture, and long-duration energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;— Breakthrough Energy (@Breakthrough) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Breakthrough/status/1425806066328248320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hzkfwy"&gt;Both Breakthrough Energy and the Biden administration have prioritized developing so-called “direct air capture” tech. The infrastructure package includes $3.5 billion for four proposed regional hubs across the US, each with the ability to capture at least 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide annually (about as much as 120,000 US homes might generate from their energy use in a year). There’s billions more in funding in the bill to build out a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22606395/pipeline-battle-co2-removal-carbon-capture-bipartisan-infrastructure"&gt;new network of pipelines and storage for captured CO2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CoKDM5"&gt;There’s another $8 billion in the bipartisan infrastructure package to develop &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-02/hydrogen-plan-isn-t-very-green-under-u-s-infrastructure-deal"&gt;four regional hubs for “clean hydrogen,”&lt;/a&gt; another focus of Breakthrough Energy’s work. Hydrogen fuel releases water rather than greenhouse gases when burned and has been proposed as an alternative fuel for things like aviation and maritime shipping that are difficult to electrify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8T2Wk"&gt;There’s one big caveat: making traditional hydrogen fuel actually releases a lot of CO2, because it involves reacting steam with a fossil fuel — typically gas — to separate out the hydrogen. Breakthrough Energy’s Catalyst program, which would provide the proposed $1.5 billion, also focuses on developing “green” hydrogen, which is made by using renewable energy to split water (electrolysis). There’s also “blue” hydrogen, which relies on technology to capture carbon from fossil-fueled processes for making the fuel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0zjTMz"&gt;All of these technologies are still in pretty early stages of development, which is why they’d need massive investments to scale up. That’s worried some progressive climate advocates who have called climate strategies that rely on capturing carbon a “&lt;a href="https://www.ciel.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/CCS-Letter_FINAL_US-1.pdf"&gt;dangerous distraction&lt;/a&gt;” from efforts to stop using fossil fuels altogether. Breakthrough Energy did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp, Twitter, and Facebook are reportedly blocked in Zambia during its presidential election</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TOPSHOT-ZAMBIA-VOTE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BxZGbT822ODrq9aaYsZCKPlHogo=/0x1:3600x2401/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69716961/1234632546.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N3ycU8"&gt;WhatsApp and other apps are reportedly blocked in Zambia during ongoing general elections being held in the country Thursday, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/accessnow/status/1425836954264997888?s=20"&gt;digital rights organization Access Now&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://netblocks.org/reports/whatsapp-and-social-media-restricted-in-zambia-on-election-day-18lpLY8a"&gt;internet monitor NetBlocks&lt;/a&gt;. The block, affecting state-owned internet providers and other private networks, could be cutting off voters from a vital form of communication during a contentious election.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4CGd3i"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.lusakatimes.com/2021/08/10/government-may-shut-down-internet-during-voting-period-malupenga/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lusaka Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a local Zambian news organization, writes that officials from Zambia’s Ministry of Information and Broadcast Services considered shutting down internet access in the lead-up to election day, citing a desire to stop the spread of election misinformation. A dramatic decrease in election day internet traffic from WhatsApp, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netblocks/status/1425803238423552002?s=20"&gt;spotted by NetBlocks&lt;/a&gt; seems to confirm that the government moved forward with that plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gseALE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;⚠️ Update: Real-time network data confirm that social media and messaging platforms including Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Messenger are now restricted in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Zambia?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Zambia&lt;/a&gt; on election day in addition to the earlier WhatsApp restriction &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ZambiaDecides2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ZambiaDecides2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  &lt;a href="https://t.co/pTzmnesKzP"&gt;https://t.co/pTzmnesKzP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Nw58eCTfu8"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Nw58eCTfu8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NetBlocks (@netblocks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netblocks/status/1425817892482818059?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HVmWVo"&gt;Zambia’s presidential election, pitting incumbent President Edgar Lungu against opposition leader Hakainde Hichilema, has already been marred by violence, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/zambia-election-idAFL8N2P80RH"&gt;according to reports from &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, prompting a military crackdown from the current government. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/africa/zambian-president-lungu-hichilema-face-off-third-time-knife-edge-vote-2021-08-12/"&gt;Polls closed as of 12PM ET&lt;/a&gt;, but votes are still allowed to be cast for anyone still in line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iy95Du"&gt;Typically information promoting voters’ security and safety would be disseminated on social media and messaging apps — everything from voting wait times to instances of potential voter fraud — but now voters on affected networks in Zambia are having to turn to VPNs to communicate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umspRx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has contacted Twitter, as well as WhatsApp and Instagram’s parent company Facebook, for comment on the blocks in Zambia. We’ll update this article if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Do we see others online as human?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iqu0zp0HpWtYS--CD76H8gjGfRg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69716837/mdoying_180118_2249_facebook_0729stills_angry.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oloOn6"&gt;I’ve often wondered if part of the reason that there is so much venom spewed on Twitter and other social media is that it’s difficult to actually recognize pieces of text on a screen as being from real, feeling human beings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jKv4q"&gt;I was nudged into this thought by a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/08/05/gamergate-threats-brianna-wu/"&gt;recent &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; story&lt;/a&gt; about Brianna Wu, who had been the target of extreme harassment several years ago during the GamerGate situation. She is apparently getting contacted by some former members of that group, who are sending apologies and regrets for their past actions. The story reminded me of something that happened to me way back when, during the days of the BBS (bulletin board system). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltTZu9"&gt;Bear with me for a couple of paragraphs while I set the stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vt6lli"&gt;First, for those who may not not know, BBSes were text-based online discussion groups, many of them local, that were popular before the web became dominant, mostly in the 1980s and early 1990s. (&lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/11/the-lost-civilization-of-dial-up-bulletin-board-systems/506465/"&gt;ran a story in 2016&lt;/a&gt; that gave a nice feel for what BBSes were.) I became a member and then a sysop (system administrator) of one of these NYC groups, called the Women’s BBS (or WBBS). We tried to create a place where people could have a reasonable conversation at a time when women were still seen as interlopers in many (possibly most) online spaces. While there were women-only areas in the BBS, most of the discussion groups were open to all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ylloQ"&gt;Naturally, we got our share of, well, jerks. Those who seemed able to at least hold some kind of discussion, however acerbic, got moved to a separate section called “The Battleground,” where anyone who liked confrontation could yell at each other to their heart’s content. The really nasty posts were just deleted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zwjxAe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One day, I was doing my usual rounds of the new entries and came across one such post, a collection of rather feeble obscenities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7FliGe"&gt;Which brings me (finally) to my story. One day, I was doing my usual rounds of the new entries and came across one such post, a collection of rather feeble obscenities. I was going to delete it, when I realized (from the general tone and some of the misspellings) that it was probably written by someone in their teens or even younger. So instead, I posted a reply, something like: “Do you realize that some of the women here are your age? And that some are your mom’s age? Would you say something this hurtful to your mom? Or to somebody you know?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="80j1FN"&gt;A bit to my surprise, I got back an embarrassed reply. It turned out that the rather stilted nastiness was from a 12-year-old who hadn’t psychologically processed that the people reading his post were actual, real humans with personalities and lives. To him, they were just impersonal names on the screen, names that were associated with a movement that he had been told was ridiculous and comic-book villainous. By replying to him as a real person, I had become real. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jExDs"&gt;We conversed back and forth for about an hour — about his life, about school, and other topics. At the end, I asked him to always think about who was going to read what he posted online, because they were as real as he was. I don’t know if our conversation made any difference to him in the long term. I like to think it did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWVdSs"&gt;Of course, since those first baby steps of online interaction, things have changed radically. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The online universe is a far, far more complex and often frustrating place to navigate. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gdsSbf"&gt;Not only have services such as Facebook and Twitter made online conversation part of everyone’s lives (rather than a subset of the computer-literate), but we are no longer just exchanging text messages. And you would think that apps such as TikTok would make it obvious that the people who are sending their messages out into the world are, indeed, people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="biwJLa"&gt;Or not. In my experience, videos on TikTok and YouTube seem to attract as much, if not more, vitriol as text messages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrxBXn"&gt;So I went looking for answers. There have been loads of articles pointing out the psychology of online interactions and positing various theories as to why people seem to feel freer to attack others online. One, from &lt;em&gt;Mosaic Science&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20180403-why-do-people-become-trolls-online-and-in-social-media"&gt;republished by the BBC&lt;/a&gt;, describes several behavioral experiments and posits that if you’re mean online, nobody you know in “real life” will see. Another, from KQED, describes the “&lt;a href="https://www.kqed.org/education/532334/is-the-internet-making-you-meaner"&gt;online disinhibition effect&lt;/a&gt;” which says that being online lowers your inhibitions. &lt;a href="https://www.thechicagoschool.edu/insight/from-the-magazine/a-virtual-life/"&gt;And yet another&lt;/a&gt; from the Chicago School of Professional Psychology talks about how social media negatively affects our self-image by causing us to constantly compare ourselves to others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OsZmvQ"&gt;And those are only the first three I came across.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YzsvAA"&gt;Because we’re human, there are no definitive answers. Which means that when I scan Twitter, or check out the comments on TikTok, or the replies to articles, and see the way people dash off smart-ass, nasty answers to posts about tragic situations or relatively innocuous observations, I still wonder. Are they doing it just because they can? Because they had a bad day and this is one way to let off steam? Because some of us mistake insult for wit? Because by expressing disdain of some people, they are looking for the approval and support of others? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aIpr9U"&gt;Or is it that, despite the photos and videos, we may still not truly see those others out there in the ether as human?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How in the world did these AMD RX 6600 XT GPUs sell at or under MSRP?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OJm42NAUnka2bvoAWmLa2xPe62s=/98x0:1162x709/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69716790/910022_amd_radeon_6600XT_angle1260x709_0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qPBpRT"&gt;Every PC graphics card we’ve reviewed in months has come with a disclaimer — if you can find one &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt;, you won’t be able to buy it for anywhere near its MSRP. And yet somehow, we’ve stepped into a bizzaro world where a few retailers listed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617256/amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-review-gpu-graphics-card"&gt;the brand-new AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT&lt;/a&gt; for at or under its $379 suggested retail price, &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/amd-rx-6600-xt-available-at-msrp/"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt; notes today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sWDg6o"&gt;Stock appears to have run out of the US cards while I was writing this post, but the UK cards still seem to be in stock, including &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.overclockers.co.uk%2Fsapphire-radeon-rx-6600-xt-pulse-gaming-8gb-gddr6-pci-express-graphics-card-gx-39p-sp.html%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F12%2F22622066%2Famd-rx-6600-xt-sale-msrp-micro-center-379-dollars" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a Sapphire RX 6600 XT Pulse for £374.99 at Overclockers&lt;/a&gt; and an XFX RX 6600 XT QICK 308 for £359.99 at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebuyer.com%2F1265233-xfx-radeon-rx-6600xt-8gb-qick-308-black-graphics-card-rx-66xt8lbdq&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F12%2F22622066%2Famd-rx-6600-xt-sale-msrp-micro-center-379-dollars" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eBuyer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zur3Y7"&gt;The US cards included a PowerColor AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT Fighter &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/640366/AMD_Radeon_RX_6600_XT_Fighter_Dual-Fan_8GB_GDDR6_PCIe_40_Graphics_Card"&gt;for $379.99&lt;/a&gt;, and a Gigabyte RX 6600 XT Eagle with triple fan &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/640801/gigabyte-amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-eagle-overclocked-triple-fan-8gb-gddr6-pcie-40-graphics-card"&gt;for $379.99 as well&lt;/a&gt;, both at Micro Center, where you’d have needed to visit a store in person to pick one up, and they’re now listed as “limited availability.” Micro Center apparently still has three of &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/640090/powercolor-amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-hellhound-overclocked-dual-fan-8gb-gddr6-pcie-40-graphics-card"&gt;PowerColor’s Hellhound card&lt;/a&gt; for $439.99, however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wE6k9A"&gt;GPU prices are no longer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;as ridiculously bad as they used to be&lt;/a&gt; — following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22544367/china-crypto-crackdown-bitcoin-mining-sichuan-ban-hydro-cryptocurrency-trading"&gt;China’s cryptocurrency crackdown&lt;/a&gt;, a flood of cards returned to the secondhand market that miners no longer needed, and GPUs no longer necessarily fetch triple their MSRP on eBay due to that and other factors. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"&gt;the global chip shortage isn’t over&lt;/a&gt;, either, and it’s surprising to see any retailers or OEMs leave any amount of cash on the table during a period where GPUs continue to sell for far north of their asking price. We’re asking AMD if it did anything to stimulate the market, and we’ll let you know what we hear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IP3Obx"&gt;As you’ll read &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617256/amd-radeon-rx-6600-xt-review-gpu-graphics-card"&gt;in our Radeon RX 6600 XT review&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not like it’s a particularly desirable card compared to other recent powerhouses. But for $379, it’s still a steal in this market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbbtJX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDsBqr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsjwRx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
