    <title>Google’s latest diversity report shows jump in departures among women of color</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GxE7i9"&gt;Google’s latest diversity report shows that despite some gains in the number of Black employees, the company is lagging in its goal to double the number of Black workers by 2025. And the search giant is having particular difficulty retaining women of color, the &lt;a href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/diversity.google/en//annual-report/static/pdfs/google_2021_diversity_annual_report.pdf"&gt;report released Thursday&lt;/a&gt; (pdf) shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AB9tx"&gt;Google uses a scale it calls an attrition index, with the number 100 used as a benchmark. The attrition figure for Black women on that index rose from 110 in 2020 to 146 in 2021, the report shows. Among Native American women the attrition index was up to 148 in 2021, compared to 123 in 2020. The 2021 attrition figures also were higher for Asian men and women and for Latinx men, the report showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KeNICs"&gt;“We recognize the platform that we have and the brand position that we have and we know that there are other companies that are watching us and looking at us,” Google chief diversity officer Melonie Parker &lt;a href="https://diversity.google/annual-report/"&gt;said in a video&lt;/a&gt; that accompanied the report. “And we want to make sure that we don’t just show our successes, but that we show the areas that we need to get better as well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrkqRr"&gt;The company made some progress in its representation and diversity goals, doubling the number of Black employees hired to its US leadership team to 7.1 percent from 3.6 percent the year prior, and the number of women in Google leadership around the world rose from 26.7 percent to 28.1 percent. Still, Google’s US workforce is 68 percent male and 32 percent female, the report shows. Fifty percent of Google’s US workforce is white, compared to 42 percent Asian, 6.4 percent Latinx, 4.4 percent Black, and 0.8 percent Native American. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkC0Td"&gt;And Google faced a slew of criticism late last year and earlier this year, for how it handled the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;firing of Black AI ethics researcher Timnit Gebru&lt;/a&gt; after she wrote a paper that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/5/22155985/paper-timnit-gebru-fired-google-large-language-models-search-ai"&gt;questioned the dangers of large language models&lt;/a&gt;. Gebru accused Google of racism and retaliation, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22309962/timnit-gebru-google-harassment-campaign-jeff-dean"&gt;faced online harassment&lt;/a&gt; for months afterward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yweqd6"&gt;In October, &lt;a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/company-announcements/progress-racial-equity-commitments/"&gt;CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; that the company planned to double the number of Black employees by 2025 and increase the number of underrepresented workers in senior positions by 30 percent. “We’ll hold ourselves accountable for creating an inclusive workplace,” Pichai wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkyXcx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LKZhun"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhEI7d"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Riot made some chill beats for creators to stream to</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m33TaJPJ_VCR1GJUM7iirA17id4=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69534288/P3_still.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ERfXBP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; developer Riot is making something new — and very chill. The company just released an album called &lt;a href="https://found.ee/sessionsvi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sessions: Vi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is packed with 37 lo-fi tracks from producers like &lt;a href="https://chromonicci.bandcamp.com/"&gt;Chromonicci&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://juniorstate.bandcamp.com/"&gt;Junior State&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://laxcity.io/"&gt;Laxcity&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://tennyson.bandcamp.com/"&gt;Tennyson&lt;/a&gt;. The idea, the company says, is to offer “stream-safe” music that creators on platforms like YouTube and Twitch can use, without having to worry about copyright strikes. The album is available to stream now on Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gWQRXX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Bait and Twitch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562372/twitch-soundtrack-riaa-music-youtube"},{"title":"Lo-fi beats to quarantine to are booming on YouTube","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21222294/lofi-chillhop-youtube-productivity-community-views-subscribers"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6fjW4U"&gt;In typical Riot fashion, there’s also a narrative album. The title is in reference to &lt;a href="https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/champions/vi/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; character Vi&lt;/a&gt;, a criminal with high-tech gauntlets, and Riot’s head of music Toa Dunn says the album is meant to reflect a day in her life. The tracks are divided into three main parts, with vibes to represent afternoon, sunset, and night. “It all comes down to storytelling. It gives a lot of context,” Dunn says of the structure. “This isn’t canon. We’re not trying to expand on Runeterra, but this is another look.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqcX3G"&gt;Music has become an increasingly large focus for Riot, particularly within the fantasy realm of &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;, with fictional groups like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21496800/kda-league-of-legends-k-pop-album-release-date"&gt;K/DA&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937187/league-of-legends-true-damage-hip-hop-group-kda-louis-vuitton"&gt;True Damage&lt;/a&gt; releasing albums and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20959206/league-of-legends-worlds-2019-opening-ceremony-holograms-holonet"&gt;performing at esports competitions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Sessions&lt;/em&gt; represents a different direction, but one that makes a lot of sense, given &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562372/twitch-soundtrack-riaa-music-youtube"&gt;the constant tension between streamers and the music industry&lt;/a&gt;. And Dunn says there’s likely more music in the “sessions” line coming in the future as well. “This is drop one of who knows how many,” he says. “We plan to continue to learn and figure out more and more what people like.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ME5ZwY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Tesla Model S Plaid caught fire in Pennsylvania, briefly trapping the driver inside</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VVujueJVLsFLoDWB7QReQDnR2go=/0x210:1536x1234/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69534231/E5ObJckVoAMsr4n.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/meiselasb/status/1410641707985641472" target="_blank"&gt;@meiselasb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LciM7T"&gt;A high-end Tesla Model S Plaid caught fire Tuesday night in Haverford, Pennsylvania, briefly trapping the driver inside, according to the local fire department. A lawyer for the owner said the vehicle “spontaneously combusted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Kmcb6"&gt;Firefighters from both the Gladwyne and Lower Merion Fire Departments arrived on the scene shortly before 9PM ET on Tuesday. The firefighters, who had been trained on how to respond to battery fires involving Tesla vehicles, “laid a 5 inch supply line into the scene so that we could keep a continual water stream on the fire to extinguish the fire and cool the batteries down to ensure complete extinguishment,” according to a statement from the Gladwyne Fire Department. The driver managed to escape and there were no injuries reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Lf2Lgi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla’s Model S Plaid is a high-end, ultra-quick version of the automaker’s original electric sedan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CshC3g"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22528963/tesla-model-s-plaid-ev-price-specs-range-speed"&gt;Tesla’s Model S Plaid is a high-end, ultra-quick version&lt;/a&gt; of the automaker’s original electric sedan. Tesla CEO Elon Musk held a splashy event last month to announce the first customer deliveries of the $130,000 vehicle. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/meiselasb/status/1410641707985641472"&gt;According to Ben Meiselas&lt;/a&gt;, a lawyer who works for the firm representing the unnamed owner, the Model S Plaid was one of the first 250 vehicles shipped to customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xrKokD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10634637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="9t8huc"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Our firm &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AthleteDefender?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AthleteDefender&lt;/a&gt; represent an exec who purchased new Tesla Plaid Model S, which was 1/250 shipped. On Tuesday it spontaneously combusted. Our client was trapped &amp;amp; could have died. We tried reaching out to Tesla &amp;amp; have been ignored so far. This is  car after escape. &lt;a href="https://t.co/wXyJXbWggJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wXyJXbWggJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ben Meiselas (@meiselasb) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/meiselasb/status/1410641707985641472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uciJAm"&gt;“This is a harrowing and frightening situation and an obvious major problem,” said Mark Geragos, another attorney representing the owner. “Our preliminary investigation is ongoing, but we call on Tesla to sideline these cars until a full investigation can occur.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m1lFK7"&gt;There’s no evidence that electric vehicles catch fire at a rate that’s any different from internal combustion cars, but the topic has received increased scrutiny as more EVs hit the road. First responders are even being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/3/17530646/tesla-battery-fire-electric-vehicles-transportation-science"&gt;trained to handle EV battery fires&lt;/a&gt; since they can’t be extinguished via some traditional methods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2uwWcy"&gt;Tesla’s vehicle fires have especially caught a lot of attention — to the point that Musk has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1120802953130995714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;publicly pushed back on the coverage of those incidents&lt;/a&gt;. Some companies, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564217/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-lg-chem"&gt;Chevrolet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357068/hyundai-kona-ev-recall-battery-fire-nhtsa"&gt;Hyundai&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/10/18659983/audi-etron-recall-battery-fire-risk"&gt;Audi&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/27/18761067/nio-es8-electric-suv-recall-battery-fires-china"&gt;NIO&lt;/a&gt;, have issued recalls over the possibility of fires in their EVs. Others, like Jaguar, have experienced &lt;a href="https://www.caixinglobal.com/2019-05-02/deformed-chassis-put-nio-ev-on-fire-101410947.html"&gt;isolated&lt;/a&gt; fires with &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/a-jaguar-i-pace-ev-had-a-thermal-incident-while-parke-1830995550"&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; electric cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="H3KGBR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s no evidence that electric vehicles catch fire at a rate that’s any different from internal combustion cars&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CpCSIU"&gt;Tesla has maintained that its cars &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/VehicleSafetyReport"&gt;are the safest in the world&lt;/a&gt; and self-reports annual vehicle fire statistics that are far lower than those found in gasoline-powered cars. The company has made multiple changes to the Model S over the years to reduce the risk of fires, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5MHSp"&gt;It shipped a software update in 2013 that &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/11/tesla-responds-model-s-fires/"&gt;made the Model S ride higher at highway speeds&lt;/a&gt; to lower the chance of debris puncturing the battery pack and added more physical protection to new packs coming off the line. Both those updates were sent after a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigation into multiple fires. (The agency closed the &lt;a href="https://www.industryweek.com/safety/nhtsa-halts-investigation-tesla-fires"&gt;investigation in 2014&lt;/a&gt;.) Tesla also released a software update in 2016 to “provide extra security during charging” &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2016/03/17/tesla-supercharger-fire-update-software-short-circuit/"&gt;after a Model S caught fire in Norway&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uw9J7M"&gt;Incidents involving Teslas tend to draw more media attention than other vehicles because of the company’s tendency to push the limits on technology, whether it’s battery density, partial autonomy, or vehicle design. Tesla is lauded by its many fans for its willingness to go beyond the comfort zone of more conservative, legacy automakers. And with that also comes more scrutiny from media outlets and regulators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1iPEl"&gt;A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment about the fire, which is unsurprising considering the company has dissolved its public relations department and hasn’t responded to any inquiry in the last two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OOAUuA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMNRrO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla delivered over 200,000 cars in the second quarter of 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QxDCyMnqZ4PxNqSIJannNZCjq9I=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69533799/jbareham_180213_2301_0168.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qkU2uy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q2-2021-vehicle-production-deliveries"&gt;Tesla delivered 201,250 vehicles&lt;/a&gt; in the second quarter of 2021, a record for the company but still falling slightly short of Wall Street expectations. Elon Musk’s company also produced 206,421 vehicles during the same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Np3aK"&gt;Of all the cars that Tesla produced during the quarter, the vast majority — 204,081 — were Model 3 and Model Y vehicles. On top of that, Tesla also produced 2,340 Model S and Model X vehicles — though the company did not break out how many Model S sedans were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22528963/tesla-model-s-plaid-ev-price-specs-range-speed"&gt;the high-end Plaid variant&lt;/a&gt; that just started reaching customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wDW7g4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the company did not break out how many Model S Plaid sedans were delivered&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TlO554"&gt;Earlier last month, Tesla held a delivery event for the redesigned Model S, featuring a new powertrain, more horsepower, a new landscape touchscreen and steering wheel, and more range. A Model S Plaid &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/01/tesla-plaid-fire/"&gt;recently caught fire&lt;/a&gt; in Pennsylvania, briefly trapping the driver inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WO2znB"&gt;The second quarter delivery numbers broke the previous quarter’s record, when Tesla delivered nearly 185,000 vehicles. Tesla has been ramping up production capacity, including building new factories in Texas and Germany, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210191/tesla-delivery-goal-elon-musk-vehicles-2020"&gt;just nearly missed&lt;/a&gt; CEO Elon Musk’s goal of delivering 500,000 cars in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIa93v"&gt;Tesla does not break out deliveries by region, so we don’t know how many vehicles the company is sending to customers in China. Tesla has been hit by a slate of bad news in the country, most recently announcing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/26/22551618/tesla-recalls-model-vehicles-china-cruise-control-safety"&gt;recall of more than 285,000 vehicles&lt;/a&gt; —most of which were made locally— over a safety risk with the vehicles’ cruise control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxtLqG"&gt;Like the rest of the auto industry, Tesla has also struggled with the parts shortage, including a dearth of semiconductors. In May, Musk tweeted that prices were increasing as a result of “supply chain price-pressure industry-wide [sic].” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eNsY7x"&gt;The second quarter also saw the departure of several high-level Tesla executives, including former long-time acting general counsel Al Prescott in April, and both deputy general counsel Lynn Miller and former president of automotive and heavy trucking Jerome Guillen in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LG16dh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Electric vehicles are the future for everyone — except disabled people</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rz2cT0Szh1PhsITx0l0OBrfveg4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69533659/acastro_210625_4643_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;By locating the battery in the floor of the vehicle, auto companies are making it difficult to convert EVs for wheelchair users&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="jU2oxZ"&gt;In a Super Bowl commercial that aired earlier this year, GM declared that its electric vehicles were designed for everyone. The ad closed with the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJf5Woythmk"&gt;image of a one-armed surfer&lt;/a&gt; to emphasize its point. But sometime later, that &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgdQfbaGPsE"&gt;surfer was replaced by an able-bodied counterpart&lt;/a&gt;, with no explanation for the switch. As a wheelchair user, I was left wondering whether people like me are being left out of the EV revolution?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1lT9H"&gt;There’s no doubt that EVs are going to be one of the pillars of our future, yet there are currently none on the market for the disabled. Retrofitting these vehicles with ramps seems close to impossible due to the architecture. And the only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352748/volkswagen-id-buzz-electric-microbus-us-release-date"&gt;EV on the horizon&lt;/a&gt; that could be made accessible isn’t coming until 2023 — and even then, it’s unclear that it will be marketed toward disabled drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcXT9V"&gt;I don’t drive because treatment for a brain tumor caused swelling that impacted my cranial nerves, corrupting my balance, motor skills, and causing my eyes to bounce. I did own a Dodge minivan with a converted ramp so that others could transport me in my electric wheelchair when I had to travel long distances or on tough terrain. For someone with an active life, these vans are a necessity. I was fortunate in that I had the financial support to purchase one, but for many disabled people who live off Social Security income or low-wage jobs, this option is prohibitive. And the price tag will only go up with new technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JV1eCv"&gt;But price is not the problem at this juncture. Most electric vehicles use a so-called “skateboard architecture,” which includes the battery pack, the electric drivetrain, and the electrical architecture that rests under the floor of the vehicle. This makes an EV harder to get into for those with physical disabilities — if only by a minimal amount — because the floor is placed above the battery pack. For disabled drivers, an untapped consumer base of 61 million with nearly $500 million of disposable income, that extra inch or two could be the reason for not getting a license or owning a car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="b04H6k"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I do feel that I might have a harder time getting into the driver’s seat if the battery raises the height of the floor.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="afVBzn"&gt;Kelly Dawson, a disability advocate and writer based in Los Angeles, has limited mobility due to cerebral palsy that mostly affects her legs. She can’t bend down to fill her tires with air because she can’t crouch and balance at the same time. But even as an ambulatory driver, she is worried about the challenges EVs might present her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OK0wLg"&gt;“I do feel that I might have a harder time getting into the driver’s seat if the battery raises the height of the floor,” she said. “With my current fuel-powered car, I can step or slide in, but an EV might be a tighter (potentially unsafe) squeeze.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVHZTa"&gt;Dawson points out that “when cars were first introduced to the public at the beginning of the 20th century, disabled people were in no way a part of public life — they were actively excluded from it. The main difference with this chapter of automotive innovation is that it’s coming 30 years after the passage of the ADA [Americans with Disabilities Act].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SqRAVz"&gt;Where this barrier for the disabled comes into focus is in the potential conversion of the vehicle. Dropping the floor of a gas-powered vehicle 10–14 inches would typically cost $25,000–35,000 and can be partially paid for with help from the state government or Department of Veterans Affairs. Roughly 20,000 of these conversions are done every year, according to Sam Abuelsamid, principal analyst for e-mobility at Guidehouse. However, vehicle conversion companies like &lt;a href="https://www.mobilityworks.com/"&gt;MobilityWorks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.braunability.com/us/en.html"&gt;Braunability&lt;/a&gt;, while being able to add handbrake equipment, can’t convert electric vehicles to have a ramp due to the battery’s position. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZCUVEjikxuiuXRUiH-ekl9yfRc8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22693492/Screen_Shot_2021_07_01_at_10.59.41_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.mobilityworks.com/vehicles/chrysler/" target="_blank"&gt;Braunability&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7oJtvl"&gt;Abuelsamid said that Braunability does offer a conversion for the Chrysler Pacifica plug-in hybrid, which has drop-down ramp access through the rear, but there are no fully electric minivans like that on the market today. Some larger electric vans will appear later this year in the Ford &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21559954/ford-e-transit-electric-delivery-cargo-van-price-specs-range"&gt;E-Transit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/gm-brightdrop-ev600-electric-van-ev-ces-fedex/"&gt;Brightdrop EV600&lt;/a&gt; from GM, but those are prioritized for commercial fleets. The first real electric minivan expected to arrive is the VW ID Buzz in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lkBmyJ"&gt;Kevin Frayne worked for 34 years at GM before joining Braunability as its quasi-futurist. He recently spoke on behalf of the US Access Board at the Department of Transportation’s forum on equity. And he works closely with companies to consult on designs. He said this task will be a difficult one. “It’s not insurmountable, but companies have to start working with us now,” Frayne said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qg3Vg6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In this case, everything has to do with geometry and triangles.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bHHCTf"&gt;“In this case, everything has to do with geometry and triangles,” he said. Frayne has to think about things like roof height because the ADA requires door openings to be 56 inches tall, which makes it a problematic crunch when the floor is raised. If he has two inches to fit an ultra-thin ramp between the floor and the battery, he has to devise a blueprint for the ADA-mandated slope ratio of one inch of rise for every four inches of ramp — though Frayne and others think it should be 1:6. And that doesn’t even take into account automated tie-down systems to secure a wheelchair once inside a vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XilhHL"&gt;But conversions are not the only potential barriers for the disabled community. &lt;a href="https://www.zap-map.com/electric-vehicle-charge-points-lack-accessibility/"&gt;A four-year study by Zap-Map and Motability in the UK&lt;/a&gt; found that one-third of drivers with disabilities had difficulty finding a charge station they could use. The survey only included 2,200 people, and 176 of those considered themselves disabled, but that might have something to do with EV ownership among the disabled being so low due to income and access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nnN6e6"&gt;According to that survey, one reason for inaccessibility at charging stations is the heavy weight of charging cables. Like cellphone and laptop batteries, high-power charging generates a lot of heat in the cable, which is why they are typically insulated and liquid-cooled. This makes them heavier and harder to maneuver. Adding to the difficulty, the charging connectors need to be precisely aligned in order to slide in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gl67KN"&gt;Other issues include the force required to connect the cables to the EV, the lack of curb-cuts to access the charging station, and parking spaces bunched too closely together. Hopefully, as electric vehicles become cheaper and more popular, charging station operators will abandon the current side-by-side setup to support disabled drivers as well as trucks, buses, and vehicles pulling trailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tM1xLL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It seems that disabled drivers and passengers are, at the moment, something of an afterthought”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kEU9Jv"&gt;In 2014, the Department of Energy released a &lt;a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/files/u/publication/WPCC_complyingwithADArequirements_1114.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; with measurements and images depicting a layout for charging stations. While it would be easy to install charging stations in old or unused parking spaces, by law, every lot must have four accessible spaces, and 1 in 6 must be van accessible. As EV expert Dan Caesar from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/fullychargedshow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fully Charged&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; says, “It seems that disabled drivers and passengers are, at the moment, something of an afterthought for the nascent electric vehicle/charging sector.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QHxHtM"&gt;I asked Henry Claypool, technology policy consultant for the American Association of People with Disabilities, about the obstacle of EV batteries in the floor of the vehicle. He was optimistic, recalling how in 2019, Volkswagen convened a meeting with a range of stakeholder groups to discuss building a purpose-built wheelchair-accessible vehicle as part of the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.inclusivemobility.com/"&gt;Inclusive Mobility&lt;/a&gt; initiative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ajoMt"&gt;“At the end of this meeting, a few VW engineers came down to the parking garage to look at my aftermarket modified van,” Claypool told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “They observed the kneeling and ramp system and didn’t seem troubled by creating something like an electric vehicle with a battery in the floor. They seemed really committed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0XJvtO"&gt;Claypool said Toyota is another company that is really advanced in accessibility. “It will be exciting to see them unveil an accessible AV at the Paralympics in Tokyo, Japan,” he said. “And the thing is, when one OEM successfully does this, everyone’s going to follow.”                                               &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLjIhi"&gt;What remains frustrating, though, is how disabled people are being used to sell products while being left out of the engineering decisions. The disabled community doesn’t want to drive gas-burning cars while everyone else zips around in zero-emission vehicles. Automakers shouldn’t put off the disabled community’s concerns because if we’re not included on a foundational level, it’s going to be more complex and expensive for everyone going forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="6syBEw"&gt;“Disabled people are arguably the most innovative cohort of Americans,” says Dawson. “We shouldn’t just be behind the wheel of electric cars, we should also be calling the shots on how to build them.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s G15 Ryzen Edition with an RTX 3060 is $1,078 for a limited time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dell G15 Ryzen Edition" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SAM8rUcZPfPqmvLElwMlEpvf5mc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69533629/g15lineup.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kvemwm"&gt;Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368010/dell-g15-amd-ryzen-edition-15-inch-gaming-laptop-release-date-price-specs"&gt;Dell’s G15 Ryzen Edition&lt;/a&gt; is perhaps the most affordable gaming laptop that has a powerful Ryzen 7 5800H processor and an Nvidia RTX 3060 graphics chip inside (via &lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/15136345-dell-g15-r5-15-6-fhd-165hz-ips-ryzen-7-5800h-16gb-ddr4-512gb-pcie-ssd-rtx-3060-win10h-1077-99?src=jfy%7Crecombee%7C6318339ea0bbb63ee26e92b252a7a4de"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Those two components alone &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-14367655?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeals.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fmpp%2Fproductdetail%2F9dch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;make today’s price of $1,078 an amazing deal&lt;/a&gt; (originally $1,459). Additionally, this laptop features a 15.6-inch 1080p screen with a 165Hz refresh rate, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and a 512GB NVMe SSD (both the RAM and storage are user-upgradeable). I can’t hide that I’m pretty excited about this deal, partially because I don’t know how much longer it will last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3o0Go"&gt;If you’re interested in buying a gaming laptop that doesn’t cost too much but want one that has a respectable graphics card, consider this one. Its RTX 3060 supports up to 115W of total graphics power — the same power you’ll find in the much more expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22518545/alienware-m15-r5-ryzen-edition-review-7-5800h-nvidia-rtx-3060-features-specs-performance"&gt;Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition&lt;/a&gt; that currently sells for $1,372. With it, games like &lt;em&gt;Red Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; ran faster than 60 frames per second on ultra graphics settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wWHO07"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10634452"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="XPpvpa"&gt;
&lt;p id="P8MU9y"&gt;Sony’s last-gen WH-1000XM3 over-ear, wireless headphones are discounted at Best Buy. Originally $349, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743780474724360893#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;they’re $200&lt;/a&gt;. We featured a similar deal recently that saw them at $10 cheaper, but this isn’t a bad deal if you have an eye out for headphones with great sound quality and a very effective noise cancellation effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HH32Qa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326538"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8BifuY"&gt;
&lt;p id="dlZ4yY"&gt;The Master &amp;amp; Dynamic MW07 were a tough sell for their original $299 price back in late 2018, but &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-13142092?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fmaster-dynamic-mw07-true-wireless-earphones-15%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_2_46" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Woot has them new for just $115&lt;/a&gt;. These aren’t the most capable truly wireless earphones you can buy in terms of features, but they have a unique look, a cozy fit, decent noise isolation, and sound quality that likely outpaces most competition at the $115 price range. They come in a shiny case that’s reminiscent of the backside of old iPods.  Similarly, it’s prone to scratching and collecting fingerprints, but it looks distinguished, at least.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Full approval could make the difference for the US COVID-19 vaccine campaign   </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Covid-19 Vaccinations in USA" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M5s4yRv0Li2UagRr6bSuZlTuJ_Q=/134x0:4967x3222/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69533609/1301632521.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qbVrdI"&gt;Right now, anyone rolling up their sleeve for a COVID-19 vaccine in the United States is supposed to get a &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144414/download"&gt;long information sheet&lt;/a&gt;. The document informs them that, even though the vaccine can prevent COVID-19, it’s technically not yet approved in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrIrZx"&gt;Instead, people are getting the shot under an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22189236/fda-approval-authorization-difference-clearance-vaccines"&gt;emergency use authorization&lt;/a&gt; (EUA) — a designation that let the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sign off on the lifesaving immunizations without going through the long, onerous licensing process. The shots still went through a rigorous safety review, and there’s ample evidence that they’re highly effective. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iSUHaN"&gt;But for some people, the “emergency” tag and the fact that the shots are still unapproved is a reason to avoid getting vaccinated. &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/poll-finding/kff-covid-19-vaccine-monitor-june-2021/"&gt;New polling&lt;/a&gt; from the Kaiser Family Foundation released Wednesday shows that around a third of unvaccinated adults in the United States would be more likely to get vaccinated when the FDA gives a full approval to the shots. About 35 percent of adults in the United States are currently unvaccinated — a third of that group would be around 10 percent of US adults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="6y4wPM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m58tHt"&gt;A 10 percent bump in the number of US adults who are vaccinated would be significant, especially as the Delta variant of the coronavirus takes hold across the country. The variant is highly contagious, and it is &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/michael-brown-europe-coronavirus-pandemic-coronavirus-vaccine-science-e1379d34d3cdff0f522e0915b0f246fe"&gt;easily burning through&lt;/a&gt; communities where most people aren’t vaccinated. In Missouri, for example, counties with low vaccination rates are seeing spikes in COVID-19 hospital admissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zu8yGX"&gt;Experts cautioned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21266591/covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-fda-authorize-emergency-experimental"&gt;last summer&lt;/a&gt; that the emergency use of a COVID-19 vaccine, even if it was the best way to beat back the pandemic, could lead to some vaccine hesitancy. The limited data they had back then looked bad — only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21266591/covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-fda-authorize-emergency-experimental"&gt;around 8 percent&lt;/a&gt; of people said in 2009 they’d take a hypothetical emergency H1N1 vaccine. People proved far less reluctant to take an emergency COVID-19 vaccine, but some clearly still have reservations. And each person who avoids the COVID-19 vaccine is a weakness in the US protection against the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a4sMWm"&gt;The FDA is currently reviewing applications for full approval of both the Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines, but it’s not clear when the final license for either might be released. While we wait, public health officials are still using every tool at their disposal to encourage more people to get vaccinated, like lotteries and convenient mobile clinics. Full approval will likely be a big boost for vaccination numbers, but Delta is here already — and there’s no time to waste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATIaVh"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week. &lt;/p&gt;

The findings suggest that people could be protected from COVID-19 for years. (Apoorva Mandavilli / &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="grbPRu"&gt;Perspectives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NgfJTi"&gt;As the national government doled out limited amounts of oxygen, officials in Delhi grew increasingly worried. Its hospitals had built only one small oxygen-generating plant because there had previously been little need, said Manish Sisodia, Delhi’s deputy chief minister. And Delhi could store only about one day’s worth of its pandemic needs at its hospitals and in a city-owned tank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8adCCj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;— &lt;/strong&gt;a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/28/world/asia/india-coronavirus-oxygen.html?smtyp=cur&amp;amp;smid=tw-nytimes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; traced the cascade of failures that lead to oxygen supplies running out at hospitals in India&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vSsQFo"&gt;Something special happens when you marathon horror movies. On their own, slasher flicks like &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Halloween&lt;/em&gt; can seem like nothing more than bloody fun. But when you watch a bunch in a row, the connections and mythologies become much more apparent; Jason Voorhees shifts from a murderous demon into something more sympathetic. Some of them even feature “previously on” segments to make these links more obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xc4Z2F"&gt;These movies may not have been created with binge-watching in mind, but in many ways they benefit from it, which is part of what makes the &lt;em&gt;Fear Street&lt;/em&gt; trilogy on Netflix so interesting: it was designed to be binged. All three entries, starting with part one on July 2nd, will be released over the course of three weeks. It’s a unique experiment with changing viewing habits, and one that feels uniquely suited to horror as a genre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABra2V"&gt;The films are based loosely on the R.L. Stine books of the same name, following a town called Shadyside that’s been haunted for centuries, cursed by periodic — and grisly — killings that have earned it a reputation as the murder capital of the US. The movies track this history across three time periods. Part one is set in 1994, followed by 1978 and 1666. Though they tell individual stories, they’re all tightly connected to the Shadyside mythos. You’ll definitely want to watch them in order.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Fear Street" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zf5uXpZW79fuuQ2_p-d4tYVNWFY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694120/Fear_Street_Part_1__1994_00_49_16_17_R.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YTJ61D"&gt;The 1994 movie starts, as many horror movies do, with a young woman being killed. From there, you learn that the town of Shadyside has long been haunted by a dead witch named Sarah Fier (pronounced “Fear,” naturally) and that, every so often, someone goes on a murderous rampage, apparently due to her influence. The vibe is sort of like &lt;em&gt;Scream&lt;/em&gt; crossed with the &lt;em&gt;Chilling Adventures of Sabrina&lt;/em&gt;, as a group of misfit high school students work together to learn about Fier and end the killings once and for all. (You can get a sense of the first movie &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22558138/netflix-fear-street-movie-1994-first-five-minutes"&gt;by watching the first five minutes here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70bAaT"&gt;It has all of the hallmarks of a slasher movie — inventively grisly deaths, single-minded killers that never give up, gratuitous sex scenes — but it’s buoyed by the hint of a deeper mystery. I won’t spoil anything, but the way the first movie connects to the sequels makes them ideal for close viewing. When I finished part one, I immediately had to know what happened next. And even though each one has a very different vibe — part two takes place at a summer retreat reminiscent of &lt;em&gt;Friday the 13th&lt;/em&gt;’s Camp Crystal Lake, while the third goes back a few centuries to the early days of Shadyside — they all feel part of the same whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pLNYJM"&gt;According to Netflix, the three movies were filmed over a 108-day period in Atlanta, which was preceded by a month-long writers’ room to nail down the story and the way it would connect each film. “Everyone involved in production knew this was crazy,” Leigh Janiak, who directed all three movies, explained in a statement. “I didn’t realize how crazy and weird it was until I got into post-production and was like, these are three completely different movies.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="fear street" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CbHOnG62VVmfYS3T0_pXOOQkYKQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22694128/Fear_Street_Part_1_1994_A226C002_190503_R2QE_1.368.1_r_rgb.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BJj1hm"&gt;Ever since Netflix started to dabble in original programming, there have been countless debates about how and when episodic stories should be released on streaming services. Netflix typically drops new seasons of its big shows, like &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;, all at once, so viewers can watch at their leisure. Disney, meanwhile, tends to go the weekly route, so you have to wait to see what happens next on &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538210/disney-plus-wednesday-friday-release-schedule-loki"&gt;Disney even recently shifted to experimenting with Wednesday releases instead of Friday&lt;/a&gt;.) There are benefits to both; binging gives fans what they want immediately, while weekly releases help a show stay in the spotlight for longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYCdCK"&gt;Up until now, though, that conversation has never really involved movies. &lt;em&gt;Fear Street&lt;/em&gt; represents something new in that regard, and it’s the kind of experiment that could only really work in the world of streaming. What might otherwise be a gone-and-forgotten horror flick is now more of a summer movie event. After part one debuts on July 2nd, two and three will follow on the 9th and 16th. The releases are close enough that you won’t forget what happens in between, but also spread out so that the trilogy has its own prolonged moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmYGta"&gt;As with all experiments, it’s unclear if this is a one-off event or the beginnings of a trend. It’s unlikely that Marvel will do something similar for its next superhero epic; blockbuster movies are challenging and expensive enough to make already, without having to worry about doing several at once. But for lower-stakes genre films, such as horror, it makes a lot more sense. And, at least in the case of &lt;em&gt;Fear Street&lt;/em&gt;, the release strategy actually improves the viewing experience — a new technique to breathe life into an old genre.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>General Motors strikes a deal to source lithium in the US for its electric car batteries </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Salton Sea In California Faces Ecological Collapse" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CmOufuVIBPzoM5U64xMxG9he81M=/2x0:5407x3603/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69533503/1231148258.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JSPWok"&gt;General Motors has struck a deal with a mining company to source lithium, a key ingredient in electric-car batteries, from geothermal deposits in the US. The automaker is making a “multi-million dollar” investment in Australia’s &lt;a href="https://www.cthermal.com/"&gt;Controlled Thermal Resources&lt;/a&gt; (CTR) to bolster the mining firm’s efforts to extract lithium from California’s Salton Sea Geothermal Field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yuQtC9"&gt;It’s a risky bet by GM, given that there is no full-scale lithium production in the US from geothermal wells. Most of the world’s lithium comes from two places: lithium brine deposits in South America’s “lithium triangle” of Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia; and hard-rock deposits in Australia. But its a sign that GM is trying to think holistically about the challenge of becoming an EV-only company by 2035. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IwmWVO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s a risky bet by GM&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k8XSml"&gt;CTR’s “direct extraction” process will have a “very small physical footprint” that produces very few carbon emissions, said Tim Grewe, general director electrification strategy and cell engineering at GM. Electric vehicle batteries can use lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide, but the industry typically talks of lithium carbonate equivalent, which contains both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sn7y8Q"&gt;“Lithium is a crucial metal to make these affordable high mileage electric vehicles in our future,” Grewe said. “We’re gonna have the first rights for the lithium produced out of this project.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xf5bU"&gt;GM said a “significant amount” of the lithium it needs for its EV batteries will come from CTR’s “Hell’s Kitchen” development site in the Salton Sea Geothermal Field, located in Imperial, California. The California Energy Commission &lt;a href="https://ww2.energy.ca.gov/2020publications/CEC-500-2020-020/CEC-500-2020-020.pdf"&gt;estimates the area could produce 600,000 tons of lithium carbonate&lt;/a&gt; annually, worth $7.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrKRbm"&gt;“It’s the single largest lithium brine resource in the United States, if not on the planet… It will be a critical hub,” Rod Colwell, CEO of CTR, &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2021/06/11/lithium-electric-cars-extraction-green-brine-geothermal/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2O5nSb"&gt;There won’t be an immediate payoff for GM’s investment, the size of which the company declined to disclose. The first stage of CTR’s project is not expected to yield lithium until 2024. But Grewe said GM will try to synthesize the lithium for its batteries as “quickly as it can, trying to beat [2024]” if possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dsEZqO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The race to find new and environmentally friendly sources of lithium in California has been called a “white go&lt;s&gt;&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/s&gt;ld rush”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kgTcmU"&gt;The race to find new and environmentally friendly sources of lithium in California has been called a &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/28/990867075/californias-white-gold-rush-lithium-in-demand-amid-surge-in-electric-vehicles"&gt;“white gold rush,”&lt;/a&gt; with companies intent on producing millions of electric vehicle batteries looking to secure a piece of the process. This rising demand has also triggered &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/shortages-flagged-ev-materials-lithium-cobalt-2021-07-01/"&gt;concerns about shortages&lt;/a&gt;, with analysts forecasting deficits in the tens of thousands of tons by 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JPner"&gt;CTR isn’t the first company to try to find a cost-effective way to pull the mineral from the naturally heated waters deep beneath the Salton Sea. One recent example was Simbol Materials, a much-hyped start-up that collapsed in 2015 shortly after Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.desertsun.com/story/tech/science/energy/2016/06/08/tesla-offered-325-million-salton-sea-startup/84913572/"&gt;offered to buy the firm&lt;/a&gt; for $325 million. (Tesla has since said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21452436/tesla-battery-day-reaction-elon-musk-questions-lithium-mining"&gt;mine its own lithium&lt;/a&gt; from clay deposits in Nevada.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hb0m6G"&gt;“I’d say the main concerns around lithium extraction from geothermal brines are mostly economic,” said Chris Berry, president of House Mountain Partners and an analyst who focuses on energy metals supply chains. “Investors want to see proven economics before writing big checks to develop projects and battery manufacturers want to see proof of scalable production of battery grade lithium before entering into binding off-take agreements.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XIIzJP"&gt;But GM sees the risk worth taking. “It is very difficult,” Grewe said. “It has to cover all of our built in quality metrics that we have at General Motors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uKurd5"&gt;The automaker recently announced that it would spend &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536601/gm-ev-investment-increase-amount-electric-autonomous-vehicles"&gt;$35 billion through 2025&lt;/a&gt; on the development of electric and autonomous vehicles. That includes the construction of two new battery facilities in the US. GM is positioning itself to be the largest manufacturer of EVs in North America, much like it already is for gas-powered vehicles. The automaker has previously said that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;it hopes to only make zero-emission light-duty vehicles by 2035&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft warns of Windows ‘PrintNightmare’ vulnerability that’s being actively exploited</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CO7Zc7_W1iKZZqRh9BPeVcriFg4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69533180/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2lvTar"&gt;Microsoft is warning Windows users about an unpatched critical flaw in the Windows Print Spooler service. The vulnerability, dubbed PrintNightmare, was uncovered earlier this week after security researchers accidentally published a proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit. While Microsoft hasn’t rated the vulnerability, it allows attackers to remotely execute code with system-level privileges, which is as critical and problematic as you can get in Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3OKmz"&gt;Researchers at Sangfor &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/edwardzpeng/status/1409810304091889669"&gt;published the PoC&lt;/a&gt;, in what appears to have been a mistake, or a miscommunication between the researchers and Microsoft. The test code was quickly deleted, but not before it had already been forked on GitHub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dRz3ob"&gt;Sangfor researchers had been &lt;a href="https://www.sangfor.com/en/info-center/blog-center/cyber-security/two-sangfor-security-research-results-selected-at-black-hat-usa-2021"&gt;planning to detail&lt;/a&gt; multiple 0-day vulnerabilities in the Windows Print Spooler service at the annual Black Hat security conference later this month. It appears the researchers thought Microsoft had patched this particular vulnerability, after the company published patches for a separate Windows Print Spooler flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SpSiMx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The vulnerability is being actively exploited&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HvPmGH"&gt;It has taken Microsoft a couple of days to finally issue an alert about the 0-day, and &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/microsoft-shares-mitigations-for-windows-printnightmare-zero-day-bug/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleepingcomputer &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that the company is even warning customers that it’s being actively exploited. The vulnerability allows attackers to use remote code execution, so bad actors could potentially install programs, modify data, and create new accounts with full admin rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nw7yI0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-34527"&gt;Microsoft admits&lt;/a&gt; “the code that contains the vulnerability is in all versions of Windows,” but it’s not clear if it’s exploitable beyond server versions of Windows. The Print Spooler service runs by default on Windows, including on client versions of the OS, Domain Controllers, and many Windows Server instances, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ysbLaN"&gt;Microsoft is working on a patch, but until it’s available the company recommends disabling the Windows Print Spooler service (if that’s an option for businesses), or disabling inbound remote printing through Group Policy. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) &lt;a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2021/06/30/printnightmare-critical-windows-print-spooler-vulnerability"&gt;has recommended&lt;/a&gt; that admins “disable the Windows Print Spooler service in Domain Controllers and systems that do not print.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBW5py"&gt;Vulnerabilities in the Windows Print Spooler service have been a headache for system administrators for years. The most infamous example was the Stuxnet virus. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/12/2944329/stuxnet-computer-virus-planted-israeli-agent-iran"&gt;Stuxnet used&lt;/a&gt; multiple 0-day exploits, including a Windows Print Spooler flaw, to destroy several Iranian nuclear centrifuges more than a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;
