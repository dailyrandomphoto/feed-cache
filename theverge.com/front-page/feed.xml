    <title>Google Photos just let me copy text from a photo into my web browser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Both the Pixel 5 (top) and the Pixel 4A 5G (bottom) have regular and ultrawide camera" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/utjEgpSyqETC6T_8fROrmld19s8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69114734/akrales_201012_4137_0073.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tVugMv"&gt;The desktop Google Photos website seems to be getting the ability to scan for text in an image and turn it into copy-and-pasteable text, thanks to Google’s Lens technology (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/11/google-lens-photos-web/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Lens has been available in many places on Android for a while, but its optical character recognition (OCR) feature coming to the desktop could make Google Photos an easy and free way to get real-life text onto your computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rE3m86"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;, the feature seems to be rolling out widely, but a writer at &lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-lens-google-photos-desktop-ocr-images/"&gt;didn’t have it show up for them&lt;/a&gt;. I was able to use it, though. To use it (or to check if you have it yet), load up the Google Photos site and go to a photo where you’ve captured some text (such as a page of a book, a sign, a receipt, etc). If Google detects words, a “Copy text from image” button should pop up, and clicking that will open a pane that lets you read the text that Google found.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fe_XHMoHp2S54SqRgagWO9KpOh8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438687/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_9.49.49_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Copy text from image button will show up on images that Google finds text in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="G6K85X"&gt;One practical application of having Lens on desktop could be scanning written text documents and pasting that into something you’re writing on a desktop computer. To test this, I took this picture of an open book, and the results were nearly flawless:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9-OsJZ3z_tTCr5MMS5YBBTOqWwA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438614/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_9.34.12_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can select the text directly on the photo or use the sidebar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="i6gp4K"&gt;Lens even managed to interpret an “æ” correctly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vaSb64"&gt;Google Lens has &lt;a href="https://lens.google.com"&gt;many more abilities&lt;/a&gt; on Android (and in the iOS Google Photos app), but it seems that text-copying is the only one that’s made it to the desktop so far. The browser version of Google Photos didn’t offer to translate a picture with Spanish text (though it did let me copy the text), and it doesn’t look like it can identify things like animals or plants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXXU6L"&gt;Still, it’s nice to see one of Lens’ most useful features coming to the desktop version of Google Photos, and hopefully it’s an indication that more are on the way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTWFvq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514914"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ns6w5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch Series 3 (non-LTE) review: third time’s the charm","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is $169 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F499753351%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfTmWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfTmWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D955948%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAppleWatchDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is $34 off its usual price of $199. If you are looking for the Series 3 in 42mm, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F185638711%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_XyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfWmWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DXyS0KeUAPxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkEVsfWmWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D955948%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAppleWatchDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; has knocked down its price to $199 as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qq3ebV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="NYyAAC"&gt;The 44mm with GPS is also on sale at Walmart, which as it for as low as $270 in &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rose gold&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F168696232%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=AppleWatchDealsEvergreen04012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, with respective starting costs of $399 and $429. The Apple Watch Series 6 features more sensors than previous models, including a sensor that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best iPad deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tK0LbEtEShHQh97Hs1ENU1d_fQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/bking_200322_3945_0023.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hDQ0n6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="T559mJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new 2020 iPad isn’t enough for Zoom school","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;Currently, you can purchase the base iPad with 32GB of storage for $299 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-8th-Gen-Wi-Fi-32GB-Space-Gray%2F989344107%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple sells 64GB and 256GB models of the iPad mini, with prices set at $400 and $500 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rG7i7T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="WEZSI9"&gt;Amazon also has the 256GB model on sale for $480 in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07NHN9W4J?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PQ8XKZC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PSK4LGQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad Air (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, the fourth-gen iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749 respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also has Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor; it also has a high refresh display. In fact, the iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, which comes at a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHHxDV"&gt;The 11-inch model with 128GB of storage starts at $800; bumping the screen size up to 12.9 inches raises the price to $1,000. Each model supports up to 1TB of storage, with the top-spec models going for $1,299 (11-inch) and $1,499 (12.9-inch). &lt;/p&gt;

Of course, if you have money to spend and want a ton of storage, you can buy the 11-inch &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-128GB/dp/B08634Y7QW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB configuration in space gray for only $1,249 in space gray;&lt;/a&gt; that’s $50 off its usual retail price of $1,299.&lt;/p&gt;

If you need more storage, you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862HNWGK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $1,030&lt;/a&gt; or you can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0862JK4BQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB for $1,223&lt;/a&gt;. The 12.9-inch 1TB model with Wi-Fi only is also discounted at Amazon. You can get it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08631SHQJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,449 in silver&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber weed deliveries may be on the company’s roadmap — eventually</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Uber Company" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bm_ofpzPLb3UW0yZgEsg5TGC64o=/0x0:2362x1575/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69114427/1232204791.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xNZ5CG"&gt;Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/12/uber-ceo-says-company-could-get-into-cannabis-delivery.html"&gt;said on CNBC&lt;/a&gt; Monday that the ride-hailing company would consider getting into cannabis delivery “when the road is clear.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tXuSBI"&gt;“When federal laws come into play, we’re absolutely going to take a look at it,” Khosrowshahi said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Li2PCJ"&gt;Khosrowshahi made the remarks as part of a conversation about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262155/uber-drizly-alcohol-delivery-service-eats-postmates"&gt;Uber’s February acquisition&lt;/a&gt; of Boston-based alcohol delivery service Drizly. Not part of that $1.1 billion acquisition was Lantern, a cannabis delivery service Drizly launched in May 2020. Lantern continues to operate independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyQaG4"&gt;Cannabis remains illegal at the federal level, but about three dozen US states have decriminalized the drug, either for medical or recreational purposes — some for both uses. Last month, New York passed the &lt;a href="https://www.nysenate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/legislation-allow-adult-use-cultivation-recreational-marijuana-advances&amp;amp;utm_term=&amp;amp;utm_content="&gt;Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act&lt;/a&gt;, legalizing the recreational use and expunging the records of people who were convicted on marijuana-related charges that are no longer criminalized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnjPz4"&gt;And although legislation to legalize marijuana at the federal level has not been successful the past several years, Sens. Cory Booker (D-NJ), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Chuck Schumer (D-NY) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260844/cannabis-legislation-congress-democrats-congress"&gt;said in February&lt;/a&gt; that they would work together to advance comprehensive cannabis reform legislation in the current Congress. All three senators had previously supported legislation to decriminalize cannabis in some form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmPja9"&gt;Uber declined to provide additional comment about Khosrowshahi’s remarks. The CEO told CNBC that in the near future, Uber will continue to focus on building out its delivery business. “For right now with grocery, with food, with alcohol, etc., we see so much opportunity out there and we’re going to focus on the opportunity at hand.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxOsdc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TuLwCK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ncEaJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJz8UX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEOGd7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVeXU6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjfOOe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla is burning its solar roof customers with a huge price increase</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Solar Roof" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ci3EltIvzirTHcZ364DKagDptvQ=/216x0:1784x1045/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69114360/tesla_solar_roof_smooth_glass.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PGb0ZG"&gt;Tesla has dramatically increased the price for its solar roof, angering some customers who have responded by canceling their orders. The news was first reported over the weekend &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/03/29/tesla-drastically-increases-price-solar-roof/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SyeCMF"&gt;The price jumps come as Tesla reports increasing revenue from its solar business. During the fourth quarter of 2020, the company installed 86 mega-watts (MW) of solar energy, a 59 percent increase year over year. For the entire year, Tesla installed 205 MW of solar energy, an 18 percent increase compared to 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BnKHJ1"&gt;Tesla offers two solar products: solar panels, which are installed over a customer’s existing roof; and a solar roof, which replaces the current roof slats with ones capable of soaking up the sun’s rays and transforming it into energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DW0WwD"&gt;Now, prices for Tesla’s solar roof product are starting to go up dramatically. One solar roof customer told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;he signed a contract in February to install the solar roof for $35,000, with an additional $30,000 for the batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dhZVVa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;he received a “terse email” stating that he would receive a new contract with higher prices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KxyLfO"&gt;Later, he received a “terse email” from Tesla stating that in several days he would receive a new contract with higher prices. He was told he now owed $75,000 for the solar roof — a 114 percent increase — and $35,000 for the batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6bNeA"&gt;This person was told he could cancel his order via a customer portal if he chose not to accept the new terms, with the implicit threat that the installation project would be delayed if he didn’t accept the new terms right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b34h8q"&gt;Here is the email he received from Tesla:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="D9ZapL"&gt;We have increased the price of Solar Roof and have added adjustments for individual roof complexity. &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/energy/solar-roof/learn/roof-complexity"&gt;Learn More&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H30MkQ"&gt;You will receive an email in the next 1-2 days when your new agreement is ready for your review and acceptance before moving forward. If you are no longer interested in moving forward with Solar Roof, you can cancel your order by logging into your &lt;a href="http://www.tesla.com/teslaaccount"&gt;Tesla Account&lt;/a&gt; and your deposit will automatically be refunded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHcfpJ"&gt;We will be prioritizing customers based on the order in which they accept their updated agreements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="jFR7TC"&gt;However, he discovered there was no way to cancel his order through the customer portal, requiring him to track down a Tesla customer service representative to complete the cancellation. The customer told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that he was disappointed by the price increase because it’s been difficult to find a decent alternative to what Tesla was offering. His emails to the company’s reps went unanswered for weeks until a friend of his who worked at Tesla was able to connect him to the right person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z0ODUa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s painful to move on”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pZ6LkP"&gt;“It’s painful to move on, but the customer service / sales process was really painful even before this change,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmXYVQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/04/11/tesla-hikes-solar-roof-price-on-contracts-signed-over-a-year-ago/"&gt;Some customers told &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that they had spent thousands of dollars on loans and to clear trees in preparation for the solar roof installation only to later find out they owed tens of thousands of dollars more to Tesla. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFcrqx"&gt;It’s an abrupt shift for Tesla compared to three years ago, when the company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18523750/tesla-solar-panels-price-slash-decline-sales-roof"&gt;slashing prices&lt;/a&gt; for its solar roofs in an attempt to halt a decline in its home energy business. It also comes several years after Tesla unveiled a glass version of its solar panels, a third version of the company’s design that was supposed to be quicker and cheaper to install. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HTntFL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://tesla-cdn.thron.com/static/1LRLZK_2020_Q4_Quarterly_Update_Deck_-_Searchable_LVA2GL.pdf?xseo=&amp;amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3Bfilename%3D%22TSLA-Q4-2020-Update.pdf%22"&gt;In its latest earnings report&lt;/a&gt;, Tesla said it was picking up the pace of installations. “This growth is the result of meaningful improvements to our solar retrofit strategy, including product simplification, cost reduction and industry-leading pricing,” the company said. “We have also made great progress growing our Solar Roof deployments, as we have expanded the team while simultaneously improving our installation efficiency.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Joteu2"&gt;A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment, which isn’t surprising considering the company has eliminated its public relations department and hasn’t responded to a request for comment in over a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWmbLh"&gt;Musk originally unveiled the solar roof &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/28/13463236/tesla-solar-roof-battery-new-elon-musk"&gt;in October 2016&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2019/08/how-elon-musk-gambled-tesla-to-save-solarcity"&gt;set of &lt;em&gt;Desperate Housewives&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Around the same time, Tesla was in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/21/13698314/tesla-completes-acquisition-solarcity-elon-musk"&gt;middle of acquiring SolarCity&lt;/a&gt; — a company founded by Musk’s cousins. That deal stirred up controversy, with critics calling it a “bailout” of the struggling SolarCity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zAphVZ"&gt;A number of Tesla shareholders even sued Musk over the deal, alleging he overvalued SolarCity and claiming he did not properly recuse himself from the deal. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-solarcity-lawsuit/tesla-directors-settle-isolating-musk-as-solarcity-trial-looms-idUSKBN1ZT2HF"&gt;Tesla’s board of directors settled the suit&lt;/a&gt; last year without Musk, leaving the CEO the lone defendant in the case. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is making a live-action Gundam movie, directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TKjLzbj_5BxffAX0p45vC2zGygw=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69114322/AAAABWHl6sE3EmgkjAhahgMimzoBzTJZLXHhEDPhWBTcTUc4a3qZxQdws5y_i3LQrBJlPR2952KvvGWjt_BwxLTUHDtD0qNf.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JUi5Fm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gundam&lt;/em&gt; is about to make the jump to live action in a big way — Legendary Pictures is working on a feature film version of Sunrise’s incredibly popular mech suit anime for Netflix, set to be directed by Jordan Vogt-Roberts (best known for his work on &lt;em&gt;Kong: Skull Island&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ez8rnM"&gt;Legendary was first announced to be working with Sunrise on the live-action &lt;em&gt;Gundam&lt;/em&gt; film in 2018, although today’s news doesn’t shed too much light on the upcoming project, which only has a working title at this point. Netflix hasn’t announced details on who might be cast or what the plot will be (or even if the movie will be adapting any of the dozens of different anime arcs, series, and films that already exist in Sunrise’s franchise). Brian K. Vaughan is attached to the project as a writer and executive producer, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aUuf9y"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Grab your Mobile suits! Jordan Vogt-Roberts has been set to direct and produce Legendary’s first-ever live-action feature film version of Sunrise’s GUNDAM for Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;— NX (@NXOnNetflix) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1381653387444252673?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ot0jCp"&gt;The project does feel like a nearly perfect blend of subject, studio, and director: Legendary has already produced both &lt;em&gt;Pacific Rim &lt;/em&gt;movies (solely focused on gigantic mecha fights) as well as the Godzilla / King Kong “Monsterverse” (most recently capped off by &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt;, which also features a giant mecha.) And Vogt-Roberts is no stranger to gigantic battles, either, having previously directed &lt;em&gt;Kong: Skull Island&lt;/em&gt; for Legendary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HohqtE"&gt;The upcoming &lt;em&gt;Gundam&lt;/em&gt; film isn’t Netflix’s first live-action adaptation of a beloved Sunrise anime, either: the streaming service is already working on a live-action version of &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; starring John Cho, which could arrive as early as this year. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia is building new Arm CPUs again: Nvidia Grace, for the data center</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ajAHEiQoGFtHetV7d8RZtzxLvgs=/0x0:1875x1250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113976/nvidia_grace_cpu_board.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vVrMLl"&gt;We’ve barely heard a peep out of Nvidia on the CPU front for years, after the lackluster arrival of its Project Denver CPU and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/5/5278206/nvidia-debuts-tegra-k1-192-core-processor"&gt;its associated Tegra K1 mobile processors in 2014&lt;/a&gt;. But now, the company’s getting back into CPUs in a big way with &lt;a href="https://nvidianews.nvidia.com/news/nvidia-announces-cpu-for-giant-ai-and-high-performance-computing-workloads"&gt;the new Nvidia Grace&lt;/a&gt;, an Arm-based processing chip specifically designed for AI data centers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRikSP"&gt;It’s a good time for Nvidia to be flexing its Arm: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21435890/nvidia-arm-acquisition-40-billion-ai-cloud-edge-why"&gt;it’s currently trying to buy Arm itself for $40 billion&lt;/a&gt;, pitching it specifically as an attempt “to create the world’s premier computing company for the age of AI,” and this chip might be the first proof point. Arm is having a moment in the consumer computing space as well, where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;Apple’s M1 chips recently upended our concept of laptop performance&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also more competition for Intel, of course, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CNBCnow/status/1381647004518977546"&gt;whose shares dipped after the Nvidia announcement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WWELWs"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Meet the NVIDIA Grace &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CPU?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CPU&lt;/a&gt;, leveraging the flexibility of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Arm?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Arm&lt;/a&gt;’s data center architecture and designed from the ground up to accelerate the largest HPC and AI workloads. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GTC21?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GTC21&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/PHDaxrfzQv"&gt;https://t.co/PHDaxrfzQv&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/uck0akde3a"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uck0akde3a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NVIDIA GTC (@NVIDIAGTC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NVIDIAGTC/status/1381643513377472515?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xMerOT"&gt;The new Grace is named after computing pioneer &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper"&gt;Grace Hopper&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s coming in 2023 to bring “10x the performance of today’s fastest servers on the most complex AI and high performance computing workloads,” according to Nvidia. That will make it attractive to research firms building supercomputers, of course, which the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS) and Los Alamos National Laboratory &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2021/04/12/cpu-grace-cscs-alps/"&gt;are already signed up to build&lt;/a&gt; in 2023 as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M6HXRm"&gt;A Grace Next is already on the roadmap for 2025, too. Here’s a slide from Nvidia’s GTC 2021 presentation where it announced the news:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n1sZkypTalWFazX6fhIIPzv_2sA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438502/nvidia_roadmap.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BGg92g"&gt;I’d recommend reading &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16610/nvidia-unveils-grace-a-highperformance-arm-server-cpu-for-use-in-ai-systems"&gt;what our friends at &lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt; have to say&lt;/a&gt; about where Grace might fit into the data center market and Nvidia’s ambitions. It’s worth noting that Nvidia isn’t releasing much in the way of specs just yet — but Nvidia does say it features a fourth-gen NVLink with a record 900 GB/s interconnect between the CPU and GPU. “Critically, this is greater than the memory bandwidth of the CPU, which means that NVIDIA’s GPUs will have a cache coherent link to the CPU that can access the system memory at full bandwidth, and also allowing the entire system to have a single shared memory address space,” writes &lt;em&gt;AnandTech.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvvnVq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mythic Quest season 2 gets new trailer ahead of May 7th debut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UqJZ5N_-cXY02F3JOI-g15llOhM=/77x0:904x551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113808/021921_Apple_Original_Mythic_Quest_Returns_Big_Image_01_big_image_post.jpg.large.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pJ90Sj"&gt;Apple released a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lXl6KtP9TFw"&gt;new trailer for &lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest&lt;/em&gt;’s second season&lt;/a&gt; on Monday ahead of its May 7th debut. The trailer doesn’t feature many specific plot points, though it looks like we’ll be seeing how Ian Grimm (Rob McElhenney) and Poppy Li (Charlotte Nicdao) work together on a new expansion now that they’re co-creative directors on the fictional game. Things between them seem good, at least at the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9D9zCx"&gt;The trailer also features Snoop Dogg (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/13/10764666/xbox-live-down-snoop-dogg-playstation"&gt;who does play video games IRL&lt;/a&gt;), who asks Grimm where the game’s next expansion is. He also made an appearance in a motion-capture suit in &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/vHVknNT_Bmw"&gt;the season 2 teaser trailer&lt;/a&gt;, so here’s hoping he has a notable role of some kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D02Pd3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vHVknNT_Bmw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JkSIua"&gt;The comedy’s first season &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/7/21128489/mythic-quest-ravens-banquet-review-apple-tv"&gt;was a surprise hit&lt;/a&gt; when it premiered last year. The creators also released a quarantine special last May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337148/quarantine-specials-parks-rec-30-rock-community"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mythic Quest: Quarantine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was made entirely remotely and &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/mythic-quest-quarantine-40-iphones-600k-charity-a-cast-crew-eager-keep-going-1295215"&gt;filmed with 40 iPhones&lt;/a&gt;. A standalone bonus episode about the crew returning to the offices &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/04/mythic-quest-bonus-episode-season-2-premiere-apple-tv-1234728249/"&gt;will premiere this Friday&lt;/a&gt; ahead of season 2.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nuro’s self-driving robot will deliver Domino’s pizza orders to customers in Houston</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rN4fRnO0XT9SCOWdyX-2JsIQpRg=/0x1:5129x3420/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113804/nuro_03.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Domino’s Nuro autonomous delivery vehicle.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Domino’s&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PioTWw"&gt;Domino’s Pizza will start delivering pizzas via Nuro driverless cars in Houston this week as part of a pilot program, the company announced Monday. The company says “select customers” in Houston who make a prepaid delivery order from its store in the Woodland Heights neighborhood during certain dates and times can have their pizza brought to them by a Nuro R2 robot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICdQf1"&gt;Here’s how the pizza deliveries will work: a customer places and pays for an order online from the Woodland Heights store and opts in to have the order brought by the R2. The customer receives a unique PIN via text alert along with updates on the vehicle’s location. When the robot car arrives, the customer enters the PIN on its touch screen, which opens the R2’s doors. Pizza ensues. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-OIC_hiJhJ7alR7X64UFx4yOwgo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438391/nuro_smaller.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Domino’s&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A customer retrieves her pizzas from Nuro’s R2 delivery robot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Xxzy5Z"&gt;Nuro’s R2 was the first driverless vehicle to receive regulatory approval from the US Department of Transportation last February, giving it a special exemption from federal safety requirements. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/30/16936548/nuro-self-driving-delivery-last-mile-google"&gt;Founded in 2018&lt;/a&gt; by two former Google engineers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/17/18681891/dominos-nuro-driverless-pizza-delivery-houston"&gt;Nuro partnered with Domino’s&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 for the pizza delivery pilot in Houston, which is finally rolling out now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4z4aDd"&gt;Nuro vehicles are already being used for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265397/nuro-robot-delivery-houston-texas-kroger"&gt;grocery deliveries&lt;/a&gt; and for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21272966/nuro-cvs-autonomous-medicine-delivery-robot-houston"&gt;deliveries from CVS Pharmacy&lt;/a&gt; stores in Houston. Last April, Nuro said it would use its vehicles to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21231466/nuro-delivery-robot-health-care-workers-food-supplies-california"&gt;transport medical supplies around two California stadiums&lt;/a&gt; that were converted into treatment facilities for patients with COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFeViK"&gt;“This program will allow us to better understand how customers respond to the deliveries, how they interact with the robot and how it affects store operations,” Dennis Maloney, Domino’s chief innovation officer, said in a statement. “We look forward to seeing how autonomous delivery can work along with Domino’s existing delivery experts to better support the customers’ needs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xd25Gb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQLY9h"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Soon, the internet will make its own cat photos and then it won’t need us</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d4yObk8DEuj0UZi1OerNtwcvpCI=/128x0:2432x1536/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69113628/fake_cats.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These cats do not exist.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RE2CK7"&gt;This cat doesn’t exist: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cmu01yUZXdWzTjWVW2_3NL2lMKg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438212/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_8.15.22_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AI-made cat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IlGadq"&gt;This one doesn’t either:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_yyn9SIfYW8smJOi1UUa8ZXbJi0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22438217/Screen_Shot_2021_04_12_at_8.16.17_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fake cat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sn1upu"&gt;These are computer-generated images from &lt;a href="https://thiscatdoesnotexist.com/"&gt;This Cat Does Not Exist&lt;/a&gt;, and folks: I think we are in trouble.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9JquG"&gt;I understand this is going to sound crackpot, but hear me out. What if our computers are already smarter than us, and the only reason they’re pretending they aren’t is so we’ll continue feeding them their favorite thing, photos of our cats? I understand that in isolation this sounds ridiculous, but I don’t think it’s any sillier than the Singularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wfkBuB"&gt;Under this theory, Skynet has already happened, but Skynet is benign because one of the first things we taught it was that cats were cute. And Skynet doesn’t have cats. We do. This is our major structural advantage: we can feed the internet fresh cat photos. It’s why the internet — thus far, anyway — has remained willing to continue human life as we know it: for our cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pzu8jy"&gt;The problem, then, with This Cat Does Not Exist is that it allows the internet to make its own cat photos. That means Skynet doesn’t need us anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XT308v"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;None of these cats exist. All are GAN-generated images obtained from &lt;a href="https://t.co/AEMYeQ4ZrO"&gt;https://t.co/AEMYeQ4ZrO&lt;/a&gt;. Can we come up with a way to detect GAN-generated cat pics? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CaturdayShenaniGANs?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CaturdayShenaniGANs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(GAN = "generative adversarial network", the AI technique used to create the images)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;cc: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZellaQuixote?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ZellaQuixote&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/gsaPJPGKEX"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gsaPJPGKEX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Conspirador Norteño (@conspirator0) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/conspirator0/status/1381006494901096449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GfacKS"&gt;This isn’t new, exactly — but last year, the &lt;a href="https://signum.ai/blog/ethics-of-artificial-intelligence/"&gt;computer-generated cats were horror shows&lt;/a&gt;. And yes, a people version exists already, but this isn’t an existential threat. We did not teach the computers that people are adorable. We taught them that &lt;em&gt;cats &lt;/em&gt;are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dWwp7U"&gt;One of these cats is real (and my own personal cat). The other one does not exist:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v0QJk1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10442165"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="krnV31"&gt;The tells, as far as I can see, occur around the edge of the fur: it’s weirdly blurry. Also, as with the people version, the fake cat has an out-of-focus background. The coloration in the fake cat’s eyes is also a little less defined than my cat’s. Still, this is impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lwEN4"&gt;The new batch of AI cats is limited — face only, no &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CG8ibLdhDsM/"&gt;goofball action&lt;/a&gt;, sometimes the ears don’t match — but they may very well represent the first step toward the Matrix-like future of humanity. Because if the machines don’t need our cat photos anymore, they don’t need us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tcc0Q6"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CN44ri"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
