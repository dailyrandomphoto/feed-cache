    <title>SpaceX rocket debris creates a fantastic light show in the Pacific Northwest sky</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Footage of the debris from Cornelius, Oregon. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/Rasmusse007/status/1375303605356355586" target="_blank"&gt;Erik Rasmussen / @Rasmusse007&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Hfq9e"&gt;Stargazers in Oregon and Washington were treated to an unexpected show last night: what looked like a meteor shower streaking lazily across the night’s sky that was very likely the remains of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, burning up as it travelled through the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lnMcVg"&gt;Although SpaceX has not yet claimed responsibility for the spectacle, numerous meteorologists and astronomers ID’ed the lights in the sky as harmless rocket debris. (You can seen plenty of videos of the event in the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/planet4589/status/1375301028514500615"&gt;replies to this Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BH5tFz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“we got lucky and it came right over head.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7bnrrr"&gt;“We got a really good show tonight thanks to SpaceX,” James Davenport, an astronomer from the University of Washington, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ekJanB4cjUk"&gt;told NBC-affiliate &lt;em&gt;KING5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This was the top end, what we call the second stage, of a Falcon 9 rocket. It was actually launched about three weeks ago and it did exactly what it was supposed to do: it put satellites in orbit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykQarb"&gt;“The only failure it had was it didn’t complete its de-orbit burn, so it didn’t come down when and where we expected it. It’s just been waiting to fall for the last three weeks and we got lucky and it came right over head.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OfPwAh"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ekJanB4cjUk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DrGwYZ"&gt;The Falcon 9 is a partially reusable two-stage rocket. The first stage, housing nine of SpaceX’s Merlin engines, does the initial heavy lifting, getting the rocket off the ground, while the second stage, with just a single Merlin engine, guides it into a parking orbit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Keondh"&gt;The first stage can be steered back down to Earth, and it’s this section of the rocket you’ve probably seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/1/15489586/spacex-falcon-9-nrol-76-rocket-landing-success"&gt;safely&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/5/27/11787532/spacex-falcon-9-rocket-landing-success-sea-drone-ship"&gt;landing&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18127630/spacex-falcon-9-rocket-landing-failure-ground-cape-canaveral"&gt;or sometimes not&lt;/a&gt;!) on SpaceX’s drone ships. The second stage is usually left to decay in orbit or directed to burn up in the planet’s atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpdP2f"&gt;This particular launch &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-starlink-17-launch-success-8th-landing"&gt;took place on March 4th&lt;/a&gt;, putting another batch of SpaceX’s Starlink satellites into orbit, with the first stage of the rocket safely landing back on Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="SpaceX falcon 9 landing" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_F3UjKQRZPw6D9jr6HS53_Gym50=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/5846469/spacex-falcon-9-landing.0.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Falcon 9 rocket is constructed from two stages. The first can be safely landed back on Earth (as seen above) while the second is usually directed to disintegrate in the atmosphere. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vsO46H"&gt;Jonathan McDowell, an astronomer at the Center for Astrophysics, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/planet4589/status/1375324175620055043"&gt;tweeted a thread&lt;/a&gt; about the event, noting that this sort of debris re-entry is not uncommon. “This is the 14th piece of space junk with a mass over one tonne that has reentered since Jan 1st this year,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/planet4589/status/1375329641225981953"&gt;said McDowell&lt;/a&gt;. “In other words, about one a week. Plus lots more smaller bits of course.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eyeupo"&gt;McDowell notes that it can be tricky to predict the timing of these re-entries. The debris breaks up high in the atmosphere, around 40 miles or 60 kilometers above the ground — that’s well above the cruising altitude of commercial flights (around eight miles or 12 kilometers up). But the combination of headwinds in the Earth’s upper atmosphere and the speed of travel (the debris is moving at around 17,000 mph) make it difficult to predict exactly when and where re-entry will take place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i2iCh4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Falcon 9 second stage from the Mar 4 Starlink launch failed to make a deorbit burn and is now reentering after 22 days in orbit. Its reentry was observed from the Seattle area at about 0400 UTC Mar 26. &lt;a href="https://t.co/FQrBrUoBHh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/FQrBrUoBHh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jonathan McDowell (@planet4589) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/planet4589/status/1375301028514500615?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ex0lS4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;4)  But remember it's going 17000 mph, so a 5 hour  time uncertainty  means an 85,000 mile (53000 km) location uncertainty. That's more that one entire loop around the Earth. That's why we couldn't tell in advance that it would be the Seattle area that would see the reentry.&lt;/p&gt;— Jonathan McDowell (@planet4589) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/planet4589/status/1375325270236930052?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nyZa8V"&gt;The National Weather Service (NWS) of Seattle &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NWSSeattle/status/1375304832446173186"&gt;also identified&lt;/a&gt; the bright lights as debris from a Falcon 9 second stage. The NWS noted that the speed of such debris re-entry is much slower than that of meteor showers, which move at speeds greater than 45,000 mph. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITP393"&gt;Such re-entries are generally safe, with all rocket components and material burning up in the atmosphere. As Seattle’s NWS tweeted: “There are NO expected impacts on the ground in our region at this time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEJ0Y8"&gt;Right now, it seems like the only lasting effect will be a lot of fantastic footage like the video below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CO04eq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Anybody get any footage of that light in the sky over Salem?&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/meteor?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#meteor&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Meteora?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Meteora&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/7QYzN0ZW4U"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7QYzN0ZW4U&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dan Wright (@DanWrig42391786) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanWrig42391786/status/1375301612650983426?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Razer is actually making its concept RGB face mask</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/clCOEAucMemU7QFiBqCrIcwBvkc=/20x0:620x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69029337/razer_mask_smaller.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YXSvkp"&gt;Razer says it’s planning to ship its concept reusable N95 face mask. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22221344/razer-project-hazel-n95-respirator-mask-coronavirus-chroma-rgb-concept"&gt;Unveiled back in January&lt;/a&gt;, Project Hazel includes active disc-type ventilators, Chroma RGB lighting, and voice projection. The face mask is also transparent, allowing for lip-reading and the ability to see facial cues when you talk to people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5kSny2"&gt;“We were thinking, this is a concept project and is this going to be relevant when vaccinations and everything has been rolled out,” says Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan in an &lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/razer-confirms-its-concept-high-tech-face-mask-project-hazel-will-be-turned-into-reality-135826312.html"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Yahoo Finance&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We are going to proceed in making it a reality and ship the smart mask.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Project Hazel" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c3KjRX-efLPJe61wtmzLNC--d64=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228416/hazelhero.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s Project Hazel mask.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5nStOu"&gt;Razer’s smart mask made its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22221344/razer-project-hazel-n95-respirator-mask-coronavirus-chroma-rgb-concept"&gt;surprise debut at CES 2021&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, with detachable and rechargeable ventilators and a glossy outside shell made of waterproof and scratch-resistant recycled plastic. The ventilators also act as voice amplifiers, thanks to microphones embedded inside so you don’t sound muffled while speaking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WFxsyR"&gt;The Chroma RGB lighting allows the two ventilators to glow, and even automatically shine light onto your mouth when it gets dark, so others can see you speaking. It’s a smart mask that’s loaded with tech, but Razer insists that it’s comfortable to wear thanks to adjustable ear loops.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KR6GOMeCKt3NTuyN5VZqV75liN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399320/QTPjtwr.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8oNYY9"&gt;Razer hasn’t committed to any type of pricing or a release date, and the company will also need approvals and certifications from the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or Occupational Safety and Health Administration. That’s not stopping Razer from making this smart mask real, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pey7KZ"&gt;“Project Hazel is going to be a reality,” says Tan. “We are going to make it happen and I think we will all be, unfortunately, wearing masks for a long time to come.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube demonetizes David Dobrik’s channels over sexual assault allegations  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nickelodeon’s Kids’ Choice Awards 2021 - Show" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Eq-8Dsxzb54lspK9fpO5PmhzDc=/0x0:4485x2990/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69029317/1306933980.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Rich Fury/KCA2021/Getty Images for Nickelodeon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CgDDdk"&gt;YouTube has temporarily demonetized multiple David Dobrik channels after allegations of sexual assault were made against a former member of his Vlog Squad, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/youtube-demonetizing-david-dobrik-following-vlog-squad-scandal-2021-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Three of Dobrik’s channels have been demonetized; David Dobrik, David Dobrik Too, and the channel for his video podcast, Views. As well as Dobrik’s channels, YouTube has also demonetized Durte Dom, the personal channel of the ex-Vlog Squad member at the center of the allegations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfElQl"&gt;“We have strict policies that prohibit sexual harassment on YouTube and take allegations of sexual assault very seriously,” a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement. “We have temporarily suspended monetization on David Dobrik and Durte Dom channels for violating our Creator Responsibility policy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RgEN1j"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have strict policies that prohibit sexual harassment on YouTube and take allegations of sexual assault very seriously”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="47Y84t"&gt;The video platform is the latest organization to take action against Dobrik after the allegations emerged in &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; last week. In it, a woman featured in a 2018 vlog said that the former Vlog Squad member engaged in sexual activity with her while she was too drunk to consent. Footage from the night of the incident was later published in a since-removed YouTube video titled  “SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE PLAYED WITH FIRE!!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yyb00"&gt;In his &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB734hc89x8"&gt;most recent video&lt;/a&gt; addressing the controversy, Dobrik apologized for his role in the incident. “I want to apologize to her and her friends for ever putting them in an environment that I enabled that made them feel like their safety and values were compromised. I’m so sorry.” Dobrik also confirmed he took the decision to stop filming with the former Vlog Squad member in 2019. “I fully believe the woman,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sycRhp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/2021/3/23/22346231/david-dobrik-advertisers-assault-allegations-old-videos"&gt;More than a dozen advertisers&lt;/a&gt; have cut ties with Dobrik after the report emerged, including HelloFresh, EA Sports, Dollar Shave Club, and Facebook. Dobrik has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344171/david-dobrik-dispo-disposable-camera-app-cuts-ties"&gt;parted ways with disposable camera app Dispo&lt;/a&gt;, an app he co-founded in 2019, in light of the allegations. The app has lost investors including &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sparkcapital/status/1373855197064097794?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1373855197831720963%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F22%2F22344171%2Fdavid-dobrik-dispo-disposable-camera-app-cuts-ties"&gt;Spark Capital&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/david-dobriks-dispo-loses-another-investor-the-ceo-of-lime-2021-3?r=ts-sub"&gt;Lime CEO Wayne Ting&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s next batch of free PS4 and PS5 games is now available</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a_u8IAsok-nWoh1Az572Zgo-3AQ=/191x0:1712x1014/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69028679/48302575152_20b194477a_o.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yrk4Q0"&gt;Sony’s “&lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/category/83ccec1a-8c8e-4ef7-bb02-ba0fdf042e6c/1"&gt;Play at Home&lt;/a&gt;” initiative continues with a huge stack of excellent games, including &lt;em&gt;Astro Bot Rescue Mission &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Subnautica&lt;/em&gt;, that are free to own for a limited time. No PlayStation Plus membership is required, meaning you can keep these games forever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nS2gG1"&gt;From now through April 22nd at 11:59PM PT, the following titles will be free to claim for PS4 and PS5 users: &lt;em&gt;ABZÛ,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Enter the Gungeon&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Rez Infinite, Subnautica,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Astro Bot Rescue Mission&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Moss&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Thumper&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Paper Beast&lt;/em&gt;. The last four games require a PSVR headset to play. PS5 owners will need a &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/playstation-camera-adaptor/"&gt;PlayStation Camera adapter&lt;/a&gt; to use the headset with the console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9VpIQ"&gt;Sony plans to offer more games as part of the initiative until sometime in June. Currently, Sony is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22308943/ratchet-and-clank-free-ps4-ps5-playstation-sony-ps-plus"&gt;offering &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which PS4 and PS5 owners can redeem at no cost until March 31st. The company is also planning to give away &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336370/horizon-zero-dawn-free-ps4-ps5-playstation-sony"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; for free&lt;/a&gt; beginning on April 19th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The black-and-white Snyder Cut is definitely black-and-white and definitely still 4:3</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6SkMLe"&gt;Well, that didn’t take long. &lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League: Justice is Gray&lt;/em&gt;, the black and white version of the film that hews closer to the director’s ideal vision for his superhero epic, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snydercut/status/1374981675248128000?s=20"&gt;is out today on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;. Justice is Gray’s release &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snydercut/status/1373424594787446786?s=20"&gt;was first teased last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KDRcjz"&gt;Outside of the notable lack of color, the film still streams in its now familiar 4:3 aspect ratio, which if anything, I’ve fully come around to since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337756/snyder-cut-aspect-ratio-justice-league-hbo-max-warning"&gt;the initial hullabaloo&lt;/a&gt; around the “integrity-preserving” choice. Your mileage with the new black and white color scheme, on the other hand, may vary. The dramatic death that opens the film plays a lot stranger when Batman and Wonder Woman seem like they’re watching from some kind of grayscale blur, rather than the original film’s blasted-out ruins. You can judge the potential loss of detail for yourself with WarnerMedia’s new clip:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wzdxot"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;For years, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SnyderCut?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SnyderCut&lt;/a&gt; existed in black and white and shown only to a select few.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zack Snyder's Justice League: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/JusticeIsGray?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#JusticeIsGray&lt;/a&gt;, a black and white version of the film, is now streaming on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hbomax?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@HBOMax&lt;/a&gt; in 4K UHD, HDR10, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos on supported devices. &lt;a href="https://t.co/3c40221N27"&gt;pic.twitter.com/3c40221N27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Zack Snyder's Justice League (@snydercut) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/snydercut/status/1374981675248128000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n7USzU"&gt;Like the original release, &lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League: Justice is Gray&lt;/em&gt; is available with all the modern bells and whistles you’d expect, like 4K, Dolby Atmos, and Dolby Vision (though now handling a less obviously HDR-appropriate grayscale).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2RRY1"&gt;The one part of the film that hasn’t gotten a new coat of paint? That HBO Max disclosure that plays at the start:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite’s developers smashed a piano to record sounds for the game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xShuf0bvMZaGfNiv3aXKR_C2R1k=/45x0:435x260/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69028114/Mar_25_2021_16_29_36.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Uik8Z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; developer 343 Industries smashed a piano into pieces to record sound effects, the studio revealed in a new blog detailing many aspects of the game’s audio production. I really recommend watching &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/F75L97nVSYg"&gt;the video&lt;/a&gt; of the piano-smashing at the top of this post. It’s quite satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29yVLT"&gt;But 343’s audio team didn’t just use the piano as a target for various blunt instruments. Before they smashed it, they placed a subwoofer on the piano to use it as a resonator. And after they had destroyed it, they put dry ice on numerous pieces of the piano’s remains, “which yielded a large offering of singing, bellowing, screeching and everything in between,” the developers said. Some of the resulting sounds are spine-chilling. (Interestingly, the audio team for &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20954112/death-stranding-score-music-interview-joel-corelitz-ludvig-forssell"&gt;also messed with a piano&lt;/a&gt; to record a variety of sounds for the game.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LH97A9"&gt;In addition to detailing the destruction of the piano, the blog goes in-depth on things like how some gunshot effects differ between &lt;em&gt;Halo 5&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite, &lt;/em&gt;the acoustic system that simulates how sound travels through the game’s environments, and how sound design differs between single-player and multiplayer. 343 also revealed that &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; will support the Dolby Atmos, Windows Sonic, and DTS Headphone:X virtual surround sound technologies, which will allow you to hear spatial audio even when you’re wearing stereo headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnRk6Q"&gt;If you love learning about sound and music in games, you should definitely put aside some time to read the whole blog and listen to what 343 is working on. It’s fascinating stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdOXRa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; is currently scheduled to release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22164440/halo-infinite-launch-date-fall-2021"&gt;this fall&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Area-codeless local calls will largely go away in October — but for a good reason</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8wfuIZiOVNjpyC3vewIKJ2r1RBA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69027840/akrales_180620_1777_0481.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="devX27"&gt;In many places, you can call up a neighbor or local pizza parlor just by dialing seven numbers, as long as you have the same area code — but that ability will soon be going away, in order to make the National Suicide Prevention and Mental Health Crisis Lifeline easier to reach. If you live in one of the areas where the change is taking place, you’ll soon have to dial 10 numbers whether you’re making a local call or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bS7Tsp"&gt;Each cellular carrier has a support page explaining the change (we’ll link to all of them below, and a list of the area codes will be included at the end of the post), but the basic gist is that, starting October 24, 2021, anyone trying to call a local number using only seven digits will be met with a recording telling them to hang up and try again with the full area code. The change will apply to landlines, cell phones, and VoIP systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGBhIp"&gt;Here are the carrier support pages for:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="3kqb4U"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fcoverage%2Ften-digit-dialing&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F25%2F22351130%2Farea-codes-10-digit-dialing-soon-required-for-certain-places-national-suicide-prevention-hotline-988" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XwNeda"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fidpassets%2Fimages%2Fsupport%2Fhome-phone%2F988-English-and-Spanish-tagged.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F25%2F22351130%2Farea-codes-10-digit-dialing-soon-required-for-certain-places-national-suicide-prevention-hotline-988" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="h0qaWo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsupport%2Fresidential%2Fhomephone%2Farea-international-info%2Ften-digit-dialing&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F25%2F22351130%2Farea-codes-10-digit-dialing-soon-required-for-certain-places-national-suicide-prevention-hotline-988" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="OUs5AB"&gt;It’s worth noting that seven-digit calling isn’t going away for everyone — there are only 37 states with affected area codes, and in some of those states &lt;a href="https://www.theadvocate.com/baton_rouge/news/article_76c3369c-7b8a-11eb-bb14-cf281c5e0400.html"&gt;it will only cover specific regions&lt;/a&gt;. The change will still affect a lot of people though — there are plenty of states, including Alaska, Hawaii, New Hampshire, and New Mexico where the entire state will have to switch over to 10-digit dialing. People in large portions of Washington, Michigan, Colorado, Arizona, and other states will also be affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ha4GY9"&gt;The change is happening due to &lt;a href="https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-20-100A1.pdf"&gt;an FCC order&lt;/a&gt; from July 2020, which mandated that the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline should be reachable at a three-digit number, 988, to make it easier for people in crisis to reach the hotline. After the decision was reached, the responsibility for actually getting the system working was passed to the &lt;a href="https://www.nationalnanpa.com/pdf/PL_556.pdf"&gt;North American Numbering Plan Administrator&lt;/a&gt;, which is now in charge of making sure that calls to 988 end up at the Lifeline starting on July 16, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GQV05"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please note that calling 988 will not connect you to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline until July 16, 2022. If you or a loved one is in crisis, please call 1-800-273-8255&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bc4Zg5"&gt;The technical reason for why this change is required is reasonably simple — some phone numbers start with 988, so if someone were to dial a number like 988-9999, the phone switch wouldn’t know how to interpret it. Since there isn’t a 988 area code, requiring all 10 digits ensures that no phone numbers will start with 988 and confuse the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwc5Jk"&gt;If you’re struggling to remember the last time you made a call without typing in the area code, you’re not alone — places like &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/ethernet-ip/7-digit-dialing-disappears/d/d-id/587253"&gt;New York City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/06/21/why-youll-need-10-numbers-to-make-a-call-from-the-510/"&gt;parts of the Bay Area&lt;/a&gt; have been requiring 10-digit dialing for years. Of course, tapping in a specific number at all is less common in an age of more messaging, fewer calls, digital address books, and phone number links on Google Maps. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s new partnership offers another glimpse of a drone delivery future — in only one Irish town</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kAY14iVHmUCSpfKcSSfpiJLH7Mg=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69027606/Samsung_Partners_With_Manna_DL4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o2lV8E"&gt;In Oranmore, a small town in County Galway, Ireland, you can now get a taste of a possible, instantly-gratifying drone delivery future. In &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-partners-with-manna-to-launch-drone-delivery-service-to-irish-customers"&gt;a newly announced partnership&lt;/a&gt; with Irish drone delivery company &lt;a href="https://www.manna.aero/"&gt;Manna&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung is promising delivery of its smaller electronics like phones and smart watches “within three minutes” when ordered by someone in Oranmore from Samsung’s Irish online store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PdPb8G"&gt;Manna uses “custom-developed aerospace drones” to complete deliveries, according to Samsung’s announcement. The drones’ ability to travel at speeds over 60 kilometers per hour (around 37 miles per hour) seems to be what guarantees those aggressive delivery times, though only operating within a two-kilometer radius from their dispatch center probably helps too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1sq9rv"&gt;Samsung and Manna aren’t exactly breaking new ground with their partnership, however. People living in Oranmore may already be familiar with Manna’s drones delivering everything from groceries to medicine thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.irishtimes.com/business/retail-and-services/tesco-takes-to-the-skies-with-home-delivery-by-drone-1.4391566"&gt;a deal Manna secured&lt;/a&gt; with grocery chain Tesco in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8KJchlOt6_i10txkPVJn386wtC4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22397853/Samsung_Partners_With_Manna_DL3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Samsung phone getting packaged for shipping with a Manna drone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GyLC3s"&gt;Both Samsung and Manna say they’re “keen” to expand the delivery service nationwide, but outside of Ireland other companies have been experimenting with drones as well. Amazon began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/14/13952240/amazon-drone-delivery-launch-uk"&gt;testing its drones in the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; after receiving regulatory approval in 2016. In the US, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has also started giving out approval for other small scale tests, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/27/21238196/ups-cvs-drone-delivery-medicine-florida-coronavirus"&gt;a UPS and CVS partnership&lt;/a&gt; to deliver prescriptions to a retirement home in Florida, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/10/21430280/walmart-drone-delivery-pilot-program-north-carolina-flytrex"&gt;a Walmart-run test in North Carolina&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="coPP1Y"&gt;All of these tests seem to be in service of what’s starting to feel like an inevitable reality: next-day shipping becoming more like next-minute shipping. Regulators need to agree on standards for drone flights to make that happen, and in the case of the FAA, freedom to fly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22203398/faa-remote-id-rules-location-night-over-people"&gt;will require new identification systems&lt;/a&gt; to determine ownership. It can all seem like a long way off given the pace of government, but like this Samsung stunt, there are more and more examples where that possible future is bleeding into the present.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yes or no: Are these tech hearings doing anything?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="House Committees Confront Tech CEOs Over Online Spread Of False Info" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RyefwW4MWYpbjLOIhw67piqgx0k=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69027536/1231932296.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kKN7vs"&gt;In the middle of Congress’ first hearing of the year with the chief executives of Facebook, Google, and Twitter on Thursday, Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey tweeted out a poll. It was just a question mark with two answers: yes and no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MtAqea"&gt;It was an obvious troll directed at the lawmakers questioning Dorsey, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, and Google CEO Sundar Pichai over the roles their platforms have played in spreading misinformation and inciting a violent insurrection at the US Capitol earlier this year. With limited time for questioning, the members would interrupt the CEOs’ responses, asking for “yes” or “no” answers or nothing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SovYDa"&gt;But while the hearing was focused on finding solutions for some of the most serious free speech conflicts in history, Dorsey’s tweet symbolized just how seriously everyone was taking it — not very seriously at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tNxSio"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@jack&lt;/a&gt; trolling a member of Congress who asked CEOs to affirm they know the different between "yes" &amp;amp; "no" &lt;a href="https://t.co/yGrhPNy5G1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/yGrhPNy5G1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cristiano Lima (@viaCristiano) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viaCristiano/status/1375152822581403655?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JHFJPx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT IT MEANS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LuUGgf"&gt;It’s not the first time Zuckerberg, Dorsey, and Pichai have testified before Congress. But it was the first time they were hauled in after a pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol on January 6th, killing multiple people. QAnon followers and right-wing online influencers were just some of the individuals who participated in the attack which was largely organized and live-streamed on social media. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erIJsm"&gt;Ahead of the hearing, Rep. Frank Pallone (D-NJ) &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/morningtech/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;“This is not a hearing just to hear the same old thing.” He continued, “We want to know what we can do legislatively. We want to pass laws.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bj3kf0"&gt;But even after a direct affront to democracy, lawmakers were unorganized, making comments about cancel culture, Mr. Potato Head, and conflating competition, privacy, and moderation into a huge unsolvable problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnFHsL"&gt;In the lead-up to Thursday’s hearing, only one lawmaker, Rep. Anna Eshoo (D-CA), introduced legislation, the “Protecting Americans from Dangerous Algorithms Act.” And Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-IL) held an event to discuss Section 230 reform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="slquQv"&gt;But after the hearing, it doesn’t seem as if the House has moved any closer to drafting real legislative reforms. In other words, Congress has failed to move past airing their personal grievances and toward providing real solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N9myfC"&gt;In some cases, lawmakers were asking the tech executives to do more than they’re able to achieve themselves. Rep. Doris Matsui (D-CA) pushed the executives on the rise of anti-Asian violence and hate speech. But as rightly pointed out by my boss Nilay Patel &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1375146987381788675?s=20"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, the US doesn’t have any hate speech policies and it would be difficult to get any related bill passed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="wuLq0a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bills have prompted tech companies to take action themselves&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YD1JUY"&gt;In the past, bills have prompted tech companies to take action themselves. After the 2016 presidential election, Sens. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) and Mark Warner (D-VA) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/19/16502946/facebook-twitter-russia-honest-ads-act"&gt;introduced the Honest Ads Act&lt;/a&gt;. The bill was never passed, but it pressured Facebook and Google to host their own transparent ads databases. But when it comes to content moderation and Section 230 reform, Facebook, Google, and Twitter are largely opposed to any significant changes to the law. Any meaningful reform will need to come from Congress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cCpfP4"&gt;Shortly after the January 6th attack, Warner, Klobuchar, and Sen. Mazie Hirono (D-HI) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22268368/democrats-section-230-moderation-warner-klobuchar-facebook-google"&gt;introduced the SAFE TECH Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would open new pathways for users to sue tech companies if content posted on their platforms threatens them personally with harassment, discrimination, or other forms of abuse. The Eshoo bill would remove immunity under Section 230 when a platform’s algorithm is proved to have promoted or recommended content related to terrorist acts or civil rights violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EK7hoV"&gt;Still, neither of those bills have received a hearing or much bipartisan support. In the Senate, Sen. Chris Coons (D-DE) will be chairing the Judiciary Committee’s subcommittee on privacy and technology. &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/morning-tech/2021/03/19/one-on-one-with-biden-ally-and-tech-leader-chris-coons-794105"&gt;In an interview with &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;earlier this month, Coons said that, in some cases, Congress doing nothing is a better option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="GvVhm0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;But when do hearings fail to force the change Congress says it wants?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SENuo4"&gt;“In an area where technology is moving fairly quickly, sometimes oversight hearings, letters [and] conversations with the leaders of major social media companies can result in those companies demonstrably changing their practices faster than we can legislate,” Coons told &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mo7GNr"&gt;But when do hearings fail to force the change Congress says it wants? On Thursday, it seemed like we were quickly approaching that threshold. From Zuckerberg and Pichai, little new information was uncovered. Dorsey favorited tweets and sent out silly polls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Cc8Tvo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;WHAT’S NEXT?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zlML9i"&gt;Coons told &lt;em&gt;Politico &lt;/em&gt;that his Senate Judiciary panel plans on hauling these executives back for another hearing sometime in the future. But it’s not clear when that will happen. Most action on tech reform is likely to come from the House Judiciary Committee. Last week, that committee finished up its final antitrust hearing on tech. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/tech-antitrust-facebook-google-amazon-apple-275f122d-b3f5-49cb-b223-f77c95a49252.html"&gt;Chairman Rep. David Cicilline (D-RI) told &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to expect a deluge of competition bills in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VI6E2S"&gt;“My strategy is you’ll see a number of bills introduced, both because it’s harder for [the tech companies] to manage and oppose, you know, 10 bills as opposed to one,” Cicilline told &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sg95Bg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjKngx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppMGPT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla has to tell Elon Musk to delete a 2018 tweet, labor board rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="elon-musk" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jupsKoznhcSPwfsLDLilvrsHQUs=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69027484/musk7.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="htLjCJ"&gt;Tesla must tell CEO Elon Musk to delete an anti-union tweet from 2018, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) decided Thursday. The order came as part of Tesla’s appeal of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/27/20887897/tesla-elon-musk-tweets-union-nlrb-illegal"&gt;2019 ruling by an administrative judge&lt;/a&gt; in a years-long legal battle between the company and the United Auto Workers union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jo8zCj"&gt;Below is Musk’s tweet in question, which is included as a screen instead of a Twitter embed in case the tweet is deleted. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/998454539941367808"&gt;This is the direct link to the tweet&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dmatkins137/status/998451424546570242"&gt;was in response to this tweet&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to see the conversation in context on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JE-QRjts0jhrWnMPC8A5fIpDmMg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22398063/Screen_Shot_2021_03_25_at_2.07.21_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fie2x0"&gt;Tesla will also have to post a notice at its factories nationwide addressing the “unlawful tweet.” This is actually a change from the decision from the 2019 ruling, where Musk or someone with the labor board would have been required to read a notice that Tesla violated the law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4c80DQ"&gt;“Here, a notice-reading remedy is neither necessary nor appropriate to remedy the violations in this case because the Board’s traditional remedies will suffice to ameliorate the chilling effect of the Respondent’s unlawful conduct,” the NLRB said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RmwdtG"&gt;The appeal also included a number of other orders for Tesla. Notably, Tesla employees are allowed to have conversations with the media that are protected by the National Labor Relations Act without asking for approval. Previously, employees had language in their confidentiality agreement that said they couldn’t talk to the media without authorization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tGWCtG"&gt;You can download the full decision &lt;a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/32-CA-197020"&gt;from the NLRB’s website&lt;/a&gt; or read it embedded below.&lt;/p&gt;
