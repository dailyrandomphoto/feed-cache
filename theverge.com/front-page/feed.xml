    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;We couldn’t get enough&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TQ39AU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; arrives on December 8th, 2021, after over a year of delay, but the game seems truly worth the wait. &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt; was supposed to launch alongside the Xbox Series X in November 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363769/halo-infinite-delay-launch-2021-release-date-xbox-series-x"&gt;but got pushed back&lt;/a&gt; after an underwhelming initial reveal that &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/23/21336060/halo-infinite-graphics-xbox-series-x-microsoft-one-windows-fan-reaction-memes"&gt;made the game into a meme&lt;/a&gt;. As of late 2021, it appears Microsoft may have turned things around big time. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665435/halo-infinite-multiplayer-preview-september-24th"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer preview&lt;/a&gt; has gotten rave reviews and we’ve enjoyed it so much, we can’t wait to play more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWhCQU"&gt;Here’s what &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Tom Warren and Sean Hollister loved, hated, and what we’re hoping to see when the full game comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dMlxgW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Warren&lt;/strong&gt;: My favorite part of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer is the new grappleshot. It’s game-changing for &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, both in terms of moving around maps and also the ability to grab objects. I’ve been using it mainly to parkour around as if I’m playing &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt;, but once you master its uses beyond mobility, you can quickly grab the power weapons or repel yourself back onto a ledge if you just got hit by a repulsor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uh5Cly"&gt;Some of the most entertaining clips I’ve seen throughout the beta have been by people grappling back onto ledges, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mintblitz/status/1445744553412030464?s=21"&gt;grabbing vehicles out of the sky&lt;/a&gt;, or just generally using the mobility of the grappleshot to get some truly impressive plays. It really feels like a mix of &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt; and Pathfinder’s grapple hook from &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="4Y7fvm"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pYqNCjG1vPw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QNLwPl"&gt;You need to find the grappleshot and pick it up before you can actually use it to grab things or move around quickly, and there’s a small cooldown and limited amount of uses so it doesn’t feel too overpowered. You can configure the training mode with unlimited grappleshot, and I almost want a dedicated mode where everyone has it equipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02Aq3E"&gt;If you haven’t managed to play &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; beta yet, it’s one of the tools you’ll want to master early on for multiplayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPGfwq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean Hollister: &lt;/strong&gt;I’m a sucker for a great grappling hook, and I’ll echo Tom here: I’d love a mode where I could use it nonstop to grapple into, onto, and around everything. I’ve seen some amazing plays with the repulsor, too — like a single Spartan bouncing away a fully loaded Warthog like it was a two-ton tennis ball, securing a CTF victory for their team — but more often it seems like a way to boop people into bottomless pits. I prefer pulling myself &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; of those pits with the grappling hook, and it’s exhilarating to do things like intentionally throw myself under a bridge, swing underneath, and pop up behind foes on the opposite side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="G0YrgU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is possibly the best use of the repulsor I've seen in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HaloInfinite?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#HaloInfinite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;November cannot come soon enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Via: &lt;a href="https://t.co/2yLSp6FhQ4"&gt;https://t.co/2yLSp6FhQ4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/DIhklRpw1Y"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DIhklRpw1Y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Looter Universe (@LooterUniverse) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LooterUniverse/status/1444983093496975364?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B9CB65"&gt;But my favorite part of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;is simple: the gunplay. From the booming audio to the tremendous amount of damage they can put out against a shielded, armored soldier, every weapon feels incredibly powerful, every fight leaves me on the edge of my seat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InvQZ1"&gt;Stray projectiles and covering fire are deadly enough, I &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; the pressure to put my head down, let my shield regenerate, or try another angle of attack entirely instead of poking out from cover again and again. I’m constantly calculating the risk / reward of a devastating melee attack or a grenade toss, because they’re just as satisfying as they’ve always been in classic &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; games, as are the classic headshot-friendly pistol and spray-and-pray assault rifle you get by default in most matches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4HqRzA"&gt;With a few obvious exceptions like the rocket launcher, sniper rifle, and giant spike thrower (which have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/godsewa/status/1443232801231417346"&gt;counters of their own&lt;/a&gt;), the weapons feel balanced enough that I never felt penalized for picking a different one just for fun variety. It’s the most fun I’ve had with &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; in years, after the most recent games tried to get a bit too tricky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kTGrLucpuf2Yks1-20j7TjTM3HI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925717/HaloInfinite_2021_10_03_21_02_12_131.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A grappling hook doesn’t keep you from getting shot out of the sky.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w85j3d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom: &lt;/strong&gt;I also love the movement in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. Mobility is always a key aspect of first-person shooters, and &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;really encourages it with smooth sprinting, sliding, and vaulting. &lt;em&gt;Halo 5&lt;/em&gt; really took movement mechanics to the extreme, with mechanics like the thrust slide that could boost your movement and allow you to outsmart opponents. &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s movement changes are a lot more refined, very subtle, and have a clear skill gap to pull off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dSd4w"&gt;YouTuber Shyway demonstrated this really well, with &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rKBzaSqHMeE"&gt;a 17-second clip&lt;/a&gt; showing off curb slides in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. While the comments are full of people saying &lt;em&gt;Titanfall &lt;/em&gt;movement is better (and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGWRAbSKXEI"&gt;he addresses that, too&lt;/a&gt;), these curb slides are actually a big change to a &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; game that doesn’t have easy-to-use thrust slides and lots of movement mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="nd2lNH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rKBzaSqHMeE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1KpgaF"&gt;I’ve also seen people demonstrate the mobility in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; really well on Twitter, and slide jumping is a fun mechanic, especially when you combine it with things like the grappleshot. I’m used to playing &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;, which has a big focus on movement and mobility, so &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t feel slow in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mki0Fn"&gt;Once people start to master the curb slides, we’ll see some wild clips go viral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c26nj0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean: &lt;/strong&gt;Frankly, I’m hoping there aren’t too many mobility tricks like the curb slide, and that they don’t dominate the game. Skill ceilings can make a lot of shooting games inaccessible to those who don’t play for a living, and so far I’ve been impressed that most skirmishes&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;I’ve had in &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt; felt like fair fights — losses where I’d have won if I’d played my cards right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEWoVr"&gt;We don’t know what the meta will be like quite yet, of course, since we were playing against foes with a similar lack of experience. We also don’t necessarily have a good handle on the maps: the test flights dropped us into a bare handful of small and / or extremely symmetrical levels, and I wonder if I’ll enjoy larger ones as much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nu4mX"&gt;Not that any of those things will factor into my purchase decision: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349236/halo-infinite-multiplayer-free-to-play-120fps-rumors"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;multiplayer will be free to play&lt;/a&gt;, a super exciting move that should hopefully ensure it’ll be easy to find a match at my skill level for years to come. Microsoft will be making its multiplayer money entirely off cosmetic items, it seems!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ZPn3O3cDbtbeap2dQKIukioe6M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925721/HaloInfinite_2021_10_03_21_02_25_237.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I call shotgun. HEY, wait for me!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6wAfjH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom:  &lt;/strong&gt;I don’t like the battle pass system, though. There are credits which appear to be available to purchase for real money, too. You can use credits to level up the battle pass and unlock rewards like consumables (double XP), armor, and other items. You can also level up the battle pass by completing challenges, but you don’t earn XP through regular play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAQCHk"&gt;I’m fine with the challenges existing, but I feel like there should be a way to earn XP based on the amount of time you’re playing the game. If you can truly buy credits from the store that let you level up the battle pass, then that’s veering too close to pay to win for me even if all you’re getting is cosmetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PprZlF"&gt;The battle pass system is the only part of &lt;em&gt;Infinite &lt;/em&gt;that I’ve felt confused and irritated by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h2YRxdLJMkWq3xrD5NnOe4zGt7I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925723/HaloInfinite_2021_10_02_14_56_13_996.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We had high hopes &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410863/microsoft-halo-infinite-pc-32-9-ultrawide-lan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;for Microsoft’s 32:9 monitor support&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. It looks neat on an ultrawide &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Odyssey G9&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, but I’m afraid the edges are pretty distorted.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8q7ZWP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean: &lt;/strong&gt;I do wonder how Microsoft will keep it engaging enough to keep paying players paying. I took a look at the different armor variants and colors, but there are only so many ways you can skin a set of armor, and Halo’s guns don’t have the mountains of attachments or variants you’d find in a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty,&lt;/em&gt; nor the unique heroes of an &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; to keep people buying and costuming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13Z63W"&gt;I’m fine just ignoring the paid extras, like I do in all free-to-play games. But here’s something I’d genuinely pay for: a mode that makes the vehicles bouncy and indestructible, like they were in the original 2001 &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Combat Evolved&lt;/em&gt;. Want a good time? Get everyone on an OG &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; server to put their guns away and start Warthog jousting instead, then watch as the game’s bonkers physics system launches those vehicles spiraling into the sky. No shooting allowed: you’ve got to knock your foes out of their futuristic Humvees and run them over to win. It becomes a big floaty bullfight, or — with enough players — a piranha feeding frenzy. &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; made vehicles destructible in &lt;em&gt;Halo 2&lt;/em&gt;, and that was that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="SgpIBh"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C5d7AiVMoEM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VI1QfL"&gt;Either way, if &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; stays as fun as it was in these test flights, I’ll be playing a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of it. The bite-sized matches go by so quickly it’s hard to resist — it’s easy to fit one or two into my busy dad schedule, perhaps during my lunch break. Tom, you in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGxnml"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is researching AI systems that see, hear, and remember everything you do</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QMmzpzAfm8qoJnqswmQo5zzYN1k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69993205/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4eypKf"&gt;Facebook is pouring a lot of time and money into augmented reality, including building its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662809/facebook-ray-ban-stories-camera-smart-glasses-hands-on"&gt;AR glasses&lt;/a&gt; with Ray-Ban. Right now, these gadgets can only record and share imagery, but what does the company think such devices will be used for in the future? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIsPiW"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/teaching-ai-to-view-the-world-through-your-eyes/"&gt;new research project&lt;/a&gt; led by Facebook’s AI team suggests the scope of the company’s ambitions. It imagines AI systems that are constantly analyzing peoples’ lives using first-person video; recording what they see, do, and hear in order to help them with everyday tasks. Facebook’s researchers have outlined a series of skills it wants these systems to develop, including “episodic memory” (answering questions like “where did I leave my keys?”) and “audio-visual diarization” (remembering who said what when). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="f0ceBz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“there’s possibilities down the road that we’d be leveraging this kind of research”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q4mkv6"&gt;Right now, the tasks outlined above cannot be achieved reliably by any AI system, and Facebook stresses that this is a research project rather than a commercial development. However, it’s clear that the company sees functionality like these as the future of AR computing. “Definitely, thinking about augmented reality and what we’d like to be able to do with it, there’s possibilities down the road that we’d be leveraging this kind of research,” Facebook AI research scientist Kristen Grauman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLJK2b"&gt;Such ambitions have huge privacy implications. Privacy experts are already worried about how Facebook’s AR glasses allow wearers to covertly record members of the public. Such concerns will only be exacerbated if future versions of the hardware not only record footage, but analyze and transcribe it, turning wearers into walking surveillance machines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ym00sPuEzaBp64U9vobYfRLkK6Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22834538/alopez_210907_4736_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amanda Lopez for The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s first pair of commercial AR glasses can only record and share videos and pictures — not analyze it. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BeEj6O"&gt;The name of Facebook’s research project is Ego4D, which refers to the analysis of first-person, or “egocentric,” video. It consists of two major components: an open dataset of egocentric video and a series of benchmarks that Facebook thinks AI systems should be able to tackle in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d6Dk2I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook helped collect 3,205 hours of first-person footage from around the world&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WP4EAI"&gt;The dataset is the biggest of its kind ever created, and Facebook partnered with 13 universities around the world to collect the data. In total, some 3,205 hours of footage were recorded by 855 participants living in nine different countries. The universities, rather than Facebook, were responsible for collecting the data. Participants, some of whom were paid, wore GoPro cameras and AR glasses to record video of unscripted activity. This ranges from construction work to baking to playing with pets and socializing with friends. All footage was de-identified by the universities, which included blurring the faces of bystanders and removing any personally identifiable information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rhnACJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/taC2ZKl9IsE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R3vQo7"&gt;Grauman says the dataset is the “first of its kind in both scale and diversity.” The nearest comparable project, she says, contains &lt;a href="https://epic-kitchens.github.io/2021"&gt;100 hours of first-person footage&lt;/a&gt; shot entirely in kitchens. “We’ve open up the eyes of these AI systems to more than just kitchens in the UK and Sicily, but [to footage from] Saudi Arabia, Tokyo, Los Angeles, and Colombia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZeuXO"&gt;The second component of Ego4D is a series of benchmarks, or tasks, that Facebook wants researchers around the world to try and solve using AI systems trained on its dataset. The company describes these as: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ILjgln"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episodic memory&lt;/strong&gt;: What happened when (e.g., “Where did I leave my keys?”)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcuKUw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecasting&lt;/strong&gt;: What am I likely to do next (e.g., “Wait, you’ve already added salt to this recipe”)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Od5NVZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hand and object manipulation&lt;/strong&gt;: What am I doing (e.g., “Teach me how to play the drums”)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GD62EB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audio-visual diarization&lt;/strong&gt;: Who said what when (e.g., “What was the main topic during class?”)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UiQKqm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social interaction&lt;/strong&gt;: Who is interacting with whom (e.g., “Help me better hear the person talking to me at this noisy restaurant”)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6EZF4d"&gt;Right now, AI systems would find tackling any of these problems incredibly difficult, but creating datasets and benchmarks are tried-and-tested methods to spur development in the field of AI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWtMKu"&gt;Indeed, the creation of one particular dataset and an associated annual competition, known as ImageNet, is often &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1034972/the-data-that-changed-the-direction-of-ai-research-and-possibly-the-world/"&gt;credited with kickstarting&lt;/a&gt; the recent AI boom. The ImagetNet datasets consists of pictures of a huge variety of objects which researchers trained AI systems to identify. In 2012, the winning entry in the competition used a particular method of deep learning to blast past rivals, inaugurating the current era of research. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rm70bMbN2Xsj93qJO-YwBMe2M6Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925967/Before_After_Detectron_ModelFINAL.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s Ego4D dataset should help spur research into AI systems that can analyze first-person data. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2y2cTx"&gt;Facebook is hoping its Ego4D project will have similar effects for the world of augmented reality. The company says systems trained on Ego4D might one day not only be used in wearable cameras but also home assistant robots, which also rely on first-person cameras to navigate the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUCiCp"&gt;“The project has the chance to really catalyze work in this field in a way that hasn’t really been possible yet,” says Grauman. “To move our field from the ability to analyze piles of photos and videos that were human-taken with a very special purpose, to this fluid, ongoing first-person visual stream that AR systems, robots, need to understand in the context of ongoing activity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nLHqJr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook’s development of AI surveillance systems will worry many&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lRizDW"&gt;Although the tasks that Facebook outlines certainly seem practical, the company’s interest in this area will worry many. Facebook’s record on privacy is abysmal, spanning &lt;a href="https://guild.co/blog/complete-list-timeline-of-facebook-scandals/"&gt;data leaks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49099364"&gt;$5 billion fines&lt;/a&gt; from the FTC. It’s also &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;been&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/11/1020600/facebook-responsible-ai-misinformation/"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-algorithm-change-zuckerberg-11631654215?mod=article_inline"&gt;repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; that the company values growth and engagement above users’ well-being in many domains. With this in mind, it’s worrying that benchmarks in this Ego4D project do not include prominent privacy safeguards. For example, the “audio-visual diarization” task (transcribing what different people say) never mentions removing data about people who don’t want to be recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9oY0k"&gt;When asked about these issues, a spokesperson for Facebook told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that it expected that privacy safeguards would be introduced further down the line. “We expect that to the extent companies use this dataset and benchmark to develop commercial applications, they will develop safeguards for such applications,” said the spokesperson. “For example, before AR glasses can enhance someone’s voice, there could be a protocol in place that they follow to ask someone else’s glasses for permission, or they could limit the range of the device so it can only pick up sounds from the people with whom I am already having a conversation or who are in my immediate vicinity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iB5TNC"&gt;For now, such safeguards are only hypothetical.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Modular Framework laptop gets a marketplace for all those modules  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVOYwcxFfarr76rbKKEFGhmQ1NU=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69992827/b1b74084_9272_45c1_93a4_d8c4895c697c_Blog21019___Marketplace_Launch___img01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gbl4DB"&gt;Framework, makers of the modular 13.5-inch Framework laptop that’s designed to be easily repaired and upgraded, has launched a dedicated marketplace filled with replacement parts and upgrades for its portable computer. Writing in a &lt;a href="https://frame.work/blog/announcing-the-framework-marketplace"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the company said the marketplace is currently focused on replacement parts and expansion cards, but that it hopes to add more customization modules like additional language keyboards later this year, as well as third-party and community developed modules in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x59BzA"&gt;It’s an important step for the modular laptop, which has been shipping for a little over two months. After all, the laptop’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F51614%2Fframework-laptop-teardown-10-10-but-is-it-perfect&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F14%2F22725935%2Fframework-laptop-modular-marketplace-launches-spare-parts-upgrades-expansions" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10/10 &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt; score for repairability&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t matter much if you can’t get a spare part when a component fails. And who cares if a laptop is upgradeable if there aren’t any interesting modules that are actually available to upgrade it with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UQdbqG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Framework Marketplace is now live for ordering replacement parts and upgrades!  This is the foundation of a exciting ecosystem roadmap expanding the customization, upgrade, and repair of incredible products: &lt;a href="https://t.co/26ApysPerf"&gt;https://t.co/26ApysPerf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/iKe8TTSVfk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iKe8TTSVfk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Framework (@FrameworkPuter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FrameworkPuter/status/1447976504097341441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8yfvTu"&gt;The marketplace already includes a range of expansion cards for the laptop, which are designed to slot into its four modular compartments to add everything from extra storage to features like MicroSD card slots or more USB ports. There’s also user upgradeable RAM and storage for sale. But the store is clearly a work in progress, and lists a host of other items like replacement CPU-equipped mainboards, keyboards, and spare parts like batteries and displays as “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKPzoD"&gt;Framework has made a solid start at making sure its laptops can be easily repaired when they break, but it’ll be a while longer before we know if it’s truly delivered on its promise of a laptop that can be upgraded over time. It’s a promise that’s been made many times over the years. Just last year, Dells’ attempt at an upgradeable laptop with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18294631/alienware-area-51m-review-gaming-laptop-specs-price-features"&gt;Alienware Area-51m&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256845/alienware-area-51m-r1-r2-specs-upgradable-parts-gpu-dgff-limited"&gt;unravelled just one model later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Up3HrW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AV2umY3R0vw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yQfHTh"&gt;There have been similar high profile attempts to bring modular designs to smartphones. But over the years, attempts from companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14172070/lg-next-flagship-g6-smartphone-friends-modules-ces-2017"&gt;LG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12775922/google-project-ara-modular-phone-suspended-confirm"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.benefitofthedoud.com/post/moto-mods-are-not-dead-but-they-re-not-not-dead#:~:text=Moto%20mods%20led%20to%20us,world's%20first%205G%20mobile%20device.&amp;amp;text=For%20fans%20of%20moto%20z,phone%2C%20you%20can%20buy%20them."&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt; have failed to make much of an impact. Sustainable smartphone manufacturer Fairphone has seen more success, and recently announced its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22716194/fairphone-4-review"&gt;Fairphone 4&lt;/a&gt; smartphone. But Fairphone’s focus has always been more on easy repairs for longevity, rather than offering upgraded components over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RE6zBj"&gt;If you’re interested in picking up a Framework laptop for yourself, the prices start at $999 for an assembled model with an Intel i5-1135G7 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. There’s also a model with a more affordable $749 starting price if you’re happy to do some assembly, or more expensive pre-assembled versions with faster Intel i7 CPUs, and more RAM and storage. All versions come with a 13.5-inch 3:2 2256 x 1504 display, a 1080p webcam, and 55Wh battery. As of this writing, Framework’s website says new orders are due to ship next month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple extends AirPods Pro repair program for crackling or ANC issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fd4XpFdUwrRRGx7eXmiuL17ewU8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69992754/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Pro, first released in 2019.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DRcibj"&gt;Apple has quietly extended a repair program for the AirPods Pro that offers free repairs or replacements for earbuds that have issues with noise cancellation or static. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/airpods/comments/q7kov9/psa_apple_silently_extended_the_airpods_pro/"&gt;Reddit users&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/13/apple-extends-airpods-pro-repair-program/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) were first to spot the change to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/airpods-pro-service-program-sound-issues"&gt;support page for the repair program&lt;/a&gt;, which now notes that the program covers affected AirPods Pro for three years after their first retail sale, rather than two. The page appears to have been updated at the beginning of October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdzcWg"&gt;The support program was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21542846/apple-airpods-pro-repair-recall-program-noise-cancellation-static"&gt;originally introduced in October 2020&lt;/a&gt;, one year after the original &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936454/apple-airpods-pro-new-release-date-price-noise-cancellation-design-immersive-sound"&gt;release of the AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. It meant that Apple’s repair program was introduced at the exact point that the warranty on launch units was set to expire. With the extension of the repair program to three years, AirPods Pro bought at launch should now be covered right up until October 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvyRXC"&gt;As a reminder, Apple says it will fix the following issues with the AirPods Pro: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="r8TjET"&gt;Crackling or static sounds that increase in loud environments, with exercise or while talking on the phone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Dz2WK"&gt;Active Noise Cancellation not working as expected, such as a loss of bass sound, or an increase in background sounds, such as street or airplane noise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Md31O7"&gt;If you’re experiencing any of these issues, you now have a whole extra year to get off your butt and get a free fix as part of the repair program, which, in our experience, often means Apple giving you an on-the-spot replacement pair to take home. To do so, Apple says you should contact its support team or an Apple Authorized Service Provider, or else make an appointment at an Apple Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpNvqt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPKFnB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Ncase M1, a crowdfunded marvel of a PC case, has been discontinued </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UO_tk4l57IGzLCf6A-ur3RXKGXE=/345x0:2595x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69991816/ncase_m1_render_coke.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The final product wound up being remarkably faithful to this early render.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ncase&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="13kMCd"&gt;In 2012, fed up with the sorry state of small-form-factor (SFF) computer cases, &lt;a href="https://hardforum.com/threads/ncase-m1-a-crowdfunded-mini-itx-case-updates-in-first-post.1717132/"&gt;two users on the HardOCP community forum&lt;/a&gt; decided to create their own. Wahaha360 and Necere came up with the $200+ &lt;a href="https://ncases.com/products/m1"&gt;Ncase M1&lt;/a&gt;, a 12.7-liter marvel designed to put every cubic centimeter of that space to good use. Amazingly, they managed to attract the attention of renowned PC manufacturer Lian-Li to manufacture small batches of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Fncase-m1-prototype-a-mini-itx-case%23%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F13%2F22725010%2Fncase-m1-pc-case-sff-small-form-factor-discontinued" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;their crowdfunded case&lt;/a&gt; out of high-quality aluminum, and the result was greeted with rave reviews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="813Ekz"&gt;Nine years later, though, &lt;a href="https://ncases.com/blogs/news/farewell-m1-classic"&gt;Ncase has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s discontinuing the M1 for good. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WfSlj5hXU64HNDiwCp8oZLNGn6w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924630/ncase_m1_classic.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Mikqhf"&gt;It’s a weird situation. Yesterday, the company posted that it had discontinued the M1 entirely — but overnight, the post was updated to read that it’s just the current “classic” design that’s gone for good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ivGj5J"&gt;Ncase tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that’s because there’s a successor on the way. “I can say that what we are working on will follow the formula the M1 pioneered, updated and modernized to better reflect the current hardware market,” Ncase says, adding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="VDSOTk"&gt;Video cards, especially, have on average grown significantly larger over the past couple of years - a fact that has hurt the M1’s compatibility, which had previously been very good for its size. The M1 was already highly space-optimized, so accommodating such larger cards was not possible within the current design footprint. Hence the need for a more thorough redesign from the ground up, which also allows us the opportunity to explore alternate manufacturing methods, updates to the visual design, and additional features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="NSEmgG"&gt;That makes some sense: This isn’t a product that’s particularly out of date or where demand has suddenly dried up. While there are many worthy imitators like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BF8YMXC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Cooler Master NR200&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lian-Li-TU-150WX-Aluminum-Mini-ITX/dp/B07X8Z5V53?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lian-Li’s own TU-150&lt;/a&gt; — with a neat integrated carry handle, too — the Ncase M1 is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; widely regarded as one of the best cases on the market. Would-be buyers were eagerly awaiting another batch, which was tentatively slated for November.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQDCBs"&gt;But it is true that some of the oversized coolers on the most recent generation of graphics cards keeps many of them from fitting well in the M1. (Still, you can easily stuff a RTX 3080 Ti Founder’s Edition in there if you’ve got enough airflow and a potent power supply. I certainly did!)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06WqXo_Ew5BSdo1hD9st8HSFmMY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925218/M1_v2_04_1500x750.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Praise the M1’s pop-off panels, a staple of Lian-Li cases. You can even fit a slim-line optical drive or SSD under the front shield.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RhMzmT"&gt;It’s worth noting that Ncase’s founders do work on other PC cases as well. For example: The 14.7-liter &lt;a href="https://ssupd.com/products/meshlicious"&gt;SSUPD Meshlicious&lt;/a&gt;, a mass-market case that SFF specialist YouTuber Optimum Tech &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKpNt1o6l_Y"&gt;called “the 2021 ITX case to beat”&lt;/a&gt;, is also a Wahaha360 product made by Lian-Li. (So is the 9.5-liter FormD T1, another case that &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FormD/comments/pp72se/t1_v20_official_updated_from_v15/"&gt;gets produced in small batches&lt;/a&gt;.) Ncase also collaborated on &lt;a href="https://hardforum.com/threads/mach-one-a-chimera-x-ncase-collaboration.1961617/"&gt;a design called the Mach One&lt;/a&gt;, too — and if you told me that its &lt;a href="https://hardforum.com/threads/the-next-ncase-project-a-steam-machine-style-case-indeterminate.1831382/"&gt;LRPC concept&lt;/a&gt; inspired Microsoft’s Xbox One S, below, I wouldn’t bat an eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sCt3xF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10806172"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WIIzQ2"&gt;It feels premature to pour one out for the best computer case I’ve ever owned, one that I plan to keep using for years and one that’ll likely make a cameo appearance in even more &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; reviews than the ones you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;might’ve&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"&gt;already&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;clocked&lt;/a&gt;. But even if we might be getting an Ncase M2 someday, I don’t mind pressing F for the legacy this brand built. Ncase helped change the face of SFF cases, and whether you’re buying your next one from them or someone else, our desks are better for it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/odqyy9siji6kdolmAGT3_YnoMdo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925234/1826930.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To think the comparatively gigantic BitFenix Prodigy (right) was considered a groundbreaking Mini-ITX case in 2012. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Adam Neumann is back, and he just got HBO Max to cave to his demands</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eE2lpK"&gt;Months after HBO Max original docuseries &lt;em&gt;Generation Hustle&lt;/em&gt; debuted on the service, a team representing WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann says the streamer has changed some language in an episode that mapped the startup’s rise and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029499/decade-fails-flops-tech-science-culture-apple-google-data-kickstarter-2010-2019"&gt;spectacular demise&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="in8KWH"&gt;In a press release sent to a staffer at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; earlier this week, defamation attorney &lt;a href="https://clarelocke.com/professionals/thomas-a-clare-p-c/"&gt;Thomas A. Clare&lt;/a&gt; — who now represents the known &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21011740/nicholas-braun-cousin-greg-succession-wework-adam-neumann-casting-announcement"&gt;tequila enthusiast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20872777/we-work-adam-neumann-tequila-weed-ipo-eternal-life"&gt;reported aspiring immortal&lt;/a&gt; — announced that HBO Max had altered parts of a &lt;em&gt;Generation Hustle &lt;/em&gt;episode, titled “Cult of WeWork,” as well as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hbomax.com%2Fseries%2Furn%3Ahbo%3Aseries%3AGYFuzsAQIP73CUAEAAAAd&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F13%2F22725397%2Fhbo-max-edits-cult-of-wework-adam-neumann-generation-hustle" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its description&lt;/a&gt; on the HBO Max site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="takyHq"&gt;Previously, the show’s description said it combined “true-crime capers with fresh, glossy stories of charismatic fakes” and “colorful imposters,” according to a version of the site archived on &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210428091004/https://www.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GYFuzsAQIP73CUAEAAAAd"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;. Both the characterization of the series as “true crime” and the aforementioned description of its subjects have since been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B8Nadx"&gt;The service also changed language in the end cards shown in the episode by specifying that while Neumann is being investigated, “no criminal or regulatory charges have been filed.” The episode also now includes language that WeWork is &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/wework-ipo-coworking-spac-deal-stock-market-public-listing-2021-9"&gt;preparing to go public&lt;/a&gt;. While the language in the cards and the show’s and description have been updated, a spokesperson for the HBO Max told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that no alterations had been made to the episode itself. &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/10/adam-neumann-scam-wework-hbo-generation-hustle-changes-ipo-1234854081/"&gt;earlier reported&lt;/a&gt; on the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cisZLp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We hope these responsible steps ... put an end to the mischaracterizations of Adam’s successful role in creating a transformational business.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1X7oFI"&gt;“HBO did the right thing here by promptly retracting these false implications about Adam and the history of WeWork, and we applaud the network for taking these responsible steps,” Clare, Neumann’s attorney, said in a statement. “The media has repeatedly gotten the story of Adam wrong, and we hope these responsible steps by a reputable outlet will help put an end to the mischaracterizations of Adam’s successful role in creating a transformational business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4eYDA"&gt;An HBO Max spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Clare’s conflation of the changes with HBO — rather than HBO Max — was incorrect. The company had no further comment to share on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wu2itF"&gt;When asked by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; why the edits were announced nearly six months after the show’s premiere in April, a spokesperson for Neumann’s team said that the changes were made “in the last few days.” Neumann retained his defamation counsel on January 14th of 2021, according to the spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA is removing ex-Raiders coach Jon Gruden from Madden after email scandal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s9NcaW"&gt;Electronic Arts is removing former Las Vegas Raiders coach Jon Gruden from &lt;em&gt;Madden NFL 22 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jon-gruden-email-demaurice-smith-11633721045?mod=e2tw"&gt;following&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/11/sports/football/what-did-jon-gruden-say.html?"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that he had used racist, homophobic, and misogynistic language in emails. Gruden resigned as the Raiders’ coach soon after the emails came to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmetFl"&gt;“EA Sports is committed to taking action in maintaining a culture of inclusion and equity,” EA said on in a statement posted to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EAMaddenNFL/status/1448393205297332232"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Madden&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;NFL&lt;/em&gt; Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;. “Due to the circumstances of Jon Gruden’s resignation, we are taking steps to remove him from &lt;em&gt;Madden NFL 22&lt;/em&gt;. We will replace him with a generic likeness via a title update in the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flvuCL"&gt;This isn’t the first time EA has made changes to its hit football series in response to real-world events. In 2020, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/17/21328954/ea-madden-nfl-21-washington-redskins-name-logo-removal"&gt;changed all references to the Washington Redskins&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Madden NFL 21&lt;/em&gt; after the franchise announced it would be dropping the brand. Former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez was removed &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/7/8/4505076/ea-to-remove-aaron-hernandez-ncaa-football-14-madden-nfl-25"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;NCAA Football 14&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Madden NFL 25&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;after being convicted of first-degree murder in 2013. And former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/9/9/6126945/ray-rice-suspended-domestic-violence-nfl-madden"&gt;was pulled from &lt;em&gt;Madden NFL 15&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after a video surfaced of him hitting his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5MSbe"&gt;Gruden’s emails were included among 650,000 that were reviewed as part of an NFL investigation into workplace misconduct at Washington Football Team.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden administration gives offshore wind farms a big boost</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Views Of General Electric Co.’s First U.S. Offshore Wind Farm" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GNFSLIxHwKp9O2oEq3dHQ5sisa8=/0x37:4546x3068/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69991458/609022718.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The GE-Alstom Block Island Wind Farm stands in the water off Block Island, Rhode Island, U.S., on Wednesday, Sept. 14, 2016. | Eric Thayer/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jEgeSN"&gt;Offshore wind farms could be coming to nearly every coastline along the continental US. Interior Secretary Deb Haaland today &lt;a href="https://www.doi.gov/pressreleases/secretary-haaland-outlines-ambitious-offshore-wind-leasing-strategy"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; plans to auction off leases to developers for up to seven new areas by 2025. That includes waters in the Gulf of Mexico, Gulf of Maine, Central Atlantic, New York Bight (between Long Island and New Jersey), and off the coasts of Oregon, California, and the Carolinas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqkKiB"&gt;It’s a big scaling up of offshore wind in the US, which lags far behind Europe when it comes to deployment. The US’ first commercial-scale offshore wind farm just got federal approval in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430981/offshore-wind-farm-commercial-scale-federal-approval-vineyard-wind-massachusetts"&gt;May&lt;/a&gt;. Two existing, smaller operations in US waters have a combined capacity of just 42 megawatts. The Biden administration set a goal of pushing capacity up to &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/03/29/fact-sheet-biden-administration-jumpstarts-offshore-wind-energy-projects-to-create-jobs/"&gt;30,000 MW by 2030&lt;/a&gt;. Europe, home to a majority of the world’s offshore wind, already had nearly that much installed in &lt;a href="https://windeurope.org/intelligence-platform/product/offshore-wind-in-europe-key-trends-and-statistics-2020/"&gt;2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="lSkUh1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Expanding to other shores will come with new technical challenges&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IjlBGe"&gt;The US’ first offshore wind projects are all along the East Coast. Expanding to other shores will come with new technical challenges. On the Pacific coast, waters get much deeper, much closer to shore compared to the US’ Atlantic coastline. That makes it more difficult to affix turbines to the seafloor. The White House &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453282/joe-biden-california-west-coast-offshore-wind"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in May that it would open up two areas off the California coast to commercial-scale wind farms and indicated that it might turn to new technology for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22448187/ge-floating-turbine-offshore-wind-farm-energy"&gt;floating wind farms.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6IHx1"&gt;Turbines in the Gulf of Mexico will have to contend with hurricanes and soft soils, recent &lt;a href="https://www.nrel.gov/news/program/2020/studies-find-gulf-of-mexico-well-positioned-for-offshore-wind-development.html"&gt;studies&lt;/a&gt; from the National Renewable Energy Lab found. Still, shallow water and smaller waves make the Gulf ripe for wind development. New offshore wind industry here could potentially also benefit from existing infrastructure and know-how from the region’s history of offshore oil and gas drilling. The very &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/future-energy-is-blowing-in-wind/"&gt;first wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island&lt;/a&gt; was built with the help of ships from Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XNxoh0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A pipeline of projects that will establish confidence for the offshore wind industry”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iNiblb"&gt;“We are working to facilitate a pipeline of projects that will establish confidence for the offshore wind industry,” said Amanda Lefton, Director of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, in a statement today. It could still take years to get offshore turbines up and running. Proposed wind farms have historically struggled with permitting delays, local opposition, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22296979/us-offshore-ships-wind-boom-installation-vessels"&gt;shortage&lt;/a&gt; of specialized installation ships. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7STeDA"&gt;But with droughts, wildfires, storms, and coastal flooding growing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt;more intense in the US as a result of climate change&lt;/a&gt;, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724258/fossil-fuels-forecast-climate-change-international-energy-agency"&gt;no time to lose&lt;/a&gt; in the transition to clean energy. The Biden administration’s offshore wind push is part of a larger goal to get the country’s electricity grid running entirely on clean energy by 2035 and reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1N4Mm7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is trying out ads in the perfect new place: right in the replies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ElP5KBM9fJ0hQkj9zDlvzThvhgA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69991326/acastro_170726_1777_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QuvCPN"&gt;I don’t know about you, but I sometimes feel like Twitter is overloaded with ads in my feed. Unfortunately, those ads don’t seem to be enough for the company, though, because it’s testing a new place to show them: right in the middle of conversations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yRNIhC"&gt;The new ad format is in testing on iOS and Android, and you’ll see ads after the first, third, or eighth reply to a tweet if you’re in the test, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boo/status/1448319014921404417?s=21"&gt;according to Bruce Falck&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter’s revenue product lead. He shared a GIF of what the new in-conversation ads look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aDjUzj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Starting today, we’re trying something different and testing a new ad format in Tweet conversations. If you’re a part of this test (which is global; on iOS &amp;amp; Android only), you’ll see ads after the first, third or eighth reply under a Tweet.  ️ &lt;a href="https://t.co/kvIGeYt2vp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kvIGeYt2vp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— bruce.falck()   (@boo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boo/status/1448319014921404417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1YvOyb"&gt;The in-conversation ad looks exactly as you’d expect, but I can’t say I’m a fan. Twitter can already be a pretty overstimulating place, especially if I take a risk by tapping into potentially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713211/twitter-pre-tweet-prompt-fight-intense-conversation"&gt;heated replies&lt;/a&gt;; I don’t know if I want to have to cognitively process ads amongst other junk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440425/elon-musk-impersonator-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-twitter-scam-report-ftc"&gt;like Elon Musk impersonators&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, I don’t seem to have been selected for the test just yet, so at least for now, any conversations I read are ad-free.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use the iOS app tracking blocker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini feels very comfortable to hold." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8CApHo89l_6-U02FA26oLjLlBo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187117/vpavic_4279_20201108_0321.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5AV4O6"&gt;Privacy is on everyone’s mind these days. Last spring, iOS 14.5 introduced a new privacy feature called App Tracking Transparency that may have made its users happier but did not endear Apple to some other companies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;specifically Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. The feature is still available in iOS 15, along with &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F06%2Fapple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22403523%2Fios-14-5-tracking-consent-app-transparency-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some new privacy features&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLqII1"&gt;Many apps don’t just track your movements inside the app, but they track your movements outside of the app — in other words, where you go after you’ve left the app. This is why you see ads in Facebook and other apps for products you were just looking at on Amazon or other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJui93"&gt;Before 14.5, you could turn tracking off for all of your apps by going to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking and turning off “Allow Apps to Request to Track.” The version that first appeared in iOS 14.5 allows you to be more specific. To begin, when you install a new app, you don’t have to do anything; you are automatically asked whether you want the new app to track you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_sNA9207Ij6MSzf2Kv2v5aQKVoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470537/Image_from_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you or not." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SFVoiRqzCT28pCAurjfCEcl0yRk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470540/Image_from_iOS__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P6sRHd"&gt;If you want to see which apps have asked for permission to track and possibly change their tracking settings, you can just go to that same Tracking page. There, you will be able to give or revoke that permission. So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="amnEHD"&gt;Go to your iPhone’s settings and select Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FMi304"&gt;Beneath “Allow Apps to Request to Track,” you’ll now see a list of specific apps that have asked for that permission. You can permit or revoke that permission for each specific app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to Settings &amp;amp;gt; Privacy &amp;amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w6w_zBXKYJsJ68-QaTDaA_HPCgU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470579/Image_from_iOS__3_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sqNFgl"&gt;And you can still use “Allow Apps to Request to Track” to turn off permission for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of your current (and future) apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ne1PGZ"&gt;(Note: At first, the App Tracking Transparency feature seemed to be misbehaving for some people; it either didn’t respond, or &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/26/ios-14-5-app-tracking-transparency-toggle-mysteriously-toggle-grayed-out-for-some-users/"&gt;the toggle in Tracking was grayed out&lt;/a&gt;. On May 3rd, Apple issued update 14.5.1, which was supposed to fix the problem. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/03/ios-14-5-1-release-changes/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the fix hasn’t worked for some people; however, at least one staffer at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported that his toggle was no longer grayed out. There have been no such problems reported recently.)&lt;/p&gt;
