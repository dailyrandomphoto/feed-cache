    <title>Lyft reinvents calling a cab </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mIQHbL"&gt;Lyft is admitting that some part of traditional taxi services are worth emulating today by letting people in select Florida cities &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lyft.com%2Frider%2Fcall-a-lyft-ride&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F24%2F22299349%2Flyft-phone-call-feature-book-without-app" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;book Lyft rides with just a phone call&lt;/a&gt;. The new “Call A Lyft” feature should be “perfect for seniors and folks without access to the Lyft app,” says Lyft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VZXHjI"&gt;Calling 631-201-LYFT (631-201-5938) between 8AM-8PM ET on Monday through Friday will let a potential rider book a ride. Lyft says that it will tell riders the full price before confirming and send texts to track the ride once it’s paid for and booked. It should be familiar to anyone who’s ever called a cab, though Lyft notes drivers are not expected to offer assistance getting into a car and wheelchair accessible rides aren’t available at launch. Call A Lyft also requires a phone with support for SMS messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nkIEzj"&gt;Lyft isn’t the only ride-sharing company to fall back on phone calls. Uber experimented with a similar feature in 2020, allowing customers in Arizona &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21136090/uber-1800-phone-number-no-apps-smartphone"&gt;to dial 1-833-USE-UBER&lt;/a&gt; to book a ride. Prior to both companies falling back on taxi service tactics, companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21136090/uber-1800-phone-number-no-apps-smartphone"&gt;GoGoGrandparent&lt;/a&gt; stepped in as an intermediary for ride-sharing and food delivery companies, allowing older folks to dial a phone number and have someone else handle the apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UILBwV"&gt;Lyft and Uber pushed out traditional taxi and cab services with a theoretically easy-to-use service and a large pool of drivers, but Call A Lyft illustrates that sometimes the old methods were that way for a reason — because they worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNHwrM"&gt;Call A Lyft is available now and Lyft has &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lyft.com%2Frider%2Fcall-a-lyft-ride&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F24%2F22299349%2Flyft-phone-call-feature-book-without-app" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a full list of supported cities&lt;/a&gt; on its site.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D9XLPf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1002380/9358?subId1=VergeStarWarsBadBatchMightDucks022421&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; is getting a ton of new shows in the next few months, with Disney releasing the schedule of premiere dates for new original shows for March through July. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7XwTs"&gt;Along with shows like &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and The Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;, which has already been announced for March 19th, the new list also gives concrete release dates for notable series including &lt;em&gt;The Mighty Ducks: Game Changers &lt;/em&gt;on March 26th; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21322822/star-wars-the-bad-batch-clone-wars-spinoff-disney-plus-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: The Bad Batch&lt;/em&gt; on May 4th&lt;/a&gt; (also known as “Star Wars Day”); &lt;em&gt;High School Musical: The Musical: The Series s&lt;/em&gt;eason 2 on May 14th; &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; (which had been originally slated for May) on June 11th; and the Monster’s Inc. spinoff &lt;em&gt;Monsters at Work &lt;/em&gt;on July 2nd. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="piwqko"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Marvel’s Loki series will premiere on Disney Plus on June 11th","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299343/loki-premiere-date-disney-plus-marvel-tom-hiddleston-wandavision-black-widow"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="qxNCh9"&gt;The list doesn’t include a few major shows that have been announced for 2021, though, including &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt; (which likely won’t arrive until December), &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt;, and the animated &lt;em&gt;What If...? &lt;/em&gt;— all of which are likely planned for release in the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcOXob"&gt;The full release schedule of newly announced shows for &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/1002380/9358?subId1=VergeStarWarsBadBatchMightDucks022421&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; can be found below:&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One Medical gave COVID-19 vaccines to ineligible people, NPR report says</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="One Medical" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/820RdLegwx1KtwhehY6vJOql0XA=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68868422/1175073468.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Smith Collection/Gado/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pX5Z1L"&gt;Health care company One Medical gave COVID-19 vaccines to people who were ineligible under local guidelines, including friends and family of company leadership, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/24/970176532/high-end-medical-provider-let-ineligible-people-skip-covid-19-vaccine-line"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Health departments in Washington state and California said they stopped distributing doses to One Medical after finding out that the company was not sticking to eligibility rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXaE4p"&gt;The company was given vaccine doses in a few states, including Washington and California. Internal messages obtained by &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt; show that doctors raised concerns about patients jumping the line for vaccinations ahead of people who where higher priority for the shots. Now, Alameda County, California and the Washington State Department of Health have refused to give the company more doses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zs3Ucf"&gt;In many states, people who are older or who have underlying health conditions can get vaccinated now; younger, healthy people still have to wait. One Medical did not check to see if people who signed up for vaccine appointments through its systems were actually eligible, staffers said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ae4nH1"&gt;&lt;q&gt; One Medical did not check to see if people who signed up for vaccine appointments through its systems were actually eligible&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ozTE2B"&gt;“Why are young patients without health problems, on a trial membership ... allowed to book and receive a covid vaccine while healthcare workers are being waitlisted?” one medical professional asked in January in &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/02/24/970176532/high-end-medical-provider-let-ineligible-people-skip-covid-19-vaccine-line"&gt;messages obtained&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrnEBz"&gt;One Medical, which was backed by &lt;a href="https://www.gv.com/portfolio/"&gt;Alphabet’s GV&lt;/a&gt;, offers primary care to members in around a dozen cities across the United States for a $199 annual fee. The company went public in January 2020; as of today, its market capitalization is $7 billion. The company told &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt; that it doesn’t knowingly let people skip the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cD6BNw"&gt;The company’s vaccine scheduling system did not ask people to confirm if they were eligible under local guidelines until January 14th, two weeks after One Medical started offering vaccines. Once it &lt;em&gt;did ask&lt;/em&gt;, people who said they were not eligible could still book appointments. Blocking people from signing up would be too technologically difficult, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aqri2"&gt;“Scanning schedules and cancelling appointments [for ineligible patients] is not recommended,” said Spencer Blackman, the director of clinical education at the company, in a message to staff obtained by &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt;. Andrew Diamond, chief medical officer of One Medical, initially denied to &lt;em&gt;NPR&lt;/em&gt; that staff were directed not to verify eligibility. Later, he said One Medical has communicated more clearly since then. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aorbb0"&gt;After receiving complaints, the Washington State Department of Health stopped distributing COVID-19 vaccines to One Medical. Los Angeles County’s Department of Public Health warned One Medical that it would stop giving the company doses if it did not confirm patients’ vaccine eligibility. Alameda County, California said it did not give additional doses to One Medical after the company said it wanted to vaccinate people who were ineligible. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iRobot says it’ll be a few weeks until it can clean up its latest Roomba software update mess</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FwfarOXSaYMRQUZXvOqCnk4TtQ8=/0x0:1514x1009/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68868377/roomba.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: iRobot&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="veuX78"&gt;iRobot, maker of the robotic Roomba vacuums, has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that a software update has been causing issues for some users of its i7 and s9 robots and that it’s working on another one to prevent future issues. The catch? It might be a bit before things get sorted out, with iRobot expecting the update to roll out “over the next several weeks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SVXRuT"&gt;According to users on Reddit and Twitter, the recent 3.12.8 firmware update has been causing navigation issues. One user described their robot cleaner as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AnthonyVirtuoso/status/1363549503907840008"&gt;acting “drunk” after the update&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/lprthq/roomba_s9_weird_behaviour_on_version_3108/"&gt;spinning itself around and bumping into furniture&lt;/a&gt;, cleaning in strange patterns, getting stuck in an empty area, and not being able to make it home to the dock. What’s more, some other users are reporting that the environment maps their Roombas made were wiped out by the update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqQzLP"&gt;The severity of the issues ranges from Roombas now taking longer to clean the house to not being able to make it back to its charging station and thus barely working at all. And while iRobot has been working with affected customers to roll back the update, some are &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/lprthq/roomba_s9_weird_behaviour_on_version_3108/god45ep?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;reporting that they’re still experiencing issues&lt;/a&gt;. It’s possible they’ll have to wait until the new software update rolls out for the vacuums to start working properly again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJCqmU"&gt;One Reddit user &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/l3mdad/time_lapse_video_of_i7_attempting_to_return_to/?utm_content=title&amp;amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;amp;utm_name=38581dc349ec4744af0ae8bc36434bc2&amp;amp;utm_source=embedly&amp;amp;utm_term=l3mdad"&gt;took a time-lapse&lt;/a&gt; of their Roomba with the update, as it struggled and finally failed to make it home to its base station. The video shows the behavior &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/lq4mn3/irobot_app_software_and_s9_are_hot_garbage/"&gt;described by many&lt;/a&gt; other posters on the Roomba Reddit and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AnthonyVirtuoso/status/1363549503907840008"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/moodwrench/status/1363928861453525001"&gt;as well&lt;/a&gt;. One poster &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roomba/comments/lq4o3g/irobot_is_garbage_now/"&gt;detailed their support experience&lt;/a&gt;, saying they had waited two and a half weeks for the software update rolled back on their Roomba, and it still hadn’t happened. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The next Spider-Man movie will be titled Spider-Man: No Way Home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vwdoeT5oG9jnNT2AeQwvFDxAc9s=/120x0:3210x2060/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68868229/Screen_Shot_2021_02_24_at_12.44.10_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HxdgEZ"&gt;The next &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; movie starring Tom Holland will be titled &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt;. The movie will be out only in theaters on December 17th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LkR6Ts"&gt;The announcement was revealed on Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/spidermanmovie/status/1364631273226919937?s=21"&gt;on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yFpf4y"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This, we can confirm. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SpiderManNoWayHome?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SpiderManNoWayHome&lt;/a&gt; only in movie theaters this Christmas. &lt;a href="https://t.co/kCeI8Vgkdm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kCeI8Vgkdm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Spider-Man: No Way Home (@SpiderManMovie) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpiderManMovie/status/1364631273226919937?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4UZInp"&gt;Holland and co-stars Zendaya and Jacob Batalon teased fans on Tuesday by posting separate joke titles for the movie on Instagram: &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLpwqkqFaiS/"&gt;Holland’s: &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Phone Home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLp7M-SL6UQ/"&gt;Zendaya’s: &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Home Slice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLpxI_oFrp2/"&gt;Batalon’s: &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Home-Wrecker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. While the jokes may have been frustrating, the differing titles may also be hinting at the rumors that the movie will take place in some kind of &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; live-action film multiverse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2lAAl"&gt;There have even been reports that a few fan-favorite characters from past movies are coming back, lending further credence to the multiverse rumors. &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/12/alfred-molina-doctor-octopus-spider-man-3-1234652377/"&gt;Alfred Molina will reprise his role as Doctor Octopus&lt;/a&gt; (from the Tobey Maguire &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; movies), for example, and &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/spider-man-3-jolt-jamie-foxx-returning-as-electro-exclusive"&gt;Jamie Foxx will be back Electro&lt;/a&gt; (from the Andrew Garfield &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man&lt;/em&gt; movies). And Benedict Cumberbatch, who plays the time-bending and multiverse-seeing superhero Doctor Strange, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/benedict-cumberbatch-joins-spider-man-3-as-doctor-strange-exclusive"&gt;is set to appear in the movie as well&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcK34h"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a35401608/tom-holland-spider-man-3-cherry-cover-story/"&gt;recently published &lt;em&gt;Esquire&lt;/em&gt; interview&lt;/a&gt;, Holland denied that Maguire and Garfield would be appearing in the new movie — but we just don’t know if that’s a clever ruse to hide what would be two mind-melting cameos.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will match Google’s $1 billion news investment after Australia showdown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mHo09DKZBQZKKO5MM6xiH9I43-Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68868185/mdoying_180411_2400_0130still.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eAjQQQ"&gt;Facebook said it plans to invest an additional $1 billion in the news industry over the next three years as a sign of commitment to journalism, following the company’s unprecedented showdown with the government of Australia that involved briefly disabling the ability to read and share news for Australian Facebook users and publishers. The announcement was made as part of a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/the-real-story-of-what-happened-with-news-on-facebook-in-australia/"&gt;blog post from global policy chief Nick Clegg&lt;/a&gt; published on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wa0Ym4"&gt;“Facebook is more than willing to partner with news publishers. We absolutely recognize quality journalism is at the heart of how open societies function — informing and empowering citizens and holding the powerful to account,” Clegg writes. “That’s why we’ve invested $600 million since 2018 to support the news industry, and plan at least $1 billion more over the next three years.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yibvQ"&gt;The commitment matches the one Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/google-news-showcase/"&gt;made in October of last year&lt;/a&gt;, when the search giant announced it would start paying publishers to create specialized versions of stories and other forms of news content for its Google News Showcase platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sGD8b0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We absolutely recognize quality journalism is at the heart of how open societies function.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ES15xZ"&gt;Notable in this scenario, however, is the way both Facebook and Google reacted to the impending Australian media bargaining legislation that prompted such visceral reactions from the Silicon Valley titans. The law would have forced both companies to the negotiating table with news publishers to hammer out deals for paying for news content to be shared on both the main Facebook app and Google search. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kUNcaV"&gt;While Google initially threatened to shut off its services in the country, it eventually blinked in the negotiating stage and began &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/17/google-and-news-corp-strike-deal-as-australia-pushes-platforms-to-pay-for-news.html"&gt;cutting deals with media partners like Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook, on the other hand, did in fact shut off a portion of its service in Australia, in the form of disabling the sharing and reading of news links from both users and publishers for a brief few days starting last week. Facebook then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296778/facebook-ends-australian-news-ban-bargaining-code-google"&gt;reached an agreement&lt;/a&gt; with the Australian government earlier this week and restored the country’s access to news on its platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AcnwoO"&gt;According to Clegg, the company feels the proposed media bargaining law as it was designed prior to the recent compromise was unfair, mainly because it would put too much power in the hands of media conglomerates like Murdoch’s to extract ever-higher payments through a forced negotiation process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j3S97G"&gt;“At the heart of it, in Facebook’s view, is a fundamental misunderstanding of the relationship between Facebook and news publishers. It’s the publishers themselves who choose to share their stories on social media, or make them available to be shared by others, because they get value from doing so,” Clegg argues. “Facebook would have been forced to pay potentially unlimited amounts of money to multi-national media conglomerates under an arbitration system that deliberately misdescribes the relationship between publishers and Facebook — without even so much as a guarantee that it is used to pay for journalism, let alone support smaller publishers.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PGxlu"&gt;Facebook is now free to negotiate deals with news publishers for its Facebook News platform without the fear of forced arbitration, and Clegg says it plans to do that in Australia as it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248814/facebook-news-uk-launch-articles-tab-curated"&gt;currently doing in the UK, the US, and other markets&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook also retains the right to restrict news content for Australian publishers and users as it did last week, but the company has signaled it has no intent to do so if future negotiations remain in good faith. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Marvel’s Loki series will premiere on Disney Plus on June 11th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Ypc_eCnIPgq4I808iauhcRayoE=/533x0:2336x1202/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68868164/Screen_Shot_2021_02_24_at_12.21.03_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ar2Gng"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;, the Tom Hiddleston-starring series about Asgard’s god of mischief, will land on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/994499/9358?subId1=VergeDisneyPlusHitGoal021221&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; on June 11th, Marvel Studios announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RU0kvx"&gt;The series was described by Marvel Studios as a “crime thriller” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22168459/loki-trailer-marvel-studios-disney-plus-tom-hiddleston-release-date"&gt;in December&lt;/a&gt; during Disney’s big streaming investor day. It follows Loki as he faces off against the Time Variance Authority, otherwise known as as the TVA, following the events of &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;. The first trailer for the series was also released in December, and it saw Loki enter a bunch of different worlds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQZeKz"&gt;Marvel Studios is in a position where there are new shows all the time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22267989/wandavision-5th-episode-recap-sitcom-horror-disney-plus-streaming-crossover-multiverse"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Marvel Studios’ first big Disney Plus show, is nearing its end. The show has seen an incredible amount of success, trending weekly on Twitter and bringing in millions of subscribers every week within the US alone, according to Nielsen ratings. It will be followed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/21591343/falcon-winter-soldier-premiere-date-disney-plus-sebastian-stan-anthony-mackie-august"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, reuniting Anthony Mackie’s and Sebastian Stan’s characters in the events after &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;. That show will debut on March 19th. Then, &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgKNx5"&gt;With the new release date, it also firmly plants &lt;em&gt;Loki &lt;/em&gt;months after &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;is slated to hit theaters. More Marvel Studios content is slated for Disney Plus throughout the year, too, including &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="QzekXG"&gt;

    <title>Hyundai recalls Kona EVs over battery fire risk</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UhzCmNHGLhW1QLzjth9RQV0EDqk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68867982/akrales_180329_2351_1021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SZJ4IG"&gt;Hyundai is finally recalling some 76,000 Kona EVs built between 2018 and 2020 after more than a dozen reported fires related to the electric SUV’s battery pack. It’s the second recall of the Kona EV, but the first global recall, and it will cost Hyundai around $900 million to perform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlTSWh"&gt;Hyundai is also recalling some Ioniq EVs and electric buses built between November 2017 and March 2020 that use the same LG Chem cells. In total, the automaker is recalling 82,000 vehicles. Hyundai and LG Chem have decided to completely replace the batteries in these vehicles instead of trying to solve the issue through software updates, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/b742f5ec-44e2-4f3d-9a63-05662eab0f0b"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMAhX7"&gt;The recall is starting in South Korea, but Hyundai Motor North America told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;it will “be taking a similar action in the US and Canada.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMsezD"&gt;“We are working closely with NHTSA and Transport Canada on the recall and will communicate the details to affected customers shortly,” the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V2waPu"&gt;Reports of Kona EVs catching fire date back as far as mid-2019, and at least 15 have been documented since, &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/now-a-recalled-kona-ev-has-caught-fire-and-hyundai-is-1846134031"&gt;including one vehicle that was already called in for repair&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1ligg"&gt;The issue &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/489753/chevy-bolt-cells-different-separators-kona/"&gt;allegedly has to do with the material that separates the cell’s cathode and anode&lt;/a&gt;, though an official investigation in South Korea is still ongoing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3eWb8C"&gt;General Motors recently recalled nearly 70,000 Chevy Bolts that use LG Chem batteries after reports of fires, though the automaker &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/news/489753/chevy-bolt-cells-different-separators-kona/"&gt;clarified to &lt;em&gt;InsideEVs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it uses a different cell than the one in the Kona EV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RUC1aG"&gt;News of the recall comes just one day after Hyundai &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296991/hyundai-ioniq-5-electric-suv-ev-battery-range-specs"&gt;unveiled the Ioniq 5 crossover SUV&lt;/a&gt;, which will be the first EV built on the company’s new electric vehicle platform. That platform &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/02/23/hyundai-taps-catl-and-sk-innovation-to-supply-more-batteries-for-e-gmp/"&gt;will use battery cells from fellow Korean company SK Innovation as well as China’s CATL&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mlkkez"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update February 24th, 2021 11:48AM ET: Both the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22059832%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;murl=https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/xbox-series-x/consoles/products/xbox-series-x/B224744Y.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22059832%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;murl=https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/xbox-series-x/consoles/products/xbox-series-s-digital-edition/B224746K.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Series S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; are currently available at GameStop starting at $299.99. You can find more information &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22295791/xbox-series-x-s-restock-gamestop"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZoKH5"&gt;The Xbox Series S and Series X consoles are officially out, and if you missed out on preordering either (or both — look, I’m not going to judge), you might be able to snag one online soon. Due to the pandemic, combined with the high demand for these consoles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551484/best-buy-playstation-5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-store-sales-holiday-2020"&gt;retailers like Best Buy and Target are only selling online&lt;/a&gt;. That means you won’t be able to walk into a store to pick one up — unless you’ve purchased it already online. Only then will you be able to arrange an in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5s3rFB"&gt;Until we hear updates on stock replenishing from retailers, I recommend keeping it locked to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H75RTZ8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;amp;tag=verge-evergreen-20&amp;amp;linkId=e8ef14f64e0e9e1dacba6db0add8b578&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fxbox-series-x-video-games%2F-%2FN-fd2hh&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fpromotions%2Fgaming%2F20-1310%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, and (if you have memberships) &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-brand-showcase.html"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fprod24980179&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723309405282483811" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy encourages shoppers to visit its site&lt;/a&gt; to order instead of showing up at its stores. It doesn’t have set time slots for when it expects stock to be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lVxesu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="hLH7PZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ejjLHa"&gt;If you’re trying to decide between the Xbox Series S or Series X, my colleague Tom Warren recently reviewed both consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cqFv0O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"},{"title":"Xbox Series S review: small console, big potential","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h1 id="hCC7LP"&gt;Buy with the Xbox All Access plan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="tnxiJL"&gt;As an alternative to paying full price upfront for each console, you can pay a monthly installment for either of them through the Xbox All Access plan. It’s a financing option that lets you get the console upfront at no cost. You’ll be billed one monthly payment for the console and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate together ($24.99 per month for the Series S, $34.99 per month for the Series X) for 24 months.

  &lt;p id="ikctbP"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-series-x%2FB224744Y.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-series-s-digital-edition%2FB224746K.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Series S&lt;/a&gt; consoles have been available to purchase since last fall, but actually finding one to buy has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;extremely difficult&lt;/a&gt;. If you are looking to buy either console, GameStop has both models in stock, and they are available for preorder while supplies last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZpQOHY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cfRAwj"&gt;Regardless of which console you buy, you may want to consider picking up a few accessories that will help you get the most out of your new gadget, most notably &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF26MXW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an additional controller&lt;/a&gt; if you are playing a game with a local co-op with a friend or family member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v4Zgyt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562380"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P06Nfx"&gt;As far as storage goes, both consoles have rather limited storage. If you plan to download some older games that do not take full advantage of the next-gen hardware and don’t want to deplete your limited SSD storage, you can grab an external hard drive. You can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Game-Drive-Xbox-Special/dp/B072LX7WLP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;4TB external hard drive from Seagate for $100&lt;/a&gt;, and it includes two months of Xbox Game Pass, a Netflix-like digital video game subscription service for Xbox consoles. Or you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months of Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t have any games you’re interested in buying yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gpa4v9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546609"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QOq3lx"&gt;Of course, you can also upgrade your SSD as well, but there are a few things to keep in mind. Seagate is the only one with an SSD expansion card compatible with both consoles. Additionally, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SSD expansion card only comes in 1TB&lt;/a&gt;, and it is very expensive, costing $220. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SE84Lx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
