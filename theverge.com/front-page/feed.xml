    <title>Tesla turns another profit despite new Model S and Model X delay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Model Y " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l7DBsVvQRYsXKzilaChB9J20ScQ=/418x0:3582x2109/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69188993/0x0_Model_Y_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eZPwAT"&gt;Tesla has drawn a lot of scrutiny lately, has run into delays with the refreshed Model S and Model X, and the auto industry is struggling through a global shortage of semiconductors. But none of those things seemed to have much effect on Tesla’s business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyBR0j"&gt;On Monday, the Silicon Valley automaker &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471586/TSLA_Q1_2021_Update.pdf"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; its best-ever start to a year, despite not making a single Model S sedan or Model X SUV. That’s thanks in large part to the fact that Tesla continues to increase the number of Model 3s and Model Ys it makes and sells out of its year-old factory in Shanghai, China, validating CEO Elon Musk’s long-standing goal of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2018/11/30/18118451/tesla-gigafactory-nevada-video-elon-musk-jobs-model-3"&gt;localizing production in the world’s biggest markets for electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLgQlC"&gt;As a result, Tesla generated $10.4 billion in sales the first quarter, and recorded a $438 million profit. That’s basically double the revenue it generated in the first quarter of 2020, when Tesla had to temporarily shut down its factory in China due to the earliest outbreaks of the coronavirus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gLOAcB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A record first quarter despite shutting down Model S and Model X production&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="shT2R8"&gt;This is the seventh quarter in a row that Tesla has turned a profit, though the company was once again buoyed by selling emissions credits to other automakers. Tesla said Monday that it sold a record $518 million worth of regulatory credits, meaning that it would’ve finished the quarter in the red without them. Tesla presented the growth of regulatory credit sales as a positive in the presentation it published Monday. But many close followers of Tesla have been waiting for the moment when it’s able to turn a profit based on the products it sells. This was not that moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ytUDDM"&gt;Tesla also says it sold about $101 million worth of bitcoin in the first quarter. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272103/tesla-bitcoin-investment-1-5-billion-cryptocurrency-payments"&gt;announced in January that it had bought $1.5 billion worth of the cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; and started allowing customers to pay for cars using bitcoin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rOpHvI"&gt;
&lt;div id="datawrapper-rDVri" data-analytics-viewport="datawrapper" data-iframe-fallback="https://img.datawrapper.de/rDVri/full.png" data-iframe-fallback-width="600" data-iframe-fallback-height="600" data-iframe-fallback-alt="(billions in USD; green indicates profitable quarter)" data-iframe="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/rDVri/1/" data-iframe-width="600" data-iframe-height="600" data-iframe-layout="responsive" data-iframe-title="Tesla's quarterly revenue and profit/loss " data-iframe-resizable=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&amp;&amp;(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',function(){var i=document.createElement("iframe");var e=document.getElementById("datawrapper-rDVri");var t=e.dataset.iframeTitle||'Interactive graphic';i.setAttribute("src",e.dataset.iframe);i.setAttribute("title",t);i.setAttribute("frameborder","0");i.setAttribute("scrolling","no");i.setAttribute("aria-label",e.dataset.iframeFallbackAlt||t);i.setAttribute("title",t);i.setAttribute("height","400");i.setAttribute("id","datawrapper-chart-rDVri");i.style.minWidth="100%";i.style.border="none";e.appendChild(i)})}()&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R5Ll4z"&gt;This all comes at a time when Tesla is facing renewed scrutiny over the safeguards, or lack thereof, that govern the use of its Autopilot advanced driver assistance feature following a fatal crash in Texas. It’s still unclear whether Autopilot was involved in that crash, which killed two men. Even if it was, it’s very possible that the feature was misused due to early police reports that there was no one in the driver’s seat — something the company warns its customers against. But Musk’s brief claims about Tesla’s ability to stop people from misusing Autopilot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397546/tesla-autopilot-consumer-report-test-no-driver"&gt;have some obvious holes&lt;/a&gt;, federal safety investigators are now digging into what happened, and the crash &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397826/tesla-autopilot-investigation-blumenthal-markey-nhtsa-ntsb"&gt;has the attention&lt;/a&gt; of multiple &lt;a href="https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/transportation/article/Brady-urges-Tesla-to-cooperate-with-federal-crash-16124407.php"&gt;lawmakers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TjaWWK"&gt;Tesla didn’t make any Model S sedans or Model X SUVs in the first quarter because the company has been readying redesigned versions of each electric vehicle, which were announced in January. Those refreshed vehicles were supposed to start shipping in March, and Musk even said at the time that they would start coming off the line in February. But the company has either run into an issue retooling the production lines at its Fremont, California factory where the Model S and Model X are made, or something else is going on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TboQuU"&gt;Tesla did say Monday that the “[f]irst deliveries of the new Model S should start very shortly,” but didn’t specify what that means, or give any update on the refreshed Model X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KP9rTV"&gt;
&lt;div id="datawrapper-7F0ff" data-analytics-viewport="datawrapper" data-iframe-fallback="https://img.datawrapper.de/7F0ff/full.png" data-iframe-fallback-width="600" data-iframe-fallback-height="600" data-iframe-fallback-alt="" data-iframe="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/7F0ff/1/" data-iframe-width="600" data-iframe-height="600" data-iframe-layout="responsive" data-iframe-title="Tesla production / deliveries through Q1 2021" data-iframe-resizable=""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&amp;&amp;(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}});window.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',function(){var i=document.createElement("iframe");var e=document.getElementById("datawrapper-7F0ff");var t=e.dataset.iframeTitle||'Interactive graphic';i.setAttribute("src",e.dataset.iframe);i.setAttribute("title",t);i.setAttribute("frameborder","0");i.setAttribute("scrolling","no");i.setAttribute("aria-label",e.dataset.iframeFallbackAlt||t);i.setAttribute("title",t);i.setAttribute("height","400");i.setAttribute("id","datawrapper-chart-7F0ff");i.style.minWidth="100%";i.style.border="none";e.appendChild(i)})}()&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8cePLH"&gt;That Tesla had a strong quarter despite this delay is a testament to the importance of the new factory in China, as well as the general popularity of the Model 3 and Model Y. But while delays are nothing new in the world of Tesla, the company is, for now, leaving money on the table here, as the Model S and Model X generate more profit per car sold and the new versions are even more expensive. To wit, Tesla shared in January that the average selling price for all its cars dropped 11 percent in 2020 compared to 2019 because of the higher mix of Model 3 and Model Y sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQOXaT"&gt;The global chip shortage, meanwhile, has not hit Tesla as hard as it has some other automakers. The company said Monday that it was “able to navigate through global chip supply shortage issues in part by pivoting extremely quickly to new microcontrollers, while simultaneously developing firmware for new chips made by new suppliers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3Bgt5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oy2ivO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to change Siri’s voice in iOS 14.5 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wFsYk_I7SRkTLJ2YqLOOcBYLeUM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69067730/akrales_190522_3444_0017.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vvbuiG"&gt;Until recently, the default voice for Apple’s Siri assistant has been stereotypically female-sounding. However, studies have found that having AI assistants default to female-sounding voices can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634322/amazon-alexa-apple-siri-female-voice-assistants-harmful-gender-stereotypes-new-study"&gt;reinforce harmful stereotypes&lt;/a&gt;, so Apple has tried to fix that in its upcoming iOS 14.5.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6KGYdg"&gt;Starting with iOS 14.5, when you get a new phone, you’ll be prompted to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360502/apple-siri-female-voice-default-new-voices-ios-14-5"&gt;pick a default voice for Siri&lt;/a&gt; — and Apple is including two new voice options. But if you’ve updated your current phone to 14.5, you don’t have to wait. This guide will show you how to change the voice after setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhB1LI"&gt;It’s a reasonably simple process. First, go to the Settings app, then to Siri &amp;amp; Search, and tap Siri Voice. There, you’ll be presented with the list of options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/583JirAdCoNcghR8xipu6St_0-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22416486/Image.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap Siri Voice to be taken to the list of options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mph8AS"&gt;At the moment, the American variety is the only one with four voice choices; Australian, British, Indian, Irish, and South African versions only have two. The four US voice choices are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yS4oPO"&gt;Voice 1, which is a soft-spoken male-sounding voice &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="swUqtC"&gt;Voice 2, an energetic, confident female-sounding voice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l6YrCC"&gt;Voice 3 is similar to Voice 2 but male-sounding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OtUBen"&gt;And finally, Voice 4, which is similar to the default Siri voice that’s been around all these years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="tZcBH0"&gt;If you want to hear what the voices sound like for yourself, they’re in the embedded tweet below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u8ZG9v"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Siri's new voice options in the latest iOS 14.5 Beta &lt;a href="https://t.co/25pUA8kP7V"&gt;pic.twitter.com/25pUA8kP7V&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1378024607962128384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P5h6cp"&gt;Tapping on a voice will play a snippet of it saying “Hi, I’m Siri. Choose the voice you’d like me to use.” If you choose voices 1–3, your phone will have to download them before you can use them, but you don’t have to stay in the Settings app while it does so. Once it’s finished downloading, Siri will respond with your chosen voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QlKF9C"&gt;If you’ve just updated to macOS 11.3, you can also select from the new options by going to System Preferences, then Siri. From there, you can choose the voice you want to use.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Siri voices have come to macOS as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>The macOS 11.3 update includes a massive security patch and new emoji</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new MacBook Air with the M1 chip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6mKe_exYNCZlsrBguqFyi40pdi8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69188772/vpavic_4291_20201113_0366.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q3HA91"&gt;Apple has just released macOS 11.3, alongside iOS 14.5. It’s probably worth updating your Mac to it as soon as you can — not only because it comes with some new features, including improvements for running iPhone and iPad apps on M1 Macs and updates to Apple Music and Podcasts, but it also fixes a major security flaw.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RgAIa"&gt;The update &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/apple-macos-113-patches-security-flaw-vulnerability/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Mashable+%28Mashable%29"&gt;reportedly patches a vulnerability&lt;/a&gt; that allowed malware to bypass many of macOS’s built-in protections, like File Quarantine and GateKeeper’s opening dialog box. While Apple’s built-in anti-malware system could &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/26/shlayer-mac-malware-macos-security/"&gt;still block malicious programs if Apple were aware of them&lt;/a&gt;, enterprise software company Jamf did find evidence that the security flaw &lt;a href="https://www.jamf.com/blog/shlayer-malware-abusing-gatekeeper-bypass-on-macos/"&gt;was being exploited by attackers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sd3MC7"&gt;Apple also &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212325"&gt;details a slew of other security fixes&lt;/a&gt; that are included with the latest update on its security update page. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222"&gt;Catalina and Mojave&lt;/a&gt; have received security patches as well, for those who haven’t yet updated to Big Sur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5sqa92"&gt;Aside from security updates, one of the biggest new improvements in 11.3 (at least for owners of M1 Macs) is the ability to resize iPhone and iPad app windows. Apple’s also added keyboard, mouse, and trackpad support for games that are compatible with controllers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rYZejN98nU34EvibuyHdn9myDrs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471373/Screen_Shot_2021_04_26_at_12.18.55_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The infinity symbol in the queue controls the Autoplay feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="adDieb"&gt;Apple has also added autoplay to the Music app — a feature which is either great or annoying depending on your mood. After you reach the end of a song or playlist, Apple Music will continue playing music that it thinks is similar (thankfully, it can be turned off if you’re just looking to listen to one specific song). The News and Podcasts apps also have redesigned pages to make them easier to use (with the former getting a reworked search feature — something that’s exciting to me, and possibly no one else).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHAOre"&gt;The update also adds many of the features that are in iOS 14.5: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;ability to track AirTags&lt;/a&gt; using the Find My app, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285963/apple-emoji-ios-14-5-smiley-faces-hearts-more-skin-tones"&gt;new emoji&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360502/apple-siri-female-voice-default-new-voices-ios-14-5"&gt;Siri voices&lt;/a&gt;, and support for the Xbox Series X / S and PlayStation 5 DualSense controllers. You can visit Apple’s site to &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211896"&gt;see the entire list of updates and features&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: You can apparently still lose jobs and get arrested for an overdue VHS rental </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nt_t7gEnm3_yNiqr6sNeyh50sEg=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69188730/the_verge_vhs_3_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gQcTD1"&gt;Ever mysteriously lost a job opportunity? Did they treat you like a criminal? Better check to see if your family forgot to return a VHS tape 22 years ago! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qelH6"&gt;As utterly ridiculous as that sounds, it’s apparently &lt;a href="https://okcfox.com/news/local/oklahoma-woman-charged-with-felony-for-not-returning-vhs-tape-21-years-ago"&gt;the true story&lt;/a&gt; of Texas woman Caron McBride, who had a warrant out for her arrest in Oklahoma for felony embezzlement — all because a movie store thought she rented a copy of &lt;em&gt;Sabrina and the Teenage Witch&lt;/em&gt; in 1999 and never bothered to bring it back. Never mind that the store in question (“Movie Place”) closed in 2008, or that VHS is such a dated tech that even the last Japanese manufacturer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/7/21/12244094/japan-stops-vcr-production-funai"&gt;finally stopped producing the players&lt;/a&gt; five years back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDfnF1"&gt;McBride &lt;a href="https://okcfox.com/news/local/oklahoma-woman-charged-with-felony-for-not-returning-vhs-tape-21-years-ago"&gt;told local Fox News affiliate KOKH&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/woman-hit-with-embezzlement-charges-for-20-year-old-ove-1846764009"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) that she had no idea this tape even existed and never would have picked it — “just not my cup of tea” — but thinks maybe a man she used to live with at the time could have rented it for his two kids. She only found out about the out-of-state warrant when she tried to change the name on her driver’s license after getting married in Texas. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;There was a lot of hype about carbon capture and green hydrogen at Joe Biden’s climate summit&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GsX4Om"&gt;At last week’s climate summit, there was a lot of talk about climate tech and how it could help countries meet their splashy new climate goals. A couple of the emerging technologies that got the most hype — carbon capture and green hydrogen — already have somewhat of a checkered track record. But leaders from big economies like Japan, Australia, Russia, and the US still hailed them as the key to slashing greenhouse gas emissions from some of the peskiest polluting industries.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QtCElZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’ve got to be constantly original and optimistic about new technology” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h8KKUT"&gt;“We’ve got to be constantly original and optimistic about new technology,” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said during the summit. “We need the scientists and all of our countries to work together to produce the technological solutions that humanity is going to need — whether it’s carbon capture and storage, or solving the problems of cheap hydrogen delivery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rl9eZ9"&gt;President Joe Biden’s virtual climate summit was aimed at encouraging individual countries to raise their climate ambitions. Last week, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22394366/joe-biden-pledge-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2030"&gt;US committed&lt;/a&gt; to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions this decade by roughly half compared to peak polluting levels. Japan and Canada made similar announcements, while the UK announced a bigger reduction goal for 2035. It’s all part of a race to do what scientists have &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;found is necessary&lt;/a&gt; to prevent the worst effects of climate change: get greenhouse gas emissions near zero by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lfnc1f"&gt;None of those goals can be achieved without switching out fossil fuels with renewable energy. That’s definitely the case for some of the biggest sources of planet-heating carbon dioxide emissions — like the power sector, which can swap coal and natural gas for wind turbines and solar panels. But some industries, like construction and shipping will have a much harder time getting rid of their emissions through renewables. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="l7RkbZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What carbon capture technologies and green hydrogen might actually be able to achieve&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aBZXMU"&gt;For these so-called “hard-to-decarbonize” industries, alternative fuel like green hydrogen or technologies that capture their CO2 emissions &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; offer a solution. But they’ll need to be developed and deployed carefully to avoid pitfalls that could derail the efforts to wean the world off fossil fuels. Take a look at what carbon capture technologies and green hydrogen might actually be able to achieve, along with some caveats.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RXc44a"&gt;Carbon capture&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lxMIeX"&gt;Carbon capture technologies can scrub CO2 out of polluters’ emissions so that it doesn’t enter the atmosphere in the first place. The technology can be added to a coal-fired power plant or steel mill, where it separates carbon dioxide from other gases. The carbon dioxide can be compressed and transported so that it can be stored in underground reservoirs or packaged as a commodity to be used in things like &lt;a href="https://grist.org/article/direct-air-carbon-capture-global-thermostat/"&gt;soda pop&lt;/a&gt;. The White House released a &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Innovation-Investment-and-Inclusion-CEA-April-23-2021-1.pdf"&gt;white paper&lt;/a&gt; on Friday that describes its potential for cleaning up industries like steel and cement — sectors that will likely play a big role in building out clean energy infrastructure, but which release a lot of CO2 in the process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlJhUN"&gt;“Retrofitting our existing manufacturing infrastructure with these carbon capture and storage projects is where we’re going to get the biggest bang for our buck on the climate,” says Noah Deich, president of the nonprofit Carbon180, which advocates for the carbon removal technologies. We might be able to make these things without generating carbon dioxide within a couple decades, he says, but we don’t have the time to wait for that to happen. Getting rid of carbon dioxide released from cement manufacturing alone would be enormous progress; it would take a hefty &lt;a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/qa-why-cement-emissions-matter-for-climate-change"&gt;8 percent&lt;/a&gt; chunk out of global emissions.  &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The NRG Energy Inc. WA Parish generating station stands in Thompsons, Texas, on Thursday, Feb. 16th, 2017. The plant is home to the Petra Nova Carbon Capture Project, a joint venture between NRG Energy and JX Nippon Oil &amp;amp; Gas Exploration Corp., which reportedly captures and repurposes more than 90 percent of its own CO2 emissions — until it shutters later this year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lXSJz1"&gt;The Department of Energy announced &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/articles/doe-announces-1095-million-support-jobs-and-economic-growth-coal-and-power-plant"&gt;$75 million&lt;/a&gt; in funding on April 23rd for carbon capture projects that could be used for steel, cement, or power plants. For some experts and environmental advocates, using carbon capture in the steel and cement industries makes sense — it’s when carbon capture gets paired with fossil-fueled power plants where the strategy can run into trouble. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmvM6t"&gt;While capturing carbon from polluting power plants helps avoid climate disaster, it doesn’t necessarily address the environmental destruction caused by drilling, mining, and fracking for fossil fuel. Nor does it eliminate the dangers, like spills and other pollution, which worries many people living in communities near pipelines and fossil fuel infrastructure. Captured carbon can also be shot into the ground to extract hard-to-reach fossil fuel reserves, perpetuating a polluting cycle. It’s no wonder, then, that oil companies and big oil-producing countries like the United Arab Emirates are promoting this tech. That’s why critics like Bernie Sanders and environmental justice groups have called carbon capture a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/22/20828794/bernie-sanders-green-new-deal-2020-elections-climate-change"&gt;false solution.&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="W8Hr3N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Environmental justice groups have called carbon capture a “false solution” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rHmfaU"&gt;Carbon capture technology is also still very expensive, so much so that mounting costs led the only carbon capture coal plant in the US to &lt;a href="https://earther.gizmodo.com/the-only-carbon-capture-plant-in-the-u-s-just-closed-1846177778"&gt;shutter&lt;/a&gt; this year. “It teaches us a lot of lessons about what types of carbon capture projects make the most sense in the long run,” Deich says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tTHIcw"&gt;Carbon capture enthusiasts, however, believe costs will fall as the technology improves and more people adopt it, just as they did for renewable energy. Major investment — from governments or the private sector — could add to that trend. American tech companies have embraced similar technologies that pull carbon dioxide directly out of the atmosphere. So-called carbon removal or negative emissions tech is even more fledgling, but it doesn’t need to be tied to a source of pollution to yield CO2 reductions. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254483/microsoft-climate-change-pledge-update-carbon-dioxide-removal"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21537247/stripe-customers-carbon-capture-projects-climate-change"&gt;Stripe&lt;/a&gt; have pledged to use it to cancel out their emissions using it, and their buy-in is crucial to bringing down the exorbitant costs still associated with the technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2hezJV"&gt;Hydrogen&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DQJZUV"&gt;On the other side of the world, green hydrogen is making a splash. “In the United States, you have the Silicon Valley. Here in Australia, we are creating our own hydrogen valleys where we will transform our transport industries, our mining and resource sectors, our manufacturing, and our fuel and energy production,” Australia Prime Minister Scott Morrison said during the first day of the summit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dRttLq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Here in Australia, we are creating our own hydrogen valleys “&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Dd1WZ"&gt;So what is green hydrogen and how can it do all those things Morrison says it will? Hydrogen as a fuel has actually been around for a long time, but it’s been getting a lot more hype lately because of the rising demand for clean energy. Hydrogen fuel releases water when burned, but its carbon footprint actually depends on how the fuel is made. It can be made through electrolysis: splitting water to get to the hydrogen. Or it can be made through a process in which steam reacts with some kind of fossil fuel — usually gas — to separate out the hydrogen.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzYnA7"&gt;Crucially, it’s starting to get cheaper to make &lt;em&gt;green&lt;/em&gt; hydrogen — which is made using electrolysis powered by renewable energy. Then there’s “blue” hydrogen that’s really just  hydrogen made using fossil fuels paired with carbon capture, which comes with some of the same concerns as carbon capture paired with dirty power plants. Most hydrogen fuel is still &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/the-future-of-hydrogen"&gt;made with natural gas&lt;/a&gt;, so turning it into blue hydrogen could give the gas industry a crutch in a future where fossil fuels aren’t as common. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;August 28th, 2020, North Rhine-Westphalia, Duisburg: A steel worker stands in front of a steel sheet coil on the ThyssenKrupp site. ThyssenKrupp aims to achieve climate-neutral steel production by 2050. One step toward this goal will be the switch to direct reduction plants, which will in the future be operated with green hydrogen. The first such plant from ThyssenKrupp is scheduled to start operation at the Duisburg site in the mid-2020s. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JEjNrK"&gt;In a future that avoids climate catastrophe, green (and, some say, blue) hydrogen might help power ships and planes. It could even replace coke and coal in steel and cement manufacturing. But while it holds a lot of promise, hydrogen is expensive, explosive, and difficult to transport. On the last day of the summit, US Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm set a goal of cutting hydrogen costs by 80 percent by 2030 to make it “competitive with natural gas.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Hydrogen also needs a lot of investment in new pipelines, fueling stations, and storage. All of those things have held it back in the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Amcy1C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Every week is infrastructure week”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BnJAac"&gt;That lack of infrastructure has stalled the development of hydrogen-powered cars, so the future of ground transportation is increasingly electric. But container shipping is one potential bright spot for hydrogen. With &lt;a href="https://www.oecd.org/ocean/topics/ocean-shipping/"&gt;90 percent&lt;/a&gt; of global trade transported by sea, shipping accounts for about 3 percent of global emissions (slightly more than the aviation industry). The International Maritime Organization set a &lt;a href="https://www.imo.org/en/MediaCentre/HotTopics/Pages/Reducing-greenhouse-gas-emissions-from-ships.aspx"&gt;target&lt;/a&gt; of halving the industry’s emissions by 2050, a goal that will likely depend on the availability of alternative fuels like hydrogen — especially since batteries aren’t advanced enough to power ships the size of skyscrapers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtoBuL"&gt;To overcome the hurdles that have stood in hydrogen’s way in the past — between now and 2050, when economies are supposed to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions — “every week is infrastructure week,” says Julio Friedmann, a senior research scholar at Columbia University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="DXigG7"&gt;The same could be said for nearly every piece of the future clean energy economy — whether it’s green hydrogen, carbon capture, or clean energy. And while hydrogen and carbon capture might play supporting roles in efforts to avert a deeper climate crisis, they’re still no replacement for expediting the transition from fossil fuels to more renewable energy. Australia, for example, still has a lot of work to do on all fronts. It has abundant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18715585/tesla-australia-renewable-energy-houses-electrical-grid-battery-installation"&gt;solar&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/14/green-giants-the-massive-projects-that-could-make-australia-a-clean-energy-superpower"&gt;and wind&lt;/a&gt; resources, which Friedmann says is a boon for the country’s green hydrogen ambitions. But the country still &lt;a href="https://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/energy/basics"&gt;primarily relies on coal&lt;/a&gt; for its electricity generation. So Australia, like the rest of the world, will need to find the right balance of phasing out the old and bringing in the new to usher in a more sustainable future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola is once again announcing a low-cost phone with a 90Hz screen and a huge battery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PVlxPPCbd814-L4_xh2OWW_TEoY=/1x0:1396x930/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69188600/moto_g20.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Motorola Moto G20 features a large 5,000mAh battery and a faster-than-standard 90Hz 6.5-inch display.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Motorola&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KnGKty"&gt;Motorola has announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350611/motorola-g100-g50-launch-price-specs"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286048/motorola-moto-g30-moto-g10-90hz-screen-price-launch"&gt;low-cost devices&lt;/a&gt; with big batteries and fast-refreshing displays this year, and now it’s offering its least expensive model yet: the Moto G20. Launching in Europe this week for €149 (about $180), it includes a 6.5-inch 720p LCD with a 90Hz refresh rate and a 5,000mAh battery. It’s the latest in a series of budget devices from Motorola targeting slightly different price points in the budget range, and it would likely have a place in the US market if the company chose to offer it in the States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2d7kDh"&gt;The G20 features a 48-megapixel main camera, 8-megapixel ultrawide, 2-megapixel macro and depth-sensing cameras, and a 13-megapixel selfie camera. Unlike other Moto G-series phones launched this year, the G20 does not use a Snapdragon chipset, offering instead a Unisoc T700 processor with 4GB of RAM. The device’s built-in storage of 64GB or 128GB can be expanded via microSD, and it will ship with Android 11. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HpnZsKY4IFjbz2eAxNzW51i6lR0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471191/156439_1200_auto.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Motorola&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G20 includes a 48-megapixel main camera along with an ultrawide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="i5vYLX"&gt;There’s no indication whether the G20 will be sold in the US — the G100, G50, and G30 introduced earlier this year haven’t been offered stateside as of yet either. Motorola’s current US offerings are largely situated above the $200 mark, and there are &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/three-motorola-edge-flagships-coming-one-with-108mp-camera_id131722"&gt;rumblings&lt;/a&gt; that high-end Edge devices may be coming next. But with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/11/22375938/lg-smartphone-business-exit-tcl-motorola"&gt;the void LG is leaving&lt;/a&gt; at the budget end of the market, Motorola certainly has a full portfolio of devices it could offer if it wanted to try to fill the gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzEO9B"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is adding a COVID-19 vaccine fact box box to users’ timelines</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mTWDC1czYHs-N_X61yCHqnOgG08=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69188578/acastro_180130_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2OTCzp"&gt;Twitter is adding a new prompt to users’ timelines to help promote the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination effort, providing users around the world with the “latest vaccine info” in their particular country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZZyM5"&gt;The new notice appears as a massive unmissable box at the top of users’ Twitter feeds on the iOS and Android apps, prompting users to “make sure you have the most up-to-date information on the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccinations.” (The prompt is so large that on my iPhone 12 Pro, it obscured all but a single tweet when I opened the app.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r_MiUEiYOfYCczLtMrsuGTTCeeE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471260/Untitled.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FJIxYX"&gt;Tapping that link takes you to a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1353046517142016001?s=21"&gt;new Twitter event page&lt;/a&gt; with information about the vaccines, shown as a series of collected tweets from organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), at least in the US. The guide is broken up into several sections, into details on vaccine efficacy, potential side effects, advice for pregnant people, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mm4ZaX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As COVID-19 vaccinations become more widely available, we want you to have access to the latest vaccine info in your country.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This week you’ll see a prompt in your timeline that links to sources about vaccine safety, efficacy, and news from public health experts.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1386676306369253378?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2BT0bf"&gt;It’s the latest effort by a major tech company to help promote the COVID-19 vaccines and provide useful and accurate information to users. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379710/facebook-us-state-covid-19-vaccine-information"&gt;Facebook has recently added&lt;/a&gt; state-by-state vaccination information to its News Feed for US users, for example, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379710/facebook-us-state-covid-19-vaccine-information"&gt;YouTube is running an ad campaign&lt;/a&gt; of PSAs to encourage people to get their shots. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA says FIFA mode with loot boxes is the ‘cornerstone’ of the franchise in leaked documents </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BC7iVVFxXRYeUCxPysXt6yolyNc=/0x0:1266x844/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69188433/fifa_21_next_level_4kscreenshot_taa.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;FIFA 21&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Electronic Arts&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="omJlNK"&gt;Electronic Arts wants to push &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt; players to the FIFA Ultimate Team (FUT) mode, which lets people spend real-world money and in-game currency to buy loot boxes with virtual athletes, according to documents &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/gopublic/fifa21-loot-boxes-electronic-arts-1.5996912"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;CBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Loot boxes, which typically offer random collections of virtual goods with the tantalizing (and often very small) chance of winning something that could give you an advantage in a game, can bring in piles of money for studios but have come under criticism for being linked to gambling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cuAxjG"&gt;You can read two of the documents &lt;em&gt;CBC News&lt;/em&gt; had access to &lt;a href="https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/20690561/ea_merged.pdf"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;, which appear to be taken from an internal EA presentation. In one, EA says that “FUT is the cornerstone and we are doing everything we can to drive players there.” In another, one section, headlined “All roads lead to FUT,” says that teasers and targeted messaging will “drive excitement &amp;amp; funnel players toward FUT from other modes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="buh8Yg"&gt;A separate document apparently referred to FIFA’s in-game currency as “grind currency,” according to &lt;em&gt;CBC News&lt;/em&gt;. The publication says that the information was shared by a “gaming insider.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F2UQrD"&gt;Here was EA’s response to &lt;em&gt;CBC News&lt;/em&gt; about the 54-page document — the studio says that the documents are being viewed without context:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OYKwmA"&gt;An EA spokesperson declined an interview request and wouldn’t comment on the document, which, he noted, was “marked privileged and confidential,” other than to say it is being “viewed without context” and that interpretations of what it says “are misinformed.” When asked to clarify, he did not respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFt9F3"&gt;“All EA games can be played without spending on in-game items, and the majority of players do not spend,” Charlie Fortescue said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VQCici"&gt;And regarding the term “grind currency,” an EA spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;CBC News&lt;/em&gt; that “‘grind currency’ is not a term we typically use.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5vtW0"&gt;Loot boxes have been scrutinized for their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18226852/loot-boxes-gaming-regulation-gambling-free-to-play"&gt;links to gambling for years&lt;/a&gt;, and many publishers have shifted how they sell in-game items in response to criticisms. Epic Games removed blind draw loot boxes in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; “Save the World” mode &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295676/epic-games-fortnite-loot-box-lawsuit-settlement-rocket-league-v-bucks"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and now allows players to see what’s inside them before purchase. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21154809/destiny-2-paid-cosmetic-loot-boxes-fortnite-style-season-battle-pass-ending"&gt;Bungie removed paid loot boxes from &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. And EA removed in-game purchases from &lt;em&gt;Star Wars Battlefront 2&lt;/em&gt; just &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/16/16668234/battlefront-2-loot-boxes-crystal-microtransaction"&gt;hours before the game’s release in 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; which would have let people buy a special currency that could be used to purchase loot boxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x19634"&gt;Months after the &lt;em&gt;Battlefront 2&lt;/em&gt; controversy, EA’s former chief design officer, Patrick Söderlund, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/13/17230874/ea-star-wars-battlefront-2-loot-box-patrick-soderlund-interview"&gt;vowed that EA&lt;/a&gt; would learn from mistakes and “be better.” But it seems that &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt;’s loot boxes in FUT have been valuable enough to EA that the studio will continue to push players toward the mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9PY3T"&gt;EA has not responded to a request for comment. If you know more about EA or other companies’ plans for loot boxes that you want to share with us, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/a/tip-us-secure-contact-email"&gt;please send us a tip&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Oz8VJ"&gt;YouTube is &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/covid-19-vaccines-get-back-what-you-love/"&gt;launching a series&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19 vaccine public service announcements, calling it the “first chapter” of a partnership with the London School of Hygiene &amp;amp; Tropical Medicine’s Vaccine Confidence Project. The ads will start running in the US today and roll out internationally in coming weeks, coinciding with local vaccine availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWG9l5"&gt;YouTube posted a dozen 16-second videos &lt;a href="http://youtube.com/vaccineinfo"&gt;on the company’s channel&lt;/a&gt;, as well as two 31-second clips (one in English, one in Spanish) and a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4ziIcbb4xI"&gt;longer compilation&lt;/a&gt; stringing them together. The messages encourage people to “get back to what you love” by getting the vaccine, offering reasons like “because birthday songs,” “because roller coasters,” “because wedding receptions,” and “because everything.” YouTube says they’ll run across its platform — as well as television, radio, and paid social posts — through July, aiming to reach Americans between the ages of 18 to 34.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VNaNOY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m4ziIcbb4xI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oe7QnP"&gt;All US adults are eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine, and half the adult population has received at least one dose. But vaccination rates have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/25/world/coronavirus-cases-rising-vaccine-rates-dropping.html"&gt;slowed markedly&lt;/a&gt; in the past weeks. The slowdown coincided with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399228/covid-vaccine-johnson-pause-lifted-fda-cdc"&gt;a now-lifted pause&lt;/a&gt; on the one-dose Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot, but it may also reflect the need to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/us/politics/coronavirus-vaccine-rates.html"&gt;make vaccination easier and more attractive&lt;/a&gt; for people who weren’t in the first rush of dedicated vaccine hunters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xnNMK"&gt;YouTube says its campaign is aimed at “making sure that people have access to reliable information about the vaccine, including how it was developed and tested, what they can expect when they get the vaccine, and how every person plays a part in the public’s health.” Its blog directs people to earlier vaccine-focused videos with health experts, but the new videos primarily focus on vaccines’ potential to restore “a more normal way of life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIqFUu"&gt;Social networks, including YouTube, have spent recent years reactively &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573019/youtube-information-panels-fact-check-boxes-covid-19-vaccination-misinformation"&gt;addressing anti-vaccination content&lt;/a&gt; on their platforms. As COVID-19 vaccines have begun rolling out in the US, the Biden administration has encouraged the platforms to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/18/22391004/twitter-facebook-snap-white-house-vaccine-campaign"&gt;promote news about the shots&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379710/facebook-us-state-covid-19-vaccine-information"&gt;state-level vaccine information&lt;/a&gt; to its News Feed earlier this month, and Twitter recently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1353046517142016001?s=21"&gt;added a prompt&lt;/a&gt; with info from the World Health Organization and other public health agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to unlock your iOS 14.5 iPhone with your Apple Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oMdFEphfvF9abukIpdfb71urPwg=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69188189/DSCF2033.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BkliOm"&gt;Apple’s iOS 14.5 is out, and with it comes the ability to have your Apple Watch unlock your Face ID-protected phone if you happen to be wearing a mask. This will make it a lot easier to get through your day without having to enter your passcode each time you need to use your phone (because the Face ID can’t recognize you with that mask on). As long as your phone and watch are in close proximity, you will be able to unlock your iPhone just by turning on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMLEZg"&gt;Once you’re officially running iOS 14.5 (and watchOS 7.4), it’s easy to enable the feature that lets you unlock your iPhone with your watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n9cWI3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10322418"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="huAMks"&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Face ID &amp;amp; Passcode, and scroll down to the new Unlock With Apple Watch option. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jJTFRE"&gt;Toggle it on to turn on the feature. (There’s nothing you have to do on the watch.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="JPijRY"&gt;Now that you have it installed, here’s what you can expect. First, and most important to note, is that your phone isn’t looking for &lt;em&gt;your &lt;/em&gt;face with a mask, it’s looking for &lt;em&gt;a &lt;/em&gt;face with a mask. With this feature on, when my wife was wearing a mask, she was able to unlock my phone with no problem if I was within three or so feet. Apple even warns you about this when you turn the feature on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EpD-gKQYBs0Zk8CSxCmgskqnpas=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471051/IMG_1328.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple warns you about the fact that your phone will only be looking for a face with a mask. (Note: “Beagle” is the name of my Apple Watch)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mVPWWS"&gt;Apple’s mitigation to this is whenever your Apple Watch is used to unlock your phone, the watch buzzes you, along with a notification saying your phone has been unlocked and a button to lock it. Pressing that lock button immediately locks your phone and requires a passcode on next unlock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="csLdnt"&gt;With that caveat out of the way, so far I’ve had great success with the feature. I tried it with a variety of masks, and it worked with all of them for me. It is worth noting again that the phone is looking for a face with a mask, so this feature won’t help you if your phone is lying on the table and you try to unlock it — because the Face ID camera can’t see you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fteXGe"&gt;Still, I find that not having to put in my passcode every time I want to check my grocery list while shopping is a huge benefit and worth what I consider to be a relatively minor security trade-off. The feature may not be for those with super-secret info on their phones, but for everyone else it’ll be a nice quality-of-life improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
