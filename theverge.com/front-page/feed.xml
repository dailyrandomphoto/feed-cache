  &lt;p&gt;How the company found itself in its biggest crisis since Cambridge Analytica&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Fs70Fs"&gt;A week ago, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; began to publish a series of stories about Facebook based on the internal findings of the company’s researchers. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;The Facebook Files&lt;/a&gt;, as they are known, lay out a dizzying number of problems unfolding on the world’s biggest social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQW7MZ"&gt;The stories detail &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-files-xcheck-zuckerberg-elite-rules-11631541353?mod=article_inline"&gt;an opaque, separate system of government for elite users&lt;/a&gt; known as XCheck; provide evidence that &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739?mod=article_inline"&gt;Instagram can be harmful to a significant percentage of teenage girls&lt;/a&gt;; and reveal that &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-algorithm-change-zuckerberg-11631654215?mod=article_inline"&gt;entire political parties have changed their policies&lt;/a&gt; in response to changes in the News Feed algorithm. The stories also &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-drug-cartels-human-traffickers-response-is-weak-documents-11631812953?mod=article_inline"&gt;uncovered massive inequality in how Facebook moderates content in foreign countries&lt;/a&gt; compared to the investment it has made in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bjm37o"&gt;The stories have galvanized public attention, and members of Congress &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/senators-seek-answers-from-facebook-after-wsj-report-on-instagrams-impact-on-young-users-11631664695"&gt;have announced a probe&lt;/a&gt;. And scrutiny is growing as reporters at other outlets contribute material of their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxFRsK"&gt;For instance: &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt; found that despite Facebook’s significant investment in security, by October 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/16/1035851/facebook-troll-farms-report-us-2020-election/"&gt;Eastern European troll farms reached 140 million people a month with propaganda&lt;/a&gt; — and 75 percent of those users saw it not because they followed a page but because Facebook’s recommendation engine served it to them. &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; investigated Facebook Marketplace and &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-grew-marketplace-to-1-billion-users-now-scammers-are-using-it-to-target-people-around-the-world"&gt;found thousands of fake accounts participating in a wide variety of scams&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; revealed that Facebook has sought to improve its reputation in part &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/21/technology/zuckerberg-facebook-project-amplify.html"&gt;by pumping pro-Facebook stories into the News Feed&lt;/a&gt;, an effort known as “Project Amplify.” (To date this has only been tested in three cities, and it’s not clear whether it will continue.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ienlG6"&gt;Most Facebook scandals come and go. But this one feels different than Facebook scandals of the past, because it has been led by Facebook’s own workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="colYiv"&gt;
&lt;p id="CuX98e"&gt;The last time Facebook found itself under this much public scrutiny was 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17165130/facebook-cambridge-analytica-scandal"&gt;when the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal&lt;/a&gt; rocked the company. It was a strange scandal for many reasons, not least of which was the fact that most of its details had been reported years previously. What turned it into an international story was the idea that political operatives had sought to use Facebook’s vast trove of demographic data in an effort to manipulate Americans into voting for Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wwcrky"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook ads get people to buy — but not change their politics?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jOP7aJ"&gt;Today nearly everyone agrees that what Cambridge Analytica called “&lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2018/3/23/17152564/cambridge-analytica-psychographic-microtargeting-what"&gt;psychographic targeting&lt;/a&gt;” was overblown marketing spin. But the idea that Facebook and other social networks are gradually reshaping whole societies with their data collection, advertising practices, ranking algorithms and engagement metrics has largely stuck. Facebook is an all-time great business because its ads are so effective in getting people to buy things. And yet the company wants us to believe it isn’t similarly effective at getting people to change their politics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CcFw0G"&gt;There’s a disconnect there, one that the company has never really resolved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FaaNw"&gt;Still, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-21/facebook-says-it-has-spent-13-billion-on-safety-security"&gt;it plowed $13 billion into safety and security&lt;/a&gt;. It hired 40,000 people to police the network. It developed a real aptitude at disrupting networks of fake accounts. It got more comfortable inserting high-quality information into the News Feed, whether about COVID-19 or climate change. When the 2020 US presidential election was over, Facebook was barely a footnote in the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdJ2A0"&gt;But basic questions lingered. &lt;em&gt;How&lt;/em&gt; was the network policed, exactly? Are different countries being policed equitably? And what does looking at a personalized feed like that every day to do a person, or to a country and its politics?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KpNQjX"&gt;As always, there’s a risk of being a technological determinist here: to assume that Facebook’s algorithms are more powerful they are, or operate in a vacuum. Research that I’ve highlighted in this column has shown that often, other forces can be even more powerful — Fox News, for example, can inspire a much greater shift in a person’s politics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="deJcyq"&gt;For a lot of reasons, we would all stand to benefit if we could better isolate the effect of Facebook — or YouTube, or TikTok, or Twitter — on the larger world. But because they keep their data private, for reasons both good and bad, we spend a lot of time arguing about subjects for which we often have little grounding in empiricism. We talk about what Facebook &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; based on how Facebook makes us &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;. And so Facebook and the world wind up talking past each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1eVYr"&gt;At the same time, and to its credit, Facebook did allocate some resources to investigating some of the questions on our minds. Questions like, what &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; Instagram doing to teenage girls?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBH3MR"&gt;In doing so, Facebook planted the seeds of the current moment. The most pressing questions in the recent reporting ask the same question Cambridge Analytica did — &lt;em&gt;what is this social network doing to us&lt;/em&gt;? But unlike with that story, this time we have real data to look at — data that Facebook itself produced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="m8KHQl"&gt;
&lt;p id="puyqyG"&gt;When I talk to some people at Facebook about some of this, they bristle. They’ll say: reporters have had it out for us forever; the recent stories all bear more than a faint trace of confirmation bias. They’ll say: just because one researcher at the company says something doesn’t mean it’s true. They’ll ask: why isn’t anyone demanding to see internal research from YouTube, or Twitter, or TikTok?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Op46Ax"&gt;Perhaps this explains the company’s generally dismissive response to all this reporting. The emotional, &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/what-the-wall-street-journal-got-wrong/"&gt;scattered Nick Clegg blog post&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/its-about-ethics-in-surf-journalism"&gt;CEO joking about it&lt;/a&gt;. The mainstream media — &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_you_go_again"&gt;there they go again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYGAjp"&gt;To me, though, the past week has felt like a turning point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlGQBW"&gt;By now, the majority of Facebook researchers to ever speak out about the company in public have taken the opportunity to say that their research was largely stymied or ignored by their superiors. And what we have read of their research suggests that the company has often acted irresponsibly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="xFccgO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The past week has felt like a turning point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sTcUqA"&gt;Sometimes this is unintentional — Facebook appears to have been genuinely surprised by the finding that Instagram appears to be responsible for the rise in anxiety and depression for teenage girls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjQ70M"&gt;Other times, the company acted irresponsibly with full knowledge of what it was doing, as when it allocated massively more resources for removing misleading content in the United States than it does in the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L6WViK"&gt;And even in the United States, it arguably under-invested in safety and security: as Samidh Chakrabarti, who ran Facebook’s civic integrity team until this year, put it: the company’s much-ballyhooed $13 billion investment &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/samidh/status/1440486111726366738?s=20"&gt;represents about four percent of revenue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MamLeF"&gt;Despite all this, of course, Facebook is thriving. Daily users are up &lt;a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-news/press-release-details/2021/facebook-reports-second-quarter-2021-results/default.aspx"&gt;seven percent year over year&lt;/a&gt;. Profits are up. The post-pandemic ad business is booming so hard that even digital ad also-rans like Pinterest and Twitter are having a banner year. And Facebook’s hardware business is quietly turning into a success, potentially paving a road from here &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;all the way to the metaverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwCqCt"&gt;But still that question nags: &lt;em&gt;what is this social network doing to us?&lt;/em&gt; It now seems apparent that no one at the company, or in the world at large, has really gotten their arms around it. And so the company’s reputation is once again in free fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVIPTM"&gt;One natural reaction to this state of affairs, if you were running the company, would be to do &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; research: no more negative studies, no more negative headlines! What’s Congress going to do, hold a hearing? Who cares. Pass a law? Not this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kvpjqv"&gt;When Facebook moved this week &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/citizen-browser/2021/09/21/facebook-rolls-out-news-feed-change-that-blocks-watchdogs-from-gathering-data"&gt;to make it harder for people to volunteer their own News Feed data to an external research program&lt;/a&gt;, it signaled that this is the way it is heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zrEOE2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What if Facebook invested in more and more open research, not less?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9x6QbE"&gt;But what if it did the reverse? What if it invested dramatically more in research, and publicly pressured its peers to join it? What if Facebook routinely published its findings and allowed its data to be audited? What if the company made it dramatically easier for qualified researchers to study the platform independently?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JuKiNZ"&gt;This would be unprecedented in the history of American business, but Facebook is an unprecedented thing in the world. The company can’t rebuild trust with the larger world through blog posts and tweet storms. But it could start by helping us understand its effects on human behavior, politics, and society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lx13Ph"&gt;That doesn’t seem to be the way things are going, though. Instead, the company is doing different kinds of research — research like “what happens if we show people good news about Facebook?” I’m told one story that appeared in the recent test informed users of an incident in which the social network helped a woman find her lost horse. Maybe &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; will move the needle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqIakm"&gt;But I shouldn’t joke. There’s a real idea embedded in that test, which is that over time you can reshape perception by the narratives you promote. That what appears in the News Feed may be able to shift public opinion over time, to the opinion of whoever is running the feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsCVIg"&gt;It is this suspicion that the News Feed can drive such changes that has driven so much of the company’s own research, and fears about the company’s influence, even as that possibility has been relentlessly downplayed by Facebook’s PR machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQeWok"&gt;But now the company has decided to see for itself. To the public, it will promise it can’t possibly be as powerful as its apostate researchers say it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gpFkJe"&gt;And then, with Project Amplify, Facebook will attempt to see if they might actually be right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="gwmrGP"&gt;
&lt;p id="NF4ttn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is starting to share more about what it demotes in News Feed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The word facebook in white against a blue background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pyDQcU26zI1KBnh2LXxK3U51yyc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69896800/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WSds8g"&gt;The way that Facebook controls its News Feed is often controversial and largely opaque to the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b4Oobk"&gt;Now the social network is attempting to shine more light on the content it surpresses but doesn't remove entirely. On Thursday, Facebook &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/"&gt;published its “Content Distribution Guidelines”&lt;/a&gt; detailing the roughly three-dozen types of posts it demotes for various reasons in the News Feed, like clickbait and posts by repeat policy offenders. That process, which relies heavily on machine learning technology to automatically detect problematic content, effectively throttles the reach of offending posts and comments without the author knowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iQ88wb"&gt;There’s still plenty that the guidelines, which Facebook has mostly confirmed in various reports over the years but is just now publishing for the first time in one place, don’t say. They don’t detail exactly how a demotion works and exactly how much it reduces a piece of content’s reach. Or how severely a certain kind of post, like a link to spam, is throttled in the News Feed relative to a post about health misinformation, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9iPsO3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We want to give a clearer sense of what we think is problematic but not worth removing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0pYOwF"&gt;“We want to give a clearer sense of what we think is problematic but not worth removing,” Jason Hirsch, Facebook’s head of integrity policy, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. He said the company hopes to add more information to the guidelines over time, including how demotions throttle specific kinds of content relative to others. But he said Facebook likely won’t stack rank the severity of demotions “for adversarial reasons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RkWPoW"&gt;Detailing the guidelines now could help Facebook avoid controversy the next time it throttles a high-profile post from going viral, like when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/14/21515972/facebook-new-york-post-hunter-biden-story-fact-checking-reduced-distribution-election-misinformation"&gt;it suppressed a story by &lt;em&gt;The New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about U.S. President Joe Biden’s son, Hunter. The guidelines spell out that Facebook’s policy is to suppress stories that have been disputed by users as inaccurate — as was the case with &lt;em&gt;The Post’s &lt;/em&gt;dubious reporting — until a review is completed by its network of third-party fact-checkers. That policy was made known widely only a year ago after critics accused the company of political bias for censoring &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ney23b"&gt;According to the distribution guidelines, other types of content Facebook demotes include links to spam sites, “low quality” comments that are either very lengthy with copied text or contain no words at all, posts in groups from accounts that share at a “very high frequency,” and news articles without a clear byline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPkt4d"&gt;Releasing these guidelines is part of a bigger effort to disclose more about how the News Feed works to the public, according to Hirsch. Media outlets and politicians are increasingly examining &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;Facebook’s negative effects on the world&lt;/a&gt;, and lawmakers in the US and elsewhere are looking to regulate how social media companies police their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="45vRan"&gt;Facebook recently put out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630813/facebook-report-most-viewed-content-links-news-feed-transparancy"&gt;its first quarterly report&lt;/a&gt; on the most-viewed content in the News Feed after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/14/technology/facebook-data.html"&gt;journalists used its public-facing analysts tool&lt;/a&gt;, CrowdTangle, to show that right-leaning personalities are often the most engaged with on its service. He said that, while building the most-viewed data into a self-service, real-time tool like CrowdTangle would be a “huge investment of time and resources,” the company wasn’t opposed to doing it eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elizabeth Holmes ‘was in charge’ of Theranos, says Gen. Mattis</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes Attends Criminal Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5DApprMoH8E6Twb35v-ib_zw7kI=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69896318/1235434673.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;She pricked his finger, and he fell under her spell&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="rGKES5"&gt;Theranos’s board member James &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2004-apr-16-fg-general16-story.html"&gt;“Mad Dog”&lt;/a&gt; Mattis, a four-star general and the former secretary of defense, served among the company’s impeccably credentialed supporters —&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;but testifying in Elizabeth Holmes’s trial on Wednesday, he resembled nothing so much as a nattily-dressed grandfather. At one point, he seemed befuddled when the defense asked him if he remembered discussion of high-throughput devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N87O2Z"&gt;When Mattis first met Theranos’ Holmes in 2011, he told the court, she pricked his finger to give him an idea of the blood draw process. And like a damsel in a fairy tale, he fell under her spell. At the trial of the US v Elizabeth Holmes, he said he was “taken” with the Theranos device. Now “young Elizabeth,” as Mattis addressed her in an email, faces 10 counts of wire fraud and two of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="uODeuE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I was a strong believer in getting this in theater so it could stand and deliver.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9j2dyy"&gt;Mattis’ testimony on Wednesday was the most damning of the trial so far. He portrayed Holmes as firmly in control of Theranos, even telling board members what to discuss with the press. He also seems to have been misled about the capabilities of the Theranos analyzer, called Edison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvfg56"&gt;“I’m trying to find a way to employ your device on a swift ‘pilot project’ or ‘proof of principle to expedite its entry to our forces,” Mattis wrote Holmes in October 2011, when he was the commander of US Central Command. In today’s testimony, he said he had wanted to see a side-by-side comparison with existing blood testing technology. That never happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAoWkV"&gt;The small size of the analyzer was particularly appealing to him, he testified. Sick bays on ships have limited room, remote locations make it hard to set up labs, and the idea of being able to quickly and accurately run tests to triage wounded soldiers was particularly appealing. “I was a strong believer in getting this in theater so it could stand and deliver,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YEoP9v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was pretty breathtaking what she was doing.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lEexqV"&gt;Mattis also described Holmes as “sharp, articulate, committed” and said she was “aggressive” about trying to work with the Department of Defense. At the time, she didn’t say that Theranos didn’t have the resources to do this, nor did she mention the commercial launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MMLcU8"&gt;To Mattis’ knowledge, the Theranos analyzer was never deployed in clandestine operations, on military helicopters, or anywhere else in the military. This is a particular problem for Holmes’ defense, as she told investors Theranos devices were being deployed in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sxn74Y"&gt;After retiring from the military, Mattis visited the Theranos headquarters in late 2013. There he saw the Theranos analyzer — and didn’t see the commercially-available equipment that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674657/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-wire-fraud-financial-witness"&gt;Erika Cheung&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680372/elizabeth-holmes-wire-fraud-emails-gangakhedkar"&gt;Surekha Gangakhedkar&lt;/a&gt; testified Theranos was using for most of its tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="csSm7E"&gt;Holmes invited him to join the Theranos board to help her build a good corporate culture — his management experience would be helpful, she told him. “It was pretty breathtaking what she was doing,” he said. As a board member, Holmes was not just his primary source of information on Theranos’ tech, she was his sole source of information, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="8cM68a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Ms. Holmes was in charge.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cj0Jlc"&gt;Mattis invested $85,000 into Theranos when he joined the board, a significant amount for “someone who has been in government for 40 years,” he said, smiling slightly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSdGND"&gt;At board meetings, Holmes was the primary presenter. Her co-defendant, Sunny Balwani, who is being tried separately, sometimes gave financial forecasts, but “Ms. Holmes was in charge,” Mattis said. There were board meetings where Balwani wasn’t even present, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6o9uT"&gt;This testimony is, naturally, a problem for the defense, which has been trying to shift blame onto Balwani, among others. But it’s consistent with media profiles of Holmes in that period, which presented her as being in complete control of the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CC4iUl"&gt;Holmes’ media coverage was introduced directly today. First up was a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324123004579055003869574012"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;article &lt;/a&gt;that claimed the Theranos devices were “faster, cheaper and more accurate than the conventional methods and require only microscopic blood volumes, not vial after vial of the stuff.” That was consistent with Mattis’ understanding of the technology at the time, he said. The article was also featured in a board meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="RFEcZG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Duty of loyalty”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BS4JpZ"&gt;It wasn’t until later that Mattis learned only a few tests were actually run on the Theranos machine. If he’d known that third party devices were being used for most tests, that “would have tempered my enthusiasm significantly,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8tYtuG"&gt;Mattis also spoke to Roger Parloff for &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2014/06/12/theranos-blood-holmes/"&gt;his &lt;em&gt;Fortune&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; — and before doing so, he asked Holmes for guidance about what to say. Parloff’s article claimed that Theranos “does not buy any analyzers from third parties,” which was not true. But the claim was consistent with what Mattis understood at the time, he told the court. He also received directions about a &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; article: he was not to discuss how the tech worked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xn1paP"&gt;Later, a Theranos lawyer emailed Mattis to tell him not to talk to John Carreyrou, who was &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901"&gt;reporting his blockbuster story about Theranos&lt;/a&gt;; in the email, Carreyrou’s forthcoming story was described as defaming the company and exposing trade secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ly89LU"&gt;After the story came out, the board of directors was rebranded as the board of counselors. A slide from that meeting was shown to jurors — and the only part of it that wasn’t redacted were the words “duty of loyalty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jc6ktL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I thought all along that we were doing it on Theranos’ gear.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EJY6ML"&gt;That didn’t stop another board member, Richard Kovacevich, former head of Wells Fargo, from emailing Holmes and the rest of the board with questions. “So when blood is withdrawn in venous tubes, do I understand correctly that the tests are done on lab-like equipment and not Edison and those are sent to CLIA for testing while Edison is only being used for the FDA tests?” Kovacevich wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6QZho"&gt;Holmes replied that Theranos was transitioning between regulatory standards, and Mattis said he understood that Carryerou had essentially  “caught [the company] in mid-stride.” Holmes did not tell the board that third-party tests were used because Edison didn’t work for everything. “I thought all along that we were doing it on Theranos’ gear,” he testified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0AdQHE"&gt;But after some “surprises, disappointing surprises,” Mattis said he began to question if Edison actually worked. “There came a time when I didn’t know what to believe about Theranos anymore,” he said. He resigned as a member of the board in late 2016, because he understood he was going to be nominated as the Secretary of Defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJj5FY"&gt;Damaging as his testimony was, it also seemed that Mattis was easily confused. He wasn’t entirely sure where he’d met Holmes for the first time, though he knew it was before or after a speech in San Francisco. He also didn’t remember he’d bought stock options in the company — though the defense displayed the paperwork showing he did. When asked how much he made a year as a board member, Mattis said $50,000; documents introduced by the defense revealed he’d actually made $150,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3if0l"&gt;But when the defense tried to get him to say that Holmes never told him the tech was ready, Mattis pushed back. Holmes had told him the tech was ready to deploy in the field for a side-by-side comparison with existing blood tests, he insisted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="RXh89c"&gt;“I assumed it would be more than a handful of tests,” Mattis said, “or it would be useless to us.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s department stores sound like a very Amazon way to sell clothes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Go store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/27yDpnoYTyWjeLAKRdUpOfLPrHw=/231x0:1770x1026/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69896114/amazon_go_stock_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s Go convenience stores are cashier-less.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AhaLCd"&gt;Amazon’s rumored department store experiment could take a similarly high-tech approach to selling clothes as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534570/amazon-fresh-full-size-grocery-store-just-walk-out-cashierless-technology-bellevue-washington"&gt;the company took with groceries&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-amazons-department-store-plans-high-tech-dressing-rooms-its-own-apparel-brands-11632303002?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632141/amazon-mall-department-store-retail-rumor"&gt;previously reported to be considering opening department stores&lt;/a&gt; in California and Ohio, a natural expansion of the company’s push into physical retail, and those department stores will reportedly feature its own clothing brands too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6hMw8"&gt;Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17869294/amazon-go-store-chicago-cashier-less"&gt;Amazon’s cashier-less Go stores&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Journal&lt;/em&gt; seems to suggest Amazon-branded department stores will focus on customer convenience, using several possible tech  solutions. In one idea, customers “scan QR codes of items they want to try on by using a smartphone app,” before sales associates gather and place those items in a dressing room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OAxAsA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A high-tech dressing room&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3A0VfJ"&gt;Once in a fitting room, “customers could ask for more items using a touch screen, which might be capable of recommending additional clothing based on the pieces shoppers liked,” the article reads. Amazon has also reportedly considered introducing robots or automation to streamline the shopping experience. Exactly how is unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tRSGgG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; writes that Amazon’s stores will sells Amazon’s clothing brands first and foremost, but also feature offerings from retailers that sell on Amazon’s online marketplace. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/23/11099968/amazon-fashion-launches-clothing-lines"&gt;made a major push into apparel&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, and has received increasing amounts of scrutiny &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311574/peak-design-video-amazon-copy-everyday-sling-bag"&gt;following claims it copies competitors&lt;/a&gt; with its house brands. Amazon has reportedly already passed Walmart as the number one apparel retailer in the US, according to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/17/amazon-unseats-walmart-to-become-the-no-1-apparel-retailer-in-the-us.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;amp;par=sharebar"&gt;a Wells Fargo reported cited by CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, and that’s before whatever effect physical department stores could have on the recognition of the company and its brands. Selling its clothes in a department store could give Amazon’s products an identity beyond their typically affordable price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rAkM7V"&gt;When asked about these plans by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Amazon said it doesn’t comment on rumors. If these are the company’s plans, Amazon department stores could offer a very different experience to a traditional clothing store, for both shoppers and employees. It’s hard to not compare the automated, efficiency-minded solutions Amazon is reportedly considering for shoppers to the robotic way it manages employees in its own warehouses and distribution centers. For future employees, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365330/amazon-apology-pee-bottles-worker-warehouse-union-pocan"&gt;hopefully the comparisons end there&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FDA clears Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine boosters for vulnerable groups</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vials of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine are seen at a..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ppkrPgIR3cqKgkrVb7yoan6G06w=/0x238:4200x3038/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69895977/1235221438.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Paul Hennessy/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="36TVJW"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration cleared a third dose of the Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for people some vulnerable groups — the first booster in the United States’ vaccination efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xWPAt"&gt;The agency &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-booster-dose-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-certain-populations"&gt;signed off&lt;/a&gt; on boosters for people 65 years of age and older, those who are at high risk of severe disease, health care workers, and other people at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 at work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A1mMbX"&gt;The decision comes a month after the Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22628799/covid-vaccine-booster-biden-moderna-pfizer-fda-cdc"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that booster shots would be available to people in the US starting in September. At the time, scientists and public health experts &lt;a href="https://khn.org/news/article/covid-vaccine-boosters-science-biden-plan-jumped-gun/"&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; the administration for pushing boosters before there was clear evidence that they were necessary and before either the FDA or CDC signed off on their use. In early September, federal officials told the White House that they may have to modify or push back the booster plan while health agencies collected and reviewed data, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/03/us/politics/coronavirus-booster-shots.html"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OGLWkU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;there are no updated guidelines for the Moderna and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shots at this point.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jgGDRc"&gt;The decision only covers the Pfizer / BioNTech vaccine shots, and there are no updated guidelines for the Moderna and Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shots at this point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXcWQd"&gt;Over the past few weeks, experts debated whether or not third doses of the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines were necessary. Data from the US and Israel &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/18/health/covid-cdc-boosters-elderly.html"&gt;appears to show&lt;/a&gt; that protection against infection with the coronavirus drops off over time, though there are different estimates around exactly how steep that decline might be. The effect is more pronounced for older people. Most data shows that otherwise healthy people who get two shots of the vaccine are still protected against severe illness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="twXIpS"&gt;The FDA’s advisory committee on vaccination on Friday voted against recommending boosters for people 16 years of age and older, citing limited evidence for boosters in younger age groups. Members were also uncomfortable with the lack of safety data on third doses in younger people. The committee &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/09/17/fda-advisory-panel-recommends-against-booster-doses-of-covid-19-vaccine-for-most-americans/"&gt;recommended boosters&lt;/a&gt; for a narrower group of people: those who are over 65 or who might be at high risk of severe COVID-19. In a less formal poll, it also supported boosters for health care workers and people at risk of exposure at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHcUtA"&gt;Most data used to make the case for or against boosters comes from outside the US, from countries that have centralized health care systems that they can pull from to understand big-picture COVID-19 trends. The US doesn’t have that kind of infrastructure, so vaccine information is more piecemeal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ruaTRp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This current discussion from the CDC on collecting data about the vaccines just reveals how terrible the U.S. collection of health data are. All of it goes back to our fragmented IT infrastructure. Compare it to the data coming from the U.K.'s NHS.&lt;/p&gt;— Matthew Herper (@matthewherper) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/matthewherper/status/1438857259480662022?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xbCmil"&gt;Israel is offering third doses of the COVID-19 vaccine to everyone over the age of 12. A third dose has been available to people over 60 in Israel since the end of July. Pfizer / BioNTech &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/15/covid-boosters-pfizer-says-israel-data-shows-third-shot-restores-efficacy-to-95percent.html"&gt;said in data released this week&lt;/a&gt; that the protection against infection had fallen for that group, which was among the first to be vaccinated, but that a third shot bumped the protection against infection back to the 95 percent efficacy seen in the original trials testing the vaccines. The United Kingdom also &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/14/uk-sets-out-covid-plan-for-fall-and-winter-booster-shots-to-begin-next-week.html"&gt;announced a booster plan this week&lt;/a&gt;, and will give third shots to people over the age of 50. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WjHIHy"&gt;Experts are concerned that the US and other wealthy countries are pursuing third doses while vaccines are still scarce in most parts of the world. The World Health Organization has called for a moratorium on boosters &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/08/who-extends-call-for-a-moratorium-on-covid-booster-doses-until-the-end-of-the-year.html"&gt;until the end of the year&lt;/a&gt;, in order to prioritize doses for low income countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8ectQ"&gt;An advisory committee for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention meets Thursday, and is expected to discuss if &lt;em&gt;it&lt;/em&gt; recommends the now-authorized third shot, and who it recommends them for. The committee would refine and define the groups that should qualify for a booster under the FDA’s decision. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfJor8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Otc336"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how much buying into Microsoft’s pro Surface vision actually costs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8tE-L_hw_iwzmGQZgsW-0EnGxbs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69895909/2021_surface_family_3_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;None of these tablets come with keyboards or stylii.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2tzBvs"&gt;Microsoft is listening. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22448855"&gt;Surface Duo 2&lt;/a&gt; ditches its predecessor’s last-gen specs, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22450051"&gt;Surface Laptop Studio&lt;/a&gt; does away with the Surface Book’s gimmicky detachable screen, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22686705/microsoft-surface-pro-8-keyboard-screen-photos-video-hands-on"&gt;Surface Pro 8&lt;/a&gt; might be the one we’ve been waiting for, with an enhanced keyboard, stylus, high-refresh rate screen and Thunderbolt ports (finally!). But there’s one place where Microsoft is stubbornly carrying on: making you pay substantially more than the quoted sticker price to use these computers as advertised — because none of them include a stylus or keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4WoyvO"&gt;While Microsoft touted the $1,099-and-up Surface Pro 8 as “a powerful laptop with the flexibility of a tablet,” it’s not a laptop at all when you take it out of the box. It’s a touchscreen tablet, and nothing else, unless you add the keyboard or stylus Microsoft will happily sell you for $130 and up. Microsoft only spent 11 seconds of its 49 minute event demoing the Surface Pro 8 &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; a peripheral you’ll need to pay extra for. (Two of those seconds were a repeat from an earlier part of the presentation, and six of them were part of a montage that included Surfaces with keyboards and stylii as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="l2QLeC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The least expensive Surface Pro 8 I would consider starts at $1,680&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFsHY2"&gt;In reality, you’ll pay an extra $129.99 for the stylus, $179.99 for Microsoft’s new keyboard with a stylus slot, $279.99 if you want both (there’s a $30 discount), $199.99 if you want that keyboard to come with a fingerprint reader, or $329.98 for your keyboard, stylus and fingerprint in total. So for Microsoft’s full Surface Pro 8 vision of keyboard and detachable magnetic stylus, you’re looking at a minimum of $1,379.98 before tax — and that’s with just 8GB of RAM and a tiny 128GB SSD. Double those capacities for the barest amount of futureproofing, and you’re at a grand total of $1,679.98. That might not be a bad deal, but it’s definitely not $1,099. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YCZADzr-pNMMjPsAiN6oRn2ge2w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871149/surface_family_wide_2021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft.&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This picture contains eight optional accessories. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="i4BCjL"&gt;There &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; ways to save a little more money. Technically, the Surface Pro 8 is compatible with the old Surface Pro X keyboards as well, which start $40 cheaper at $140, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Microsoft-Surface-Pro-Keyboard/dp/B07YNLYYNK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can currently find them on sale&lt;/a&gt; for just $104 if you don’t care about having a stylus that magnetically charges from the keyboard. (Microsoft also sells a standalone stylus charger for $35 if you change your mind.) Some companies will also sell alternative keyboards, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687438/brydge-sp-plus-surface-pro-8-keyboard-wireless"&gt;like this new Brydge&lt;/a&gt; that makes the Surface Pro more of a clamshell design. Plus, the Thunderbolt ports should theoretically mean you don’t have to pay for a proprietary Microsoft single-cable docking solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hXjklH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A full Surface Pro X is more like $1,580&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D8OHun"&gt;But consumer choice or no, Microsoft wants to have it both ways — a seemingly low starting price for powerful pen-equipped laptops and a big upsell to actually make them that way — and that applies to its other products as well. You may have heard &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22679573/microsoft-surface-pro-x-display-specs-price-release-date"&gt;the ARM-based Surface Pro X has a new low price of $899&lt;/a&gt;. While that’s technically true, that $899 buys you a tablet that ditches the original promise of always-on connectivity for plain ol’ Wi-Fi, doesn’t include the keyboard or stylus, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; features a last-gen SQ1 processor instead of the new SQ2 model. The full Surface Pro X vision with the newer SQ2, LTE, keyboard and pen will cost you $1,579.98, though you could get away with paying $1,400 if you ditch the stylus and nab the lowest-end keyboard at retail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lA7v6t"&gt;I can’t bring myself to criticize &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684608/microsoft-surface-go-3-processor-specs-price-features"&gt;the $399-and-up Surface Go 3&lt;/a&gt; in quite the same way — Microsoft did indeed show kids watching videos and taking video calls for nearly a full minute during its presentation. While its last-gen Pentium chip, 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage might be a little iffy in 2021 (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675300/apple-64gb-iphone-13-128gb-standard-storage-space-photos-videos-apps"&gt;we just wrote the obituary for 64GB iPhones&lt;/a&gt;), Microsoft isn’t advertising it as a keyboard-first machine. And even though that keyboard still costs $100 by itself, you can find the stylus &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Surface-Platinum-Model-EYU-00009/dp/B07YNKFC3R?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as low as $65&lt;/a&gt; on sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfEok4"&gt;But even Microsoft’s demonstration of the new $1,499 Surface Duo 2 phone included prominent placement for a feature it’ll make you pay extra for. Did you spot &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/TSii5NIgbYQ?t=1955"&gt;the moment&lt;/a&gt; where Microsoft shows how the new Surface Pen can magnetically stick to its new phone and charge? &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KUQomC0Nm_vagSQDCa7WLyCXFnc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22871089/surface_duo_pen_stick.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1m9AyO"&gt;It can’t do that out of the box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvOfVH"&gt;“To make sure your Surface Slim Pen is always with you and charged, we’re introducing Microsoft Surface Duo 2 Pen Cover,” a Microsoft presenter said. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/captain2phones/status/1440709413409476619?s=21"&gt;The reality&lt;/a&gt; is that “Pen Cover” refers to a new case you’ll need to buy for the phone to do those things, not a feature of the Surface Duo 2’s cover materials. (And you’ll need to buy the pen, of course.) But good on Microsoft for designing a case that blends in so well I thought it was part of the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j5To73"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Surface Pen still doesn't magnetize directly to the device (at least not on purpose), but it *does* stick to the new case/cover, which is much nicer looking than last year's bumper.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bonus: the pen wirelessly charges when attached. (Sorry, no Qi charging for Duo 2 itself.)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;5/ &lt;a href="https://t.co/fyDd7zWjAT"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fyDd7zWjAT&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Michael Fisher (@Captain2Phones) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Captain2Phones/status/1440709413409476619?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tM84Dz"&gt;It’s highly unlikely that Microsoft will stop this practice anytime soon: it’s proven the strategy out over seven generations of Surface tablets, and it gives the company great flexibility when it comes to sales: when Black Friday or Prime Day roll around, it can build discounted bundles or throw in free accessories to tempt buyers who’d been on the fence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NxB8Bw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Consumer choice is a valid argument, to a point&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wiR2uQ"&gt;Microsoft can always argue it’s on the side of consumer choice and sustainability, too — why include a keyboard when some won’t use them, or even throw them away? (That’s the argument for unbundling phone chargers, too, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519466/apple-iphone-12-chargers-airpods-greenhouse-gas-emissions-e-waste"&gt;though it’s not quite that simple&lt;/a&gt;.) And one thing Microsoft has going for that argument is backwards compatibility — &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/identify-your-surface-pen-and-features-c82a0208-2e35-b347-dae0-d7f4922edc77"&gt;its stylus pens are compatible&lt;/a&gt; all the way back to the Surface Pro 3 from 2014, and a keyboard cover from that same Surface Pro 3 worked all the way up to 2019’s Surface Pro 7, &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/do-older-surface-pro-type-covers-work-surface-pro-7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpO9Cd"&gt;Unfortunately, the Surface Pro X and new Surface Pro 8 break that keyboard compatibility streak, so you can’t just go find a prior year’s model for $30 or $40 used instead of buying it for $104 on sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RaDYZi"&gt;Mostly, I’m just a little annoyed that Microsoft presents its Surface products as a complete vision of computing, while leaving the most interesting parts of that vision out of the box that bears their name. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter says it will fix disappearing tweets issue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FNHmZj9l6VBPYeh-5vdejuWCb2Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69895591/akrales_180620_1777_0266.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KoYj7l"&gt;Twitter is planning to make some changes that could prevent tweets from disappearing while you are reading them, the company said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1440766157884039170"&gt;on its support account Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sB3MIx"&gt;Here’s what you might have run into. If you were looking at a tweet on your timeline, and at the same time someone else you follow replied to it, or the original tweeter threaded it, the app would suddenly refresh, while the tweet disappeared from view. That’s obviously not ideal, so Twitter plans to make changes over the next two months to fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b0rUwN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The background: a Tweet would move up the timeline as replies were added to the ongoing convo. Since some convos can evolve quickly, this made it so you didn't see the same Tweet repeated in the TL. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our changes will keep your TL fresh and keep Tweets from disappearing mid-read.&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1440766159486214159?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TyYRtn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1440786174235213827"&gt;In a tweet replying to a user&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter put what it’s trying to fix more simply: “We want you to be able to stop and read a Tweet without it disappearing from view.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t0bgQo"&gt;The two-month timeline means that a fix won’t be in place immediately, though, so you might still run into the issue before Twitter makes the necessary changes. And while it’s not clear exactly what changes Twitter plans to make, the fixes could be welcome for people who have been affected by the disappearing tweets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FdQHG9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYyvQz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nokia’s new G50 is a $300 5G phone with a big battery and two years of OS upgrades</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-KxYIa3RB9oWPphcH1iu4V4w3Ic=/0x125:3000x2125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69895204/Nokia_G50___Beauty_1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nokia G50 has a triple rear camera system.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nokia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sK3V8q"&gt;Nokia has a new midrange phone coming to the US and a number of global markets. The new G50 costs $299 and has all the ingredients to be competitive as a midrange phone, with a 6.82-inch HD+ display, big battery, audio jack and 18W fast charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOnRac"&gt;This G-series phone is similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22372444/hmd-nokia-x20-specs-release-date-price-news-quad-camera"&gt;Nokia X20&lt;/a&gt; that was announced back in April 2021, but the G50 has a bigger screen and battery and comes in a version specifically designed for the North American market (AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile). Unsurprisingly, it supports the slower 5G Sub 6, which means this phone will work on T-Mobile’s 5G network, but not on Verizon’s mmWave network, and will only get 4G reception on AT&amp;amp;T.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f9lJF9"&gt;Like other 5G phones in the $300 range, the Nokia G50 is powered by the modest Snapdragon 480 chip, so don’t expect the fastest performance or smoothest gaming experience on this phone. It has 4GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, as well as a microSD slot in case you need to backup your photos or sideload an app. Compared to Motorola’s identically named &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350611/motorola-g100-g50-launch-price-specs"&gt;G50&lt;/a&gt;, the Nokia has a slightly bigger HD+ 6.82-inch display that is capable of 450 nits of brightness and has a v-shaped notch around its front 8-megapixel camera.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xulu-7vTpb5_FiBSErLXKOC0beI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22870595/Nokia_G50_Emotional_copy.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nokia&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G50 comes in two colors, a blue and a pink.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k2WTe5"&gt;On the back of the Nokia G50 is a triple-camera array, arranged in a circle. You’ll probably use the 48-megapixel standard camera the most, while the 5-megapixel Ultrawide and 2-megapixel depth sensor cameras can bring some fun perspectives to your shots but will likely be of noticeably lower quality. Its front selfie camera also offers video stabilization to help sharpen your blurry Tik Tok videos and a Night Selfie mode to brighten your low-light selfies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJBrqy"&gt;According to HMD Global, the maker of Nokia phones, the Nokia G50 will ship with Android 11 and receive two years of OS upgrades and three years of monthly security updates. In other words, this budget phone won’t turn into a brick in a few years, which is good for the environment and for consumers who want to get more use out of their phones before upgrading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32jfJ0"&gt;The Nokia G50 is preloaded with Spotify and a 30-day trial of ExpressVPN and is available in Ocean Blue or Midnight Sun. It’s available for preorder starting today, September 22nd, at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http%3A%2F%2FNokia.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F22%2F22687760%2Fnokia-g50-phone-battery-android-upgrades" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nokia.com&lt;/a&gt; and will ship on September 30th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon collaborates with Billie Eilish on an Echo Studio</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Jy2s61mlmnaq0ia2idExoWds0o=/0x240:5760x4080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69895066/Billie_Eilish_Limited_Edition_Echo_Studio_Lifestyle_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon has revealed its new collaboration with singer Billie Eilish: a limited-edition Echo Studio speaker.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cN4AmS"&gt;If you were in a tizzy about what to get the devoted Billie Eilish fan in your family for the holidays, Amazon might have just solved your problem — assuming you’re prepared to drop $230 on them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3ANSZ"&gt;Announced today, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Billie-Eilish-Limited-High-fidelity-speaker/dp/B0939S1B5R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Billie Eilish Limited Edition Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt; is available for pre-order and features the melancholy-voiced singer pasted on the side of Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features"&gt;highest-end Echo speaker, the Studio&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, the album cover art from Eilish’s new album “Happier Than Ever” has been printed onto a new beige-hued fabric and wrapped around the Echo Studio. It creates a slightly eerie-looking product that supposedly someone, somewhere, will want to put in their home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxSHR1"&gt;This is Amazon’s first foray into celebrity skins; previous attempts to dress up its bulbous smart speakers have focused on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;pandas and tigers&lt;/a&gt; designed for children’s rooms. The collaboration between Billie and the bassiest Echo seems like a direct play for the tweenager room — an assumption bolstered by the frilly boudoir featured in promotional pix for the collab. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="637pvO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon Echo Studio review: finally, an Echo that sounds great","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="yXFeRb"&gt;The commercialism of this move may be a sad day for many Billie fans, who flock to the singer’s genre-defying music in part because of her ability to challenge the expectations that surround most young, female popstars. The songwriter is quoted in an Amazon&lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/devices/amazon-and-billie-eilish-announce-limited-edition-echo-studio"&gt; blog post&lt;/a&gt; about the device as saying, “I can’t wait for my cutie fans to be able to listen to my new album &lt;em&gt;Happier Than Ever&lt;/em&gt; in spatial audio, available on Amazon Music Unlimited.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/klPBqXXWWcyW6wr2jN7DgwdT54g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22870572/Billie_Eilish_Limited_Edition_Echo_Studio_Lifestyle_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Billie Eilish Echo Studio comes in a beige color.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zjA9Xn"&gt;As a limited-edition device, the Billie Studio comes with a $30 price bump over the non-Billie version, which goes for $199. You do get six months of Amazon Music bundled with it — and that applies to existing subscribers as well — so you can listen happily to “Happier Than Ever” in spatial audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgt3CG"&gt;There are no extra Billie features here, though, and no option to have her dulcet tones be your new Alexa voice. Amazon says that special Billie Eilish alarms are coming soon — although those will come to all Echo speakers, whether they have the singer’s face on them or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCe8Xx"&gt;Avid Echo Studio fans may have been hoping for an actual upgrade to the aging speaker. Despite being the only Echo that can output high-quality audio formats like HD or Ultra HD and spatial audio formats like Dolby Atmos, the Studio hasn’t seen a spec bump since its release in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcwpRp"&gt;For now, all we’re getting is a new look. We’ll have to wait and see if this is the start of a slew of celebrity-themed skins for Echo devices or a one-off collaboration. Top of our list would be Roy Kent wrapped around the soccer-ball-shaped Echo, complete with the rascally Brit as a celebrity voice for Alexa. Although, sadly, Siri probably has dibs on the likeness of the Ted Lasso star.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15CKNx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jPxGX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 4:49PM ET September 22nd 2021&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added that all Echo devices will be able to use the special Billie Eilish alarms when they’re released.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook names a new CTO with a major focus on hardware</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FfZdFmFSrLeIx_lh_Iaca21WOuo=/24x48:1200x832/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69895096/slack_imgs.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Incoming CTO Andrew Bosworth wearing Facebook’s new smart glasses with Ray-Ban. | Photo: Facebook / Andrew Bosworth&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TqkdYE"&gt;Facebook is serious about being a long-term player in hardware. On Wednesday, the company promoted Andrew Bosworth, the current head of its hardware division that makes Oculus and other consumer devices, to the role of chief technology officer, replacing outgoing CTO Mike Schroepfer when he becomes a senior fellow next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O10AU3"&gt;In his new role, Bosworth, who goes by Boz, will continue to lead the hardware group, called Facebook Reality Labs, while also assuming responsibility for Facebook’s broader software engineering organization and artificial intelligence efforts. He’ll report directly to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who has taken a keen interest in developing AR glasses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;and the metaverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dc2mPI"&gt;Facebook is still a relative newcomer to selling consumer hardware, and it faces steep skepticism from potential customers given its long litany of privacy scandals. Even still, the company has significantly ramped up its hardware efforts in recent years under Bosworth’s watch. His Reality Labs team already has over 10,000 employees, making it the largest after the engineering organization he’s subsuming that supports Facebook’s suite of apps and infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ki0pHU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is all foundational to our broader efforts helping to build the metaverse”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YSQ6Te"&gt;“As our next CTO, Boz will continue leading Facebook Reality Labs and overseeing our work in augmented reality, virtual reality and more, and as part of this transition, a few other groups will join Boz’s team as well,” Zuckerberg said &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/09/note-from-mark-zuckerberg/"&gt;in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “This is all foundational to our broader efforts helping to build the metaverse, and I’m excited about the future of this work under Boz’s leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w1VoHu"&gt;Schroepfer, who has been CTO since 2013, said in &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/schrep/posts/10159715842464443"&gt;a Facebook post&lt;/a&gt; that he plans to stay “deeply connected to the company, working on key initiatives including recruiting and developing technical talent.” He said stepping down next year will let him “dedicate more time to my family and my personal philanthropic efforts.” He notified Facebook that he was resigning on September 20th, according to a filing with the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PFjbmN"&gt;Facebook’s current hardware products include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest VR headset&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22684447/facebook-releases-portal-go-plus-video-calling-devices"&gt;Portal video chat device lineup&lt;/a&gt;, and its new camera-equipped &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662809/facebook-ray-ban-stories-camera-smart-glasses-hands-on"&gt;smart glasses with Ray-Ban&lt;/a&gt;. The company is, in addition, developing AR glasses with displays in them, which Zuckerberg thinks will one day be as ubiquitous as mobile phones. A smartwatch with a detachable display and two cameras is also in the works for as soon as next year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22526266/facebook-smartwatch-two-cameras-heart-rate-monitor"&gt;I recently reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQ7bJi"&gt;Bosworth is one of Facebook’s longest-serving executives, having joined the company over 15 years ago. Before running Reality Labs, he led its ads division and worked on the first versions of key Facebook features like the News Feed, Messenger, and Groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2cAIj"&gt;He’s an unusually public-facing Facebook executive who often engages with critics directly on Twitter. A close confidant of Zuckerberg, he has been met with blowback over the years for controversial comments, such as &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/growth-at-any-cost-top-facebook-executive-defended-data#.upw3jdyR8"&gt;a 2016 internal memo&lt;/a&gt; that bluntly said connecting people was worth the cost, even if it led to someone dying.&lt;/p&gt;
