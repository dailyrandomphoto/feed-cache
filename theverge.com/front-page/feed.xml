    <title>HP’s refreshed Pavilion x360 convertible laptops are optimized for streaming  </title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hLKeb7"&gt;HP announced today that it has refreshed its Pavilion x360 line of 14- and 15-inch convertible laptops, making them smaller, lighter, and more geared toward streaming entertainment. The 15-inch version is available today. With an 11th Gen Intel Core i3 processor, 8GB of memory, and 256GB of storage, it starts at $750. The 14-inch version will be available later this spring; no pricing was available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JU5IN6"&gt;In view of marketing to “Gen Z” during a streaming-heavy pandemic, HP says it has optimized the new line for entertainment. The bezels have been reduced — something you’ll likely appreciate when watching videos — and HP has included a simplified version of its Omen Gaming Hub, which allows you to customize your keystrokes, lighting, and other features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxOFDZ"&gt;The two new Pavilion x360 laptops also have a smaller footprint than before. For example, the 14-inch version has been shrunk down from a width of 221mm to 209mm, and its weight has dropped from 1.61kg (3.5 pounds) to 1.50kg (3.3 pounds). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qZDwX"&gt;Other specs include an 11th Gen Intel Core i3/i5/i7 processor, storage up to 1TB, Intel Iris Xe graphics (in the i5 / i7 systems), and optional Wi-Fi 6. HP also is promoting the sustainability of the new computers, claiming they use post-consumer recycled and ocean-bound plastic and recycled aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="givVVN"&gt;The 14-inch Pavilion x360 will come in three colors: “natural silver,” “warm gold” (premium only), and “spruce blue” (non-premium only). The 15-inch version comes in “natural silver.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4529DG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CJm2GwlbGF56gpDmNhJwIgppWKg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989898/dseifert_201025_4263_0002.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Echo Dot with LED display&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30. Currently, you can buy the Echo Dot for $45 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K4FDPHZ?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=9435ae8f24eb1f1ce631fc393e5b63fc&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, you will also receive &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K4FDPHZ?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=1f8cec5c4de66d34faec62b689563081&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one Sengled Bluetooth bulb&lt;/a&gt; at no extra cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjABjU"&gt;Amazon is also selling a bundle that includes one &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Amazon-Smart-Charcoal/dp/B08GTWC9ZB?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=9d071f8b7fa655d000e04ef86f37a2ae&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot and an Amazon Smart Plug&lt;/a&gt; for $60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The 4th-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;We have seen this product go down to $40. Right now, you can buy one for $55 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=62af1027db0f9e0b5d445aa7e24b9179&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502548%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="3GbSWO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The 4th-gen Amazon Echo smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the 4th-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;You can buy a fourth-gen Amazon Echo for $90 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KVFM2XM?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=361ad144f7f58ae894b621dc4e2bef89&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;; the retailer will also throw in two Philips Hue bulbs along with the Echo.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiNGuc"&gt;If you are looking for a pair of Amazon Echo devices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589613981487950" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is selling an Amazon Echo two-pack for $180&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $20 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="oiVOWB"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for an Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the Echo Show 5 is one of two smart displays to consider. The Echo Show 5 includes a 5.5-inch display, making it easy to fit just about anywhere inside your home. Not only does the device include a built-in camera, but there’s also a physical shutter on the device, allowing you to block the camera’s view while keeping the always-on microphone active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsps6q"&gt;The Echo Show 5 usually costs $90 and we have seen it go down as low as $45. Right now, you can get it for $60 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZD7VZG?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4261fc6b8543b690542caa2dcbd1968d&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy the Echo Show 5 on Amazon, you can also receive a one-year subscription to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZD7VZG?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=6fde3082530c75af7d8ff189576c8fdf&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Food Network Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; at no extra cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJmJw1"&gt;Amazon also has a few bundles available at a discounted price; you can get an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089Q2RJH9?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=d2be23f6d66fe42b8ce0b1b1ba09793f&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and three months of Amazon Kids Plus&lt;/a&gt; for $61, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086P992GD?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=2fbb41aba454fb34ba8b518124dbff4e&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $70, and an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SW188FP?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=5e0b558c561fc5f089e3706f5558b213&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 plus an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $80. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVFAcO"&gt;Best Buy also has a few bundles currently available, including the $70 bundle with the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730445461281046110" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt;. You can also get &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730445590854581686" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two Echo Show 5 units for just $120&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 features an eight-inch display; it costs $40 more than the Echo Show 5. When stacked up against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is its closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option for a few reasons: it has a slightly larger display, better speakers, and a camera, allowing you to use it as a video chatting device; this includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;We have seen the device go down as low as $65.

  &lt;p id="TQFidg"&gt;A new bill introduced in the North Dakota Senate might have far-reaching consequences for app store operators. The bill, &lt;a href="https://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/67-2021/documents/21-1044-01000.pdf"&gt;Senate Bill 2333&lt;/a&gt;, seeks to ban stores like Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store from mandating developers only use those app stores and their respective in-app payment systems. It also bans retaliation against developers in the event they choose an alternative distribution channel or payment system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6YbDg"&gt;“The purpose of the bill is to level the playing field for app developers in North Dakota and protect customers from devastating, monopolistic fees imposed by big tech companies,” said Sen. Kyle Davison (R-Fargo), who introduced the bill before a Senate committee on Tuesday, told reporters in a press conference yesterday, as &lt;a href="https://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/north-dakota-senate-bill-targets-monopolistic-app-stores/article_dc491c88-97e0-54cd-beb2-5a26044cb97c.html"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Bismarck Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Davison said the 30 percent fee imposed on app developers who sell software through Apple and Google’s marketplaces has the effect of “raising prices and limiting choices for consumers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmLQNZ"&gt;The bill is quite simple and lays out three key restrictions for any “digital application distribution platform” that exceeds $10 million in annual revenue. That means an app store cannot: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="KrRc8v"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;“Require a developer to use a digital application distribution platform or digital transaction platform as the exclusive mode of distributing a digital product.”&lt;/strong&gt; That would likely mean that companies like Apple would have to allow app purchases outside a single locked-down store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xvC9Ot"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;“Require a developer to use an in-application payment system as the exclusive mode of accepting payment from a user to download a software application or purchase a digital or physical product through a software application.”&lt;/strong&gt; This would allow an iOS version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, to process in-app payments through Epic instead of Apple’s system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JGsDGf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Retaliate against a developer for choosing to use an alternative application store or in-application payment system.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="Femqby"&gt;As a state bill, the proposed legislation would only affect the operation of businesses like the App Store within North Dakota. But the sweeping changes the bill calls for would likely require companies like Apple to make substantial platform-level changes that could affect software distribution on a national scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U9Tusp"&gt;The use of alternative in-app payment methods is at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;heart of an ongoing legal battle&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;em&gt;Fornite &lt;/em&gt;developer Epic Games and both Apple and Google, after &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;was removed from the App Store and Play Store in August of last year for introducing its own payment processing tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijA1wq"&gt;Epic purposefully engineered its &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;update to bypass the 30 percent cut of all in-app purchases required by Apple and Google as a form of protest, both to the standard 30 percent cut and specifically Apple’s App Store rules that bar third-party app stores from the iPhone. (Google does allow Android users to sideload third-party software and for developers to create alternative app stores for distributing software, though it does make doing so difficult.) Epic is now suing both companies for alleged antitrust violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3ti9F9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The purpose of the bill is to level the playing field for app developers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LCbdc1"&gt;The Epic case is just one part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506682/google-apple-amazon-facebook-antitrust-report-house-judiciary"&gt;growing antitrust movement in the US that’s taken aim at Big Tech&lt;/a&gt;. Every one of the major US tech companies, save Microsoft, is currently under increased antitrust scrutiny from the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, as well as state attorneys general, with various levels of investigations underway. While Apple is not under formal investigation, CEO Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21335706/antitrust-hearing-highlights-facebook-google-amazon-apple-congress-testimony"&gt;testified this past summer&lt;/a&gt; before the Senate Judiciary Committee during its tech antitrust hearing. Meanwhile, the European Commission has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;two ongoing antitrust investigations&lt;/a&gt; into Apple’s App Store and Apple Pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4f3J3m"&gt;Apple has already testified against North Dakota’s new bill in a hearing on Tuesday with North Dakota’s Senate Industry, Business and Labor Committee. Apple’s Erik Neuenschwander, its chief privacy engineer, told the committee the bill “threatens to destroy iPhone as you know it” and that it would “undermine the privacy, security, safety, and performance that’s built into iPhone by design,” according to the &lt;em&gt;Bismarck Tribune&lt;/em&gt;. “Simply put, we work hard to keep bad apps out of the App Store; (the bill) could require us to let them in.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y1XOt5"&gt;Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson, who attended the hearing and testified in favor of the bill, criticized Apple for exaggerating the threat the bill poses to its business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GwInFj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;North Dakota's SB 2333 is the first real, concrete legislative proposal I've seen that actually gives me hope that tech monopolies aren't going to rule the world forever. Fargo or Bismarck sound like wonderful places to set up shop under a shield against abuse   &lt;/p&gt;— DHH (@dhh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1359203441827078145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fNPc52"&gt;Hansson has become a vocal critic of Apple’s App Store policies, following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293419/hey-apple-rejection-ios-app-store-dhh-gangsters-antitrust"&gt;showdown his company had with Apple&lt;/a&gt; last summer over Basecamp’s Hey email client. The disagreement centered on the functions of the Hey iOS email app, and Hansson and Basecamp CEO Jason Fried complained that the situation was emblematic of Apple’s inconsistently applied rules and the lengths the company goes to ensure developers are not sidestepping the 30 percent cut mandate. Although Apple and Basecamp &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;reached a compromise&lt;/a&gt;, Hansson has since called for congressional action, as well as stronger antitrust regulation, to try to force Apple to alter its policies and to reign in Big Tech at large. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="APyX5i"&gt;In written testimony Hansson prepared prior to the hearing, he laid out his case for Senate Bill 2333. “After the recitals, the 17 lines of SB 2333 read like music. Written in a language I can understand without hiring counsel to parse it for me. It almost seems too good to be true! But I sincerely hope that it is not,” he wrote in his testimony, which he later &lt;a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/testimony-before-the-north-dakota-senate-industry-business-and-labor-committee/"&gt;released online&lt;/a&gt;. “That you will listen to the small software developers from all over the country, who are tired of being bullied and shaken down by a handful of big tech monopolists out of Seattle and Silicon Valley.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmdyQn"&gt;Hansson says the US needs a “fair digital marketplace free of monopoly abuse” and that “no single change will have a greater impact than giving small software makers like us a choice when it comes to in-app payment systems, and protection from retaliation, if we refuse the onerous deal the monopolists are offering.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayiay1"&gt;Chairman Sen. Jerry Klein (R-Fessenden) said during the committee hearing that “there’s still some mulling to be done” and that no action would be taken on the bill as of yet. Neither Apple nor Google have immediately responded to requests for comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is teasing us with dark mode for desktop search</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mqA596MFJlwA7s9DhGhXlNI2CJM=/0x3:1147x768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68799457/capture.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P2C9Nx"&gt;Google appears to be rolling out a dark mode for desktop search, but only some people have it right now. If the change has rolled out to you and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18270975/how-to-dark-mode-iphone-android-mac-windows-xbox-ps4-nintendo-switch"&gt;your system is set to dark mode&lt;/a&gt;, the background of Google’s search pages will be a very dark gray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3AVOV5"&gt;Here’s an example of what the new dark mode looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A8iD1eb17R-1uVbKpkD6biNdQVw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22294957/capture__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ct0rJV"&gt;A couple of &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers had their search pages automatically switch to dark mode, and &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/10/google-search-dark-mode-on-desktop-will-be-able-to-match-your-system-theme/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and some &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ruchernchong/status/1359537637049028611"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/olearycrew/status/1359525437643362305"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mkgirlnextdoor/status/1359522898067750913"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; have seen the new dark mode, too. But it doesn’t seem to be something that everyone has just yet. Google’s search pages are still white for me, for example, even though I have dark mode turned on right now on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s62hQy"&gt;This isn’t the first time a desktop search dark mode has appeared: &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reported &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/29/google-search-dark-mode-web/"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt; that some people were seeing dark mode then. It’s unclear if what people are seeing now is some kind of test or a full rollout, so there’s always a chance that Google could turn dark mode back off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lqJoJW"&gt;Google didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CopNrs"&gt;If you’re a dark mode fan, it’s been an eventful few days. Changes to Twitter’s dark mode caught some people unawares last week when their dark mode unexpectedly got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22265306/twitter-dark-mode-dim-lights-out-black-darker-light-settings"&gt;even darker&lt;/a&gt;. And Microsoft is now testing changes to Word to make &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274181/microsoft-word-dark-mode-canvas-update-beta"&gt;entire documents dark&lt;/a&gt; when you’re using dark mode.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is reportedly working on a Clubhouse copy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BAYeAVXWxgZm8J5boQeVRA4jPGo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68799406/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CzhMGo"&gt;Facebook, a company known for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22216692/facebook-nearby-feature-copied-italian-court-app-faround"&gt;ripping its ideas&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21136898/facebook-pinterest-photo-sharing-app"&gt;competitors&lt;/a&gt;, has reportedly set its sights on social audio. &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/facebook-building-product-clubhouse.html"&gt;reports today&lt;/a&gt; that the company is working on a copycat of Clubhouse, the buzzy invite-only social audio startup. The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reports the product is in the “early stages of development,” so it’s unclear if and when it might launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrG4Uw"&gt;The news comes only &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-on-clubhouse-2021-2"&gt;five days after&lt;/a&gt; CEO Mark Zuckerberg joined Clubhouse and participated in a room to talk about the future of augmented and virtual reality. His presence on the app was shocking, given it’s a new social network, so the fact that Facebook might now be cloning Clubhouse is no surprise. The company has already done so with multiple other apps, including, most infamously, Stories, which it took from Snapchat, and Reels, its TikTok competitor that launched last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFxjZV"&gt;Twitter is also working on a Clubhouse competitor called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22187490/twitter-spaces-test-voice-chat-rooms"&gt;Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, which is in beta at the moment. Its team &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/twitter-acquires-social-podcasting-app-breaker-team-to-help-build-twitter-spaces/"&gt;acquired&lt;/a&gt; social podcasting company Breaker, seemingly for its expertise in social audio, to help beef up its efforts. Meanwhile, Mark Cuban is also at work on a live audio app called Fireside, which &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;reported on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272148/mark-cuban-fireside-podcast-app-launch-creator-conversations"&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly, lots of people in tech think audio will be an important format for communicating in the future, and they’re rapidly trying to get in on it before the trend dies out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-115" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $110 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731722633239801630" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4781ccd9dac6fb8bf9e60c657cd3fbba&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/979838/2092?sharedid=verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. Right now, if you don’t mind buying refurbished, they are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730154636955201273" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$190 at Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Google now pays 450 sites to bring you free news, including some paywalled stories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UaCQNsxGUY9iglowWHuBcQmwcSY=/188x0:812x416/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68799291/Garamond_Blogpost_Hero_Image_2_OFwnitg.max_1000x1000.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UqTREX"&gt;Google’s News Showcase, a program wherein the search giant pays to curate news content from publishers, has launched in the UK and Argentina. &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/news/google-news-showcase-launches-uk"&gt;In the UK&lt;/a&gt;, the service covers over 120 publications, while &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/news/google-news-showcase-launches-argentina-/"&gt;40 Argentinian publications&lt;/a&gt; have signed up. For readers, the service includes the ability to access &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22149118/googles-news-showcase-free-paywall-access"&gt;select paywalled content for free&lt;/a&gt;. News Showcase launched in &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/google-news-showcase/"&gt;Germany and Brazil&lt;/a&gt; last year, and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/05/google-launches-news-showcase-in-australia-in-sign-of-compromise-over-media-code"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; last week, and now includes content from over 450 publications worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bnt5q5"&gt;In the UK, publications available through the service include &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, the&lt;em&gt; Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;New Statesman&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;, while Argentinian publications include &lt;em&gt;Clarín&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;La Nación&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Perfil&lt;/em&gt;. An &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/australia/answering-your-top-questions-about-google-news-showcase/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28The+Keyword+%7C+Official+Google+Blog%29#jump-content:~:text=Payments%20are%20made%20for%20the%20publishers%E2%80%99,is%20on%20top%20of%20that%20fee."&gt;FAQ from Google&lt;/a&gt; notes that publishers are paid a monthly fee to curate news stories for the service, as well as for access to paywalled content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pidFWT"&gt;News Showcase is available in the Google News app on iOS, Android, and mobile web, as well as Discover on iOS. On select Android phones, like Google Pixel devices, Discover is available by swiping to the left on the home screen. The interface shows lists of articles from each publication, which you can tap to read in full. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XB5saf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;More than 120 publications in the U.K. will start curating content for News Showcase, many of them local newspapers that do not have the same resources that many larger, national papers have to invest in their digital transformation. 2/ &lt;a href="https://t.co/CV3mFa2QUK"&gt;https://t.co/CV3mFa2QUK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/buDHqtiA9N"&gt;pic.twitter.com/buDHqtiA9N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Google News Initiative (@GoogleNewsInit) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleNewsInit/status/1359543094106984453?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6Xwz5z"&gt;Last week, Google News Showcase launched in Australia, a country where the company is currently locking horns with lawmakers over new rules &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/19/21227263/australia-facebook-google-ad-revenue-media-coronavirus-economy"&gt;that could force it&lt;/a&gt; to pay news publishers for their content. Google recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243468/google-threatens-to-remove-its-search-engine-from-australia-if-new-law-goes-into-effect"&gt;threatened to pull its search engine&lt;/a&gt; from the country if the News Media Bargaining Code goes into effect. Last week, Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he’d held “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/feb/04/scott-morrison-has-constructive-talks-with-google-boss-on-news-media-code"&gt;constructive&lt;/a&gt;” talks with Google CEO Sundar Pichai over the new rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUV1ob"&gt;The situation means that although seven Australian publishers have joined the program, covering over 25 publications, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/05/google-launches-news-showcase-in-australia-in-sign-of-compromise-over-media-code"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that one outlet, Nine, chose not to negotiate with Google until the new code is brought in. In &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/australia/top-questions-news-code/#jump-content:~:text=Google%20News%20Showcase%20would%20be%20subject,an%20arbitrator%20to%20resolve%20any%20disagreements."&gt;an FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, Google says it believes News Showcase should be compatible with the new rules, since publishers are free to enter into arbitration if they don’t like Google’s News Showcase deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VWdiWF"&gt;Facebook has a similar news initiative that involves paying publishers to license their content in the form of the News tab, a section of the service that includes a mix of curated and personalized news stories. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21285656/facebook-news-tab-section-launch-us-local-publishers-partnership"&gt;launching in the US&lt;/a&gt;, the tab recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248814/facebook-news-uk-launch-articles-tab-curated"&gt;arrived in the UK&lt;/a&gt;. Similar to Google News Showcase, the service involves Facebook paying select publishers to license content, including some that would normally be paywalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G9P66I"&gt;Beyond the UK and Argentina, Google says it’s also readying to launch News Showcase in France, Canada, and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pk7ndD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0ZBYy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ns6w5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch Series 3 (non-LTE) review: third time’s the charm","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is $169 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K37HKT8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731924340555615481" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/955948/9383?subId1=VergeBestAppleWatchDeals020321&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F499753351%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is $30 off its usual price of $199. If you are looking for the Series 3 in 42mm, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-38mm-Space-Aluminium/dp/B07K387Y7K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, Best Buy (space gray only), and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/955948/9383?subId1=VergeBestAppleWatchDeals020321&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F185638711&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, have knocked $30 off its price as well, bringing it down to $199. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bf2vA"&gt;If you buy the wearable at Best Buy, you will also receive six months of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174574/apple-fitness-plus-watch-iphone-release-date-price"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/a&gt; at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0eLZZK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch SE review: pay a lot less to give up only a little","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6p1Qub"&gt;The best deal right now on the Apple Watch SE 40mm with GPS is at Amazon, which has knocked $10 off its normal price in select colors, bringing the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5W9QWZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;price down to $269&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYyAAC"&gt;The 44mm with GPS is also on sale at several retailers. The lowest you can currently get this model for at Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5QB5QT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$294 in silver&lt;/a&gt; with a white band, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5V7H7H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5XTRZD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;. Walmart also has this model on sale for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$294 in rose gold&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, with respective starting costs of $399 and $429. The Apple Watch Series 6 features more sensors than previous models, including a sensor that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram announces tougher consequences for hate speech in direct messages</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PtGgJVRaLlvp2PbZ9zabWM352ko=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68799198/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5PbhNk"&gt;Instagram is toughening its stance on hate speech in direct messages. The company &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/an-update-on-our-work-to-tackle-abuse-on-instagram"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll start disabling the accounts of people who repeatedly send hateful messages. First-time offenders won’t be able to send messages for an undefined period of time, but if they send hateful messages again, their account will be disabled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jsvlx5"&gt;“We’ll also disable new accounts created to get around our messaging restrictions, and will continue to disable accounts we find that are created purely to send abusive messages,” an Instagram blog post states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvP8Eh"&gt;Instagram’s hate speech policy bans attacks on people based on protected characteristics, including race or religion, as well as “more implicit forms of hate speech,” like content depicting blackface and anti-Semitic tropes. Instagram says it also cooperates with law enforcement when necessary to assist in hate speech cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvGe1B"&gt;This update to hate speech processes stems from a situation in the UK where soccer stars were targeted with racist abuse on Instagram after losing a match. Prince William, who is also the president of England’s Football Association, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KensingtonRoyal/status/1355934414279204866"&gt;issued a statement&lt;/a&gt; last month saying “racist abuse - whether on the pitch, in the stands, or on social media - is despicable and it must stop now.” Four football clubs &lt;a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/12201010/axel-tuanzebe-manchester-united-defender-racially-abused-on-instagram-after-sheffield-united-defeat"&gt;also issued a statement&lt;/a&gt; against the abuse, and the mayor of Greater Manchester pushed the social networks to step up in helping curb it. This procedural update could dissuade people from sending a terrible message but will also only work if Instagram can continue to quickly disable accounts as they pop up.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Big Fitbit update adds Charge 4 health features, brings premium data to more users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KQKES06GZdlolc30DylKyVPu_Po=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68799046/Fitbit_Charge_4_Core_Black_Rosewood_v2_Screens_Cropped.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The FitBit Charge 4 gets a healthy feature boost with a new update | Image: FitBit&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ip8V2Y"&gt;Fitbit is offering a major update for some of its current smartwatches. As &lt;a href="https://www.wareable.com/fitbit/fitbit-update-charge-4-temp-sp02-health-metrics-glucose-feb-2021-8298"&gt;detailed by &lt;em&gt;Wareable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the company is making new health data available to Charge 4 users and expanding access to previously paywalled information to more users. Fitbit, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22188428/google-fitbit-acquisition-completed-approved"&gt;recently acquired by Google&lt;/a&gt;, continues its trend of supporting devices well after launch with feature updates and fixes to keep them fresh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LrdVOI"&gt;With the update, Charge 4 users will be able to access blood oxygen readings on the watchface, information that was previously available only through the app in sleep data. The update also adds skin temperature data to the Charge 4, which wasn’t offered previously on this device at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PMHxta"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fitbit Sense review: enough bugs to raise your heart rate","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21450123/fitbit-sense-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gbqtVX"&gt;Owners of the Charge 4, Versa 2, and Inspire 2 also gain access to Health Metrics, which previously required a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/28/20835674/fitbit-premium-subscription-service-personalized-data-challenges#:~:text=Fitbit%20Premium%20is%20a%20new,Fitbit%20fitness%20trackers%20and%20smartwatches."&gt;Premium subscription&lt;/a&gt;. This dashboard shows trends for certain health metrics — including breathing rate during sleep and heart rate variability — over a recent period of time. Premium subscribers still get a little extra information, since their dashboards will show a full month’s worth of information while the free version shows only seven days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJLuNR"&gt;Fitbit also continues to expand access to its EKG feature on the Sense, making it available to customers in Canada, New Zealand, and US territories. This feature wasn’t available in all regions when the device launched, but it &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/fitbit-sense-ecg-app-rollout-071725627.html"&gt;was added in places like the US&lt;/a&gt; following regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukdJhg"&gt;This update shows that Fitbit remains committed to rolling out new features and addressing issues proactively. It addressed EKG issues with some Sense units last year by contacting affected users and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/4/22152346/fitbit-sense-electrocardiogram-ecg-reading-hardware-issue-replacement"&gt;replacing their smartwatches&lt;/a&gt;. Fitbit has also supported the Charge 4 for nearly a year old now, with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/11/21321298/fitbit-charge-4-smart-wake-dynamic-gps"&gt;previous update&lt;/a&gt; to add new features and better manage things like GPS use. So while we’ve seen devices with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21450123/fitbit-sense-review"&gt;their share of bugs at launch&lt;/a&gt;, Fitbit users can take comfort that the company is listening at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;
