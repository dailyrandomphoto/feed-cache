    <title>You can now hide like counts on Instagram and Facebook</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kwbQvj1_XrGbBaO54-q2kLj4b3I=/40x0:1660x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69344538/IG_Hiding_Likes__Consumer_View_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8k7TKT"&gt;You can now hide like counts on Instagram and Facebook. After years of testing on both platforms, Facebook and Instagram have settled on an opt-in experience for hiding like counts to allow people to disable seeing them across all posts and an option to hide their own public like counts from others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYfAa7"&gt;Instagram is enabling this feature after years of tests and pressure from experts to make changes to its platform. The service was ranked as “the most detrimental to young people’s mental health and wellbeing” in a &lt;a href="https://www.rsph.org.uk/about-us/news/instagram-ranked-worst-for-young-people-s-mental-health.html"&gt;2017 study&lt;/a&gt; by the Royal Society for Public Health UK. &lt;a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/science/how-removing-likes-from-instagram-could-affect-our-mental-health"&gt;Experts have argued&lt;/a&gt; that removing a like button or like counts could help reduce anxiety and social pressures for some Facebook and Instagram users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qcSjNO"&gt;“We tested hiding like counts to see if it might depressurize people’s experience on Instagram,” says an Instagram spokesperson. “What we heard from people and experts was that not seeing like counts was beneficial for some, and annoying to others, particularly because people use like counts to get a sense for what’s trending or popular, so we’re giving you the choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_gHOgYucb6dNkd5codKvIet0WQI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22540453/FB_Hiding_Likes_Mock.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;How to hide Facebook like counts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ImiIQ0"&gt;You’ll now be able to toggle an option to hide all like counts on all posts in your feed on both Instagram and Facebook today. A separate option will let you hide your own like counts to others. You can also hide like counts on a per-post basis on Instagram, so there’s a little more flexibility to allow people to focus on the content of posts rather than the like counts. Facebook will get these same per-post controls in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFTnt9"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/26/20885990/facebook-hide-public-like-count-test-user-experience-australia"&gt;first started testing hidden like counts&lt;/a&gt; in September 2019 as an experiment to see if the change would improve the experience of using the platform. Instagram has also been testing a variety of ways to hide like counts in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/14/20964865/instagram-test-hide-like-counts-expands-us-globally"&gt;recent years&lt;/a&gt;, with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382692/instagram-public-like-count-test-expand"&gt;test for this same optional feature&lt;/a&gt; just last month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney’s Cruella is absolutely absurd</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Emma Stone as Cruella de Vil. She has black and white hair and is dressed in a structured leather ballgown. Her lips are painted with red glitter and “the future” is written over her eyes in black paint." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xo5n3ELAVqVxlyOxnU56XPtjLc8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69344568/cru_24747_r2_79c1746d.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Walk walk fashion baby | Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;It will delight you even as you question its need to exist&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="6hgAsF"&gt;I spent the entire run of Disney’s &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; torn between delight and horror. Rarely has a film so neatly emotionally vivisected me as this one about a villain best known for &lt;em&gt;wanting to skin puppies to make a coat&lt;/em&gt;. Only &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; isn’t about that character really. It’s not about her war with the fur industry or PETA. It’s definitely not about a collection of Dalmatian dogs fleeing her furrier desires. It’s a colorful and pulpy tale of a woman with profound narcissistic tendencies getting vengeance on a murderer and becoming a London fashion icon. I’m sorry if you ever thought, “I could never have anything but camp-fueled affection for Disney’s puppy killer” because this gal is a delight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7hOpW"&gt;This is more &lt;em&gt;Wicked&lt;/em&gt; than &lt;em&gt;Joker &lt;/em&gt;in that it reimagines a notorious villain as a misunderstood hero besmirched by popular media. Yet I have no idea &lt;em&gt;why &lt;/em&gt;it is a movie about Cruella de Vil and not simply an original film about a woman with profound narcissistic tendencies getting vengeance on a murderer and becoming a London fashion icon. Where &lt;em&gt;Wicked&lt;/em&gt; (both the book and the musical) takes pains to explore how media can corrupt an image, &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; largely sidesteps jibes about populism or media to just put on a big fabulous show.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Emma Stone dressed as Cruella de Vil. She is wearing a red ballgown with a black military style top." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ay2iHTFzxqhjnJHRxBljIR8Pk0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539291/cru_27097_r_c264a6a0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emma Stone looks fabulous 90 percent of the time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tFby7K"&gt;Plus, apart from the occasional cameo from Roger (played by a wonderfully schluppy-looking Kayvan Novak), Anita (a perky but sly Kirby Howell-Baptiste), and some black-and-white spotted pups, &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; has nothing to do with any of its source material. &lt;em&gt;Wicked&lt;/em&gt; at least took us to the natural end of the story after building up its hero. I’m not saying I needed to see Emma Stone skin 101 puppies, but at least then the focus on Cruella would have made sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrkqgW"&gt;In every lull in the film I found myself trying to figure out why exactly &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; exists, entertaining as it is. One colleague jokingly told me he thinks it was made because Disney made some digital dog tech from &lt;em&gt;Lady and the Tramp&lt;/em&gt; and wanted to get the most out of it. To his credit, there are a lot of dogs running between Emma Stone's legs and leaping over her and generally being adorable in &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;. There are even a few Dalmatians! They all look realistic and pettable until the uncanny valley occasionally catches them in its maw and you are reminded that those are some very fake dogs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBgrgY"&gt;And even if this film &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; greenlit as some bean counter’s way of making back the cash spent to produce the tech for &lt;em&gt;Lady and the Tramp,&lt;/em&gt; it still means that somewhere once upon a time some Disney execs were sitting in their office, legs up on the desk, tasteful Mickey Mouse-branded socks peeking out from between expensively tailored pants and more expensive shoes, and looking at this pitch, saying “sure, let’s reimagine the story of that villain who really has no redeemable quality apart from her taste in cars as a misunderstood antisocial heroine just out to resolve some true injustices in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Emma Stone as Cruella de Vil in a red gown surrounded by party goers dressed entirely in black and white." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K-eTx143tdh4Eppwr_6fWwzpWyg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539293/24d414407a5cf2e6633fe7a10cc44182_4096x2730_b7af0050.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This woman was previously on fire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iyLjtl"&gt;At no point does the film attempt to explain — or even hint — at how Cruella would turn from a fashion icon with a very deeply buried heart of gold into a monster forcing her friends to kidnap puppies from another friend and to make a coat. It starts with Cruella, then called Estella, going to school, causing trouble, and being doted on by her exceptionally nice mother. After a murder that Cruella blames herself for, she flees into the streets of London and meets two young thieves, Jasper and Horace. She dyes her distinguishable hair and joins them in their heist and the three become a family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6XOlx"&gt;But as much as Estella loves crime, her true passion is &lt;em&gt;fashion&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FaDvSf"&gt;We then shoot forward 10 years to an otherworldly version of ‘70s London. Estella’s adoptive brothers (Joel Fry gives Jasper heart even as Paul Walter Hauser happily plays Horace as a cartoon) get her a job at a high-end store in the hopes she’ll wow them with her skills as a designer and seamstress. And while she enrages her bosses, she catches the eye of the Baroness (Emma Thompson), the biggest and most powerful designer in London. Estella then is torn between a desire to prove herself to the Baroness and to destroy the Baroness, and the movie quickly becomes scene after scene of guerilla fashion shows framed like the most gorgeous-looking heists you’ve ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Emma Thompson as the Baroness. Her hair is up in an intricate hairstyle, she is wearing large sunglasses, gold earrings, a pearl necklace and a large gold coat." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mDOZX-STGhPUL-RMfBF3cM0U3o4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539294/d3825ac27da7201ee96eaeab7066aa0e_4096x2730_745628ce.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Emma Thompson will be compared to Meryl Streep in &lt;/em&gt;The Devil Wears Prada&lt;em&gt;. The comparison will be well earned.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2HGWfo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt; borders on camp with the way it hops between absurdity and melodrama — often in the same scene. I questioned if I was stoned as Cruella raced across London in a dump truck after charging a one-eyed Chihuahua with a jailbreak. Not because it was silly (it was!) but because it was played deadly seriously. Stone and Thompson anchor the whole affair with cartoonish characters treated with the gravitas of historical figures. They do not wink at the camera. They do not make sly referential jokes about the story material. They just go to war with flaming dresses and shimmering moth cocoons and the occasional blow of a dog whistle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J7eQ60"&gt;You usually know when you’re supposed to laugh and when you’re just supposed to enjoy yourself watching a movie, but I found myself torn constantly by &lt;em&gt;Cruella&lt;/em&gt;. It's like a fairy tale, and it's like a really good graphic novel, and it's unlike any of the films it will get compared to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LD2MF8"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Cruella &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;premieres on Disney Plus Friday, May 28th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon buys MGM for $8.45 billion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MGM Logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QRNGpUaT8r90oQ1ZabsmhoMuYFg=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69344420/mgm-logo.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Metro Goldwyn Mayer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Keh1ON"&gt;Amazon has &lt;a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-and-mgm-have-signed-agreement-amazon-acquire-mgm"&gt;reached a deal&lt;/a&gt; to acquire the film and TV company MGM for $8.45 billion, the companies announced today. It’s a significant acquisition for the e-commerce giant, and it means it will own a library of content that’s reported to consist of around &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/22/hollywood-giant-mgm-puts-itself-up-for-sale-at-5bn"&gt;4,000 films and 17,000 hours of TV&lt;/a&gt;. The acquisition is likely to help Amazon attract even more big-spending Prime subscribers as its Prime Video service competes with the likes of Netflix and Disney Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="meMfR2"&gt;MGM is perhaps most notable for being the Hollywood studio behind the James Bond and Rocky franchises, but its library runs the gamut from classic films like &lt;em&gt;12 Angry Men&lt;/em&gt; to modern TV shows like &lt;em&gt;The Handmaid’s Tale &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Vikings&lt;/em&gt;. MGM’s library also includes unscripted TV shows like &lt;em&gt;The Voice &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; Shark Tank&lt;/em&gt;. Amazon says the acquisition will “provide customers with greater access” to MGM’s works and “empower” the studio to continue its “great storytelling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xL6skJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The real financial value behind this deal is the treasure trove of IP”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hj5th0"&gt;“The real financial value behind this deal is the treasure trove of IP in the deep catalog that we plan to reimagine and develop together with MGM’s talented team,” Mike Hopkins, senior vice president of Prime Video and Amazon Studios, said in a statement. “It’s very exciting and provides so many opportunities for high-quality storytelling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nrJrIu"&gt;Amazon’s media business has so far been a relatively small part of its overall empire, although it still spends billions on content each year. A substantial portion of Prime subscribers make use of the included free Prime Video streaming. Of the 200 million-plus people worldwide who are currently subscribed to Amazon Prime, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/amazon-q1-2021-prime-video-viewers-1234963065/"&gt;over 175 million&lt;/a&gt; streamed video last year. Adding thousands more films and TV shows could be a boon for both figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lnNZQ"&gt;Reports of Amazon’s possible acquisition of MGM first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441330/amazon-mgm-offer"&gt;emerged in mid-May&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/digital/news/amazon-mgm-acquisition-talks-9-billion-1234975168/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the deal was being negotiated by Hopkins. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-nears-deal-to-buy-hollywood-studio-mgm-11621880759"&gt;on May 24th&lt;/a&gt; that Amazon was nearing a deal to buy MGM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rmj78M"&gt;MGM is currently owned by a collection of private equity firms, including Anchorage Capital Group, Highland Capital Management, and Solus Alternative Asset Management. Reports that MGM was up for sale &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mgm-holdings-studio-behind-james-bond-explores-a-sale-11608588732"&gt;emerged last December&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epXi5p"&gt;The sale of MGM comes during a period of Hollywood consolidation, as companies attempt to beef up their content libraries to compete with Netflix and Disney. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439964/at-t-warnermedia-discovery-merger-spin-off"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T recently spun out its media business WarnerMedia&lt;/a&gt; to merge it with TV company Discovery, creating the world’s second largest media firm by revenue outside of Disney. Both companies have their own streaming services (HBO Max and Discovery Plus), raising the possibility of them being combined into a single, more substantial service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJdz5Y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="syhKkl"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Headphones are a generation old at this point, but they still provide a comfortable fit, pleasant sound, and active noise cancellation.

Originally $350, Woot is selling &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8532386-13112648?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fmicrosoft-surface-headphones-13%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_0_2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;brand-new Surface Headphones for just $80&lt;/a&gt; today, making them one of the best values in noise-canceling headphones right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="xVcWdn"&gt;The 2020 Roku Ultra may not be considered our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21375098/best-streaming-device"&gt;favorite streaming device&lt;/a&gt;, however, it’s also not one to scoff at. It’s the most capable device in the Roku lineup, equipped with both a USB port for external media and an ethernet port for those times when your Wi-Fi is acting up or overloaded. It also supports a range of content, from 4K to HDR to Dolby Vision, and features quick performance, thanks to its quad-core processor.

    <title>Scammy iOS app discovered that refuses to open unless you give it a good review</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mJwUQO2mVOG0Bwa8r_RmzeFyMbA=/0x1:1898x1266/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69344133/E2QqsPEVUAA8_Rg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A selection of app reviews detailing the scammy behavior.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1397288727349657604" target="_blank"&gt;Kosta Eleftheriou&lt;/a&gt; / App Store&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kxk3Bk"&gt;App developer and scam app hunter Kosta Eleftheriou’s latest discovery is a real doozy, an iOS app that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1397288720357679104?s=21"&gt;refuses to function&lt;/a&gt; before you give it at least a 3-star review in the App Store. Although the UPNP Xtreme app — which claimed to let users stream video to their TVs — now appears to have &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/id1223416942"&gt;been pulled&lt;/a&gt;, we were able to verify that it generates the App Store rating box the second it opens. You can’t dismiss the ratings box, nor can you tap the 1 or 2-star ratings, Eleftheriou said. We verified this behavior, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/prvrtl/status/1397301269279223809"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; other &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HenrickTheBull/status/1397346867965571073"&gt;users &lt;/a&gt;report they were able to dismiss the dialog box or leave a lower rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrXoCo"&gt;This is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;just&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22386533/ios-app-scam-jungle-runner-magical-forest-apple-kosta"&gt;the&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395907/apple-match-three-game-gambling-marina-misko-vegas-pirates-lucky-stars"&gt;latest&lt;/a&gt; scammy app to have been unearthed by Elefheriou, who’s been waging a war against them after his own Apple Watch keyboard app, FlickType, was &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356011082075148291"&gt;overtaken by expensive apps&lt;/a&gt; with fake reviews. Eleftheriou says Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou#:~:text=eleftheriou%20tells%20me%20that%20apple%20has%20removed%20over%20100%20apps%20due%20to%20his%20reports%20%E2%80%94%20and%20if%20you%E2%80%99re%20wondering%20whether%20his%20online%20crusade%20is%20personal%2C%20the%20answer%20is%20most%20definitely%20yes"&gt;removed over 100 apps&lt;/a&gt; as a result of his reports, but it’s concerning that the multi-billion dollar company isn’t catching these scams during its App Store review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b9o50E"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you think you can trust App Store ratings, you haven’t been paying enough attention. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This is the iOS *system* rating prompt, not a custom look-alike one.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The worst part? This trick is EXTREMELY easy for any developer to do, and not limited to this app.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1397288722706489353?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QKwGD7"&gt;The UPNP Xtreme app’s behavior directly contradicts one of the best practices Apple lists on its developer site, &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/storekit/skstorereviewcontroller/requesting_app_store_reviews"&gt;which states&lt;/a&gt; that developers should “avoid showing a request for a review immediately when a user launches your app.” Generally, developers are allowed to prompt for a rating up to there times in a 365-day period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTXPiB"&gt;Apple’s review process has been under particularly intense scrutiny recently because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;Epic Games’ lawsuit against the company&lt;/a&gt;. Central to the dispute is the 30 percent commission Apple takes on many App Store payments and in-app purchases. Apple argues it needs the commission to run the App Store and create a safe environment for users. But that argument gets undermined pretty quickly if obvious scammy apps are able to slip through Apple’s review process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YoIyyV"&gt;Apps like the ones discovered by Eleftheriou not only harm customers who end up downloading scammy software and can get tricked into paying for difficult-to-cancel recurring subscriptions. It also harms legitimate developers who have to contend with apps that are willing to play dirty to get the good reviews needed to rise up the App Store’s rankings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEMtkm"&gt;Eleftheriou filed a lawsuit against Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, arguing it exploits its monopoly power over iOS app to make money at the expense of app developers and consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla will store Chinese car data locally, following government fears about spying</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CHINA-AUTOMOBILE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m3ePL85XM7AVPvp0GEfsMHiTJUM=/52x0:3949x2598/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69344105/1212733626.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;China is a key market for Tesla. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by NOEL CELIS/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K25mBm"&gt;Tesla says it’s established a data center in China to store and process information produced by its vehicles locally. The announcement, &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/3615027564/Kh8mMfpDQ?from=page_1006063615027564_profile&amp;amp;wvr=6&amp;amp;mod=weibotime&amp;amp;type=comment"&gt;made on Weibo&lt;/a&gt;, comes as the US carmaker faces pressure from Chinese authorities over fears its cars could be used for spying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHQDdT"&gt;“Car data security is very important,” said Tesla (via Google Translate). “All data generated from the sales of vehicles in the Chinese mainland market will be stored in China.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="r3N7XI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Telsa cars are reportedly banned from Chinese military sites&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LNrDDv"&gt;Reports from &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-to-restrict-tesla-usage-by-military-and-state-personnel-11616155643?mod=mhp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-19/tesla-cars-banned-by-china-s-military-on-concerns-about-cameras?sref=GYlFC92K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said Tesla’s cars have been banned from Chinese military sites, and that “military staff and employees of key state-owned companies” are prohibited from owning the vehicles. Chinese authorities were reportedly concerned that the exterior cameras on the cars could be used to collect sensitive data and send it back to the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDR0oE"&gt;Elon Musk responded by saying if this was true it would be the end of the company in China. “There’s a very strong incentive for us to be very confidential with any information,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/21/22343018/elon-musk-tesla-shut-down-cars-spying-china"&gt;said Musk in March&lt;/a&gt;. “If Tesla used cars to spy in China or anywhere, we will get shut down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52Lu6s"&gt;Tesla certainly needs to keep China happy to ensure the company’s future growth. China is the world’s largest market for electric vehicles — around three to four times the size of the the US. Tesla sold 147,445 cars in China last year, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-forum-musk/musk-says-tesla-would-be-shut-down-if-its-cars-spied-in-china-elsewhere-idUSKBN2BC04Q"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, accounting for 30 percent of global sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X99nyr"&gt;Last month, the Chinese government &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/china-autos-data-idUSL1N2MM0O0"&gt;published draft rules&lt;/a&gt; outlining its concerns with data-collection by smart vehicles. The rules state that data about roads, buildings, and terrain should not leave the country, and that customers should have to consent to data collection. Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/tesla-gives-chinas-new-data-security-proposal-a-big-like/"&gt;expressed support for the rules&lt;/a&gt; through social media accounts in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fIx6ws"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft claims Edge is now ‘the best performing browser on Windows 10’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YeWS65UIVSHEjM0q-qbe_mH8HkM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69343928/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hQm2lP"&gt;Microsoft is now claiming the performance crown in the desktop browser battle. The software maker has been gradually adding new features to Edge over the past year to improve performance and launch times. These additions have allowed Microsoft to claim itself the performance winner, even as Google &lt;a href="https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2021/05/stable-channel-update-for-desktop_25.html"&gt;releases Chrome 91 today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="46Kwnu"&gt;“Microsoft Edge will be the best performing browser on Windows 10 when Microsoft Edge version 91 releases later this week,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2021/05/25/whats-new-edge-build-2021/"&gt;says the Microsoft Edge team in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “So, why can we say this? It’s simple: startup boost and sleeping tabs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UntMTW"&gt;Microsoft first started rolling out its new startup boost feature in Edge back in March, with claims that it makes browser launches up to 41 percent faster. The new sleeping tabs feature also appeared earlier this year, designed to improve browser performance. Edge now automatically releases system resources for inactive tabs, which helps new tabs run better or stop the browser from hogging memory and CPU resources in the background. Microsoft is also working on a separate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391505/microsoft-edge-performance-mode-ram-cpu-battery-usage"&gt;performance mode for Edge&lt;/a&gt; that’s currently in testing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Rhd7Qt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google has also been improving Chrome performance&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5a8PWq"&gt;Google hasn’t been sitting around letting Chrome eat up more RAM, either. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22326952/google-chrome-89-resource-efficiency-memory-hog-startup-speed-improvements"&gt;Recent updates to Chrome&lt;/a&gt; have included a bigger focus on performance, with a more advanced memory allocator to reduce memory usage and increase performance. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571832/google-chrome-2020-speed-memory-improvements"&gt;last update to Chrome in 2020&lt;/a&gt; was also all about efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X4qy9Q"&gt;Microsoft has also revealed it has now submitted 5,300 commits to the Chromium browser project, which will also benefit Chrome and other Chromium-based browsers. While sleeping tabs and startup boost are features for Edge, Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/27/21083299/microsoft-google-chrome-tab-management-chromium-improvements-feature"&gt;helped Google improve Chrome’s tab management&lt;/a&gt;, and the rivals have worked together on a variety of underlying Chromium improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp sues Indian government over new rules it says break encryption</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xxRLqJ6NPhk23z-RwrHim66jxgM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69343850/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="C4n87g"&gt;Facebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp is suing India’s government over new internet rules it claims are unconstitutional and will “severely undermine the privacy” of its users, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/25/technology/whatsapp-india-lawsuit.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code, which was introduced in February and comes into effect today, contains a requirement that messaging apps identify the “first originator of information” when asked. But WhatsApp, which boasts nearly 400 million users in its largest market of India, argues that doing so would require it to trace every message sent on its service, violating users’ right to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JK0cAb"&gt;“Civil society and technical experts around the world have consistently argued that a requirement to “trace” private messages would break end-to-end encryption and lead to real abuse,” a spokesperson for the service said in a statement. “WhatsApp is committed to protecting the privacy of people’s personal messages and we will continue to do all we can within the laws of India to do so.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYOocJ"&gt;WhatsApp’s warnings about “traceability” are backed of many of the world’s biggest technology firms and digital rights groups including Mozilla, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), and the Center for Democracy and Technology. In a statement about a similar plan to &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/08/faq-why-brazils-plan-mandate-traceability-private-messaging-apps-will-break-users"&gt;mandate traceability in Brazil&lt;/a&gt;, the EFF said that implementing traceability “will break users’ expectations of privacy and security, and would be hard to implement to match current security and privacy standards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RdFV3Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A requirement to ‘trace’ private messages would break end-to-end encryption”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CTP3tU"&gt;Responding to efforts by India and other countries to force it to trace messages, WhatsApp has published an &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/security-and-privacy/what-is-traceability-and-why-does-whatsapp-oppose-it"&gt;FAQ on its website&lt;/a&gt;. It argues that this traceability requirement would force it to break the end-to-end encryption for everyone on its service, because there’s no way for it to proactively know what message a government might want to investigate ahead of time. “A government that chooses to mandate traceability is effectively mandating a new form of mass surveillance,” WhatsApp’s FAQ says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCcOeN"&gt;However the Indian government argues the rules are required to track the origins of misinformation. In comments &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/exclusive-whatsapp-sues-india-govt-says-new-media-rules-mean-end-privacy-sources-2021-05-26/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a government official argued that WhatsApp isn’t being asked to break its encryption, just to track where messages originate from. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQ7gj0"&gt;But WhatsApp says tracing messages like this “would be ineffective and highly susceptible to abuse,” and risks punishing people for being the “originator” of content just for re-sharing information they found elsewhere. According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, WhatsApp argues that the new rules fail the tests established by a 2017 Supreme Court ruling. Namely, that privacy must be preserved except when legality, necessity, and proportionality require its infringement. WhatsApp argues that the new law lacks explicit parliamentary backing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3TtrH7"&gt;The lawsuit is the latest heightening of tensions between the Indian government and big tech companies. In recent months officials have ordered social media networks including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/04/27/991343032/indias-government-is-telling-facebook-twitter-to-remove-critical-posts"&gt;Facebook, and Instagram&lt;/a&gt; to remove posts critical of their handling of the pandemic. The &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; notes that social media companies have complied with many of these requests by blocking posts within the country, but keeping them visible elsewhere. While the government argues these posts could incite panic, critics say it’s using the new rules to silence detractors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWzRQV"&gt;In another incident, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451271/police-india-raid-twitter-tweets-government-manipulated-media"&gt;police in India raided Twitter’s offices&lt;/a&gt; over a “manipulated media” label applied to a tweet from a government official.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OMNDa6"&gt;While WhatsApp has been accused of facilitating the spread of misinformation around the world, the problem has been particularly acute in India. Since 2017, the service has been linked to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17595478/whatsapp-message-forwarding-end-violent-lynching-india"&gt;series of lynchings in the country&lt;/a&gt; after users on the service spread misinformation about child abductions. WhatsApp responded by placing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21211371/whatsapp-message-forwarding-limits-misinformation-coronavirus-india"&gt;new limits on message forwarding&lt;/a&gt; in an attempt to stop such accusations from going viral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3yy0EM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8ZV20K"&gt;In 2019, Sony quietly established a subsidiary dedicated to researching &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sony-announces-the-establishment-of-sony-ai-with-the-mission-to-unleash-human-creativity-300961100.html"&gt;artificial intelligence&lt;/a&gt;. What exactly the company plans to do with this tech has always been a bit unclear, but a recent corporate strategy meeting offers a little more information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rj8Odg"&gt;“Sony AI [...] has begun a collaboration with PlayStation that will make game experiences even richer and more enjoyable,” say notes from a recent &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/strategy/pdf/2021/speech_E.pdf"&gt;strategy presentation&lt;/a&gt; given by Sony CEO Kenichiro Yoshida. “By leveraging reinforcement learning, we are developing Game AI Agents that can be a player’s in-game opponent or collaboration partner.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRm3ps"&gt;This is pretty much what you’d expect from a partnership between PlayStation and Sony’s AI team, but it’s still good to have confirmation! Reinforcement learning, which relies on trial and error to teach AI agents how to carry out tasks, has proved to be a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/6/18222203/video-game-ai-future-procedural-generation-deep-learning"&gt;natural fit for video game environments&lt;/a&gt;, where agents can run at high speeds under close observation. It’s been the focus of heavy-hitting research, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/30/20939147/deepmind-google-alphastar-starcraft-2-research-grandmaster-level"&gt;DeepMind’s &lt;em&gt;StarCraft II&lt;/em&gt; AI&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QtLYEq"&gt;Other big tech companies with gaming interests such as Microsoft are also &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fresearch%2Fgroup%2Fdeep-reinforcement-learning%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;exploring this space&lt;/a&gt;. But while Microsoft’s efforts are tilted towards pure research, Sony’s sound like they’re more focused on getting this research out of the lab and into video games, pronto. The end result should be smarter teammates as well as opponents.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Tom Holland will be starring as Nathan Drake in the  upcoming &lt;/em&gt;Uncharted &lt;em&gt;movie adaptation — part of Sony’s ongoing ambitions to expand its franchises into TV and film. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RwolsJ"&gt;This tidbit was just one point in the presentation, though, in which Sony laid out numerous plans for its future growth. Here are some of the other ambitions mentioned: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="wrlx9w"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Expand Sony’s first-party titles and franchises to mobile&lt;/strong&gt;. “PlayStation has a huge catalog of diverse first-party IP that can transition to smartphone gaming and complement our AAA games or live service games,” say the notes. (Though it’s worth noting Sony established a subsidiary &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11296898/sony-forwardworks-playstation-smartphone-games"&gt;dedicated to making smartphone games&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, and it hasn’t had a huge impact yet.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZnLYka"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Make more Sony games into movies and TV shows. &lt;/strong&gt;This will be done through the company’s PlayStation Productions subsidiary. Sony gives the example of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528606/tom-holland-nathan-drake-first-photo-uncharted-movie-sony"&gt;upcoming &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; film&lt;/a&gt;, starring Tom Holland as Nathan Drake.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xHCYMd"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Grow the PlayStation Network, PlayStation Now, and PS Plus networks&lt;/strong&gt;. The company says it currently connects to about 160 million users but would like to grow that number to 1 billion (I mean, sure, who wouldn’t want more customers?). Getting there will mean growing the company’s various online services and subscriptions, including PlayStation Plus, which has seen steady, but not explosive, growth. It’s interesting to compare this to Microsoft’s huge push in subscription gaming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250795/xbox-game-pass-subscribers-growth-microsoft"&gt;through Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A_K2M1NeYb8GZ8kvqzuBz9MNDS8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22540432/Screen_Shot_2021_05_26_at_9.59.48_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s PS Plus network has seen steady but not explosive growth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sN5gPf"&gt;For more details you can check out Sony’s presentation for yourself &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/strategy/pdf/2021/speech_E.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Though, be prepared to wade through some absolutely incredible corporation-speak. We particularly liked the opening declaration that the company has now “implemented structural reform that liberated us from a loss-making paradigm.” In other words: they changed things so that Sony makes money instead of losing it! Got to dress that up somehow, I guess. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US admits Xiaomi isn’t a ‘Communist Chinese military company’ after all</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Xiaomi, Mi" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2Ef0bEBi1uBh_U-Y4tcXATJmIco=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69343640/DSCF5652.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="9m2EFh"&gt;The US has formally removed Xiaomi from its trading blacklist. The US District Court for the District of Columbia issued a final order yesterday that vacated the Department of Defense’s designation of Xiaomi as a “Communist Chinese military company” (CCMC), which would have prohibited Americans from investing in the Chinese consumer tech giant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9M4GMQ"&gt;“The Company is grateful for the trust and support of its global users, partners, employees and shareholders,” a Xiaomi spokesperson says in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The Company reiterates that it is an open, transparent, publicly traded, independently operated and managed corporation. The Company will continue to provide reliable consumer electronics products and services to users, and to relentlessly build amazing products with honest prices to let everyone in the world enjoy a better life through innovative technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IQ7x0i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The blacklisting was described as ‘arbitrary and capricious’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kegxF6"&gt;The US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231786/trump-administration-blacklists-xiaomi-communist-chinese-military-company"&gt;issued&lt;/a&gt; the CCMC designation on January 14th, in the final week of the Trump administration. Xiaomi sued the government the following month, and in March won a preliminary injunction blocking the designation, with a judge describing the blacklisting as “arbitrary and capricious.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22431838/xiaomi-us-blacklist-remove-trump-lawsuit"&gt;Earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; Xiaomi and the DoD announced that they’d come to an agreement to resolve the matter among themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aslnUi"&gt;While Xiaomi has managed to get out of its tangle with the US government, the Biden administration hasn’t given any indication that Trump’s sanctions targeting Huawei will be lifted. Huawei’s consumer division has been crippled by the resulting inability to do business with companies based in the US, but the company also makes network equipment that several politicians have accused of posing a national security threat. This week founder and CEO Ren Zhengfei reportedly sent an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22452580/huawei-software-pivot-us-sanctions-ren-zhengfei"&gt;internal memo&lt;/a&gt; to staff saying that Huawei should pivot to software as a way to get around US sanctions.&lt;/p&gt;
