    <title>Home Depot says its smart home app is for people who find the smart home space ‘intimidating’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kRPZmJjg0EFKjcyaBxLyvEQ-bi4=/0x184:1500x1184/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69817141/HubspaceDeviceScan2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Scan a QR code on a compatible product to add to Home Depot’s Hubspace  | Home Depot&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l3TbkO"&gt;Home Depot has launched a smart home app meant to be an all-in-one for smart appliances and accessories the big box store sells, but it’s debatable why anyone would need it when Google Home and Amazon’s Alexa already exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6dVCq"&gt;Called Hubspace, the free app is available in Android and iOS app stores, and “enables light bulbs, smart plugs and ceiling fans to be controlled from anywhere,” according to a press release from Home Depot.  It’s compatible with Google Home and Amazon Alexa devices, and works with a short list of products that Home Depot sells, from its proprietary brands such as Hampton Bay and EcoSmart. “There’s no need for a hub or extra equipment, and the platform already works with more than 20 products,” the press release explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYOpfs"&gt;OK, so there’s no hub required and you can control third-party devices from one app, which seems like it would add some convenience if you’ve got a ton of mismatched smart home brands in your collection but don’t want to set up a hub. But there are plenty of smart home products that users can control via the product’s own smart home app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvpGuk"&gt;We asked a Home Depot spokesperson why consumers should use this app to control their smart home products instead of Alexa or Google Home to be sure we weren’t missing something. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EryZsN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. Is Hubspace meant to be a competitor to Alexa and Google Home? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1x7d5L"&gt;A. Hubspace was designed to be a simple, reliable, and responsible way to bring products from The Home Depot’s proprietary brands such as Hampton Bay, EcoSmart, and other product lines into Smart Home. Hubspace-connected products provide customers with a high-quality user experience to control products in the Hubspace app, once products are connected to the Hubspace platform it offers the ability to seamlessly integrate their products with third-party platforms in the fastest easiest way possible&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVGY4K"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. Because it appears all of the items on the list of compatible products are already compatible with Alexa or Google Home – why would someone need this third option? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrnXVD"&gt;A. At The Home Depot, we know our DIYers look for easy-to-install and convenient solutions. Hubspace was created to make the convenience and sustainability benefits of Smart Home products available to anyone with a smart device and an internet connection – with no hub necessary and at an affordable price. Smart Home can be an intimidating space for some customers, Hubspace was designed to simplify the experience and to allow all customers the [sic] enjoy the benefits of Smart Home products.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYx93K"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q. And is it limited to that list of products only?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Smmbzq"&gt;A. The Hubspace app was designed with the ability to support products from all the aisles of The Home Depot. We have started with products from within our lighting and electrical areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDCf9a"&gt;So there you have it. If you’re intimidated by smart home products, really don’t want to install a hub, and have these products that are sold at Home Depot, maybe you want this app. Each product can be added to Hubspace by scanning the QR code on the product’s packaging, and then connected to whatever voice assistant you prefer. Connecting the Hubspace account to a voice assistant (like Alexa) enables the voice commands. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says its AI mislabeling a video of Black men as “primates” was “unacceptable”</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z7ENFYChhVDAJQnEsOtXeh--aNA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69816953/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook is apologizing for applying a “primates” label to a video of Black men | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g8hY9u"&gt;Facebook is apologizing for an incident where its AI mislabeled a video of Black men with a “primates” label, calling it an “unacceptable error” that it was examining to prevent it from happening again. As reported by the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/03/technology/facebook-ai-race-primates.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, users who watched a June 27th video posted by the UK tabloid &lt;em&gt;Daily Mail&lt;/em&gt; received an auto-prompt asking whether they wanted to “keep seeing videos about Primates.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFrJBN"&gt;Facebook disabled the entire topic recommendation feature as soon as it realized what was happening, a spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bE7LNa"&gt;“This was clearly an unacceptable error,” the spokesperson said. The company is investigating the cause to prevent the behavior from happening again, the spokesperson added. “As we have said, while we have made improvements to our AI we know it’s not perfect and we have more progress to make. We apologize to anyone who may have seen these offensive recommendations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCOfnk"&gt;The incident is just the latest example of artificial intelligence tools showing gender or racial bias, with facial recognition tools shown to have a particular problem of misidentifying people of color. In 2015, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/1/8880363/google-apologizes-photos-app-tags-two-black-people-gorillas"&gt;Google apologized&lt;/a&gt; after its Photos app tagged photos of Black people as “gorillas.” Last year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21333405/facebook-instagram-racial-bias-equity-team-formed-ai-algorithms"&gt;Facebook said it was studying&lt;/a&gt; whether its algorithms trained using AI—including those of Instagram, which Facebook owns— were racially biased. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSxOzG"&gt;In April, the US &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2021/04/aiming-truth-fairness-equity-your-companys-use-ai"&gt;Federal Trade Commission warned&lt;/a&gt; that AI tools that have demonstrated “troubling” racial and gender biases may be in violation of consumer protection laws if they’re used decision-making for credit, housing or employment. “Hold yourself accountable— or be ready for the FTC to do it for you,” FTC privacy attorney Elisa Jillson wrote in a post on the agency’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aEQHGb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PC7GJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GoDaddy cut off Texas Right to Life’s abortion ‘whistleblowing’ website, but it’s staying online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-MEXICO-BORDER" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mzsrsS8Dh7ma-8JqW0CDO3pJ3xQ=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69814931/1233640838.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PUy8f0"&gt;In case you haven’t heard, Texas now has a law that makes it illegal for anyone to help women get an abortion after six weeks of pregnancy — and to take advantage of that, the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life is encouraging citizens to report those people at a dedicated “whistleblower” website, promising to “ensure that these lawbreakers are held accountable for their actions.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLQOwQ"&gt;On Friday, Texas Right to Life had to find a new home on the web, because hosting provider GoDaddy gave the group 24 hours to find a different place to park its website. “We have informed prolifewhistleblower.com they have 24 hours to move to another provider for violating our terms of service,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/03/technology/texas-abortion-law-website-tiktok.html"&gt;a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3VEtx"&gt;By late Friday, it appears it found that home: Epik, the provider that also helped save &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/5/18049132/gab-social-network-online-synagogue-shooting-deplatforming-return-godaddy-paypal-stripe-ban"&gt;controversial sites Gab&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22236178/parler-resurfaces-sunday-app-banned"&gt;social media platform Parler&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/5/20754943/8chan-epik-offline-voxility-service-cutoff-hate-speech-ban"&gt;internet hate forum 8chan&lt;/a&gt; when other web service providers wouldn’t take them, is now listed as the registrar for prolifewhistleblower.com as well. The site is still having some trouble staying online though: as of 4AM ET Saturday, we saw HTTP 503 error codes when trying to access it. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/09/texas-abortion-snitch-website-kicked-off-godaddy-for-invading-peoples-privacy/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, it tried to use Digital Ocean as a hosting provider first, but may have fallen afoul of that provider’s rules as well and is not hosted there anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ssajkq"&gt;GoDaddy originally &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the whistleblower site violated “multiple provisions” of its &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.godaddy.com%2Flegal%2Fagreements%2Funiversal-terms-of-service-agreement&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F3%2F22656196%2Fgodaddy-texas-right-for-life-abortion-whistleblowing-site" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Terms of Service&lt;/a&gt; including Section 5.2, which reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="uQcvnG"&gt;You will not collect or harvest (or permit anyone else to collect or harvest) any User Content (as defined below) or any non-public or personally identifiable information about another User or any other person or entity without their express prior written consent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5zw3kD"&gt;The anti-abortion group’s website has been under siege for days now, with angry protesters flooding it with fake tips — including at least one fake claim that Texas governor Greg Abbott himself had violated the law, according to the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;. One activist on TikTok even created a script that can automatically feed fake reports into the website’s tipbox, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3x9ba/tiktok-texas-abortion-law-bot-site-ios-shortcut"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Motherboard &lt;/em&gt;reported yesterday&lt;/a&gt;. He told&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; that the automated tools he’d created had received over 15,000 clicks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Qc5bIa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@black_madness21/video/7000057713975725318" data-video-id="7000057713975725318" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@black_madness21" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@black_madness21"&gt;@black_madness21&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reply to @black_madness21 &lt;a title="texas" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/texas"&gt;#texas&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="abortion" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/abortion"&gt;#abortion&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="gregabbott" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/gregabbott"&gt;#gregabbott&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Sean Black" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7000057554395007750"&gt;♬ original sound - Sean Black&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zQ1vqM"&gt;But on Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/here-s-how-you-can-help-shut-down-the-vile-website-for-1847557293"&gt;Gizmodo’s Shoshana Wodinsky suggested another way for activists to protest&lt;/a&gt;: blowing the whistle on Texas Right to Life itself, by complaining to GoDaddy about what it was doing. That’s what appears to have happened. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bxPLM"&gt;It’s not the first time web hosting providers or even GoDaddy specifically have played this role: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/28/18036520/gab-down-godaddy-domain-blocked"&gt;Gab.com had to find a new home in October 2018&lt;/a&gt;, and GoDaddy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/4/17320086/godaddy-domain-registrar-richard-spencer-altright-com-offline"&gt;took down white nationalist Richard Spencer’s Altright.com&lt;/a&gt; that May. Neo-nazi news site the Daily Stormer was similarly given 24 hours by GoDaddy to find a new home &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/14/16142384/daily-stormer-site-go-daddy-hosting-providers-hackers-anonymous"&gt;in August 2017&lt;/a&gt;, and wound up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16150668/daily-stormer-alt-right-dark-web-site-godaddy-google-ban"&gt;moving to the dark web&lt;/a&gt; instead. Gab was able to return, though, and apparently Texas Right to Life has avoided being removed at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="oFf3gR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, September 4th at 4AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that Epik appears to be Texas Right to Life’s new home for its site.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch PlayerUnknown describe Prologue, a post-PUBG project all his own</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AfE7fyrU1sgvG9stKKWuJ77-z2o=/428x0:3668x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69815725/game_image.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0RcAx5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt;, more commonly known as &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;Game for Peace&lt;/em&gt; in China) is already one of the most successful and influential games ever made just four years after release. Its director Brendan Greene, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/pubg-playerunknown-brendan-greene-interview-july-2017/"&gt;a former DJ and web designer from Ireland&lt;/a&gt;, is credited with launching the entire battle royale genre, directly inspiring what you now know as &lt;em&gt;Fortnite,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;CoD: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends &lt;/em&gt;and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ofvpo"&gt;But this past week, he announced that he’d left the Korean company whose work on his battle royale vision propelled him to fame to build a studio all his own — and late Thursday, he revealed what to expect from his next project.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R0C38g"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/dipZpUSeNY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/dipZpUSeNY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PLAYERUNKNOWN (@PLAYERUNKNOWN) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PLAYERUNKNOWN/status/1433682802931904518?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NuTOjp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://playprologue.com/"&gt;It’s called Prologue&lt;/a&gt;, and it will be a pay-what-you-want tech demo designed to illustrate the kinds of games that Greene wants to build next: “We want to create realistic sandbox worlds on a scale that’s seldom attempted, worlds hundreds of kilometers across with thousands of players interacting, exploring and creating,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cFb3Dh"&gt;Greene says his new team has built a neural network that can generate “massive realistic open worlds at runtime — each and every time you press play,” calling it a “breakthrough,” and that Prologue will be “a simple introduction to an early iteration of our technology.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iiU74w"&gt;Here’s his full description of Prologue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Pwg4Rp"&gt;You’ll need to find your way across a runtime generated wilderness and use found tools and gathered resources to survive on a journey where harsh weather is your constant foe. There will be no guidance, no path for you to follow, just a world, a spot on the map to reach, and the tools you need to get there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="84JbQH"&gt;There’s no word on when we should expect Prologue yet, but Greene gave an exclusive interview to &lt;em&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/em&gt;’s Dean Takahashi. It should go live at 8:45AM on Saturday, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/09/03/brendan-playerunknown-greene-reveals-an-ambitious-new-game-world-dubbed-prologue/"&gt;according to the publication.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2GGc2"&gt;The company that Greene left has a stake in his new company too, &lt;em&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/em&gt; reports. Krafton (formerly known as PUBG Corp, and before that Bluehole Studio) is also working on its next game, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22639319/krafton-pubg-project-windless-fantasy-franchise"&gt;a fantasy epic currently known as “Project Windless”&lt;/a&gt; that’s based on Korean folklore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eO6xpJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hQDYzm"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lyft and Uber to cover legal fees of drivers sued under Texas anti-abortion law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SXVByRiencZslrKanPVzOKge_hQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69815468/akrales_181010_3013_0065.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UU76Ay"&gt;Lyft and Uber are committing to pay legal fees for any driver on their respective platforms who get sued under Texas’ controversial anti-abortion law.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Of0sDi"&gt;The new law, which was signed this week by Texas governor Greg Abbott, bans abortions of fetuses after six weeks (which is before many women even know they are pregnant) and offers no exceptions for rape or incest. The law also empowers private citizens across the country to sue anyone for “aiding and abetting” abortions past the six-week mark, including clinics, anyone who pays for the abortion, or even people who drive someone to the procedure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="S26NVA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the law allows people to sue those “aiding and abetting” abortions past six weeks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MPzQts"&gt;“This is an attack on women’s access to healthcare and on their right to choose,” Lyft co-founder and CEO Logan Green tweeted Friday afternoon. Green said Lyft is creating a “driver legal defense fund” to cover 100 percent of legal fees if drivers on its platform get sued under the new law. He said Lyft is also donating $1 million to Planned Parenthood to “ensure that transportation is never a barrier to healthcare access.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UXgI9B"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Right on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/logangreen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@logangreen&lt;/a&gt; - drivers shouldn’t be put at risk for getting people where they want to go.  Team &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Uber?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Uber&lt;/a&gt; is in too and will cover legal fees in the same way. Thanks for the push. &lt;a href="https://t.co/85LhOUctSc"&gt;https://t.co/85LhOUctSc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— dara khosrowshahi (@dkhos) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dkhos/status/1433894081487273987?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wdaEiI"&gt;Shortly after, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi announced in a tweet that his company would follow suit. “[D]rivers shouldn’t be put at risk for getting people to where they want to go,” he wrote. Uber “will cover legal fees in the same way,” he said, quoting Green’s tweet. “Thanks for the push.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yjdKlO"&gt;The announcements from Uber and Lyft came after Bumble and Match Group (which owns Tinder) announced the creation of &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/bumble-and-match-have-created-a-relief-fund-to-help-cov-1847613072"&gt;a relief fund for women seeking abortions&lt;/a&gt;. Match Group CEO Shar Dubey said in an internal memo obtained by &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/transactional/match-ceo-bumble-create-funds-texas-staff-after-strict-abortion-law-2021-09-02/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the company “generally does not take political stands unless it is relevant to our business. But in this instance, I personally, as a woman in Texas, could not keep silent.” Both companies are headquartered in Texas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H22pfp"&gt;Pressure &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/corporate-americas-response-to-texas-abortion-law-silence"&gt;ramped up on companies that do business in Texas&lt;/a&gt; to act late this week after the Supreme Court’s conservative majority (minus Chief Justice John Roberts) &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/02/us/supreme-court-texas-abortion-law.html"&gt;declined to step in and halt the restrictive law&lt;/a&gt;. But so far corporations have only announced reactive measures like defense funds, despite calls to move their business elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8dkxG"&gt;It’s also possible that the law could &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/policy/the-texas-abortion-ban-could-force-tech-to-snitch-on-users"&gt;spur an explosion of requests&lt;/a&gt; to tech companies for information on users who may have helped someone get an abortion, Evan Greer, director of the digital rights group Fight for the Future, told &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; this week. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo is reportedly set to bring Game Boy and Game Boy Color games to Switch Online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Game Boy" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/flaMilZMle2H2DgKDC849kX3e5g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69815271/vpavic_190327_3333_0023.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6zVUOe"&gt;Nintendo may be finally ready to bring its storied handheld gaming library to the Nintendo Switch — Game Boy and Game Boy Color titles will soon join &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443321/nintendo-switch-online-may-2021-retro-games-total-library"&gt;the 100-plus NES and SNES games&lt;/a&gt; that it offers via its Switch Online subscription service, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/yFRi2jd0xMg"&gt;according to rumors&lt;/a&gt; from the “Nate the Hate” podcast, corroborated &lt;a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/09/rumour_nintendo_will_expand_its_switch_online_service_with_game_boy_and_game_boy_color_titles"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Nintendo Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Tuesday and now again on Friday &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-09-03-game-boy-and-game-boy-color-titles-headed-to-nintendo-switch-online"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not every day we see a Nintendo rumor that strong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxxxZr"&gt;There’s no word on which titles might arrive, and I wouldn’t necessarily expect your favorites to be among them, particularly to start. Nintendo has curated its NES and SNES libraries for Switch very slowly, some of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275714/nintendo-switch-online-games-february-2021"&gt;are pretty deep cuts&lt;/a&gt;, and many titles like &lt;em&gt;Earthbound&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Chrono Trigger&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Super Mario RPG&lt;/em&gt; are still MIA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20848125/super-nintendo-games-snes-switch-online-service-mario-zelda-tomorrow"&gt;two years later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUoulh"&gt;But it makes a lot of sense that Nintendo would ramp up more classic content, particularly now that the Switch is well into its life and Nintendo is watching its competitors capitalize on remakes, remasters and next-gen patches that make older games look better and give their new consoles some extra life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CSA4mj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Does this mean a Game Boy Classic Edition isn’t happening?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nvj6bl"&gt;For a while, we were wondering if Nintendo would continue going down the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/3/13507516/nintendo-nes-classic-edition-hands-on-first-impression-how-to"&gt;NES Classic&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/27/16363696/super-nintendo-snes-classic-edition-review"&gt;SNES Classic&lt;/a&gt; route, releasing cute limited-edition miniature USB versions of its Game Boy or Nintendo 64 with preloaded games on board, too. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18311479/nintendo-game-boy-30th-anniversary-switch-gaming"&gt;the Game Boy’s 30th anniversary&lt;/a&gt; came and went without a miniature Game Boy, and now we’re in the midst of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;a global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt;. I’d love to see more opportunities to let new gamers in on old classics, and not just in terms of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20871958/legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review-nintendo-switch-updates-graphics"&gt;remakes like &lt;em&gt;Link’s Awakening&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;(originally on Game Boy, Game Boy Color). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdkJRo"&gt;Here’s hoping for Game Boy Advance, too, because folks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22466240/nintendo-metroid-dread-side-scroller-e3-2021-switch"&gt;playing the new &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; deserve to play its amazing prequel &lt;em&gt;Metroid Fusion&lt;/em&gt;, and some of the best &lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem&lt;/em&gt; games ever made came out there. Oh, and &lt;em&gt;Golden Sun&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt; does say other consoles  beyond Game Boy and Game Boy Color may be “on the cards.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjoss8"&gt;Amusingly, Nintendo offered this official statement: “We have nothing to announce on this topic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ze9Tq"&gt;Which Game Boy and Game Boy Color games are on your shortlist? I’m going with &lt;em&gt;Wario Land&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Pokemon Pinball.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DfZ77e"&gt;Switch Online costs $4 a month, $20 a year, or $35 a year for a family membership.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AI computers can’t patent their own inventions — yet — a US judge rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xoNtwwJIp7t8hXD3pG0gLq2x8sM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69814568/jbareham_170215_1460_0001_v2_5_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CeKVWH"&gt;Should an artificially intelligent machine be able to patent its own inventions? For a US federal judge, the larger implications of that question were irrelevant. In April 2020, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241251/artificial-intelligence-inventor-united-states-patent-trademark-office-intellectual-property"&gt;ruled that only “natural persons” could be credited as the inventor of a patent&lt;/a&gt;, and a US court decided Thursday that yes, that’s what the law technically says (via &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-03/only-humans-not-ai-machines-can-get-a-u-s-patent-judge-rules?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0vKG9L"&gt;Not every country agrees with that direction. &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-08-01/historic-decision-allows-ai-to-be-recognised-as-an-inventor/100339264"&gt;South Africa and Australia decided to go the other direction&lt;/a&gt;, granting one patent and reinstating a second patent application filed by AI researcher Steven Thaler, whose AI system DABUS reportedly came up with a flashing light and a new type of food container. Thaler is the one who sued the US in this case as well — he’s part of a group called &lt;a href="https://artificialinventor.com/"&gt;The Artificial Inventor Project&lt;/a&gt; that’s lobbying for AI recognition around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DS52N"&gt;You can read the US’s whole decision against Thaler for yourself at the bottom of this post, but it’s pretty simple when you boil it down:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="anH6Tz"&gt;The US Patent Act says inventors an inventor must be an “individual” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2puwAz"&gt;Previous legal decisions have clarified that “individuals” have to be people (not, say, companies)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IP55o0"&gt;It’s also pretty clear from context that the Patent Act was referring to people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1wBUNo"&gt;AI systems are not people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="IxEMyP"&gt;Oh, and the court says it can only overrule a US agency’s decision if it’s arbitrary, capricious, or obviously illegal — but in this case, the USPTO already laid out its entire reasoning why it plans to stick to the status quo last April. It also asked for public comment in 2019, before it made its ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KUW9H5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The USPTO wants to know if artificial intelligence can own the content it creates","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20961788/us-government-ai-copyright-patent-trademark-office-notice-artificial-intelligence"},{"title":"We’ve been warned about AI and music for over 50 years, but no one’s prepared","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18299563/ai-algorithm-music-law-copyright-human"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QVnR3i"&gt;As to the bigger question, US District Judge Leonie Brinkema had this to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WA4qst"&gt;“[T]here may come a time when artificial intelligence reaches a level of sophistication such that it might satisfy accepted meanings of inventorship. But that time has not yet arrived, and, if it does, it will be up to Congress to decide how, if at all, it wants to expand the scope of patent law.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New study will show misinformation on Facebook gets way more engagement than news</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y8CUZT2nMOceo5lEkm6Wg98zug8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69814562/jbareham_180405_1777_facebook_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hNgJ4N"&gt;A new peer-reviewed study from researchers at New York University and the Université Grenoble Alpes in France will show that misinformation got six times as much engagement on Facebook as real news, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/09/03/facebook-misinformation-nyu-study/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ngaUW"&gt;The study looked at posts from the Facebook pages of more than 2,500 news publishers between August 2020 and January 2021. Researchers found that the pages that post more misinformation regularly got more likes, shares, and comments. This increased engagement was seen across the political spectrum, but the study found that “publishers on the right have a much higher propensity to share misleading information than publishers in other political categories,” according to &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0baJBv"&gt;The researchers will share the study as part of the 2021 Internet Measurement Conference in November. But it could be released prior to that, researcher Laura Edelson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bEK1qx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook maintains that only looking at engagement doesn’t tell the whole story&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iS21ga"&gt;A Facebook spokesperson pointed out to the &lt;em&gt;Post&lt;/em&gt; that the study only looks at engagement, and not “reach” — which is the term the company uses to describe how many people see a piece of content on Facebook, regardless of whether they interact with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gKYvI"&gt;Facebook does not make reach data available to researchers, though. Instead, they and others who want to understand and quantify the social media platform’s misinformation problem — including these researchers — have often turned to a tool called CrowdTangle, which is owned by Facebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u9uaK2"&gt;But in August, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609020/facebook-bans-academic-researchers-ad-transparency-misinformation-nyu-ad-observatory-plug-in"&gt;cut off this group of researchers’ access to this data&lt;/a&gt; (as well as to the library of political ads on the platform). Facebook said that continuing to give third-party researchers access to the data could violate a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission that it entered into following the Cambridge Analytica scandal — a claim &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612545/facebook-banned-third-party-researchers-inaccurate-says-ftc"&gt;the FTC said was “inaccurate.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrpdiQ"&gt;CrowdTangle is the tool that &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;tech columnist Kevin Roose used to make regular lists of posts that got the most engagement on Facebook — a practice that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/22/21332774/facebook-crowdtangle-kevin-roose-nyt-tweets-interactions-reach-engagement"&gt;reportedly riled up top employees inside the company&lt;/a&gt;, because the lists were regularly dominated by right-wing pages that post a lot of misinformation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPDC6U"&gt;In an effort to bat down claims that misinformation is a problem on Facebook, the company released a “transparency report” in August that laid out the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22630813/facebook-report-most-viewed-content-links-news-feed-transparancy"&gt;most-viewed posts on the platform during the second quarter of the year&lt;/a&gt;, from April to June. Just days later, though, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; revealed that Facebook had first scrapped plans to release a report about the first quarter because the most-viewed post between January and March was an article that wrongly linked the coronavirus vaccine to a Florida doctor’s death — a post that was used by many right-wing pages to sow doubt about the efficacy of the vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BMW’s new CE 02 mini-bike concept is electric</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T6iUDTLMhoEyeD5hBfZw6OOT6vs=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69814322/P90434022_highRes_bmw_motorrad_concept.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: BMW Motorrad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nuveHZ"&gt;BMW’s Motorrad division has been pumping out some &lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0320189EN/bmw-motorrad-definition-ce-04-the-new-style-of-urban-two-wheel-mobility"&gt;wild&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18759611/bmw-electric-motorcycle-concept-motorrad-vision-roadster"&gt;concepts&lt;/a&gt; over the last few years as the larger company turns its attention towards electric vehicles. It’s latest is also the to date, but still looks extremely cool: the &lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0341092EN/bmw-motorrad-concept-ce-02"&gt;CE 02 mini-bike&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3yQFG4"&gt;Debuted this week ahead of the IAA Mobility conference in Germany, the CE 02 is a tiny two-wheeler that borrows some of the futuristic vibes BMW has been honing for its larger concept bikes — including the CE 04, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22566683/bmw-ce-04-electric-city-scooter-futuristic-design-motorrad"&gt;which is actually going into production&lt;/a&gt;. Clad in silver and black and “technoid typography,” the minimalist design looks like it came right off the set of a sci-fi movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aE2QhO"&gt;The CE 02 has an 11kW belt-drive motor, which can help the bike reach a top speed of around 90 kilometers per hour (about 56 miles per hour). BMW isn’t sharing the battery capacity, but claims the CE 02 can go about 90 kilometers on a full charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="svsquo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10733772"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0h5okZ"&gt;There are no pedals, but BMW says there will be footrests — though in the photos, the only footrest that anyone is using is a skateboard clipped to the underside of the bike. (Hey, it’s a concept!) A circular LED headlight lights the way, while a small display between the handlebars serves up the basic information like speed and battery status. “Otherwise, the technology is deliberately restrained,” BMW says. The whole package weighs 120 kilograms (about 265 pounds). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MghXlU"&gt;There’s no shortage of slick-looking electric mopeds and mini-bikes these days — Super73 has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22278760/super73-ebike-moped-minibike-investment-amount"&gt;raised millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt; on the idea alone — but BMW’s CE 02 could probably find some success if the company decides to make it. It’s got the looks, and it sounds plenty capable enough for cruising through a city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BbBA1I"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Some standout options for multiple budgets&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Y2YM1c"&gt;If you don’t already have a laptop with a built-in webcam — or the one on your laptop isn’t very good — you might need a standalone webcam. Maybe it’s to be able to show your face during work or school. Maybe it’s for chatting with friends, or for side projects, like live streaming or recording yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrBM2l"&gt;If you don’t want to actually purchase a webcam, there are several routes to take. You can get crafty with your phone (and spend hardly anything or nothing at all) by using &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281765/webcam-phone-tablet-android-ios-pc-mac-how-to"&gt;an app that’ll fool your computer into thinking it’s a webcam&lt;/a&gt;. Or you can go in the total opposite direction and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21523161/phone-camera-webcam-how-to-iphone-android-dslr"&gt;connect a pricey DSLR or mirrorless camera to your computer&lt;/a&gt; to use as a webcam — a very good one, at that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="599LPF"&gt;But assuming you simply want to purchase a webcam, our goal is to make it easier for you to find the one that matches your needs and your budget. Here, I aim to decipher which USB webcams are worth your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBTZqs"&gt;We tested popular models from brands like Logitech, Microsoft, Dell, Razer, Elgato, and more. Once the dust settled, we landed on a semi-affordable webcam that we think is the best option for most people. That’s the Logitech C920S Pro HD, which usually costs about $60. It supports 1080p resolution capture at 30 frames per second, and the visual quality is satisfactory in most lighting conditions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UX8PIq"&gt;If you have some extra cash along with a desire for better video quality and more features, check out Logitech’s StreamCam. It also supports 1080p resolution, but with a faster 60 frames per second capture. This model is loaded with clever features, like an optional mode that can automatically follow your face around the frame. It also ships with versatile mounts, one for your monitor, and another for a tripod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KjCOUJ"&gt;Each camera’s video quality was judged by using it with Zoom (where footage is prone to compression, as it is with other web-based video calling apps), as well as with OBS Studio or VLC to see how it compares with a locally-stored recording. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech C920S Pro HD" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oq6w_fn8r2h5nt8UsnLMp8XGhe0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22820369/akrales_210831_4734_0071.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0UZo0O"&gt;Logitech C920S Pro HD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="HMMN3w"&gt;The best webcam for most people &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Ta46G2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Works with: Windows, Mac, Linux, Chromebook&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EamdYO"&gt;Usually priced around $60, Logitech’s C920S Pro HD provides better video and mic quality than others that I tested in this price range. This model can record in 1080p resolution at up to 30 frames per second, and while you won’t have an issue finding other similarly-priced webcams with those specs, the C920S Pro’s out-of-box color balance, exposure, and relatively fast auto-focus made it stand out from others I tested.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06NWy7"&gt;The picture quality has sufficient detail, and even in my relatively dark apartment, the C920S Pro had no trouble making my facial features look sharp. But it wasn’t a flawless presentation overall, as is to be expected for the price. In less-than-ideal lighting scenarios, the C920S Pro made my skin look over-saturated, with red spots where the webcam couldn’t compensate for the lack of lighting. Though in a work or play environment flush with natural light, this was noticeably less of an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQpq4s"&gt;Picture quality aside, the C920S Pro has several welcome features, like a generous 78-degree field of view, status lights that activate when the webcam is being used by an application, and an included privacy shutter that can give you assurance that you’re not broadcasting unless you want to be. Some other nice features at this price include its strong articulating stand, which can sit atop your monitor or just as easily screw into a tripod. It’s just a great value for the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ai4Ksm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730538"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="M8JI8o"&gt;Other webcam options you might like for under $100&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Microsoft Modern Webcam" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vbDixIE4MNptXeWGqq88TlPL1zs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22820368/akrales_210831_4734_0069.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1XjelV"&gt;Microsoft Modern Webcam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1XE3Yk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Works with: Windows 10, and in a more limited fashion, macOS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdNNIx"&gt;Like the Logitech C920S Pro, the Modern Webcam promises 1080p resolution recording at up to 30 frames per second. Compared directly to the Logitech, Microsoft’s webcam didn’t produce as sharp of an image. It was, however, able to produce a more true-to-life look for my lighting scenario thanks to its HDR setting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xajEUQ"&gt;HDR has some benefits, but it might also come with a few cons depending on your lighting. While the Modern Webcam did an admirable job of taming the pretty intense backlight that I have behind me during the day, it didn’t seem to have many tricks to make me look my best in other ways (at least without tweaking the picture with the Microsoft Accessory Center app). Through the lens of the Modern Webcam, I looked like I work in a dimly-lit basement apartment — which I do, but I’d rather not be reminded of that fact. As with the C920S Pro, this should be less of a problem for people who have no shortage of natural light in their room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="owpuJl"&gt;I appreciate that the Modern Webcam’s stand lets you hang it over a monitor, or screw it into a tripod. And it gets bonus points for having a physical privacy slider. This webcam also has a built-in microphone, but it strangely isn’t enabled by default. If you’re using Windows 10, you’ll need to download and enable that setting within the aforementioned Accessory Center app. If you’re using a macOS computer, well, you’re stuck with a webcam that lacks a microphone. Considering that this webcam costs $69.99, I think you’re better off with Logitech’s C920S Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PJKItV"&gt;
&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730545"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech C270 HD" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w-y1NE1SxqTFm7HCPEo8x-3mj1E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22820367/akrales_210831_4734_0062.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="h6Ocsh"&gt;Logitech C270 HD&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="a0ZCZM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Works with: Windows 10, macOS, Android, Chrome OS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nsz1XC"&gt;If you’re really in a pinch, and your main requirements in a webcam are simply that it’s reliable, very affordable, and it has a microphone, you might want to check out the Logitech C270 HD. It’s by no means a stunner when it comes to video quality — it’s only capable of 720p resolution at 30 frames per second — so you’ll get a fairly fuzzy image no matter what your lighting situation is. You’ll get the best picture if you have it connected in a well-lit environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLaENJ"&gt;The C270 HD’s bulkier design will likely overlap your monitor’s screen, unlike the options above. It’s a minor consolation that its monitor mount doubles as a stand of sorts, so it can hold itself up on your desk or a table. Being an affordable webcam doesn’t mandate that it shouldn’t have good design, though, so hopefully Logitech improves this aspect in particular for the next iteration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="piS4zR"&gt;This isn’t the most glowing recommendation, but I understand that spending more isn’t something that some people may want to do. Most people should spend $60 on our top pick, but if you just want something that gets the job done without making a large investment, the C270 HD will do just that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tJMDzD"&gt;
&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730561"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech StreamCam" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nh1GFyxuwOqYABKQWVCaktQzGYQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22820366/akrales_210831_4734_0060.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9eDY3g"&gt;Logitech Streamcam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fmc0AB"&gt;The best webcam for people who need better picture quality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BffJel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Works with: Windows 10 and macOS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpcJPD"&gt;If you’re comfortable spending somewhere in the $150-$200 price range, your webcam selection will open up to devices that have sharper picture quality and other features that may make them worth the extra cost. Logitech’s Streamcam isn’t the newest webcam to be released, but it stands out as being a great value overall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yEyIJ0"&gt;For one, it’s compact, and its picture fidelity can reach 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second. To my eyes, the Streamcam had only slightly improved clarity, exposure, and color reproduction over the cheaper C920S Pro mentioned above. But it easily takes the win with its much more fluid capture at 60fps. The Streamcam also has a built-in dual omnidirectional mic and a fast auto-focus feature. For people who’d rather have a fixed focus webcam that isn’t constantly searching for objects in motion, Logitech’s Capture software lets you switch off the auto-focus, in addition to several other picture-tweaking settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8I6mT"&gt;These are all great to have (and what you should expect in a $100+ webcam), but it’s the extra features that put this one at the top. The Streamcam can record in landscape or portrait mode, which may save you a step when you edit clips that are made for mobile viewing. It includes two stands, one that can mount it to a tripod and another, more flexible one that rests on your monitor. The latter stand supports a generous amount of vertical tilt, as well as panning from left to right. Lastly, the Capture software allows you to activate an AI feature that can follow your face as it moves within the frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djm8fC"&gt;If you have an older laptop, one aspect of the Streamcam that might cause trouble is that it plugs in via USB-C. So, if your computer doesn’t have a USB-C port, you’ll need to purchase a USB-C to USB-A adapter. Also, there are other higher-end webcams that offer wider fields of view than the Streamcam’s 78 degrees, so you may want to look elsewhere if you want to capture an image that encompasses more of your room or desk setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MrH5U6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730585"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NlGSTH"&gt;Other options you might like in the $100-$200 range&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Elgato Facecam" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n-DPVsE7UXl4CXq1faIpRT8hGmA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22820364/akrales_210831_4734_0054.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5BtEmd"&gt;Elgato Facecam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gC1SzH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Works with: Windows 10 and macOS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MYdPD"&gt;The Streamcam is a tough webcam to beat, yet Elgato’s Facecam comes close. It has a great balance of performance and features — offering slightly better-looking video quality than Logitech’s webcam — but its lack of a microphone combined with its higher, $199 price tag makes it tough to recommend to most people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYt6rS"&gt;The Facecam has similar specs to the Streamcam. It can record at 1080p with up to 60 frames per second, and you can customize how you look in its companion software. After some tweaking to the many settings in Elgato’s Camera Hub app, I preferred how the Facecam made me look with my lighting setup (though its default settings out of the box weren’t great).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXdHAX"&gt;There are a few problems, though, minor as they might seem to some people. As I’ve already mentioned, the Facecam costs a little more, and for the price, its lack of a microphone surprised me, even if it may not be an issue for people who already use a standalone mic or a headset. And the Facecam’s boxy design won’t exactly blend in with every setup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CtsdR"&gt;Despite its flaws, there is a lot to like here. The Facecam supports an 82-degree field of view that’s a little wider than the Streamcam’s, and the fixed focus means that the lens won’t be constantly going in and out of focus as you move around. The Facecam also produces footage that looks noticeably less grainy than any other webcam that I tested for this guide. Some other things I like about this model are that it includes a privacy cap and the webcam itself has a tripod thread on its bottom, so you can easily mount it to a tripod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WX61Qw"&gt;Whether you’re willing to forgive the Facecam for its lack of a mic, or if it wasn’t a problem for you in the first place, I’d still recommend waiting until this one drops a bit in price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QkCwjk"&gt;
&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730597"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dell UltraSharp webcam" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ETDO0EbRLO_teCpl8gQY18XtOd4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22820363/akrales_210831_4734_0051.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Op5sXu"&gt;Dell UltraSharp webcam&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Pkwn4q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Works with: Windows 10 and macOS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMV9Vn"&gt;Dell’s new, cylindrical-shaped Ultrasharp webcam is another option with no microphone and a high price. But judging on looks alone, Dell’s seems worth the $199. The Ultrasharp is well-constructed, and includes two stands (one monitor mount, one tripod mount) that can magnetically snap into its bottom, making the setup very simple. It also ships with a privacy cap that snaps on magnetically. It looks and feels like a $200 webcam should.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSMXeW"&gt;Surprisingly, though, the Ultrasharp presented the worst out-of-the-box performance of the webcams that I tried. Making adjustments using the Dell Peripheral companion app definitely helped to bring the quality more into the territory that I expected, considering the high price. This model is capable of 4K resolution capture at up to 30 frames per second, and if you want more frames per second, it gives you the option to bump it down to 1080p resolution to get 60 frames per second. Despite having similar specs to some of the devices above, the Ultrasharp yields footage that’s a little blurry and grainy, and bumping down the resolution to 1080p didn’t seem to yield the advertised 60fps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5cRiPg"&gt;That said, it does have some features that you may be seeking out. Like the Streamcam, there’s an AI-driven feature that can keep you in the frame as you move around. It also supports Windows Hello facial recognition for logging into your machine securely. If you want a wide field of view, the Ultrasharp supports up to 90 degrees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpzTA0"&gt;All in all, while the Ultrasharp might appeal to people who want a fancy-looking webcam with some interesting features, unfortunately, the overall performance doesn’t match the fit and finish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="84Foww"&gt;
&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10730615"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Kiyo Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gsa07uaWlsBlRq4jP_gypkLSwMk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22319958/cfaulkner_210219_4432_0001.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="b84tbO"&gt;Razer Kiyo Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hAbxOa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Works with: Windows 10&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wRVqwt"&gt;The differentiating feature of the lens-shaped $199 Kiyo Pro, compared to other higher-end webcams, is its super-wide 103-degree field of view. It allows you to see more of your work or play space, as well as more of you. It can also be set to 80 degrees or 90 degrees, if you want to tweak the look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ur5tIT"&gt;Otherwise, its specs will look familiar if you’ve made it this far down the guide. It supports 1080p capture at 60 frames per second, and there’s an HDR mode that knocks the framerate down to 30fps in exchange for a more balanced-looking image. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295235/razer-kiyo-pro-webcam-review-adjustable-field-of-view-streaming-zoom-video-calls-price-features"&gt;During my testing earlier in 2021&lt;/a&gt;, I thought it did a better job than the webcam that I’ve used the most during the pandemic: the one built into my 2019 MacBook Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzxHbZ"&gt;That’s underselling it a bit, though. It’s basically on par with the Logitech Streamcam in its ability to produce a satisfying picture with good exposure, although the image was fuzzier than I would have liked for the price. Picture quality aside, the build quality is excellent, and its stand lets you easily mount it on your monitor, or attach it to a tripod. But, this might be a more attractive option if it’s discounted.&lt;/p&gt;
