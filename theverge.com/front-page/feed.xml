    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6fllf4"&gt;Google’s next Pixel flagship — the presumably named “Pixel 6” — will reportedly feature a Google-designed GS101 “Whitechapel” SoC (system on a chip), a first for the company, as reported by &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/02/pixel-6-google-gs101-whitechapel/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-pixel-6-custom-system-on-chip/#update1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rjg04Y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;’s report claims Google is working on two phones that will feature the Arm-based GS101 — presumed to be a flagship device to succeed last year’s Pixel 5 and a Pixel 4A 5G follow-up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EhhKh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt;’s report, meanwhile, goes into further detail on the new SoC, claiming the GS101 chips will feature a “three cluster setup with a TPU (Tensor Processing Unit)” for machine learning applications. (For reference, Qualcomm’s own flagship &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;Snapdragon 888&lt;/a&gt; uses Arm’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/26/21267893/arm-cortex-a78-mali-g78-cpu-gpu-designs-smartphones-2021-samsung-qualcomm-apple"&gt;Cortex-X1 / Cortex-A78&lt;/a&gt; / Cortex-A55 as a triple cluster CPU setup.) Additionally, the new SoC may feature an integrated security chip, similar to the Titan M. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlHZpy"&gt;The idea of Google making a custom TPU or security chip isn’t new: Google has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/26/17616140/google-edge-tpu-on-device-ai-machine-learning-devkit"&gt;previously made TPUs for servers&lt;/a&gt; and the Pixel 4’s Neural Core, along with the discrete Titan M chip on its current phones. But the custom-designed GS101 would presumably allow the company to integrate those features on a deeper level.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="noJs1F"&gt;Rumors of the Whitechapel chips have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21221062/google-processor-pixels-chromebooks-whitechapel-samsung-qualcomm"&gt;circulated since last year&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/scoop-google-readies-its-own-chip-for-future-pixels-chromebooks-e5f8479e-4a38-485c-a264-9ef9cf68908c.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Google was looking to develop its own in-house chips for use in Pixel and Chromebook devices. That report claimed the company would be optimizing its chip for Google’s machine learning technology — something the &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt; report corroborates. The GS101 chip for the 2021 Pixel lineup would be the first fruits of the Whitechapel project, although &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;’ original report noted that Chromebook chips weren’t expected until further in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l0sawQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;’s report also includes references to a “Slider” codename tied to the new device, which it says is also connected to Samsung’s Exynos SoCs (which the company uses on Galaxy smartphone devices outside the US). Samsung’s involvement on the manufacturing side — which &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; also reported last year — would make sense, as one of the largest manufacturers of smartphone semiconductors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZCfSoD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A Google-designed GS101 chip is an intriguing idea&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hhh5jf"&gt;The idea of Google-designed chips is a compelling one. Apple has long touted its tightly integrated software and hardware stack as a key part of how its iPhones, iPads, and now, its Mac computers are able to run so well — a key part of which is the company’s custom-designed A-series and M-series chips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dhO3S3"&gt;Google — and almost every other Android manufacturer, save Samsung and Huawei — doesn’t have that advantage. It instead relies on Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chips, which dominate the Android marketplace in the US. Oftentimes, an Android device lives or dies on how well its manufacturer is able to synergize Qualcomm’s chips, Google’s software, and its own hardware designs. Similarly, the fact that, at their core, almost every Android device runs on the same chipset and the same software makes it difficult for any one model to stand out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJbcjC"&gt;But a Google-designed GS101 chip brings a tantalizing promise: that Google could bring an Apple-like boost in speed, performance, and battery life to Android (and specifically, its Pixel lineup) with a similar level of control over the hardware design, software, and processor. It’s an intriguing idea — assuming Google can pull it off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KYiog0"&gt;That said, building a smartphone processor at the level of Apple or Qualcomm isn’t easy. While both companies use Arm as a common base, they’ve spent years refining those basic building blocks with customizations to suit their needs. Apple has been using custom designs in its processors since the 2012’s A6 design (as opposed to previous models that used licensed CPU designs from Arm itself). Qualcomm takes a similar approach in its modern processors, using custom Kryo cores that are semi-customized versions of Arm’s base Cortex designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g4Pys1"&gt;It might take Google a few generations to fine-tune its Pixel chips. But if Google can actually deliver on a proper customized chip that’s built from the ground up to be specifically designed for Android’s software and the Pixel’s hardware, it could be the key to transforming the Pixel line from a sideshow to a true smartphone powerhouse.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHoW8g"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest in the global semiconductor shortage</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;From consoles to cars, it seems like everyone is having a hard time getting enough chips&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="DHYGjq"&gt;As the COVID-19 pandemic hit, demand for tech products suddenly spiked, just as it became difficult for chipmakers to know how much production capacity they actually needed. Now, anyone looking to build something with a computer chip in it has to deal with a global shortage. It’s affecting the production of everything from the obvious, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325999/gogo-5g-network-delay-chip-shortage"&gt;5G rollout&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/e/21991081"&gt;GPUs&lt;/a&gt;, to things you wouldn’t necessarily expect, like &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/e/22030524"&gt;trucks and cars&lt;/a&gt;. Even large companies like Samsung are having to reevaluate plans to make sure they’ll be able to get the chips they need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KgaT6J"&gt;The problem has gotten so bad that US President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order"&gt;has pledged to address it&lt;/a&gt;, but industry insiders say the problem &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/e/22122297"&gt;will be sticking around for a while&lt;/a&gt;. We’ll be tracking the latest evolutions in policy surrounding the shortage and keeping up with the latest products affected by it right here, so stay tuned if you want to stay on top of the latest delays and changes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bNwLH1"&gt;Microsoft has updated its &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fevents" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;events website&lt;/a&gt; to reveal the dates of Microsoft Build 2021. Per the new listing, the annual conference will take place from May 25th–27th this year. It will also be held &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/7/21211721/microsoft-events-build-2021-digital-only-coronavirus-plans"&gt;virtually&lt;/a&gt;, along with many of Microsoft’s 2021 events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eoRr57"&gt;A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed the dates to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Please stay tuned for more information to come,” the spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWvmRP"&gt;“Microsoft Build is where developers, architects, start-ups, and students learn, connect, and code together, sharing knowledge and expanding their skillset, while exploring new ways of innovating for tomorrow,” the website reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SeJx0T"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;That moment you go to confirm the dates of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MSBuild?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MSBuild&lt;/a&gt; and find this! Hey that is me!!! :) Can't wait! Let's do this!!! &lt;a href="https://t.co/bBdV9orRpz"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bBdV9orRpz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Donovan Brown #BlackLivesMatter (@DonovanBrown) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DonovanBrown/status/1377739812770353157?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xZic88"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://mybuild.microsoft.com/"&gt;Build-specific website&lt;/a&gt; still includes information about Build 2020 and does not appear to have been updated with the new dates yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqyMkP"&gt;Microsoft Build 2020 was also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21163586/microsoft-build-2020-virtual-event-cancel-online-coronavirus"&gt;held remotely&lt;/a&gt;. The 48-hour event was free of charge; workshops and keynotes were live-streamed. Build is primarily targeted at developers and is often Microsoft’s opportunity to showcase upcoming changes to Windows, Office, Edge, and other services. At last year’s conference, the company exhibited its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21260005/microsoft-office-fluid-web-document-features-build"&gt;Fluid Framework&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21262060/microsoft-windows-10-launcher-powertoy-spotlight-alfred-download-build"&gt;PowerToys Run launcher&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21258697/microsoft-windows-project-reunion-win32-uwp-apps-apis-build"&gt;Project Reunion&lt;/a&gt;, among other new products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8A01AD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The biggest announcements from Microsoft Build 2020","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21264363/microsoft-build-2020-top-news-annoucements-fluid-office-windows-reunion-edge"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9n9Tpr"&gt;The announcement comes as daily reported COVID-19 cases are &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/covid-2021-04-02"&gt;still trending upward&lt;/a&gt; in the US. About &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/coronavirus/2021/3/31/22361028/johnson-covid-vaccine-error-ruin-doses"&gt;30 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the US population has received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine so far, but the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated-guidance.html"&gt;still recommending&lt;/a&gt; that all people avoid medium and large gatherings, regardless of vaccine status. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxMlrF"&gt;“The safety of our community is a top priority,” a Microsoft spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a statement regarding &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21163586/microsoft-build-2020-virtual-event-cancel-online-coronavirus"&gt;last year’s announcement&lt;/a&gt;. “We look forward to bringing together our ecosystem of developers in this new virtual format to learn, connect and code together.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read Bloomberg’s interactive and educational breakdown of the semiconductor shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="intel silicon" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EaVSZ0oTuxP2FRe0pZmoTge7-Mk=/0x0:2880x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69068357/ntel-chip.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uhgtqt"&gt;The global chip shortage has been a growing concern in the tech industry (and it has even &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/e/22042472"&gt;grabbed the interest of the US president&lt;/a&gt;) as it starts to affect the production of more and more products, from cars to graphics cards to game consoles. For a great explanation of all the factors that have led to the shortage, you should read &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-semiconductors-chips-shortage/?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s breakdown&lt;/a&gt;. It digs into factors like pandemic-fueled demand and the small number of companies actually able to produce the chips that now power so much of our digital lives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYr7eU"&gt;One of the most interesting features of the article is an interactive graphic that shows the customers and industries that make use of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), which gives a great idea of the scale and potential downstream effects of the manufacturing bottleneck when one company becomes a dominant force in the consumer electronics component pipeline. You’ll probably learn something new from playing around with it — like the possibly surprising size of Texas Instruments, a company many mostly associate with calculators. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R6rYVYVmvugkFEu96Y-uXOuTTiA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22416708/Screen_Shot_2021_04_02_at_11.33.10_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bloomberg&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This graphic is a wealth of knowledge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7JVkPA"&gt;The article also dives into factors that are more obscure but no less important, like lead times and inventory planning. Despite the depth, the &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;piece still manages to show the interplay between all of the global occurrences and companies involved with surprising clarity, which is why &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2021-semiconductors-chips-shortage/?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;it’s well worth a read&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dish is begging authorities for help with T-Mobile’s CDMA shutdown looming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dish CES 2013 stock 1020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vKWoSSF8sVyWpIq_kz0p6q6tTao=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69068243/20130110-625A1517VERGE.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Boost Mobile, owned by Dish Network, serves 9 million customers — more than half of which rely on the older CDMA network.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CY4Z8b"&gt;Dish Network issued a new letter to the Federal Communications Commission this week, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/dish-tmobile-network-shutdown-fcc-466e406c-db9d-4318-8cec-3579a54fdf04.html"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, highlighting the urgent situation it faces if T-Mobile moves ahead with its planned January 2022 CDMA network shutdown. “We believe that T-Mobile’s actions raise significant competition and public interest concerns,” the letter states. It would be a blow to Dish’s business, but most importantly, millions of Boost Mobile customers would feel the impact as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZPWrRn"&gt;Boost Mobile, a former Sprint MVNO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/20/18632376/boost-mobile-sale-sprint-tmobile-merger-approval-promise"&gt;sold to Dish&lt;/a&gt; as part of T-Mobile’s acquisition, serves 9 million customers. According to the letter, more than half of them rely on CDMA service. Its prepaid service is an accessible alternative to contract plans for low-income customers; there’s no credit check required or even a credit card. Customers can pay for phones and service at retailers like Walmart and top them off as needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y9BNlO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Boost customers may not necessarily even have an email registered with the company&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e1N4zX"&gt;It makes for an appealing service if the costs and contracts of major carrier plans are prohibitive, but it’s also what makes migrating these customers to a newer network uniquely challenging. Boost customers may not necessarily even have an email registered with the company, and those still using slower 3G CDMA devices are likely doing so not because they prefer it, but because they can’t afford a new phone. In less than a year, they’ll be forced to choose between making that purchase or losing their current cell service altogether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9poK8v"&gt;Bearing &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/4/10/21207520/coronavirus-deaths-economy-layoffs-inequality-covid-pandemic"&gt;disproportionate effects of the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; and related economic fallout, it’s likely not a great time for these customers to be shopping for a new phone. Dish also points out that the global chip shortage makes it an especially bad time to try to secure a large number of new devices for customers. Overall, the company’s letter to the FCC makes quite clear how dire the situation is in its view: “A forced migration of this scale under this accelerated time frame is simply not possible and will leave potentially millions of Boost subscribers disenfranchised and without cell service come January 1, 2022.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w4StEr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A forced migration of this scale under this accelerated time frame is simply not possible”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BHOBXK"&gt;As part of the Sprint merger, T-Mobile agreed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708411/dish-tmobile-sprint-carrer-merger-assets-spectrum-boost"&gt;help set Dish up as the US’s fourth wireless carrier&lt;/a&gt;, and selling the prepaid Boost business to Dish was one step in that plan. However, in late 2020, T-Mobile notified Dish that it would be shutting down the CDMA network that many Boost customers use in early 2022, several years earlier than Dish had anticipated. It’s a move the company has been quick to call anti-competitive, both in &lt;a href="https://www.phonearena.com/news/dish-chairman-calls-out-t-mobile-for-being-anticompetitive_id130387"&gt;previous communications&lt;/a&gt; and in this latest letter to the FCC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lyXfQq"&gt;T-Mobile doesn’t see things the same way. It isn’t technically violating the agreement by doing so, and in the company’s view, it has given Dish plenty of notice. Here’s what it had to say in a statement on the matter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="S0FHwM"&gt;Everything we are doing here is exactly consistent with the agreement that DISH made with us a year and a half ago, and we have been very proactive and transparent about the timing for this transition with all of our MVNOs, including DISH. We gave DISH notice in October 2020 for a January 1st 2022 transition – far more than the required 6-month contractual agreement. Our agreement with DISH is also clear that they are responsible for migrating Boost customers, just as we are responsible for migrating Sprint customers, and we are confident that DISH is already making plans to take good care of their impacted customers prior to the transition date. Given the advance notice that they received, just a small percentage of Boost customers should need to upgrade their handsets by the end of this year, and typically those customers would be supported with incentives and promotions to get their handsets upgraded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tn11Sl"&gt;In fact, the company is taking a kind of victory lap on the anniversary of the acquisition with &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fun-carrier%2Fceo-mike-sievert-merger-year-1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F2%2F22364126%2Fboost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a new post on its blog&lt;/a&gt;, celebrating the 5G network it’s been able to build with Sprint’s former spectrum. Based on the tone of this latest letter to the FCC, it’s a celebratory mood that Dish certainly doesn’t share.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Wifi router management is getting rolled into the Google Home app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X8iCmdFMDu_u-YaNG2ibX8ANjX0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69068059/vpavic_191010_3722_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0mDfRH"&gt;Google is killing off its dedicated Google Wifi app for managing its routers, rolling that functionality over to the Google Home app as the company continues to “help our customers control and manage all their connected products in one place and enable routines across them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5ZcjMu"&gt;The switchover to the Google Home app will come in two phases: first, Google will disable most of the functionality of the Google Wifi app on May 25th. Starting then, users will only be able to view the current status of their networks — but any changes, including adding new routers or access points — will have to be done in the Google Home app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YQtF4u"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Starting on May 25th, users will have to use the Home app to make any changes to a Google Wifi setup&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FoEx91"&gt;Then, sometime in June, Google will remove the Wifi app from the Play Store and iOS App Store, funneling all users to exclusively use the Google Home app. (It’ll also stop supporting the old app at that time for existing users, too.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BRTJhA"&gt;Google’s been working on this change since 2019, when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20946586/google-nest-wifi-review-mesh-router-price-specs-features"&gt;launched the Nest Wifi routers&lt;/a&gt; — which could only be configured in the Google Home app. But at the time, the Google Home app still didn’t offer many of the features that the Google Wifi app did. Google had promised that it would support both apps until it had updated the Home app to include all the features offered in the Wifi app, which it says will be the case once June rolls around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkqFL1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlenest/answer/9547597?p=wifi_migrate&amp;amp;utm_source=transactional&amp;amp;utm_medium=email_service&amp;amp;utm_campaign=GS106039&amp;amp;utm_term=learnmore1&amp;amp;utm_content=110398454&amp;amp;visit_id=637529843289028306-3069274133&amp;amp;rd=1"&gt;Google points out&lt;/a&gt; that migrating existing Wifi setups to the Google Home app will offer some new benefits, including the ability to use Google Assistant for things like pausing the Wi-Fi connection, testing your current internet speed, and (in a neat bit of product synergy) showing a guest Wi-Fi password on a Google Nest Hub or Nest Hub Max display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwLzNM"&gt;Migrating a network setup seems to be a relatively simple process, although Google’s how-to warns it’s a one-way street: once you switch over to the Google Home app, you can’t go back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRTle1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 2nd, 4:15pm:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added additional clarification as to which Google Wifi routers are impacted by the sunsetting of the standalone app. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla delivered more cars than it made in the first quarter of 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Tn8-FFNOwq2pJPmI3C-aPXFGxU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69067798/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z2zOwc"&gt;Tesla delivered nearly 185,000 cars in the first quarter of 2021, more than it produced over the three-month period, according to numbers &lt;a href="https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q1-2021-vehicle-production-deliveries"&gt;the company shared on Friday&lt;/a&gt;. Tesla has been ramping up production capacity and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/2/22210191/tesla-delivery-goal-elon-musk-vehicles-2020"&gt;just nearly missed&lt;/a&gt; CEO Elon Musk’s goal of delivering 500,000 cars in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlCEcl"&gt;Of the cars Tesla delivered in Q1 2021, nearly 183,000 were Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, more than the 180,000 of those models produced in Q1. On top of the Model 3 and Model Y deliveries, the company also sold an additional 2,020 Model S cars that had been produced in previous quarters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HSzsIR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tesla could beat last year’s 500,000-car goal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rzxpko"&gt;Tesla &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252832/tesla-model-s-redesign-plaid-mile-range-interior-refresh"&gt;announced redesigns&lt;/a&gt; for the Model S and Model X in January 2021, which added new powertrains, higher range options, and the landscape in-car display from the more popular Model 3. Tesla says the redesigns were “exceptionally well-received” and that it’s in the early stage of ramping up production on both new models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzxUMr"&gt;The company didn’t break out specific delivery numbers for cars in China, but Tesla says it continues to be happy with the reception of its newer Model Y in the country. China has been a focus for Tesla since it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21042493/tesla-chinese-model-3-cars-gigafactory-3-shanghai"&gt;opened its Gigafactory&lt;/a&gt; there in 2019, which the company seems to see as critical for meeting demand for its cars. When Tesla shared &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252765/tesla-profit-q4-2020-earnings-elon-musk-record-sales"&gt;its Q4 2020 financial figures&lt;/a&gt;, it announced that its factory in Shanghai could allow it to produce as many as 1.05 million cars in a year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbIBOy"&gt;Tesla and Musk haven’t yet announced any ambitious delivery goals for 2021, but in comparison to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21205932/tesla-q1-sales-deliveries-production-china-factory-coronavirus"&gt;88,400 cars it delivered in Q1 2020,&lt;/a&gt; Tesla seems like it’s starting on the right foot to beat last year’s 500,000-car goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5aC67"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to change Siri’s voice in the iOS 14.5 beta</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wFsYk_I7SRkTLJ2YqLOOcBYLeUM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69067730/akrales_190522_3444_0017.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vvbuiG"&gt;Until recently, the default voice for Apple’s Siri assistant has been stereotypically female-sounding. However, studies have found that having AI assistants default to female-sounding voices can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634322/amazon-alexa-apple-siri-female-voice-assistants-harmful-gender-stereotypes-new-study"&gt;reinforce harmful stereotypes&lt;/a&gt;, so Apple has tried to fix that in its upcoming iOS 14.5, which is now in beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6KGYdg"&gt;When you update your phone to iOS 14.5, you’ll be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360502/apple-siri-female-voice-default-new-voices-ios-14-5"&gt;prompted to pick a default voice for Siri&lt;/a&gt; — and Apple is including two new voice options. However, if you’ve changed your mind and want to use a different voice (or are using the 14.5 beta and weren’t prompted), this guide will show you how to change the voice after setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XhB1LI"&gt;It’s a reasonably simple process. First, go to the Settings app, then to Siri &amp;amp; Search, and tap Siri Voice. There, you’ll be presented with the list of options.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/583JirAdCoNcghR8xipu6St_0-s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22416486/Image.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap Siri Voice to be taken to the list of options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mph8AS"&gt;At the moment, the American variety is the only one with four voice choices; Australian, British, Indian, Irish, and South African versions only have two. The four US voice choices are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="yS4oPO"&gt;Voice 1, which is a soft-spoken male-sounding voice &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="swUqtC"&gt;Voice 2, an energetic, confident female-sounding voice&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="l6YrCC"&gt;Voice 3 is similar to Voice 2 but male-sounding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OtUBen"&gt;And finally, Voice 4, which is similar to the default Siri voice that’s been around all these years&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="tZcBH0"&gt;If you want to hear what the voices sound like for yourself, they’re in the embedded tweet below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u8ZG9v"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Siri's new voice options in the latest iOS 14.5 Beta &lt;a href="https://t.co/25pUA8kP7V"&gt;pic.twitter.com/25pUA8kP7V&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mitchell (@strawberrywell) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1378024607962128384?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P5h6cp"&gt;Tapping on a voice will play a snippet of it saying “Hi, I’m Siri. Choose the voice you’d like me to use.” If you choose voices 1–3, it will have to download them before you can use them, but you don’t have to stay in the Settings app while it does so. Once it’s finished downloading, Siri will respond with your chosen voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QlKF9C"&gt;This process is unlikely to change in the final version, but if it does, we’ll be sure to update this how-to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite is getting a Bruno Mars emote</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="InY9xi"&gt;Bruno Mars is the latest celebrity to jump into the virtual world of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Today, developer Epic Games announced that the battle royale game would be getting a new Mars emote — essentially an in-game dance — set to the singer’s song “Leave the Door Open.” Players will be able to buy it starting at 8PM ET tonight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaDZUz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is steadily becoming a place filled with real-world stars, whether it’s streamers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21068938/fortnite-ninja-skin-icon-series-metaverse-tyler-blevins-ultimate-virtual-world-star-wars"&gt;Tyler “Ninja” Blevins&lt;/a&gt; or the upcoming appearance of Brazilian soccer star Neymar. Music, in particular, has been a big focal point for the game. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18234980/fortnite-marshmello-concert-viewer-numbers"&gt;Marshmello&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt; both held massive in-game concerts with millions of virtual attendees, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448831/bts-fortnite-party-royale-dynamite-music-video"&gt;BTS debuted a music video&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21423004/fortnite-party-royale-concert-series-dominic-fike"&gt;Epic even created its own soundstage&lt;/a&gt; to host shows from the likes of Dominic Fike, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21525028/fortnite-fortnitemares-halloween-event-jbalvin-concert"&gt;J Balvin&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437843/fortnite-anderson-paak-spotlight-concert-date"&gt;Anderson .Paak&lt;/a&gt; (who recently performed with Bruno Mars at the Grammys).&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="NbdJCk"&gt;Easter is on Sunday, and if you celebrate the holiday but won’t be able to visit your family this year, a Zoom call is a great substitute to ensure you can still connect with your loved ones. A few devices support Zoom, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;including Amazon’s Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;, which is on sale for $75 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724867471427496922#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="GWOeX6"&gt;Amazon is also discounting its Fire HD 8 tablets, knocking $30 off the usual retail prices. You can buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-8-tablet/dp/B07TMJ1R3X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire HD 8 tablet for only $60&lt;/a&gt;, or you can get the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0839NDRB2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire HD 8 Plus for $80&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike the previous Fire HD 8 models, the latest tablets have a USB-C port for faster charging, and the HD 8 Plus supports wireless charging, too. &lt;/p&gt;
