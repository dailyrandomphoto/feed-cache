    <title>Bose ‘Sport Open Earbuds’ with ear hooks appear at FCC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cNDjKx5AEE607MeEioucYXWGgYg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449603/BoseOpen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: FCC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9sTRKY"&gt;It looks like Bose is planning another set of true wireless earbuds to join its QuietComfort and Sport Earbuds. Today, filings for the “Sport Open Earbuds” &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/A94109R"&gt;have appeared at the Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; — with plenty of photos of the unannounced product contained within. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QJT3e4"&gt;The design makes clear that Bose is going for a fitness-first set of earbuds here, with a completely open, plastic exterior that seems to just rest against your ear. It’s held in place by an ear hook, and there’s a button visible at the bottom of each earbud. A charger for the Sport Open Earbuds is also seen in the filing. The product name is confirmed several times in the documentation and is visible on the labels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xlm8b1y6NVGstxUKwo2EMrPF2tw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22141550/Screen_Shot_2020_12_03_at_12.17.12_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: FCC&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XLdHwF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Bose for more details on the Sport Open Earbuds. The Sport Earbuds released earlier this year cost $159, but they’ve got an in-ear design with silicone tips. This open alternative could be more targeted at people who don't like how earbuds feel and want greater awareness of their surroundings when running or during other fitness activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48OKJ6"&gt;There’s a lot we don’t know yet about the Sport Open Earbuds like battery life, sweat resistance rating, and how this totally open style will actually &lt;em&gt;sound&lt;/em&gt; compared to the company’s more traditional earbuds. But it might be worth holding off on your next purchase of fitness buds until we get the full story.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon now lets you text Alexa on iOS to ask for things instead of only using your voice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bq38Bgg-cWgI9IMVIOFLQouI9q0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449526/acastro_180510_1777_alexa_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mVMJ7w"&gt;Amazon is testing a new feature for its iOS Alexa app: the ability to type out Alexa commands, instead of having to ask questions or requests by speaking out loud. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04yLIB"&gt;“Type with Alexa is a Public Preview feature available to iOS Alexa app customers allowing you to interact with Alexa without using voice, meaning everything you can currently say to Alexa can now also be typed using your Alexa mobile app. Type with Alexa is available to iOS customers in the U.S.,” said an Amazon spokesperson. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4-FQ4-QZGN0KR37kVM7MCFoTkUE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22141390/Untitled.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5VVPli"&gt;The new feature — &lt;a href="https://www.the-ambient.com/news/type-with-alexa-new-keyboard-feature-2435"&gt;first spotted by &lt;em&gt;The Ambient&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — is available for iOS users in the Alexa app. To access it, simply tap the keyboard icon that now appears on the top left of the main menu of the app. The typed-out commands should work identically to verbal ones, although Amazon notes that it’s still a public preview, and Alexa is “still getting the hang of it.” In other words, there might be a bug or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUhBEU"&gt;Being able to type out your requests to a digital assistant isn’t a new idea (both Google Assistant and Apple’s Siri have offered it for years), but it’s good to see that Amazon is working to offer a similar option for Alexa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yd8nbC"&gt;For now, Type with Alexa is available in public preview for iOS users. Amazon has yet to say when it’ll be releasing a final version of the feature or when it will be available on other platforms like Android. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Five new Android features coming this winter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L6eGCSbMHKYx4B3aJHEMcWZpaR4=/1304x0:4906x2401/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449450/Android_feature_winter.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New features coming for Google Maps, Gboard, Voice Access, Google Play Books, and Nearby Share.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OwKvTW"&gt;Google is rolling out five new Android features in the weeks ahead that enhance Maps navigation, Gboard emoji mashups, Voice Access, Google Play audiobooks, and Nearby Share file sharing. Google is also making Android Auto available in 36 more countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="elcP0P"&gt;To start with, Google is giving Maps a new Go tab that lets you quickly navigate to favorite places without entering the address. Pin driving destinations to school or work, for example, and the Go tab will show directions, live traffic and disruptions, and an estimated arrival time. You can also pin your favorite public transport route to see departure and arrival times and any delays right from the tab. Google suggests pinning both driving and public transport options to the same destination to see which will get your there faster. The Go tab will start rolling out to Android and iOS devices “in the coming weeks,” according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o8FaD_OxNSmpuVhWpC0GD6zWN28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140893/maps_go.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quickly access pinned destinations in new Go tab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rxB2vT"&gt;Next up, Google is expanding those custom emoji sticker mashups available on Gboard from a few hundred unique combinations to more than 14,000. The so-called Emoji Kitchen now lets you tap two emoji to see suggested combinations, or double a single emoji to see “more intense” variations. Available already on &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.inputmethod.latin"&gt;Gboard beta&lt;/a&gt;, Google says the new Emoji Kitchen will be available on Android 6.0 and above “over the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WIuGGrfI_pEc6j0jxfP6TKxPEFg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140894/gif_mashup.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Make mashups with Emoji Kitchen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jXXm4p"&gt;Google is also making a change that could result in more audiobooks in the Play Store. Google says that it’s providing publishers in the US and UK with a new auto-generated narrator tool than can be used to create audio versions of books that currently lack them. The tool is currently in beta, and should be coming to all publishers in early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h7zxhMZlkdRK8UiZ-nZvxQAXqPc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140895/auto_narration.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An audiobook created with new auto-narrator tool for publishers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7AFkob"&gt;Next up, Google is bringing its enhanced &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.accessibility.voiceaccess&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;Voice Access&lt;/a&gt; navigation, already available in Android 11, to all devices globally running Android 6.0 and above. With the help of machine learning, Voice Access allows UI elements such as buttons and labels to be more easily manipulated by voice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bby7YbVM0wtbvxkyB-wZ1IN2MrU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22140897/voice_naviation.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Navigating Maps using Voice Access.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yYk00c"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353020/android-nearby-share-file-sharing-feature-launch-airdrop"&gt;Nearby Share&lt;/a&gt; functionality will also soon support the direct sharing of Play Store apps with nearby Android users. The apps are sent via whatever method your two phones deem the fastest: Bluetooth, Bluetooth Low Energy, WebRTC, or peer-to-peer Wi-Fi. To share an app from Google Play you’ll need to head to the “Share Apps” menu in “Manage Apps &amp;amp; Games” and select the app to share. Your friend must then accept the incoming app. This particular update will start rolling out in “the coming weeks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZ5T3k"&gt;Lastly, Google says that it’s expanding &lt;a href="https://www.android.com/auto/"&gt;Android Auto&lt;/a&gt; support to 36 more countries over “the next few months,” bringing Google’s apps and services to the dashboard of &lt;a href="https://www.android.com/auto/compatibility/"&gt;compatible cars&lt;/a&gt; for anyone running Android 10 or above (Android 9 users can download the app).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android Auto expands to dozens of countries in Europe, Africa, and Asia</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aqFUrIUYXDmCMqQrR-SrTW_WXpQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449411/akrales_190725_3567_0090.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jaQzWn"&gt;Android Auto, the Google-powered software system for cars, is expanding to dozens of new markets around the world, the company announced. In the coming months, Android Auto will be available in 36 additional countries, including much of Eastern Europe, Southeast Asia, and a handful of countries in Africa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYuJA7"&gt;Here’s the list of countries that will soon be getting Android Auto: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="DTKdcm"&gt;Europe: Albania, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Portugal, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Latvia, Luxembourg, Lithuania, Macedonia, Malta, Moldova, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Albania, Armenia, Belarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Ukraine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bfyhzn"&gt;Asia: Turkey, Thailand, Indonesia &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OVw8Am"&gt;Africa: Angola, Botswana&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="JQoOel"&gt;Google is effectively doubling the number of countries in the world where customers can access Android Auto. It’s a sign that the company is feeling bullish about the future of its vehicle interface. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21377399/google-android-auto-android-11-wireless-phone-support"&gt;Google recently announced&lt;/a&gt; that the latest version of its operating system, Android 11, will allow any smartphone owner to connect wirelessly to Android Auto, as long as the connecting vehicle includes a head unit that supports 5GHz Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OABlSd"&gt;Google is also working with automakers to produce more cars with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/25/18196234/google-android-auto-in-car-systems-apple-carplay-interview"&gt;natively installed Android Auto&lt;/a&gt;. Google struck deals with Volvo and Audi to start rolling out these systems, and over the last year, we’ve seen a few examples of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21365032/polestar-2-hands-on-first-drive-electric-android-automotive-photos-range"&gt;what they will look like&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung begins wider rollout of Android 11 and One UI 3.0 to latest phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rsM98UEv-xmvDlsK2etfX2xxunE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449227/bking_200306_3928_0015.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Brennan King / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HAwEAy"&gt;Samsung is starting to &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-one-ui-3-android11-enhanced-user-experience/"&gt;roll out updates&lt;/a&gt; to Android 11 and One UI 3.0, its customized interface, to some of its latest phones. The first up are Galaxy S20 series devices in the US, Korea, and most of Europe, which will start receiving updates today. Updates for the Note 20, last year’s Note 10 and S10, and the Z Fold, Z Fold 2, and Z Flip are planned to arrive in the “coming weeks.” Updates for the Galaxy A series will arrive in the first half of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aemOdF"&gt;The updates come three months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427153/android-11-official-launch-google-pixel-oneplus-8-xiaomi-oppo-realme-update"&gt;the launch of Android 11&lt;/a&gt;. Samsung has historically been slow to deliver Android updates even to its latest phones. Three months isn’t a huge wait (it maintains &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21025221/android-10-samsung-galaxy-s10-availability-att-sprint-t-mobile-verizon-xfinity-mobile-one-ui"&gt;the same pace&lt;/a&gt; as last year), but a number of other phone manufacturers, including OnePlus, Xiaomi, and Oppo, managed to deliver Android 11 on day one this year. Samsung’s updates take longer in part because it heavily customizes Android with its own interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nXJQTT"&gt;One UI 3.0 mostly brings visual refinements to Samsung’s existing interface. Menus and widgets are now presented with a frosty, translucent background, rather than the grayish look they previously had. Samsung has also added some richer lock screen widgets and a redesigned volume menu, and it says animations should be smoother, and camera autofocus should be faster. &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/09/17/heres-absolutely-every-new-thing-in-samsung-oneui-3-0/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police &lt;/em&gt;has a thorough rundown&lt;/a&gt; of the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L3mK0Y"&gt;It’s not entirely clear how soon any given phone will get these updates, even though the rollout is starting today. Samsung’s software rollouts often start slowly, and they’re frequently held up on a carrier-by-carrier basis. To illustrate just how chaotic it can be: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22149171/verizon-samsung-galaxy-s20-android-11-one-ui-3-0"&gt;Verizon preempted Samsung’s announcement&lt;/a&gt; and started rolling out this update to the Galaxy S20 5G UW yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Photos now lets you set a changing wallpaper that pulls images from your memories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MO_Bg18DwZNEv_C95AYK4biQwus=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449069/1BEB77B1_EB2C_4E1F_A9C1_1B863908E956.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t3IMGi"&gt;Android users who are bored of their usual wallpapers are in luck: an update to Google Photos now allows users to set their wallpaper as a random, rotating cast of saved photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yE8l3J"&gt;Version 5.22 of Google Photos automatically includes the update, so if you go to your phone’s wallpaper selector and look at the live wallpapers, you should see the option for one called “Memories.” Once selected, your phone will start pulling photos from the Memories section of Google Photos to cycle between as a background. You’ll then be able to preview what you’ll see as a wallpaper before confirming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SekiEk"&gt;The main catch here is that Google defines what &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/products/photos/relive-your-best-memories-new-features-google-photos"&gt;counts as a memory&lt;/a&gt; based on its machine learning algorithms, so you won’t be able to really decide what shows up. Photos could range from gorgeous vistas to a photo of your sad home office lunch. Who knows! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8oEW9b"&gt;Of course, you might as well try this out now if you’re ever going to, considering Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/11/21560810/google-photos-unlimited-cap-free-uploads-15gb-ending"&gt;is eliminating&lt;/a&gt; unlimited, free photo storage on June 1st, 2021. Google Photos will start charging for storage over 15GB, which is beyond a bummer. If you think you might end up switching services, now’s the time to try out a live wallpaper.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Complex turned its fashion and music festival into a futuristic video game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6dv-MSJBwUJ1ZlripOv5BUiVgTo=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68448969/INTRO_RENDER_08.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A week of sneakers, panels, and... virtual food trucks&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="SvPdhu"&gt;Since 2016, ComplexCon has been a place where streetwear enthusiasts can gather in one place to buy exclusive gear, listen to amazing live music, and gorge at high-end food trucks. As with most live shows, though, the event isn’t taking place in 2020 — at least, not in the traditional way. In lieu of an in-person festival in Long Beach, Complex has built a video game where users can shop, watch talks and performances, and, yes, order from local restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmfkO6"&gt;It’s not a sprawling virtual world where millions can gather in one place, but rather a single-player experience designed to mimic the feeling of being at a live show. ComplexLand is a video game where the main activity is shopping, and you chase after sneaker drops like a hero in the latest open-world blockbuster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ev9q1Z"&gt;&lt;a href="https://complexland.com/"&gt;ComplexLand&lt;/a&gt; will take place from December 7th–11th, and it’s completely free. The experience was built by design studio Jam3 in WebGL, meaning it’s accessible via a web browser, either on desktop or mobile. Once you create an account, you’re dropped into a sort of abstract, futuristic cityscape and immediately prompted to create an avatar, choosing from various brandname hats and sneakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1gDUd"&gt;From there, the experience opens up, with a big world full of NPCs to talk to and points of interest to explore. To emulate some of the social experience, there will also be a persistent chat where attendees can talk about the day’s events. Most importantly: there are plenty of places to shop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="QGHljW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8GyQ_sOZ9jU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMNSQ1"&gt;Complex’s head of collaborations, Neil Wright, says the creative team was inspired by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott’s appearance in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, but they felt one key thing was missing. “Aesthetically, I thought it looked really cool. It was so over the top and whimsical in a way that was really creative,” Wright explains. “I think, for us, the one thing that it lacked was the commerce aspect. If you wanted to buy any of the merch, you had to go to Travis’ website. You had to go elsewhere for it. So when we were building this world, we wanted to make sure that commerce was top of mind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VmG--dK0Iv9PRu56Phl0aVBkalI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22141171/AVATAR_02_0020.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVXsLX"&gt;ComplexLand is essentially a game built entirely around shopping. Yes, you can watch talks where Fat Joe and Lil Yachty discuss the best sneakers of the year or listen to T-Pain’s thoughts on the future of esports. (All of the talks will be broadcast via YouTube Live.) But you’re also running through a sci-fi city in search of the latest gear. Complex has partnered with fashion brands like Adidas, BAPE, and Tokidoki for virtual booths that users can visit to shop for exclusive sneakers or hoodies. Everything is branded and shoppable: there are artists booths where individuals can sell their work, or you can pop by a Perrier booth plastered with Takashi Murakami’s iconic smiling flowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1cXdN5"&gt;The experience also gamifies that ever-present part of streetwear culture: the limited drop. As players are exploring the world, they’ll get notifications that a new drop is about to happen. From there, it works sort of like an open-world game like &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt;. Your mini-map will show you the general area where the drop can be found, but it’s up to you to actually find it. If you manage to, you’ll be entered into a queue for the opportunity to buy whatever the item is. “In my perfect scenario, your avatar will be shopping around, and then you’ll be alerted that a drop is going to occur. And you have to stop what you’re doing and then try to locate it in the world,” says Wright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qVb-hCiWu12oxpDD33ccaBR9iTo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22141163/ComplexLand_2020___Google_Chrome_2020_12_02_at_6.48.19_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uZB8B3"&gt;Perhaps the most ambitious aspect of ComplexLand is the food trucks. You’ll be able to go up to a virtual truck, order food, and have it delivered to your house. Here’s how Wright describes it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nrdFDa"&gt;It’s something that we really wanted to make sure we were able to execute on because the food trucks at ComplexCon are such an important part because the restaurants that we choose are really top-tier. Basically, what you’ll be able to do is, when you’re in the world, we’ll have four food trucks all based around things like burgers or tacos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWD6GS"&gt;At that point, your avatar will approach the truck, and you’ll be able to see menu items that are region-specific — so if you’re in New York, you get the New York burger, and if you’re in Chicago, you get the Chicago burger — and then we’ll work with the restaurant to have that item available through their delivery platform. Once you select the menu, you’ll be connected to the restaurant’s food delivery service of choice, and it’ll be delivered to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gXekud"&gt;ComplexLand represents the confluence of several trends, from events going virtual to the collision of fashion and gaming. Both of these became more prominent in 2020, whether it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/26/21721371/balenciaga-afterworld-the-age-of-tomorrow-fashion-launch-video-game"&gt;Balenciaga making a game to show off its next clothing line&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570454/lil-nas-x-roblox-concert-33-million-views"&gt;Lil Nas X performing inside &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21238703/animal-crossing-new-horizons-streetwear-fashion-outfits-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; fans working together to design in-game streetwear&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LFtTXI"&gt;ComplexLand differs in some ways because it’s so overtly commercial, designed explicitly for shopping, but that could also be indicative of the future of virtual worlds. After all, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s continued growth has been built largely off of pop culture collaborations with Marvel and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;. Brands are everywhere. ComplexLand simply embraces this fact more than most. And while it was designed initially for a week-long event, it could also end up being a more permanent virtual space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="PqOXt6"&gt;“We built it with the objective that we would probably bring it back,” says Wright.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This is the best Nintendo Switch deal you’ll find this holiday season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/APQAtVw2YL5h_5I0Nv3HdQtBdQ0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68448780/jbareham_180301_2346_nintendo_switch_0034_mario.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fZ0yJN"&gt;Some of the best deals during Black Friday and Cyber Monday have come and gone, but with the holidays just around the corner, there are still a ton of deals readily available at various retailers. If you are looking to gift a Nintendo Switch this holiday season, Walmart has one of the best deals right now, which includes &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-w-Neon-Blue-Neon-Red-Joy-Con-12-Month-Individual-Membership-Nintendo-Switch-Online-Carrying-Case%2F498089523&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the console, a carrying case, and 12 months of Nintendo Switch Online (individual membership)&lt;/a&gt; for $299.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qibft2"&gt;It’s a unique deal for a few reasons: the Nintendo Switch alone costs $300, and 12 months of Nintendo’s online service costs $20. Carrying cases vary in price but can cost anywhere between $13 to $33. Nintendo Switch Online is a great service if you plan to purchase games that take advantage of the online feature like &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FAnimal-Crossing-New-Horizons-Nintendo-Nintendo-Switch-045496596439%2F720388718&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMario-Kart-8-Deluxe-Nintendo-Nintendo-Switch-045496590475%2F55432571&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSuper-Smash-Bros-Ultimate-Nintendo-Nintendo-Switch-045496592998%2F467273231&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562530/nintendo-switch-lite-sales-october-2020"&gt;ongoing popularity&lt;/a&gt;, Nintendo doesn’t discount the Switch console itself. The only way you’re going to save money when buying one is through bundles like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gf2eb0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10200007"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="9iDVu1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"You can get Super Mario Odyssey for free when you buy a Switch Pro controller","url":"https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/12/2/22016568/nintendo-switch-pro-controller-super-mario-odyssey-steelseries-arctis-pro-wireless-headset-amazon"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="V4DvMI"&gt;The Nintendo Switch included with the bundle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20697601/nintendo-switch-new-model-battery-life-improvements"&gt;is the updated model&lt;/a&gt;. Compared to the original version, which was released nearly four years ago, the updated Switch has two more hours of battery life. While playing the console in handheld mode, it can be used between 4.5 to nine hours on a single charge, depending on what games you play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ismdPA"&gt;With the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S kickstarting a new generation of consoles (and both being &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;very difficult to find right now&lt;/a&gt;), the Switch still offers a lot of value as an eighth-generation console, thanks to its hybrid design of being both a home and handheld console.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s best commercial features dogs frolicking in Halo, Minecraft, and Flight Simulator</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EhpN7Kx26a6UrLDXQTyoU1vwZmY=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68448606/dogsmicrosoftholiday2020.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kjcR6e"&gt;Microsoft has had some memorable holiday commercials over the years, but this year’s is the best yet because it features dogs. They aren’t just regular dogs, either. These pups dream of running around in a virtual &lt;em&gt;Minecraft &lt;/em&gt;world, playing fetch with grenades for Master Chief in &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, and even flying high in the &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator &lt;/em&gt;skies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qXx4Go"&gt;“A Dog’s Dream” features two dogs who are bored at home as their owners are distracted playing &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, busy on Microsoft Teams work calls, or crafting materials in &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;. One starts to dream about the possibilities if more dogs were part of video games or conference calls, and the rest is history. Just check out Master Chief’s reaction when one of the dogs fetches a grenade he just threw and returns it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wR8BZAs37gpA0wSGy06AJybfI2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22141084/masterchief.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Master Chief’s reaction is priceless.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cJDhH5"&gt;Microsoft creates holiday commercials every year, but none have been as fun-filled as this one. Back in 2015, Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/1/9827332/microsoft-holiday-tv-commercial-apple"&gt;hugged it out with Apple Store employees&lt;/a&gt; for some festive spirit, and then in 2017, it tried to make 3D Paint a thing with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/10/16758462/microsoft-holiday-commercial-2017-3d-remix"&gt;adorable monsters&lt;/a&gt;. This year, it’s all about dogs frolicking in video games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ny8mh5"&gt;Now we just need more dogs in &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; for real to keep &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CanYouPetTheDog"&gt;@CanYouPetTheDog&lt;/a&gt; happy.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus’ ROG Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop is back down to its Black Friday price</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nl8rMXR4epHbi5JgqJE1xCKa9tY=/0x0:1939x1293/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68448594/awhite_200319_3954_6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Avery White for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zK25Nb"&gt;Some retailers are still shaking out a few remaining Cyber Monday deals, like the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop. Though, there are some new ones, too. That busy shopping weekend was undoubtedly the best time to get gifts at the lowest prices, but that’s not to say you’ve completely run out of chances. The deals below prove otherwise, and as we get closer to the holidays, we’ll be surfacing more and more deals on tech products that might be on your wishlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="QCdn8a"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jEiVNU"&gt;Tech&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7aOoh6"&gt;The 14-inch Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 gaming laptop is a treat if you want a lot of power in a compact machine. Best Buy’s Black Friday deal is back, once again knocking $250 off the high-end configuration with AMD’s capable and efficient Ryzen 9 4900HS processor, Nvidia’s RTX 2060 Max-Q graphics chip, 16GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725507320874252995" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $1,200&lt;/a&gt;. And just so you know, this machine oddly doesn’t have a webcam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="boDpW3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505867"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Pfvz7F"&gt;If getting to sleep — or if you’re a light sleeper, staying asleep — is a challenge, Lectrofan’s white noise machine might be helpful. This product has become indispensable to me, and it travels well, too. Daily Steals is offering &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers a sizable discount on a new model from its site, dropping the cost by almost half of what Amazon sells it for. Instead of paying $50, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailysteals.com%2Fproducts%2Flectrofan-premium-white-noise-sound-machine-with-20-unique-non-looping-sounds&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2020%2F12%2F3%2F22149986%2Fasus-zephyrus-rog-g14-gaming-laptop-xbox-game-pass-subscription-chromecast-deal-sale-best-buy#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get one for $30&lt;/a&gt; by using the offer code &lt;strong&gt;VERGELFAN&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q6mcQA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10199974"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dp84r0"&gt;CalDigit’s TS3 Plus 15-port Thunderbolt 3 dock is more affordable than ever at B&amp;amp;H Photo as part of a limited-time deal that will end later today or once stock sells out. Normally around $220 during other sales, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1434943-REG%2Fcaldigit_500561_ts3_thunderbolt_3_docking.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2020%2F12%2F3%2F22149986%2Fasus-zephyrus-rog-g14-gaming-laptop-xbox-game-pass-subscription-chromecast-deal-sale-best-buy#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $190 right now&lt;/a&gt;. My colleague &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21234512/work-from-home-remote-gadgets-recommendations-airpods-nest-hub-display-desk"&gt;Dan Seifert considers this an essential WFH gadget&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6lvXyr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10199988"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p id="YrufMe"&gt;1Password has extended its promo for &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers to get a year’s worth of monthly discounts on a family membership.
