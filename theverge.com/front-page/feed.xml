    <title>Leak reveals Microsoft’s canceled Windows OS for dual-screen devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6gkidiET_FLjl9Pgu5vFmUMqI7o=/91x0:1510x946/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70415928/andromeda_os_screenshots_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RRFuQ1"&gt;Microsoft was working on a secret “pocketable” Surface device powered by a custom Windows OS before the company turned to Android for its Surface Duo. Codenamed Andromeda, the device appeared in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/29/17518582/microsoft-surface-dual-screen-andromeda-device-pocketable"&gt;leaked emails&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/15/16780124/microsoft-surface-notepad-foldable-tablet-hinge-rumors"&gt;patents&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16553250/microsoft-surface-courier-device-rumors"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, and throughout various references to it in Microsoft’s Windows operating system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VevZxw"&gt;Now, &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/andromeda-os-hands-video"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt; has obtained&lt;/a&gt; an early test version of Andromeda OS running on a Lumia 950 to show just how close Microsoft got to launching a more modern successor to Windows Phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cEnFn9"&gt;While Andromeda OS was never designed to ship on a Lumia 950, some Microsoft engineers used these devices to test parts of the operating system. As is typical for secret device development at many tech companies, not all engineers got access to prototype dual-screen hardware, but they still had to work on OS components.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vA4xho12FfXqIEryP6gwkxYgM2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23184378/andromeda_os_screenshots_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Windows Central&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Andromeda OS’ UI looked a lot like Windows Phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xeUvvp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/andromeda-os-hands-video"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt;’s hands-on&lt;/a&gt; of Andromeda OS shows a very early version of what would have ultimately been a Windows Phone for dual-screen hardware. The lockscreen is clearly inspired by Windows Phone, with Cortana managing notifications. A big difference is the ability of the lockscreen to act as a giant canvas to take notes. No need to launch a separate notes app — just start writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QyWvmS"&gt;Even the home screen was another inking canvas, something Microsoft called Journal. This digital notebook supported inking, sticky notes, images, and 3D objects and was always instantly accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9BblM3owRkLkZFkQ82jJLmpBFKc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23184383/andromedaos.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Windows Central&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lockscreen was a giant canvas for inking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hftDqg"&gt;Elsewhere, there is early gesture support that clearly led to what eventually shipped on the Android-powered Surface Duo. Most of the early Andromeda OS UI looks like parts of what shipped with the Surface Duo or even ideas that went into Windows 11.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjTw4h"&gt;Still, it’s interesting to look back at what could have been. Microsoft eventually canceled plans for Andromeda and Andromeda OS in favor of similar hardware that would be powered by Android. The software maker was also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/2/20889000/microsoft-surface-neo-windows-10x-hands-on-features-price-photos-release-date"&gt;working on Surface Neo&lt;/a&gt;, a larger dual-screen device powered by Windows 10X. That project ended with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442421/microsoft-windows-10-x-canceled-official"&gt;cancelation of Windows 10X last year&lt;/a&gt;, and it looks like Windows 11 will lead the way for any devices from OEMs that attempt to bring foldable or dual-screen hardware to life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Twitter could take NFTs mainstream</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pdJw5LQCkGD1RzMd3aCSFbQfoks=/0x58:800x591/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70415810/twitter_nft.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Twitter&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y5zPl1"&gt;Today, just four months after announcing it was exploring the idea, Twitter began letting some people &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/twitterblue/status/1484226494708662273?s=21"&gt;use non-fungible tokens as their profile pictures&lt;/a&gt;. Subscribers to the $2.99-a-month Twitter Blue service can now connect a crypto wallet, and display any NFTs they own in their profile. These users are easily distinguished from those yet to be crypto-pilled by the shape of their avatars: a hexagon, rather than the traditional circle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfUmI6"&gt;In September, when Twitter first broached the idea, I suggested that &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/how-twitter-could-take-nfts-mainstream"&gt;the company’s adoption of NFTs could take the technology mainstream&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter users already invented the hashtag, the @ mention, and the retweet; by using profile pictures to display their (unauthenticated) NFTs already, I argued, owners of CryptoPunks, Bored Apes and other popular collections had invented the NFT profile. And now here it is, as an official Twitter product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcsJUU"&gt;In accordance with the polarizing nature of blockchain-based projects in general, Twitter’s introduction of NFT profiles was met with significant disdain. Recent criticism of NFTs has highlighted &lt;a href="https://moxie.org/2022/01/07/web3-first-impressions.html"&gt;the degree to which the technology does not live up to its own promises&lt;/a&gt;: of decentralizing power, or even of verifying ownership. (For the most part, NFTs today do not encode the owned media on the blockchain; rather, what is encoded is essentially a receipt for it.) Viewed through this lens, Twitter could be accused of legitimizing a technology that can leave people open to theft, scams, and other dangers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MeZOv9"&gt;At the same time, millions of people are about to begin seeing those hexagons every day and wonder what the fuss is about. The question is whether Twitter — and all the other platforms racing to build NFT integrations — can brute-force digital collectibles into popularity, over the strident objections of critics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKvMuG"&gt;As it so happens, we’ve had an early test of that question in the gaming industry. Over the past several months, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/15/technology/cryptocurrency-nft-gamers.html"&gt;several top developers have announced plans to integrate NFTs into their games, in the form of digital goods&lt;/a&gt;. The resulting stories generally include the phrase “massive backlash.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL0VkM"&gt;Gamers’ complaints are straightforward. The gaming industry has gradually shifted from a model of charging you a one-time fee to own a game to one in which you might be asked to pay for it multiple times (to download new expansions, or buy cosmetic items); or continuously (via subscriptions). Loot boxes, which award players items at random, introduced an expensive and &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56614281"&gt;much-hated form of pseudo-gambling&lt;/a&gt; into the gaming world. As a result, gamers often feel nickel-and-dimed by developers, without the games generally feeling more fun as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqsDun"&gt;The idea that playing a video game in the future might involve connecting a crypto wallet, paying steep fees just to transact on the marketplace, purchasing scarce digital goods, and then working to protect them from thieves — well, it’s not clear how that would make games much more fun, either. (One of my favorite YouTubers, the game critic SkillUp, now has a recurring feature about NFTs in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbcyJSeTLtlzGRENniEdwxC2C6mXOXlcz"&gt;his weekly round-up of games news&lt;/a&gt;: it’s called “No Fucking Thanks.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3NdLn"&gt;And so &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/88880/after-backlash-ubisoft-calls-gaming-nfts-a-major-change-that-will-take-time"&gt;Ubisoft was roasted&lt;/a&gt; after announcing a plan to put NFTs into its shooter game &lt;em&gt;Ghost Recon Breakpoint&lt;/em&gt;. Square Enix, maker of the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; series and others, drew criticism for suggesting that &lt;a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/square-enix-nft-backlash"&gt;it could “potentially” offer crypto tokens in the future&lt;/a&gt;. Mobile gaming company Zynga seems to have avoided much backlash for&lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/mobile-gaming-giant-zynga-pledges-eco-friendly-nfts-78420ca7-6fb5-483e-948f-bc55726be934.html"&gt; hiring a blockchain chief&lt;/a&gt;, but then Zynga games have been built on asking players to make constant, frustrating transactions &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2011-07-06/zynga-s-quest-for-big-spending-whales?sref=CrGXSfHu"&gt;from the start&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uqSOYg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This fight will shape the metaverse conversation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G4SMFm"&gt;For would-be operators of thriving NFT trading platforms, this backlash represents more than a series of negative public relations cycles. Silicon Valley’s collective vision of the next version of the internet, the one we have taken to calling the metaverse, hinges on video games as the thing that will lure the masses to buy augmented and virtual reality headsets. The basic idea, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg articulated to me last summer&lt;/a&gt;, is that you’ll buy virtual clothes or other digital goods as NFTs, and take them from VR experience to VR experience, starting with games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOcIAM"&gt;If players continue to hate the idea of NFTs forever, then, the metaverse will look very, very different. And developers that have raised funds at sky-high valuations based on the idea that games will bring billions of people onto web3, such as the team behind &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/how-axie-infinity-is-turning-gaming"&gt;Axie Infinity&lt;/a&gt;, will suffer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mek5wj"&gt;It’s not just players who are skeptical. In a survey published today by the Game Developers Conference, 70 percent of studios said they have “no interest” in NFTs. Here’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893216/gdc-annual-survey-2022-game-developers-nfts"&gt;Jay Peters at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="K4dmhX"&gt;“When asked how they felt about the possibility of cryptocurrency or NFTs in games, a few called it ‘the future of gaming,’” the survey said. “However, a vast majority of respondents spoke out against both practices — noting their potential for scams, overall monetization concerns, and the environmental impact.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVm5dq"&gt;Many quotes directly from developers were scathing. “How this hasn’t been identified as a pyramid scheme is beyond me,” one wrote. “I’d rather not endorse burning a rainforest down to confirm someone ‘owns’ a jpeg,” said another. “Burn ‘em to the ground. Ban everyone involved in them. I work at an NFT company currently and am quitting to get away from it,” said another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EeCj3I"&gt;Of course, another way of reading this data is that almost one-third of game developers today say they are at least interested in NFT integrations. But for now, at least, they are in the minority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnR2UX"&gt;All of which brings us back to the question of how these dynamics will play out on Twitter. There are some important differences between games and tweets: gamers hate NFTs in large part because they feel they fear they will be forced to buy them; on Twitter, buying and displaying any digital art that you purchase will be optional. And while the audience for video games numbers in the &lt;a href="https://www.adexchanger.com/gaming/a-marketers-guide-to-breaking-down-stereotypes-in-the-gaming-audience/"&gt;billions&lt;/a&gt; and defies easy categorization, I imagine Twitter’s diverse audience may have an even wider range of reactions to NFTs in the timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oR0STj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Crypto skeptics are dunking on hexagons; crypto enthusiasts are dunking on people mad at hexagons&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8LpsRs"&gt;Today I saw reactions of two kinds: from crypto skeptics, dunking on hexagons; and, from crypto enthusiasts, dunking on people who are mad at hexagons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DK4cBq"&gt;Who will prevail?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjjkR8"&gt;Sometimes, a technology is so reviled from the start that it is driven out of polite society. Ask anyone &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/seattle-dive-bar-becomes-first-to-ban-google-glass/"&gt;who wore Google Glass into a bar in 2013&lt;/a&gt; how that worked out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5L5UC"&gt;Other times, though — and this feels especially true on Twitter — things get ridiculed into legitimate popularity. (People who research extremism have a term for the way jokes are often used to smuggle ideas into the mainstream: &lt;a href="https://static.nytimes.com/email-content/INT_4981.html"&gt;irony poisoning&lt;/a&gt;.) And crypto enthusiasts have been masterful at co-opting insults hurled at them into badges of honor. When critics derided their art works as “JPEGs,” for example, the community quickly began using that term — with a wink — to refer to their collections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBeGdn"&gt;If Twitter can’t take NFTs mainstream alone, it won’t be the last to try. The &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; reported on Thursday that&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/2745d50b-36e4-4c0a-abe0-e93f035b0628"&gt; Meta plans to let people create and sell NFTs on its platforms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-19/google-forms-blockchain-group-under-newly-appointed-executive?sref=CrGXSfHu"&gt; Google now officially has a blockchain team as well&lt;/a&gt;, and surely YouTube will fit into its plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpT6Ob"&gt;It’s far too soon to gauge the prospects of any of these efforts, which remain in their earliest stages. But in the meantime, we may look back on Twitter’s hexagon launch as the day NFTs became accessible to a broad, mainstream audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jK6jeq"&gt;Now we wait to see whether the mainstream actually wants them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>MSI Creator Z16 review: thin isn’t everything</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The Creator Z16 is slim, powerful, and starved for battery&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="KvkjI8"&gt;MSI’s Creator Z16 is one of a new cadre of “creator” laptops that have been popping up from companies that are traditionally gaming-oriented over the past two years. They tend to take the sorts of specs that you might see in a gaming laptop and cram them into a thinner chassis that looks more like something one might bring into a boardroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HbaaVW"&gt;While you could certainly use the Z16 for gaming — it has an RTX 3060 discrete GPU and a heavy-duty “Cooler Boost” cooling system — it also has a more subtle look than even the most subdued of MSI’s gaming laptops, with a silvery-gray finish, a barely visible dragon logo, and MacBook-esque rounded corners. There’s a 16:10 QHD+ screen with a 120Hz refresh rate (my much-preferred aspect ratio for productivity devices). It ships with Windows 10 Pro. And the video conferencing features — the speakers, in particular — are a solid upgrade from what I often expect to see on a gaming laptop. The system would make a fantastic multimedia machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dmwc80"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"MSI Prestige 14 Evo review: fast but flawed","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22368806/msi-prestige-14-evo-review-price-specs-features-intel-1185g7"},{"title":"MSI Summit B15 review: average business","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22327287/msi-summit-series-b15-review-chassis-build-keyboard-speakers"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="3vuv7d"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10987632"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="idz04h"&gt;Unfortunately, it’s not priced like a multimedia machine — it’s priced like a workstation. That makes it a generally fine laptop that’s in a bit of an odd spot price-wise. It’s below the price of the leading laptops in this zone. My test unit (&lt;a href="https://us-store.msi.com/index.php?utm_source=hatch&amp;amp;utm_campaign=MSI+Systems&amp;amp;utm_content=s164269797016847twa52417&amp;amp;route=product/product&amp;amp;product_id=850"&gt;the cheapest one listed on MSI’s site&lt;/a&gt;, though I’ve found a few &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1644830-REG%2Fmsi_creator_z16_a11uet_045_creator_z16_i9_11900h_rtx3060.html%3FSID%3Ds164269797016847twa52417&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22893308%2Fmsi-creator-z16-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cheaper SKUs&lt;/a&gt; floating around other retailers) has a Core i7-11800H, a GeForce RTX 3060 GPU, a 2560 x 1600 touch display, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB of storage for $2,599.99 (currently listed at $2,349.99 for what MSI claims is a limited time). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aWpTE2"&gt;A comparable &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-laptops/xps-17-laptop/spd/xps-17-9710-laptop/xn9710cto220s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell XPS 17 (with a bigger screen, but lower resolution) has the same MSRP&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/16-inch-space-gray-10-core-cpu-16-core-gpu-512gb#"&gt;16-inch MacBook Pro with comparable RAM and storage&lt;/a&gt; is $500 more at $3,099. But the Z16 is certainly still an expensive laptop — a Gigabyte Aero 15 with the same specs is going for a few hundred less at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FGIGABYTE-AERO-15-OLED-RP75-Gaming-Laptop-15-6-4K-UHD-Display-Intel-Core-i7-11800H-Upto-4-6GHz-32GB-RAM-1TB-NVMe-SSD-NVIDIA-GeForce-RTX-3060-HDMI-Mini%2F452783099%3Fwmlspartner%3Dwlpa%26selectedSellerId%3D6418%26fbclid%3DIwAR3VVo1VMgOcREwjBEtQ5-ZiP05S--NO863uxASNtnePciCCDgkJTX4qdss&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; (though it’s sold out there as of this writing — there’s a 16GB &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fgigabyte-15-6-4k-oled-creator-laptop-intel-core-i7-11800h-16gb-nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-1tb-ssd%2F6463823.p%3FskuId%3D6463823&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;model at Best Buy for $1,899&lt;/a&gt; which you could easily upgrade). And it comes with some flaws that are uncharacteristic of a laptop of that price caliber. While I can see this product having an audience, those who can afford to spend more absolutely should. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI Creator Z16 seen from the back, half open on a wooden table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iv-EkrNwq8fvEu5Lu42IOUKJpvQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22996212/akrales_211105_4818_0024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;4.85 pounds, 0.63 inches thick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="riWUhE"&gt;The first thing to be aware of: this laptop is &lt;em&gt;loud&lt;/em&gt;. The Z16’s fans got going the instant I fired up Cinebench, and they trucked along throughout the entire benchmark run. The noise wasn’t audible from the next room over, but it was certainly loud enough to be distracting as I worked at the same table. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wt2Hvy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The world’s thinnest 0.1mm sharp-edged fan blade”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dnHZKZ"&gt;MSI has made a big deal of the new cooling system, which is said to contain “the world’s thinnest 0.11mm sharp-edged fan blade.” These fans didn’t seem quite able to handle the power of these specs, even with the High Performance profile (which optimizes the Z16’s power limits and cooling behavior for heavy workloads) selected in MSI’s control center. (This control center, by the way, has been much smoother to use than iterations I’ve had to use on previous MSI laptops, so props to MSI for that.) The Z16’s 30-minute Cinebench score was lower than the 10-minute Cinebench score, and the CPU was very consistently hitting 95 degrees Celsius throughout the benchmark. Basically, this wasn’t a MacBook scenario where the Z16 took whatever we threw at it with no sweat — it was working hard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHUMeQ"&gt;That heat wasn’t as much of a problem on our real-world Premiere Pro 4K export test, which the Z16 completed in three minutes and nine seconds. That’s a competitive score and faster than almost every Windows laptop I’ve ever tested. But the Z16 only got a 769 on the &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=73928"&gt;Puget Systems benchmark for Premiere Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which tests live playback and export performance. The &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=59189"&gt;Aero 15&lt;/a&gt; beat that handily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vBqNMs"&gt;Temperatures were more manageable during the Geekbench suite, and notably, the Compute benchmark, which leverages the GPU more than the CPU. Geekbench Compute, interestingly, was also the only test that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;MacBook Pro models&lt;/a&gt; didn’t blow the Z16 out of the water on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nTS7Cr"&gt;Overall, while the Z16 isn’t totally topping its category, you’re getting some real graphics power — and certainly more than you would expect from a thinner and lighter big-screen device. It seems like a compelling package — but that’s before we talk about battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The MSI Creator Z16 speakers seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JFy0rsQtde4mbXkqnkA0Pa3sd9M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22996219/akrales_211105_4818_0098.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s an audio jack to plug peripherals in, a well as four 2W stereo speakers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ExQl5A"&gt;The battery life is bad. Even on the Z16’s Battery Saver profile and with the keyboard backlighting and the GPU turned off, I was still getting under five hours of continuous work at medium brightness — close to four and a half hours on average. And my workload isn’t anything close to what this computer is capable of — I was mostly jumping around between a dozen-ish Chrome tabs and running occasional Zoom calls overtop. You should certainly expect less if you’re doing anything more demanding on battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5n3mHv"&gt;The Z16 just isn’t realistic as a portable laptop with this battery capacity. We wouldn’t necessarily expect a laptop in this category to last all day, but this result is disappointing even large-screened competitors. I regularly got between seven and eight hours out of the last &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327454/dell-xps-17-2020-laptop-review-display-test-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 17&lt;/a&gt; I reviewed. And, of course, even the more powerful 16-inch MacBook Pros last at least twice as long. We’re no longer in an era where hefty power means chopping hours off a device’s battery life, even for thin and light products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="a4erQ4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10987640"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3HBQr6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Z16 is generally a well-built and nice-looking device&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oip5VJ"&gt;Performance aside, the Z16 is generally a well-built and nice-looking device. It’s fairly thin, at just 0.63 inches thick. It’s sturdy with a comfortable finish — a step above most MSI devices I’ve reviewed before when it comes to build quality. The display, in particular, is gorgeous, and the 120Hz refresh rate makes scrolling a very smooth experience. Details are crisp — I had no problem sifting through a batch of photos for some light editing. I also appreciate that there’s a row of handy hot keys on the right side of the keyboard, which is slightly more convenient to reach than the function row.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The fingerprint sensor of the MSI Creator Z16." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/adPZBDcumGQ7odsvtVsgM-HAJO8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22996220/akrales_211105_4818_0110.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can log in with fingerprint or facial recognition.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8R7hdR"&gt;But the biggest pleasant surprise, to me, was the speakers. There are four of them, and they sound great, easily reaching the volume of a decent external speaker. I could hear both the bass notes and quieter midrange tones that I don’t usually hear from laptop audio. Did you know there’s some cute, subtle harmony in the first chorus of Harry Styles’ &lt;em&gt;Falling&lt;/em&gt;? I did not until I heard it on the Creator Z16 for the first time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XynTHG"&gt;These features, again, make the Z16 a solid machine for productivity and entertainment. But they may not be as important to the Z16’s target audience as some of its glitches. And there are a few dings that are surprising to see in a device at this price point. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The webcam of the MSI Creator 16 up close." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0pzaOXt6yUk84qHh4sAQ4e6X9Qc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22996218/akrales_211105_4818_0097.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s a kill switch for the camera, though I prefer physical shutters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IRatYC"&gt;For one, while the port selection should be fine for general use (two Thunderbolt 4, two USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A, one microSD reader, and a headphone jack, in addition to a DC-in for the barrel charger), there’s no HDMI. This may be inconvenient for folks who need certain external displays or tablets for their work — which is at least a chunk of the Z16’s professional target audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="w22KfZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10987655"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nDt1T7"&gt;I also had a terrible time with the keyboard on my unit. The spacebar would every so often not register my right thumb’s tap — my colleagues can attest that I was constantly sending Slack messages with missing spaces. MSI didn’t have a replacement unit available to send me but says it’s not an issue they’ve heard about before. Still, the fact that I received a unit with this issue makes me slightly worried about the durability of the keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vydO37"&gt;There’s also no 4K screen option. There are some upgradeability hassles as well — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqtJDLt2bO4"&gt;teardowns have shown&lt;/a&gt; that the RAM is a whole pill to get to due to the placement of the motherboard. And — most frustratingly to me — there’s bloatware. I was getting antivirus nagware popups as soon as I opened this thing, and I had to close all my tabs and reboot the unit in order to uninstall it. I complain when I see this kind of thing on $1,000 devices. It is unacceptable for MSI to be shipping $2,600 laptops with crapware preinstalled on them — it’s the equivalent of Hulu shoving ads on people who are shelling out for their highest subscription tier. While this won’t impact your experience long-term if you uninstall it right away, it leaves a sour taste in my mouth nonetheless. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The keyboard of the MSI Creator Z16 seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iiiyACoHnKV4ZgTvW6MVXq-B1vg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22996217/akrales_211105_4818_0078.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a miniLED per-key RGB keyboard by SteelSeries.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="3YLW8r"&gt;Ultimately, the strongest argument in favor of buying the Creator Z16 is the power it packs into such a thin and attractive chassis. Many workstations of this size, including the Aero 15 and the XPS 17, are noticeably thicker — and the MacBook, which is similarly thin, is also significantly more expensive.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="NqCSlZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The strongest argument in favor of buying the Creator Z16 is the power&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="IxzCad"&gt;But I’m not sure that argument is quite strong enough. The battery life, in particular, is a significant compromise for anyone who might want to use this away from their desk for an extended period of time. And given the number of other concerns I have with this device, which are really uncharacteristic in such a premium tier, I think &lt;em&gt;most &lt;/em&gt;people who are wed to this price point and don’t mind bad battery life will have a better time with the Aero, which we’d expect to deliver similar performance, but with a much better port selection and better reparability (albeit in a clunkier chassis) for even less money. Those who are looking for a general-purpose multimedia machine and don’t quite need the Z16’s power can expect better battery life and a more premium experience from the XPS 17. And folks who can afford to spend more money will get a massive improvement on all fronts from the MacBook Pro. That doesn’t make this a bad device, but it does mean it’s mostly geared towards people for whom thinness is the top priority. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Target is selling PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles right now (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2CMHHMgjMVLWGLrDplDgKh76rlE=/160x0:1881x1147/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70415579/vpavic_4261_20201023_0018.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VbUXCe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 8:23AM ET, January 21st:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Target has sold out of consoles for now. We hope you had some luck on your side today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kjqv1o"&gt;Target restocked the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-console%2F-%2FA-81114595%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=PS5Restock03252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;$499.99 standard PS5 console&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https://www.target.com/p/playstation-5-digital-edition-console/-/A-81114596&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsolerestock&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22612482%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD"&gt;$399.99 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt; but both are sold out, and now the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https://www.target.com/p/xbox-series-x-console/-/A-80790841#lnk=sametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsolerestock&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22612482%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD"&gt;$499.99 Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; is available (depending on location, and possible only via the $34.99 per month All Access subscription package). Unlike other retailers, Target doesn’t require an account or special subscription to access these restocks, so they’ll be dished out on a first-come, first-serve basis. Additionally, there is no queue system in place on the Target store, so your best best is to continually attempt to add the console to your cart and head to checkout as quickly as you can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqFnjG"&gt;Another potential avenue you could explore is downloading the Target app on your mobile device, which might just give you the edge you need to snag a console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OeUdjz"&gt;Don’t stress if you happen to miss out, as retailers generally restock at least once a week. We’re always on the lookout for the best deals, so make sure to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for bi-weekly highlights of all the best discounts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We regret to inform you that Apple now verifies anyone asking for educational discounts </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/50TLf-UapZYpyPMwke4yaxsqkbw=/0x0:1768x1179/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70415567/billboard_202101_intro.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U5Ies2"&gt;Apple has introduced a new verification process in the US to ensure that customers who want to benefit from its discounted education pricing are actually involved in education. It’s not clear exactly when its policy changed, but &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220108032348/https://www.apple.com/us-edu/store"&gt;at some point this month&lt;/a&gt;, some &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/s7g5t6/apple_education_store_now_requires_unidays_and/"&gt;Reddit users&lt;/a&gt; noticed that Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/education-pricing"&gt;education pricing page&lt;/a&gt; was updated to note that customers will now be checked &lt;a href="https://www.myunidays.com/US/en-US/partners/appleeducationstore/spotlight/online"&gt;by Unidays&lt;/a&gt;, a third-party verification service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOJnNg"&gt;As well as requiring Unidays, Apple is also placing new limits on how many items you can buy with an educational discount. &lt;a href="https://appletrack.com/apple-tightens-education-discounts-with-account-verification-and-purchase-limits/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Track&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that users are limited to one desktop computer, one Mac mini, one laptop, two iPads, and two accessories per year. Given that’s more than any student, teacher, or educational staff member is likely to purchase for themselves in a given year, the limit seems to be in place to stop them from acting as an illicit discount broker for all their non-education friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Gasaqa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Matching a similar policy in the UK&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aLqaON"&gt;Requiring Unidays verification matches a similar process Apple already uses in &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/education-pricing?afid=p238%7Cs5Jg5FlGg-dc_mtid_187079nc38483_pcrid_349151339418_pgrid_15144757333_&amp;amp;cid=aos-uk-kwgo-edu%E2%80%94slid%E2%80%94bran-product-"&gt;some countries like the UK&lt;/a&gt;. Interestingly, as of this writing, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/ca_edu_93120/store"&gt;Apple’s Canada store&lt;/a&gt; is yet to be updated to mention Unidays, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/19/apple-us-education-store-verification/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZrydR"&gt;Although the change removes a loophole that was previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/27/17169108/apple-education-discount-how-to-new-ipad"&gt;ridiculously easy&lt;/a&gt; to exploit (apparently Apple didn’t even require customers to have an .edu email address) there’s surprisingly little outcry over on Reddit, with some pointing out that Apple’s first-party discounts are often beaten by third-party retailers during back to school season. Meanwhile, if you’re looking for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"&gt;good deal on a MacBook&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve got a page dedicated to that exact purpose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This controller turns your Android phone into a portable Xbox</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A good solution for mobile Game Pass games... or at least some of them&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="92GeMI"&gt;It seems unlikely that Microsoft will ever make a portable Xbox. Between Sony’s failure with the Vita, Nintendo’s dominance of the market with the Switch, and Microsoft’s device-agnostic business model, there isn’t really much need for such a product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPRfa3"&gt;That doesn’t mean there’s no demand for portable Xbox games, though. Microsoft has been pushing cloud gaming hard with Xbox Game Pass, as well as the ability to stream games directly from your own Xbox console to your phone. And even though a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22813749/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-touch-controls-stats"&gt;surprising number of players&lt;/a&gt; are doing this with touchscreen controls — I know people who swear by the touch version of &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;, believe it or not — it’s not an ideal setup for most Xbox games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ljy59s"&gt;That’s why I was interested to try the RIG MG-X, a mobile controller from Nacon. It’s an officially licensed Xbox controller that works with just about any Android phone, giving it all the buttons you’d find on a standard Xbox One pad. This should make it a good fit for Game Pass games on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yuk8Fx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10988921"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="237Ui6"&gt;Mobile controllers aren’t a new idea, and there are solid options for Android out there already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21285073/razer-kishi-review-game-controller-phone-price-nintendo-switch-stadia"&gt;like the Razer Kishi&lt;/a&gt; — including a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww2.razer.com%2Fap-en%2Fgaming-controllers%2Frazer-kishi&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F21%2F22894588%2Fnacon-rig-mg-x-review-xbox-mobile-controller" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently released Xbox-specific version&lt;/a&gt;. The RIG MG-X, though, has an appealingly straightforward design for a product category that can be a little awkward, which makes for a sleeker approach when coupled with the Xbox buttons. It’s nice not to have to think about which icons map to which commands; you can just naturally use the same buttons you’d have on a conventional Xbox setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMHOfZ"&gt;The controller has a gap in the middle that extends out to clamp around your phone, which connects over Bluetooth. Nacon says it should work with any phone running Android 6 and above with a screen up to 6.7 inches; I mostly used it with a Vivo X70 Pro Plus, which is a giant phone with a 6.78-inch screen, and it works fine. (It does not, however, work with iPhones at all.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="W1GS06"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bluetooth is a trade-off I’m okay with&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x73HKp"&gt;This is quite a chunky device, and it’s wider than an Xbox controller even before you extend it to insert your phone. That’s not necessarily a bad thing — it feels well-built and and I wouldn’t have a problem tossing it into a bag when traveling. The use of Bluetooth instead of a USB-C connector is a trade-off I’m okay with, because it makes for a more compatible design and ensures the controller can be used with the phone in a case. It does mean that you have to manually pair with the phone, though, and charge the controller itself over USB-C from time to time; Nacon quotes around 20 hours of battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcCHId"&gt;Overall, the RIG MG-X’s controls are small but effective. The analog sticks aren’t as big as a full-size Xbox controller’s, but they’re bigger than a Nintendo Switch Joy-Con’s and feel more satisfying to use. The face buttons are also quite small but tactile and clicky, while the D-pad is accurate enough despite being a little mushier than I’d prefer. I have big hands and I found the RIG MG-X to have reasonably good ergonomics over time for most games.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/13Ug_-3zq2hC3bJTSff4TluciaY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23184163/IMG_1854.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The RIG MG-X’s triggers are its biggest flaw.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GYgtaC"&gt;There is one exception, though, when it comes to the triggers. For some reason they’re unusually difficult to press in all the way, which is a big problem for games like racers where you need to hold them down a lot. A game like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820011/halo-infinite-campaign-review-xbox-series-x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; where you’re regularly making individual squeezes to fire weapons is okay, but I was wondering why I was losing so many races in &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; before figuring out that I didn’t have my foot pressed firmly enough on the gas. You can do it, but it takes more force than any other controller I’ve ever used, and it’s not at all comfortable for extended play sessions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DSpRO"&gt;It’s unfortunate that this isn’t a good &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; controller — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22769985/forza-horizon-5-review"&gt;you may have heard that it’s a pretty good game&lt;/a&gt; — but it does work well for most other genres. You can use it for non-Xbox games, of course, whether they’re from the Play Store or elsewhere — I played a lot of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; with it, and you even get native Xbox button indicators in the menus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3kwWJX"&gt;The RIG MG-X is a decent controller with a single big flaw, so just know what you’re getting into if you’re a fan of racing games. I happen to be one, so that was disappointing for me, and I’d personally go with the Xbox version of the Razer Kishi for that reason. But for lots of other Xbox games, this is a solid solution that gets you closer to a portable Xbox than ever before, and other than the triggers I prefer its design to the Kishi. This month Nacon also announced the MG-X Pro, which looks much more like a standard Xbox controller — hopefully the triggers are better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel selects Ohio for ‘largest silicon manufacturing location on the planet’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MTo7vDh3bfsIUEFVjwCzx67z9tc=/0x0:2012x1341/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70415296/Intel_fabrication_plants_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A render of the planned site.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Intel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HG5t08"&gt;Chip manufacturer Intel will spend at least $20 billion on a new chip manufacturing site in New Albany, near Columbus, Ohio, &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20220121005066/en/Intel-Announces-Next-US-Site-with-Landmark-Investment-in-Ohio/?feedref=JjAwJuNHiystnCoBq_hl-Q-tiwWZwkcswR1UZtV7eGe24xL9TZOyQUMS3J72mJlQ7fxFuNFTHSunhvli30RlBNXya2izy9YOgHlBiZQk2LOzmn6JePCpHPCiYGaEx4DL1Rq8pNwkf3AarimpDzQGuQ=="&gt;the company announced today.&lt;/a&gt; The 1,000-acre location will initially play host to two chip factories, and is set to directly employ at least 3,000 people and “tens of thousands” more across suppliers and partners. Construction is reportedly due to kick off this year, with the site becoming operational in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJik4O"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://time.com/6140476/intel-building-factory-ohio/?s=09"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said the company expects the site to become “the largest silicon manufacturing location on the planet,” adding that it could eventually expand to 2,000 acres with eight fabs. After helping to establish Silicon Valley, Gelsinger said the new site could become “the Silicon Heartland.” Intel plans to invest up to $100 billion in the site over the next decade, as well as around $100 million in partnership with Ohio universities, colleges, and the US National Science Foundation to foster new talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ex1tAp"&gt;Intel already has US factories across several states including Oregon, New Mexico, and Arizona. Ohio represents its first manufacturing expansion into a new state in over 40 years, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/21/technology/intel-to-invest-at-least-20-billion-in-new-chip-factories-in-ohio.html"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Intel has been aggressively ramping up its investments in manufacturing capacity under its new CEO, who’s already announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing"&gt;$20 billion expansion&lt;/a&gt; of the company’s existing Arizona complex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tu1Xw8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Intel wants it to become “the largest silicon manufacturing location on the planet”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5vpbQP"&gt;Expanding into a state without an existing chip manufacturing presence brings challenges, like acquiring the correct permits, raw materials and supplies, and production machines, the &lt;em&gt;NYT &lt;/em&gt;notes. But New Albany is known for its inexpensive land, and any manufacturing plant could benefit from engineering graduates at nearby Ohio State University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ed156"&gt;Intel’s search for its new manufacturing hub reportedly saw states competing for the huge economic opportunity a new plant represents. &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt; reports that at least one other state offered more subsidies, but Ohio was a better regulatory fit and Intel didn’t want to displace current residents. It’s a marked contrast from Amazon’s hyper-competitive bidding process that eventually awarded a second HQ to New York, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18224993/amazon-hq-2-queens-new-york-backlash-pulls-drops"&gt;it shelved&lt;/a&gt; following backlash from residents and local lawmakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GqrM0Rx-VODTtedCuhj-3Q-bS-c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23184255/Intel_Expansion_Ohio_1.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A render of the planned factories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SFczFl"&gt;The announcement comes as the world continues to grapple with an acute shortage of computer chips that has impacted everyone from games console manufacturers to automakers. The shortage has shed light on the decades-long shift of chip manufacturing from the US and Europe to Asian countries, particularly Taiwan where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) in headquartered. To help reverse the shift, the US Senate approved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22457293/semiconductor-chip-shortage-funding-frontier-china-competition-act"&gt;a $52 billion subsidy package&lt;/a&gt; for the chip industry last June which would offer grants to companies building new US factories, but it is yet to pass through the House.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qfD16R"&gt;Intel’s competitors TSMC and Samsung have announced new US-based manufacturing investments of their own in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21259094/apple-tsmc-factory-chips-arizona-a-series"&gt;Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22245325/samsung-building-chipmaking-fab-texas-taylor"&gt;Texas&lt;/a&gt;, respectively. But in some officials’ eyes, Intel has the advantage of being a homegrown US company, while TSMC’s proximity to China has worried Pentagon officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Faf5hc"&gt;“Today’s investment marks another significant way Intel is leading the effort to restore U.S. semiconductor manufacturing leadership,” said Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger in a statement. “Intel’s actions will help build a more resilient supply chain and ensure reliable access to advanced semiconductors for years to come. Intel is bringing leading capability and capacity back to the United States to strengthen the global semiconductor industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8Wher"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 21st, 5:39AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated with Intel’s official announcement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blizzard boss details what the studio is doing to ‘rebuild your trust’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_YecHwd3ghRYY1WyM9jml-58VpU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70414513/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blizzard chief Mike Ybarra posted a blog about the changes on Thursday.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YNXzeQ"&gt;Blizzard Entertainment, the developer of huge franchises like &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, has been under intense scrutiny since California sued parent company Activision Blizzard last summer over allegedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;fostering a culture of harassment and discrimination&lt;/a&gt;. In an attempt to assure employees and fans that the company is making positive changes, Blizzard boss Mike Ybarra &lt;a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/blizzard/23763775/putting-our-teams-and-players-at-the-forefront-of-everything-we-do"&gt;published a blog post detailing&lt;/a&gt; what it is doing to “rebuild your trust.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uBPUHs"&gt;At the top of the list is that executive and management teams will be measured “directly against culture improvement,” which means that their compensation will “depend on our overall success in creating a safe, inclusive, and creative work environment at Blizzard,” Ybarra says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHhjr6"&gt;He also outlined new full-time roles that have been created to help improve culture, including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wvo190"&gt;a Culture leader who will help us maintain the best aspects of what we have today, and change and evolve where needed to ensure everyone brings their best self to Blizzard&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3qvLT"&gt;a new organizational leader for Human Resources who will build trust, empower our teams, and help foster a safe, positive work environment for everyone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5FNnp"&gt;a Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&amp;amp;I) leader solely focused on our progress across multiple efforts in this area&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gtLCS4"&gt;Blizzard has also “tripled” the size of its compliance and investigation teams, shared representation data internally (which was not included with the blog post), set goals for improving those metrics (also not shared), and created an “upward feedback program” for employees to evaluate managers, Ybarra said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fymY4i"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're committed to more open dialog directly with the amazing player communities - not just from me but from all of our incredible teams. &lt;a href="https://t.co/5MUILlUCnS"&gt;https://t.co/5MUILlUCnS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Ybarra (@Qwik) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1484296085526827011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 20, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZcZ71D"&gt;Ybarra’s blog about these initiatives arrives under the shadow of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch"&gt;Microsoft’s massive deal to acquire Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft appears to have gone into the deal with eyes wide open about Activision Blizzard’s recent scandals, and Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer even nodded to culture changes to come in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889393/microsoft-gaming-ceo-phil-spencer-activision-blizzard-email"&gt;an email to staff&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="vUTkmS"&gt;We also believe that creative success and autonomy go hand-in-hand with treating every person with dignity and respect. We hold all teams, and all leaders, to this commitment. We’re looking forward to extending our culture of proactive inclusion to the great teams across Activision Blizzard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qBAE8m"&gt;It’s also worth noting that Ybarra was a nearly 20-year veteran of Microsoft before &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/10/24/mike-ybarra-joins-blizzard-after-years-as-xbox-services-boss/"&gt;he joined Blizzard in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UM0WtO"&gt;However, there could still be a lot of work to do to address concerns from Activision Blizzard employees. Ybarra was originally put in place as a co-lead of Blizzard alongside Jen Oneal after former president &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack"&gt;J. Allen Brack left shortly following the lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, but Oneal stepped down &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760136/blizzard-co-lead-jen-oneal-steps-down-mike-ybarra"&gt;just three months after taking the role&lt;/a&gt;. During her time as co-lead, Oneal “sent an email to a member of Activision’s legal team in which she professed a lack of faith in Activision’s leadership to turn the culture around,” according to a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report from November&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qx0jIL"&gt;Additionally, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/01/17/warzone-bugs-raven-qa-strike/"&gt;several dozen&lt;/a&gt; workers have been on strike for weeks to protest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/3/22816827/raven-software-qa-contractor-layoff-activision-blizzard-call-of-duty"&gt;surprise layoffs of QA staffers at Raven Software&lt;/a&gt;. And as &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; reporter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1484298295589675014"&gt;Ethan Gach pointed out&lt;/a&gt;, Ybarra’s blog doesn’t address demands from the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/abetterabk/status/1433466353726361603"&gt;ABK Workers Alliance&lt;/a&gt;, an employee advocacy group. That said, some Activision Blizzard employees are optimistic about the Microsoft acquisition, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-20/activision-employees-say-they-re-optimistic-about-acquisition?srnd=technology-vp"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rIFpPS"&gt;Ybarra also tacitly acknowledged Blizzard’s lack of recent big releases, a problem that was exacerbated after &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt; were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760118/activision-blizzard-delays-overwatch-2-and-diablo-4-again"&gt;delayed in November with no release dates in sight&lt;/a&gt;, but it sounds as if we could learn more about the studio’s games sometime next week. “We also know we need to deliver content to our players on a more regular basis and innovate both in and beyond our existing games,” Ybarra said. “We have some exciting things to announce, and I’ll be sharing more next week.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGqCWv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Casey Wasserman is on the board of directors for Activision Blizzard as well as the board of directors of Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n937KB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BVfVPl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHq3lt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is thinking about letting its creators charge subscription fees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lWtkbojXPZEVAg_famW1NG6jyKg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70414413/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;TikTok is testing paid subscriptions | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kcQ1ZV"&gt;TikTok confirmed Thursday that it is testing support for paid subscriptions, paving the way for creators on the short form video platform to charge for their content. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/tiktok-is-testing-paid-subscriptions?irclickid=zbUwjW3d9xyIWX6XC8ydcwL-UkG3-OWhIz0czs0&amp;amp;irgwc=1&amp;amp;utm_source=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_medium=cpa&amp;amp;utm_campaign=2334778-Linkbux&amp;amp;utm_term="&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company didn’t share details about when it might roll out to creators, how many creators are currently testing it, or what the pay structure might look like. Company spokesman Zachary Kizer said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the subscriptions were a “concept that’s been in testing,” and that it was “always thinking about new ways to bring value to our community and enrich the TikTok experience,” (whatever that means). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5cNx6"&gt;If adopted, it would be the latest move by TikTok to help its creators monetize their content; it introduced its &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/creator-next"&gt;Creator Next hub&lt;/a&gt; with monetization tools, and rolled out its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22811973/tiktok-creator-next-monetization-tips-video-gifts"&gt;tipping feature to eligible creators in December&lt;/a&gt;, after testing it with a smaller group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w4ZwA9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;if creators are holding their best content for subscribers, will it fuel the algorithm?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ujiTKA"&gt;How TikTok will add direct-to-creator payments to its highly successful business model is bit of a head-scratcher. The app’s major advantage over competitors is its uncanny algorithm that surfaces content to users’ For You pages. It’s a way for creators to reach users and ideally turn them into subscribers. But if creators are holding their best content for subscribers, that content is probably not available to fuel the algorithm, which in turn could reduce engagement, since in theory, it’s not being surfaced to non-subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHMz3m"&gt;This is not a problem unique to TikTok, of course; all digital &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22606291/youtube-shorts-fund-launches-100-million"&gt;platforms&lt;/a&gt; trying to help content &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22323398/facebook-stories-ads-stickers-creator-monetize-update"&gt;creators&lt;/a&gt; and influencers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423583/twitter-tip-jar-feature-sending-money-venmo-cashapp"&gt;monetize&lt;/a&gt; their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822042/discord-premium-memberships-creators-monetize-servers-feature"&gt;content&lt;/a&gt; are trying to balance engagement vs. letting creators monetize directly. And the creators themselves have to be able to predict what content subscribers will be willing to pay for, and what content will help them best promote their own work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTOrfZ"&gt;TikTok’s test of paid subscribers follows Instagram’s announcement that it, too, &lt;a href="https://business.instagram.com/blog/subscriptions-creators-instagram-recurring-monthly-income/"&gt;is launching a test of paid subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; with a small number of creators and influencers. Subscribers will pay a monthly fee to access exclusive content from creators they follow, including Stories and Live videos. The different tiers will range in price from $0.99 to $99.99 per month depending what the creator decides to charge, and a purple badge will denote a subscriber’s status to the creator/influencer in the comments section. Meta-owned Instagram says it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891722/instagram-paid-subscriptions-test"&gt;doesn’t plan to take a cut&lt;/a&gt; of creators’ subscription revenue until next year at the earliest. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="e9iUjq"&gt;Hold on to your jumpsuits — Netflix’s wildly popular &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; series has been confirmed by the company for a second season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNODlK"&gt;During its fourth-quarter earnings call Thursday, Netflix’s co-CEO and chief content officer Ted Sarandos confirmed that the Korean miniseries is returning. Asked by Nidhi Gupta of Fidelity Management and Research whether the viewers would get a second season of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22723452/netflix-squid-game-biggest-ever-show-at-launch"&gt;Netflix’s most popular series&lt;/a&gt; ever, Sarados said there’s more grisly action to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="endAPG"&gt;“Absolutely,” he responded. “The &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; universe has just begun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGohEz"&gt;Previously, Hwang Dong-hyuk confirmed that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772170/squid-game-season-two-netflix-director-confirms"&gt;series would return&lt;/a&gt;, adding that he was in the “planning process.” Sarandos didn’t elaborate on &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; the series will return, or what an expanded &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt; universe would look like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc4ihl"&gt;But if the series gets the full &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; treatment, that could potentially expand to gaming and more. (Netflix has repeatedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22772589/netflix-video-games-app-news-updates"&gt;hammered home&lt;/a&gt; that gaming is core to its business strategy moving forward.) &lt;em&gt;Squid Game &lt;/em&gt;already has its &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.shop/collections/shop-squid-game-merchandise"&gt;own merch line&lt;/a&gt; and Funko Pop collectibles in the Netflix Shop. A new Bape collaboration is slated to drop Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhfX2j"&gt;Bring on the games.&lt;/p&gt;
