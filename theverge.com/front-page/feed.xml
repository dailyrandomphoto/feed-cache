  &lt;p id="Lhezox"&gt;If you are looking for a smartphone with a good camera but don’t want to spend a ton of money, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1615542-REG%2Fgoogle_ga1296_us_pixel_3_xl_64gb.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo is selling a 64GB unlocked Google Pixel 3 XL for $300&lt;/a&gt;. The phone was released in late 2018, but it is still a solid contender for people who prefer Google smartphones and want a camera that offers solid image quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIRiCl"&gt;The Google Pixel 3 XL includes a 6-inch QHD OLED screen display, a 12.2MP dual-pixel camera on the back, and two 8MP front-facing cameras. While this phone is almost three years old, it does come equipped with the latest Android 11 OS and will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200925/google-pixel-3-xl-discontinued-store-sales-phone-camera"&gt;also receive Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, which will launch sometime this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4DpoXd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295850"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j9zaOm"&gt;The Google Pixel 3 XL was one of the tech giant’s two flagship smartphones released in October 2018, with both phones being praised at the time for their front and rear cameras, larger displays, and clean designs. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200925/google-pixel-3-xl-discontinued-store-sales-phone-camera"&gt;discontinued both phones last March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aROE7p"&gt;For $300, the Pixel 3 XL seems like a great deal that delivers a ton of features and is ideal for people who are unconcerned about not having 5G support. If you’re looking for more information on the Pixel 3 XL, &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; Dieter Bohn gives an in-depth look &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17973484/google-pixel-3-xl-review-camera-features-screen-battery-price-photos"&gt;in his review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this report about the US military endangering passenger jets by blocking GPS  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cFo7x-GLuQcYwJCjvhIzea05-BU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68701377/acastro_200327_3953_boeing_computer_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3dR9wz"&gt;Mark Harris, writing for&lt;em&gt; IEEE Spectrum&lt;/em&gt;, has come out with &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/aviation/faa-files-reveal-a-surprising-threat-to-airline-safety-the-us-militarys-gps-tests"&gt;a chilling report about how military testing is leading to confusion among pilots&lt;/a&gt; — and sometimes putting them in danger. The piece goes into why the US military is jamming GPS in American airspace and recounts some of the times it’s almost gotten civilians killed. If you’re a frequent flyer or are interested in when military testing bleeds into everyday life, it’s well worth the read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cOzScM"&gt;The military is carrying out the testing, ironically, to help develop technology to counteract GPS jamming. To be fair, it’s an understandable goal, as the article details the troubles that pilots face when a technology they heavily rely on goes away. But when that happens, the pilot at least has visual cues and other instruments. The article also goes into how, instead of completely cutting out the pilot’s GPS signal, the testing can end up feeding the pilot incorrect information, leading to thinking they’re somewhere they’re not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUzjdr"&gt;Each tangent the article goes on reveals worrying new details, like how pilots are warned that testing &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be happening, often leading to smooth flights and a “Chicken Little” situation where pilots have heard false warnings so many times that they’re not prepared for when it actually happens. There are also hints that the problem may be happening more often than even the Federal Aviation Administration realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kdyitj"&gt;It’s some necessary reporting. Without the public being aware of the problem, there won’t be any calls to stop or bring greater transparency to the testing. When the military &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/15/14937904/declassified-nuclear-test-movies-youtube"&gt;carried out tests of nuclear bombs&lt;/a&gt;, it was at least obvious to people that something was happening, even if they were unaware of the radioactive particles (literally) raining down on them. Sometimes, pilots don’t even know that the military carries out GPS-jamming tests. So far, it doesn’t seem like the tests have killed anyone, but &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/aviation/faa-files-reveal-a-surprising-threat-to-airline-safety-the-us-militarys-gps-tests"&gt;reading about the close calls described in the piece&lt;/a&gt; is harrowing, and it’s definitely worth your time. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>No brand is safe from Fortnite</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Predator in &lt;/em&gt;Fortnite&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MbP9mO"&gt;Starting this week in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, you can have the Predator doing a Pelé victory dance while wielding TheGrefg’s gamepad pickaxe. On Thursday, a Faze Clan streamer played &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; with a Manchester City star while wearing Manchester City skins. The battle royale hit has long been known as a cross-promotional juggernaut, but developer Epic Games has recently taken things to a whole new level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YZmVh3"&gt;Just this season, which kicked off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21831926/fortnite-chapter-2-season-5-battle-pass-trailer-mandalorian-baby-yoda"&gt;on December 2nd&lt;/a&gt;, Epic has added:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="xVYhjX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22028767/the-mandalorian-fortnite-perfect-character-season-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars’&lt;/em&gt; the Mandalorian and Baby Yoda&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="a2gw30"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22151470/fortnite-god-of-war-kratos-skin-now-available"&gt;&lt;em&gt;God of War’s &lt;/em&gt;Kratos &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="n4ON2p"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166187/fortnite-master-chief-halo-the-walking-dead-the-game-awards"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo’s&lt;/em&gt; Master Chief &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="w8N0c7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/8Gto8WEmm4s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead’s&lt;/em&gt; Daryl Dixon and Michonne&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HcZdot"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/thegrefg-enters-the-fortnite-icon-series"&gt;A skin and cosmetics based on Spanish streamer David “TheGrefg” Martínez&lt;/a&gt; (whose reveal stream for the skin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225416/thegrefg-record-fortnite-viewers-icon-skin-reveal-eu-heretics"&gt;smashed Twitch records&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9wlk6O"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/predator-joins-the-fortnite-chapter-2-season-5-battle-pass"&gt;The Predator from the &lt;em&gt;Predator&lt;/em&gt; franchise&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="erW96j"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22231705/fortnite-soccer-skins-manchester-city-juventus-ac-milan-faze-clan"&gt;Soccer kits from 23 different clubs and a new emote based on soccer icon Pelé’s goal celebration&lt;/a&gt; (available to buy on January 23rd)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="a4IDPJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JnnXLixux3g?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zaWkCp"&gt;Crossovers like these are by no means a new thing for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite.&lt;/em&gt; The game’s last season was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402707/fortnite-chapter-2-season-4-marvel-nexus-war-thor-iron-man"&gt;a multimonth Marvel mashup&lt;/a&gt;, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21027970/fortnite-winterfest-challenges-presents-star-wars-skins-emotes-gliders"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21019726/fortnite-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-rey-finn-sith-trooper-skins-buy-now"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436283/fortnite-star-wars-x-wing-glider-epic-games-crossover"&gt;themed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/15/20966222/fortnite-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-crossover-event-stormtroopers"&gt;cosmetics&lt;/a&gt;, other real-world streamers added to the game include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21065235/ninja-fortnite-skin-announced-stream-tyler-blevins-available-date"&gt;Tyler “Ninja” Blevins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/loserfruit-joins-the-fortnite-icon-series"&gt;Kathleen “Loserfruit” Belsten&lt;/a&gt;, and there have even been concerts (and accompanying in-game cosmetics) featuring huge artists like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18234980/fortnite-marshmello-concert-viewer-numbers"&gt;Marshmello&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IgOHCv"&gt;To me, the crossovers are part of the continuing appeal of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; — where else can I play as Kratos and face off against Iron Man? — and each new addition helps Epic build the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21068938/fortnite-ninja-skin-icon-series-metaverse-tyler-blevins-ultimate-virtual-world-star-wars"&gt;ultimate virtual world&lt;/a&gt;. But the crossovers also give Epic opportunities to bring in more cash, which might help make up for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21409351/apple-fortnite-ios-iphone-reinstall-how-to-terminate-developer-account"&gt;game’s absence on iOS&lt;/a&gt;. The battle royale hit is free to play, so each new brand appearance is a chance for Epic to get people to pay for items from the in-game store or sell one of its seasonal battle passes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Atdue"&gt;Don’t expect the crossovers to stop anytime soon. The Predator just joined &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, but Epic is already &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1352239528711344129"&gt;teasing the arrival&lt;/a&gt; of Sarah Connor from &lt;em&gt;The Terminator &lt;/em&gt;franchise. That probably means there will be a &lt;em&gt;Terminator&lt;/em&gt; cyborg skin, too — and if there is, that means you’ll be able to pit the Terminator against the Predator in a fight for the ages. Just hope that Mando doesn’t butt in.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart will have the PS5 and Xbox Series X available at 3PM ET today</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SB1zrc"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/PlayStation-5-Console/363472942&amp;amp;sharedid=verge&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D21951328%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/443574645&amp;amp;sharedid=verge&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D21951328%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; have been on sale for over two months, and they continue to be some of the most desirable gadgets in the world — and extremely difficult to buy. If you are looking to secure either next-gen gaming console, Walmart will have both restocked on its website at 3PM ET / 12PM PT today, the company tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UNJSyj"&gt;Visiting Walmart’s product pages for the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/PlayStation-5-Console/363472942&amp;amp;sharedid=verge&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D21951328%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https://www.walmart.com/ip/seort/443574645&amp;amp;sharedid=verge&amp;amp;subId2=%5B%5Dvg%5Be%5D21951328%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, you should see a message showing that a restock is confirmed for today. Due to these consoles’ high demand, they will likely sell out quickly, so if you want one, now may be the time to shoot your shot and secure a unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="czJSzo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226833"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vxdnA1"&gt;Similar to restocks in the past, Walmart is exclusively selling both consoles through its website. It’s unknown when Walmart plans to sell either console in stores due to the pandemic. So if you want to buy either gadget and Walmart is your preferred retailer, you will have to buy it online for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AOTQqk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="svZ5Ki"&gt;GameStop also has small waves of the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5%2FB225169Z.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fxbox-series-x%2FB224744V.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; available today, in case you want to increase your chances of buying either console. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instacart is firing every employee who voted to unionize</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X6Wtvwj5YGzy6MC59PvKLh7CgN0=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68701278/instacart_shopper_produce.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YoNtpY"&gt;Instacart is laying off every employee who voted to unionize, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/7k9deg/instacart-says-it-will-lay-off-all-of-its-unionized-workers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The news comes as the company shuts down in-store operations at some grocery stores amid the coronavirus pandemic and doubles down on curbside pickups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3Q5TS"&gt;The layoffs impact 10 unionized workers at a grocery store called Mariano’s, in addition to other Instacart employees. The group in Skokie, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, voted to unionize last year with the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1546 (UFCW). It was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21122632/instacart-workers-union-vote-succeed-gig-worker-economy-labor-activism"&gt;a landmark victory for gig workers&lt;/a&gt; and represented “the first time employees of tech companies that rely predominantly on contract labor have formed a union to collectively bargain for better wages, benefits, and working conditions,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21122632/instacart-workers-union-vote-succeed-gig-worker-economy-labor-activism"&gt;according to my colleague Nick Statt&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2ltIc"&gt;Employees were in the process of negotiating their first contract when news of the layoffs hit. “These layoffs are totally discouraging for any gig workers who are trying to do something to make these jobs better,” one unionized worker told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;. They said they were fighting for health insurance and vacation time in their initial contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AUy03u"&gt;UFCW told &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; the layoffs will impact nearly 2,000 of the company’s 10,000 grocery store workers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rbacLY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The news could have a chilling effect on other organizing efforts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4FBfaA"&gt;The news could have a chilling effect on other organizing efforts by Instacart employees across the country. The company’s leadership has already shown its hostility toward organizers, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akw3z8/leaked-memos-show-instacart-is-running-a-union-busting-campaign"&gt;running a union-busting campaign&lt;/a&gt; that included bringing in managers to the grocery store in Skokie to convince workers to vote against the union.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Pf29a"&gt;Although the pandemic has changed the company’s in-store shopping model, it’s also brought a significant increase in demand for grocery delivery. This year, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/12/instacart-taps-goldman-for-ipo-at-30-billion-valuation-sources-say.html"&gt;Instacart plans to go public&lt;/a&gt;, an event that could value the company at roughly $30 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q723Ry"&gt;The company announced the layoffs in a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/shopper-news/introducing-new-instacart-pickup-retailer-models-d9d5ef56d46f"&gt;blog post about new grocery pickup models&lt;/a&gt;. Instacart said it would transfer some of the impacted shoppers to other grocery stores and provide “transition assistance” to people looking for work. “We know this is an incredibly challenging time for many as we move through the COVID-19 crisis, and we’re doing everything we can to support in-store shoppers through this transition,” the blog post says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tCM0eH"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;, workers could get as little as $250 in severance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4Q87p"&gt;Instacart would not tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; whether the union employees would be among those getting transferred. The layoffs are scheduled to happen between March and June, according to &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3MMZlC"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, an Instacart spokesperson wrote: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="x2TqWI"&gt;As a result of some grocers transitioning to a Partner Pick model, we’ll be winding down our in-store operations at select retailer locations over the coming months. We know this is an incredibly challenging time for many as we move through the COVID-19 crisis, and we’re doing everything we can to support in-store shoppers through this transition. This includes transferring impacted shoppers to other retailer locations where we have Instacart in-store shopper roles open, working closely with our retail partners to hire impacted shoppers for roles they’re looking to fill, and providing shoppers with transition assistance as they explore new work opportunities. We’re also providing all impacted shoppers with separation packages based on their tenure with Instacart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="h3bsSv"&gt;The statement was pulled directly from the company’s public blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xc7Yy9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wo4bAt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0Y10Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ajit Pai declares 3Mbps uploads are still good enough for you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z35RSZx7rcJNM2Qci9cVxLl58j4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68701097/VRG_ILLO_4341_American_Ethernet.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mim1El"&gt;Former FCC chairman Ajit Pai &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AjitPaiFCC"&gt;has left the building&lt;/a&gt;, but not without giving the telecom industry one last pat on the back: &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-annual-broadband-report-shows-digital-divide-rapidly-closing"&gt;in his final Annual Broadband Report&lt;/a&gt;, he decided that 3Mbps upload speeds and 25Mbps download speeds are still more than good enough for Americans (via &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/01/3mbps-uploads-still-fast-enough-for-us-homes-ajit-pai-says-in-final-report/?utm_brand=arstechnica&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_social-type=owned&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hq2arj"&gt;“We find that the current speed benchmark of 25/3 Mbps remains an appropriate measure by which to assess whether a fixed service is providing advanced telecommunications capability,” the report reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AEynJK"&gt;How come? Because the FCC feels that’s as much as it’s required to do by law: “We conclude that fixed services with speeds of 25/3 Mbps continue to meet the statutory definition of advanced telecommunications capability; that is, such services ‘enable[] users to originate and receive high-quality voice, data, graphics, and video telecommunications.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WKG2NV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Does 3Mbps sound “advanced” to you?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9Pmokv"&gt;I don’t know what you consider “high-quality,” but I know from experience that my 5Mbps upload speed, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;for which I pay $100 a month&lt;/a&gt;, doesn’t let my family “originate” much in the way of large video uploads or game streaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E504Mv"&gt;Those 25Mbps / 3Mbps speeds aren’t even minimums, by the way, because the Annual Broadband Report isn’t something meant to be enforced. It’s a benchmark by which the FCC determines whether it’s doing its job of helping to close the digital divide — where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;as many as 1 in 3 US households don’t have broadband internet access at all&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Currently, if a single ISP claims it can deliver a single 25Mbps down / 3Mbps up internet connection &lt;em&gt;anywhere in your entire census block&lt;/em&gt;, much less your home, the FCC considers its job done.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Oh, and the FCC doesn’t even audit those numbers! &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17882842/us-internet-broadband-map-isp-fcc-wireless-competition"&gt;It’s a “fox guarding the henhouse” kind of thing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7rc1PY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"In 2021, we need to fix America’s internet","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"},{"title":"The 84 biggest flops, fails, and dead dreams of the decade in tech","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029499/decade-fails-flops-tech-science-culture-apple-google-data-kickstarter-2010-2019"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5w3LeW"&gt;Some of the reporting loopholes &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/1822"&gt;are getting fixed&lt;/a&gt;, but the speeds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;and the ridiculous prices the US pays&lt;/a&gt; are not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CD5krc"&gt;As for Pai, who tops our list of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029499/decade-fails-flops-tech-science-culture-apple-google-data-kickstarter-2010-2019"&gt;the 84 biggest tech fails of the decade&lt;/a&gt;, he’s now free to find a lucrative job as a telecom industry lobbyist. Former President Donald Trump gave his entire administration explicit permission to do that, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029499/decade-fails-flops-tech-science-culture-apple-google-data-kickstarter-2010-2019"&gt;killing a five-year ban on officials lobbying their former agencies&lt;/a&gt;, on his way out the door.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super Bowl 2021 won’t stream in 4K or HDR this year — because of COVID</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Divisional Round - Cleveland Browns v Kansas City Chiefs" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yJ56i2QiSXAZW95f4HVO8xBSm7g=/0x0:2505x1670/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68700840/1297295211.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5OKcvV"&gt;The 2021 Super Bowl won’t be available to stream in 4K or HDR this year when it airs on February 7th, CBS Sports Digital has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The company is citing production limitations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic as the reason.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SigOwG"&gt;Last year marked the first time that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21060342/super-bowl-2020-4k-streaming-fox-hdr-10-hlg-formats-conversion-upscaling-chiefs-49ers-roku-amazon"&gt;the Super Bowl was available in 4K and HDR&lt;/a&gt;, but that stream was broadcast by Fox Sports, which had a lot more experience broadcasting 4K NFL games, having previously offered numerous games in 4K during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/26/20884246/nfl-4k-hdr-broadcast-first-ever-fox-sports-thursday-night-football-streaming"&gt;both the 2019&lt;/a&gt; and 2020 seasons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ds3ObC"&gt;CBS, on the other hand, has never offered an NFL game in 4K / HDR before. Given the additional complexities of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitating more remote operations than usual, the company had to change plans for this year’s big game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v6gGgu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Streaming will be limited to regular HD&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hBtGAW"&gt;For what its worth, though, even Fox’s streams weren’t in true 4K, thanks to the complexity of live sports broadcasts — which, for the NFL, involves dozens of cameras in multiple locations shooting different angles of the action, along with specialty slow-motion equipment. Previous 4K streams — including last year’s Super Bowl — were actually shot in 1080p and HDR, then upscaled to 4K for the broadcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IpHjLU"&gt;Despite the lack of 4K or HDR for this year’s championship, CBS Sports Digital is promising that it’ll be focusing on ensuring that streams are reliable and low-latency for this year’s broadcast, and that it remains committed to offering more live sports in 4K and HDR in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Edge gets new colorful themes, sleeping tabs feature, and password manager</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jkt5-8f8_Xuvoezp-jp4cLBizek=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68700591/E0rmVyN.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YkRQhf"&gt;Microsoft is introducing new colorful themes for its Edge browser this week, alongside updated icons and a new sleeping tabs feature that improves the browser and overall PC performance. To celebrate a year of the Chromium-powered Microsoft Edge, the browser is getting new themes available from the &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/microsoft-edge-themes"&gt;Edge add-on site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u87OiG"&gt;Themes range from simple colors all the way to &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon&lt;/em&gt; themes. These new themes will include colors on new tab pages, tabs, the address bar, and other parts of the Edge browser.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_y0b-7_ta8XGIl-p6VTajMLDhAE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22250349/microsoftedgethemes.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Edge themes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zOnzUC"&gt;Microsoft is also updating the icons used throughout Edge to better match the company’s Fluent Design system. “In our latest release you’ll notice subtle updates to icons in Microsoft Edge that are rounder and softer in appearance,” &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/01/21/this-year-lets-resolve-to-make-the-most-of-our-time-online-and-better-protect-ourselves-from-online-threats/"&gt;explains Liat Ben-Zur&lt;/a&gt;, a Microsoft executive working on the company’s “Modern Life” initiative. “This is just the beginning of our design journey and we’re already imagining how to bring Fluent design throughout our products. We can’t wait to share more of our vision in the near future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSIF0D"&gt;The general look and feel of Edge might be changing, but Microsoft is also adding in some useful features, too. A new sleeping tabs feature is rolling out now, and it aims to improve the browser’s performance. Edge will now automatically release system resources for inactive tabs when you have a number of tabs open, which will help new tabs run better or stop the browser from hogging memory and CPU resources in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mUl9dXxN4UR_YWCNzIV-h3It1RA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22250355/W10_20H2_Laptop_Edge_Password_Generator_16x9_en_US.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Edge password suggestions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="T0QuOn"&gt;Microsoft is also taking steps to roll out its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178026/microsoft-authenticator-autofill-feature-password-manager"&gt;new password manager&lt;/a&gt; features. Edge will start automatically suggesting a secure and complex password when you sign up on a new website or attempt to change an existing password. Edge will also be getting &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2021/01/21/edge-88-privacy/"&gt;a new password monitor feature&lt;/a&gt; that will alert you if your password has leaked online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBxDvq"&gt;If that wasn’t enough, Edge history and tab sync is finally rolling out to everyone this week. These features started rolling out to a number of countries &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22216644/microsoft-edge-history-tab-sync-features-available-rolling-out"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Edge users to finally sync their full web history and active tabs across multiple devices including iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PUBG adds a reputation system ‘to help keep things more civil while you kill each other’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/28upopmErbIbbyJVCixkTMapKXg=/0x0:1130x753/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68700587/6.reputation_1365x768.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;PUBG&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: PUBG Corporation&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fJ0H4u"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;’s latest update adds a reputation system intended to encourage players to be less toxic toward each other. Though, in a blog about the update, PUBG Corporation acknowledges the inherent irony of a reputation system in a game all about killing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLWqMo"&gt;“Keeping in-game interactions healthy is important to us,” the developers wrote in &lt;a href="https://www.pubg.com/en-us/2021/01/18/console-update-10-2-patch-notes/"&gt;the blog&lt;/a&gt;. “We know passions can run high on the Battlegrounds, but toxic behavior is never justified. To help keep things more civil while you kill each other, we’re introducing a new Reputation System to &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CheFJ5"&gt;The new system gives you a reputation level between zero and five, and your reputation will naturally go up “as long as you are not exhibiting toxic or otherwise disruptive behaviour.” Things that can make your reputation go down include abandoning matches and being reported for verbal abuse. Being banned for violating &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;’s terms of service can also reduce your reputation level, according to the blog.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ebz-f6DwAGXCfbLHo3Wz5IYrAM8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22250307/7._______1365x768.jpg"&gt;

&lt;em&gt;The reputation system in &lt;/em&gt;PUBG&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4hVtgX"&gt;The new 10.2 update also adds a new vintage sports car to the game, the Coupe RB, the ability to do random stunts in midair while riding dirt bikes, and more. You can read up on the new reputation system and everything else added to the game &lt;a href="https://www.pubg.com/en-us/2021/01/18/console-update-10-2-patch-notes/"&gt;in the patch notes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gaze in wonder at this astonishingly high-res scan of an iconic painting</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Girl with a Pearl Earring by Jan Vermeer" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrsYsDOrlGHSW29tOoM3AHucj7o=/0x463:3876x3047/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68700567/587831670.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by VCG Wilson / Corbis via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kSNtzz"&gt;For the past hour, I’ve been avoiding work by browsing &lt;a href="http://hirox-europe.com/PEARL/"&gt;this amazingly high-resolution scan&lt;/a&gt; of Johannes Vermeer’s iconic &lt;em&gt;Girl with a Pearl Earring&lt;/em&gt;. With a total resolution of 93,205 x 108,565, &lt;a href="https://petapixel.com/2021/01/20/astounding-detail-a-10-billion-pixel-panorama-of-vermeers-girl-with-a-pearl-earring/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PetaPixel &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; the scan is believed to be the first 10 billion pixel panorama ever created, allowing you to zoom in close enough to turn the tiniest flecks of paint into puddles and minuscule cracks into crevasses. The scan appears to have been posted online &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mauritshuis/status/1255068605378703360"&gt;early last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9WM5Ms"&gt;The Mauritshuis gallery, which normally houses the work, recently had to temporarily &lt;a href="https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/visit/plan-your-visit/#:~:text=In%20connection%20with%20the%20nationally,case%20until%2019%20January%202021."&gt;close due to COVID restrictions&lt;/a&gt;. But for the time being, this scan is a nice replacement. In some ways, it’s actually better, letting you press your virtual nose up against the painting in a way that’d get you thrown out of most art galleries or scolded by an irate assistant at the very least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="D0TqSj"&gt;The scan is the work of Hirox’s Emilien Leonhardt and Vincent Sabatier, who photographed the painting using a high-resolution microscope back in March 2018. Scanning the painting involved taking around 9,100 photographs of it using a high-resolution microscope before stitching them together. The resulting scan allowed the team to assess its condition, learn more about Vermeer’s painting technique, and understand past restorations of the work. You can learn more about the scanning process in the short video Hirox published below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="k4kYcM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cKaZYTwmjwU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gb2cdq"&gt;The 2D image is one thing, but where things get especially interesting is with &lt;a href="http://www.hirox-europe.com/PEARL/3D/"&gt;the 3D scans&lt;/a&gt;, which cover 10 specific areas of the painting like the subject’s eyes and iconic earring. These scans let you peer at sections of the painting from any angle and see that its apparent flat surface is anything but, thanks to the layers of dried paint that make up the painting. There’s even a small virtual light you can drag around inside the program to see how these surface imperfections cast a shadow over their surrounding area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E12ZaF"&gt;To learn more about what these scans and other technical research show about this painting, check out &lt;a href="https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/explore/restoration-and-research/girl-in-the-spotlight/"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; from the Mauritshuis last year. Meanwhile, the &lt;a href="https://www.mauritshuis.nl/en/explore/the-collection/virtueel-mauritshuis/"&gt;rest of the museum has also been digitized&lt;/a&gt;, with 36 masterpieces available to view in detail. &lt;/p&gt;
