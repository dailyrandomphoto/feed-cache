    <title>How to use a TikTok video template</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ofKmjHvNtJi45jo1x35-ReMsyxU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69571941/acastro_200713_1777_tikTok_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0eGeIz"&gt;You can create a great TikTok video by doing nothing more than simply talking to the camera. However, if you want to do something a little fancier or you’re still unsure of your own ability to spruce up your video, you can start with some of the pre-designed templates that come with the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BQ6x4l"&gt;Templates make it easy to create a lively, complex video — you just have to drop your own photos and / or videos into the template, and you’re done. (You can, of course, add your own text, sounds, effects, etc. as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n7EBR7"&gt;Here’s how to start using a template:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MD4uvw"&gt;Tap the plus sign at the bottom of the screen to start a new video&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VLNvDe"&gt;Select “Templates.” (You’ll find it next to the “Camera” label at the bottom of the screen.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tap the plus sign at the bottom of the screen." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AftiDiFU2s47DYxkATKv3djm27g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712905/Screenshot_20210712_100040.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tap the plus sign at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select the “Templates” link at bottom right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BRR9sFGdfhCJy2y7bIAC3asALTE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712907/Screenshot_20210712_100251.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select the “Templates” link at bottom right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ERfQ6Q"&gt;Swipe through the prepared templates that came with the app. Last I checked, I had 11, but the number can vary. Each template will have a descriptive name, and under that, it will tell you how many photos you can use with the template. Some will have a minimum and a maximum (say, two to five photos), while others will simply have a maximum (up to, say, five photos). If you see one you like, tap the large “Select photos” button.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OvAWL1"&gt;You’ll be taken to your device’s photos area. Don’t worry that you’ll forget how many photos you can use; you’ll find the number in the lower left of your screen.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Each template can use a certain number of photos." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qfMNafs5TTolj305S6SEjhRtBBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712911/Screenshot_20210712_132903.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each template can use a certain number of photos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select the photos that you want to include." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P4Ey88CGaR0gv3Dr14QvcrXvbVA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712913/Screenshot_20210712_101230.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select the photos that you want to include.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="wd4Zap"&gt;As soon as TikTok has finished processing the photos, they will be dropped into the template&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="CTWvmI"&gt;From here, you can make some additional changes. For example, you can add stickers, tweak the effects, or add a voiceover. The rest of the process of saving and posting a TikTok video &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22567211/tiktok-video-how-to-beginners"&gt;is the same as always&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It may take a few seconds to process the images." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-59_cNIu1U4MeRAlG_j2v-qqdeU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712917/Screenshot_20210712_101306.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It may take a few seconds to process the images.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once your photos incorporated into the template, you can continue to tweak the video." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Asxk9nDb5A5zsPw5mlfQ6lZ2eFQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712918/Screenshot_20210712_101448.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once your photo’s incorporated into the template, you can continue to tweak the video.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JnSowv"&gt;But what if you don’t like any of the templates that TikTok has supplied? There are a variety of free templates and tools out there offered by a plethora of companies and creators such as Zoomerang and Canva. But be wary: while these and other services may offer free templates, you may have to deal with watermarks, ads, or other add-ons that you might rather avoid.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s radar sensors could help Alexa monitor your sleep patterns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CHUs4soBbjDxzGo6t-uRmmQphgU=/0x0:6033x4022/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69571875/dseifert_4619_echo_show_2nd_gen_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tM42vx"&gt;Amazon is interested in using radar sensors to enable sleep tracking and gestures on its smart devices, according to &lt;a href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/070974410095/DA-21-813A1.pdf"&gt;new permissions&lt;/a&gt; granted by the Federal Communications Commission (&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/technology?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The implementation might be similar to how Google uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22331567/google-nest-hub-new-2021-smart-display-sleep-tracking-soli-price-specs-features"&gt;its Soli sensor in the second-generation Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="108ZEE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ecfsapi.fcc.gov/file/10622234731686/20210622%20Amazon%20Rule%2015.255(c)(3)%20Waiver%20Request.pdf"&gt;Amazon’s initial request&lt;/a&gt; to the FCC filed on June 22nd (and &lt;a href="https://www.slashgear.com/amazon-eyes-soli-style-radar-sensors-for-sleep-tracking-and-smart-home-12682096/"&gt;dug up by &lt;em&gt;SlashGear&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) claims that its planned use of radar would enable “touchless control of device features and functions without causing harmful interference to co-frequency users,” which could be helpful to users with limited mobility or speech impairments. The company also says that the new sensors can be used for “sleep tracking and could help improve consumers’ awareness and management of sleep hygiene.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CteslQ"&gt;Rumors first appeared that Amazon was building a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22216648/amazon-sleep-tracking-alexa-brahms-apnea-radar-device"&gt;“palm-sized” Alexa-enabled sleep tracker&lt;/a&gt; in January, with a specific focus on tracking breathing for users who have sleep apnea. The company also already digests and displays sleep data for anyone who uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;its Halo band&lt;/a&gt; (the one with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538610/amazon-halo-body-fat-percentage-accurate-study"&gt;the accurate but problematic body scanning feature&lt;/a&gt;). Amazon’s been expanding on the Halo app’s capabilities with a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22465737/amazon-halo-fitness-phone-camera-measure-movement-health"&gt;Movement Health feature&lt;/a&gt; analyzing flexibility that was released last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3VyZUe"&gt;Amazon’s request doesn’t spell out what an actual product with these new radar sensors might look like, but adding them to future Echo devices doesn’t seem like much of a reach, given how comfortably they fit on bedside tables. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review"&gt;In its Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, Google’s Soli radar sensors track sleep movements and breath in concert with microphones and an onboard temperature sensor. Buying in means allowing Google, and maybe one day Amazon, to stare at you all night but in a way that’s less invasive than a camera feed or wristband.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SecretLab’s Titan Evo chair claims to offer more comfort, features, and magnets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SecretLab Titan Evo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iGjXk7T1fJyQe6EkPsc_VqKq4jI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69571306/secretlab_titanevo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SecretLab says it has improved both its polyurethane and SoftWeave materials.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: SecretLab&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LvL4d2"&gt;SecretLab’s new line of 2022 gaming chairs have a renewed focus on packing in more features without significantly boosting the price. It’s also making it easier to decide which one to buy. Instead of offering both the Titan and Omega chairs, it’s cramming the best aspects of each into a single model called the Titan Evo. SecretLab told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it’ll  launch the Titan Evo in mid-July starting at about $20 or $30 more than the small-sized Omega chair, which is currently selling for $359.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ldoC1b"&gt;The company is offering the Titan Evo in small, regular, and extra-large sizes. And no matter the size you choose, it’ll come with the same new comfort and cosmetic features. It revamped the seat base to offer thigh support, and there’s a new knob on the left side of the chair that tweaks its new and improved “L-ADAPT” lumbar support system. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="SecretLab Titan Evo" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pp-WAka___Mu8_DC4Eltu8ognqU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22706690/secretlabtitanevoarmrest.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: SecretLab&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll be able to detach and magnetically attach different arm rests that you purchase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tq6lqK"&gt;Following SecretLab’s recent obsession with magnets in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405816/secretlab-first-pc-desk-magnus-metal-magnets-cable-management"&gt;Magnus&lt;/a&gt; desk, the Titan Evo has replaceable magnetic arm rests. You’ll be able to upgrade with more materials in the future, including Technogel. There are more magnets! The pillow that comes with each Titan Evo chair attaches to the chair magnetically. SecretLab emphasized that it was challenging to develop strong magnets in a pillow that didn’t impact its softness, or put wear on the chair over time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wc9VEF"&gt;The company is offering the Titan Evo in two new colors available with its hybrid polyurethane (PU) leatherette material: royal and ash, which are a blue and gray color, respectively. SecretLab says it has improved that material, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21401434/secretlab-omega-titan-softweave-black-fabric-gaming-chair"&gt;its SoftWeave weaving technique&lt;/a&gt;, to be more durable. It claims that its PU leatherette is 12 times more durable than standard PU leatherette. Also, it uses a new weaving technique to bring color gradients to what SecretLab is calling SoftWeave Plus fabric, which it claims has a 3.5x improvement in strength.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cryptocurrency traders struggle to sue Binance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cryptocurrencies Illustrations" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zsQD_nO_jJuKV7xiSxxXHOze-Wc=/157x0:2875x1812/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69571220/1233884318.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by STR/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dSvb6b"&gt;One fun (?) thing about cryptocurrency is that it’s newer than regular money — or as the cryptocurrency enthusiasts call it, fiat — and for this reason it is less regulated. I am going to leave the case against regulation to the libertarians who are interested in making it; instead, let’s direct our attention to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/binance-froze-when-bitcoin-crashed-now-users-want-their-money-back-11626001202?mod=e2tw"&gt;this &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; story about Binance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1fMRZ"&gt;Binance, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world, had a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388447/robinhood-app-dogecoin-rally-failed-trades"&gt;Robinhood-style&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171584/robinhood-outage-week-us-stocks-third-market"&gt; oopsie woopsie&lt;/a&gt; during a plunge in Bitcoin value on May 19. Users were locked out of the system, and couldn’t make trades to stop the bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="28k4Ut"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It seems like people are having a bad time!&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="95RTPe"&gt;Now, Robinhood users are suing Robinhood for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171584/robinhood-outage-week-us-stocks-third-market"&gt;March 2020&lt;/a&gt; outages, but Binance doesn’t have a headquarters — so it seems Binance users are having some difficulty figuring out how to sue. I’m not kidding, here’s how the WSJ phrases it: “But unlike a more traditional investment platform, Binance is largely unregulated and has no headquarters, making it difficult, the traders say, to figure out whom to petition.” There are apparently two groups trying to figure out how to sue this company, one in France working with 700 people and one in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InIBvs"&gt;This is horrible for the guy who lost more than &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/binance-froze-when-bitcoin-crashed-now-users-want-their-money-back-11626001202"&gt;$70,000 on Binance&lt;/a&gt; but it’s also amazing? [Taps forehead] &lt;em&gt;You can’t sue me if you can’t figure out how to serve me. &lt;/em&gt;Anyway, Binance claims it “took immediate steps to engage with users affected by the outage” and to provide compensation. The compensation, one user told &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal,&lt;/em&gt; turned out to be three free months’ worth of Binance’s VIP platform in exchange for, basically, letting the whole thing go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tW9q1M"&gt;It is maybe here that I should mention that&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/binance-probed-by-u-s-as-money-laundering-tax-sleuths-bore-in"&gt; the US Justice Department is investigating Binance&lt;/a&gt; for its role in money laundering and possible tax evasion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zKwMoT"&gt;There are a lot of things to get excited about with respect to Binance but for me, personally, it seems like a real-world test case of libertarian values. The company is relatively unregulated — at least, compared to most banks, which is what the exchanges are primarily recapitulating in the cryptocurrency system — and it turns out that means Binance basically can screw its users with total impunity. It seems like people are having a bad time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9a9pn5"&gt;Anyway, I feel sorry for the guy — different guy — who told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; that he lost $3 million because Binance’s app wouldn’t let him sell his position. Perhaps he will reconsider fiat as an investment vehicle.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft did door-to-door router replacements to stop Trickbot malware</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mMlGpjCiIhWNYZKAY9X1o03AGIw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69571210/acastro_180507_1777_microsoft_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qo3mOH"&gt;Microsoft says it’s gone door-to-door replacing routers compromised with the Trickbot malware in Brazil and Latin America, hoping to squash an international hacking group. &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/the-pentagon-tried-to-take-down-these-hackers-theyre-back?source=articles&amp;amp;via=rss"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt; reported the detail&lt;/a&gt; in an article about the group, which is an ongoing target for US Cyber Command as well as information security companies like Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbG5Ee"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt; reports that the hacking ring — also known as Trickbot and based in Russia, Belarus, Ukraine, and Suriname — is a persistent presence online. The group uses compromised computers as a massive botnet and runs ransomware attacks and other illegal operations. Trickbot is known to &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/10/trickbot-the-for-hire-botnet-microsoft-attacked-is-scrambling-to-stay-alive/"&gt;hijack routers and internet of things devices&lt;/a&gt; that are often easy to infect without owners realizing it. Eradicating malware from routers can be &lt;a href="https://www.cbtnuggets.com/blog/certifications/security/your-router-is-probably-a-zombie-in-a-botnet"&gt;particularly difficult for users&lt;/a&gt;, making in-person replacement a surprisingly effective tactic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxPSKW"&gt;Law enforcement agencies and companies have made some recent inroads into tackling Trickbot. The Justice Department &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/5/22520499/justice-department-charges-latvian-helping-to-develop-trickbot-malware-ransomware"&gt;charged a woman&lt;/a&gt; who allegedly helped develop it last month, and Microsoft boasted in 2020 that it had &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/10/20/trickbot-ransomware-disruption-update/"&gt;cut off 94 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the group’s server infrastructure, aiming to prevent any attacks on the US election. But Amy Hogan-Burney, general manager of Microsoft’s Digital Crimes Unit, told &lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt; that Trickbot remained a “continuing challenge.” That’s where the router replacement comes in — apparently as a partnership with local internet service providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTlJwM"&gt;Trickbot has been allegedly behind attacks on hospitals, schools, and governments, stealing login credentials and locking computer systems to demand payment. Microsoft’s door-to-door replacement operation is just one piece of the attempts to stop it, but it’s an interesting ground-level tactic in the malware fight.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok parent company ByteDance still holding off on launching IPO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="ByteDance, parent company of TikTok, may put its IPO on hold indefinitely" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1tUHBVs0gktvxmloWRC6Mcq6nmU=/0x1:5000x3334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69571103/1232551963.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="E7RqSX"&gt;TikTok parent company ByteDance is not planning an initial public offering anytime soon, and &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/bytedance-shelvedipo-intentions-after-chinese-regulators-warned-about-data-security-11626078000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; Monday that such plans have been “indefinitely” shelved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p8gCLn"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;reported that ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming made the call to postpone IPO plans in March after meeting with regulators who suggested the company should focus on data security concerns. Beijing-based &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-24/bytedance-hires-xiaomi-executive-as-cfo-while-it-weighs-ipo"&gt;ByteDance hired Shou Zi Chew&lt;/a&gt; as its chief financial officer in late March, which led to conjecture that an IPO may be imminent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8CIjD"&gt;“We don’t comment on rumors or speculation,” a ByteDance spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; Monday in response to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oTv3lp"&gt;The company has not publicly announced any potential IPO plans, and in response to what it called speculation in the media, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/bytedance-ipo-idUSL4N2MG3DW"&gt;ByteDance said in April&lt;/a&gt; that the company was “not ready at this stage and do not have IPO plans yet.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nPluwa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"WeChat deleted accounts of student LGBTQ groups in China","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/8/22568597/wechat-lgbt-groups-deleted-accounts-censorship-tencent"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6VGe38"&gt;Over the past several weeks, China’s regulators have been &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/chinas-tech-clampdown-is-spreading-like-wildfire-11622971802?mod=article_inline"&gt;cracking down on the country’s tech companies&lt;/a&gt; with a focus on anti-competitive practices, inconsistent pricing, and how companies and their apps handle users’ data. Earlier this month, Chinese ride-hailing company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/4/22562912/china-regulator-orders-didi-ride-hailing-app-removed"&gt;Didi removed its app&lt;/a&gt; from app stores in the country after the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) accused the company of illegally collecting users’ personal data. Didi &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/06/30/investing/didi-china-us-ipo-intl-hnk/index.html"&gt;went public on June 30th&lt;/a&gt; in one of the biggest IPO offerings ever of a Chinese company on a US stock exchange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cc0CdK"&gt;ByteDance and TikTok were among the Chinese companies targeted by the Trump administration via &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21358505/trump-tiktok-wechat-tencent-bytedance-china-ban-executive-order-legal-sanctions-rules"&gt;a series&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215961/trump-executive-order-prohibiting-transactions-eight-chinese-apps-alipay-tencent-qq-wechat-pay"&gt;executive orders&lt;/a&gt; that blocked such apps from US app stores. None of the orders ever took meaningful effect, and in June, President Biden signed an executive order &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525953/biden-tiktok-wechat-trump-bans-revoked-alipay"&gt;revoking the bans&lt;/a&gt;. Biden’s EO also provided a framework for assessing any national security risks that the companies and their apps might present. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use Apple’s Private Relay feature with iCloud Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BJ9c9nReExFghy0D1qAUuly2oT4=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69571099/og__ishslgdhhimq.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XNwXJ6"&gt;One of the more interesting new features available with iOS 15, iPadOS 15, and macOS Monterey is iCloud Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522998/apple-icloud-plus-subscription-vpn-scurity-wwdc"&gt;Apple’s upgraded iCloud subscription service&lt;/a&gt; that adds a few key privacy features. Chief among those features is Private Relay, a VPN-like service that’s designed to mask your internet traffic on your devices from anyone trying to snoop in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDxn53"&gt;Here’s how to use it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WR0wae"&gt;To start, you’ll have to be using iOS 15, iPadOS 15, or macOS Monterey and be a subscriber to one of Apple’s iCloud plans. All &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201318"&gt;paid iCloud plans&lt;/a&gt; — including the $0.99-per-month 50GB plan — are eligible, as are shared family iCloud plans or ones purchased through a shared Apple One subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdgVn7"&gt;Turning on Private Relay is extremely simple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="g9kVyX"&gt;On an iPhone or iPad, head to Settings &amp;gt; Apple ID &amp;gt; iCloud &amp;gt; Private Relay and then toggle on the “Private Relay” switch &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TTeoOd"&gt;On a Mac, head to System Preferences &amp;gt; Apple ID &amp;gt; iCloud, and check the box labeled “Private Relay”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dcwhq_PV63TgieTpsy7OMRDqLsI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712561/IMG_2946.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The toggle for Private Relay in iOS 15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iJtHa8bKqvJZ30MYqv9Drcr5GEo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712565/IMG_2947.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Private Relay limits masking your IP address within your existing country and time zone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D89MqC"&gt;Unlike most VPNs, Private Relay only offers one configurable option: the ability to choose your IP address location. Apple gives you two choices here: you can use your “general IP address” so that websites can still give you approximate location data, or you can choose a broader IP address somewhere in your country and time zone (which offers greater anonymity at the expense of more accurate online content). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xFMDzO"&gt;Notably, though, Private Relay still only lets you navigate the web through your existing (rough) geographic location, so you can’t use it for more popular VPN activities — like streaming Netflix content from a different country or skirting local sports blackout rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vnmLtG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s missing a few major VPN features&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qT2H4x"&gt;Apple says Private Relay is actually more secure than a traditional VPN, noting that traffic is masked twice. When you navigate to a URL in Safari, it’s first sent to Apple, which strips out your identifying IP address information, and then sends it on to a second server — maintained by an as-yet-unidentified third party — to assign a new, temporary IP address. The net result is that neither Apple, the third-party relay company, nor the website can track you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MYW61"&gt;There are some limitations to Private Relay. To begin, it’ll be unavailable in a number of countries: China, Belarus, Colombia, Egypt, Kazakhstan, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Turkmenistan, Uganda, and the Philippines. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/apples-new-private-relay-feature-will-not-be-available-china-2021-06-07/"&gt;Apple tells &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this is due to regulatory limitations in those countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YthMoV"&gt;In addition, Private Relay only works with Safari — not other web browsers or apps — making it a far more limited option than other VPN services, especially when combined with the fact that it can’t be used for dodging geographic location limits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnDmvA"&gt;But considering Private Relay is included as a free add-on for iCloud subscribers, it’s a nice addition, especially if you’re the kind of user who is more interested in the privacy benefits of a VPN for regular web browsing than more specific VPN use cases. The Safari-only limitation could help push users toward using Apple’s browser over competitors like Chrome or Firefox, too. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LeBron James is coming to Fortnite this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TATdPs7mC1fpd9IUPNPl5lzwPOA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69571048/LeBron_James_Tune_Squad.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bkWZ9R"&gt;LeBron James is the latest celebrity to enter the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; metaverse. Starting on July 14th, players will be able to purchase two different versions of the NBA star: a regular LeBron with a handful of outfits, and another modeled after his role in the upcoming movie &lt;em&gt;Space Jam: A New Legacy&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLkooR"&gt;The two skins, and their associated accessories, will also be available as part of a bundle. And both will sport the player’s upcoming shoe, the Nike LeBron 19. Even better: one of the optional outfits pays homage to a classic LeBron game day look from 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T6Xvfx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10648111"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0aqdhB"&gt;Rumors of a LeBron skin have existed since May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417523/fortnite-party-royale-lebron-james-zion-the-rock-epic-apple"&gt;when some of developer Epic’s plans came out as part of the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt;. Real-world celebrities have increasingly become an important part of the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; universe, including everyone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21065235/ninja-fortnite-skin-announced-stream-tyler-blevins-available-date"&gt;from streamer Tyler “Ninja” Blevins&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;rapper Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, the spotlight has turned to sports, with skins featuring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443608/fortnite-nba-uniform-jerseys"&gt;the uniforms of NBA teams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22231705/fortnite-soccer-skins-manchester-city-juventus-ac-milan-faze-clan"&gt;professional soccer clubs&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/25/22399880/fortnite-neymar-skin"&gt;stars like Neymar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wo2XJ9"&gt;The same leak that revealed a LeBron skin &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; suggested a skin based on The Rock could be coming to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, so the celebrity train likely isn’t stopping any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 will let you play games as you’re downloading them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MNaU-sne2wdELQdP-hgPzXMM_2k=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69571040/VRG_1777_Android_12_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wtuR7x"&gt;Google is announcing a big new feature for its upcoming Android 12 update on Monday: you’ll be able to play games as you’re downloading them. For particularly large games, this could be very useful, as it means you won’t have to wait as long to jump into a game and start playing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ketsu6"&gt;You can get an idea of just how much faster you might be able to hop into a game in the below GIF shared by Google. The difference, at least in this case, is quite noticeable, and Google says it is already “seeing games being ready to open at least 2 times faster.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YgXJsprL7GsPgM9QClLa4_Fdats=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22711564/ezgif_4_9c47602cb947.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bp7DjE"&gt;The feature works with games that use the &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/playcore/asset-delivery"&gt;Play Asset Delivery system&lt;/a&gt;. If they do, developers won’t need to do anything to turn the feature on, according to Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5d5w6"&gt;The news comes as part of the &lt;a href="https://developersonair.withgoogle.com/events/game-dev-summit-2021"&gt;Google for Games Developer Summit 2021&lt;/a&gt;, which runs from July 12th through the 13th. At the event, Google also announced a new game dashboard for Android 12 that gives you easy access to utilities like screen capture and recording. The dashboard will be available on “select devices” later this year, Google says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pexHoq"&gt;Android 12 is also set to bring a bunch of other big changes to Android, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;including a major new design&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SpDzvH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Authenticated brand logos in Gmail will roll out over the coming weeks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yai1whB5paxAA8vaen087siDmn0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69571036/acastro_180424_1777_gmail_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uYkZk0"&gt;Authenticated brand logos in Gmail, a security feature that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333886/google-gmail-bimi-logo-authentication-trial-brand-indicators-for-message-identification"&gt;first announced last July&lt;/a&gt;, will be rolling out over the coming weeks, Google announced on Monday. The feature is enabled by the Brand Indicators for Message Identification (&lt;a href="https://bimigroup.org/"&gt;BIMI&lt;/a&gt;) standard, which Google joined the working group for &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/google-joins-authindicators-working-group-and-commits-to-bimi-pilot-300890074.html"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDf3WE"&gt;The idea is that an organization’s logo will show up in your inbox when they send you an email that’s authenticated &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/a/answer/2466580?hl=en"&gt;using the DMARC standard&lt;/a&gt; to help reduce the likelihood that you’ll open and act on an email posing as one from a legitimate source. Ideally, the authenticated brand logos will function like a verified badge you might see on social networks that tell you that an account is actually owned and operated by the entity it claims to represent.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/irZdPPqzepb0ebxogN8-ROyDjE0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22712571/Mobile_Default_Camera_Move_B.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="E47pOy"&gt;Here’s how it works behind the scenes, according to Google:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="pogAMb"&gt;Organizations who authenticate their emails using Sender Policy Framework (SPF) or Domain Keys Identified Mail (DKIM) and deploy DMARC can provide their validated trademarked logos to Google via a Verified Mark Certificate (VMC). BIMI leverages Mark Verifying Authorities, like Certification Authorities, to verify logo ownership and provide proof of verification in a VMC. Once these authenticated emails pass our other anti-abuse checks, Gmail will start displaying the logo in the existing avatar slot. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Jnodfj"&gt;Gmail users won’t have to do anything to see the authenticated brand logos, the company says. &lt;/p&gt;
