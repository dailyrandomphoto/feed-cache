    <title>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier is a blueprint for the next decade of Marvel heroes</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sJXgK0"&gt;The season finale of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22337849/falcon-winter-soldier-episode-1-recap-explainer-marvel-mcu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has arrived, bringing an end to the latest Marvel saga and settling the legacy of Steve Rogers and his emblematic shield. But the show doesn’t just answer the question of “Who is the next Captain America?” It charts a path forward for the next generation of Marvel heroes — and it uses a solution borrowed right from the comics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mL9HmU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YofjSvvUefEa41ZgzxYD8ve0cuM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22464589/GER7005_102_comp_v001.1024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TvVtY2"&gt;As basically everyone expected, the finale of &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt; sees Sam Wilson step fully into the role as the new Captain America — complete with a ripped-from-the-comics outfit and a new title card at the end of the series for “Captain America and the Winter Soldier.” (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/1/5566896/captain-america-the-winter-soldier-review"&gt;Not to be confused with the 2014 film&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoFjkI"&gt;The six-episode series had its ups and downs; it rocked back and forth between high-flying action scenes, a meandering plotline, and portentous questions about legacy, race in America, and issues of global refugees. But the most important legacy of the show (which may or may not be getting a second season) might be how it solves one of Marvel’s biggest behind-the-scenes challenges: keeping characters fresh after almost a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZXHtj4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The obvious solution is to pass down the roles to new actors&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kgiUPO"&gt;Marvel’s films effectively operate as a gigantic-scale TV series, with a massive ensemble cast that comes and goes across different episodes. Those episodes just happen to be two-hour-long big-budget movies. And like any long-running TV show, it starts to run into the issue of keeping its stars on the show as the costs rise and fatigue or boredom starts to set in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dowjM9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iron Man &lt;/em&gt;star Robert Downey Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/07/robert-downey-jr-avengers-endgame-salary-1202156978/"&gt;cost $75 million&lt;/a&gt; for his final appearance in &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt; (compared to $500,000 for his first MCU outing), and Chris Evans was so burned out from being Captain America that, at one point, he declared a &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2014/03/chris-evans-says-he-will-basically-quit-acting.html"&gt;plan to quit acting altogether&lt;/a&gt; (although he hasn’t quite followed through yet). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/36phH4lXQPmLe24E13kBlJg_saY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22464600/TAG_102_11562_R_C.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chuck Zlotnick / Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2jQuo2"&gt;The obvious solution is to pass down the roles to new actors, much as the comics have done with Jason Aaron’s &lt;em&gt;Thor&lt;/em&gt; run or G. Willow Wilson’s reimagining of Ms. Marvel. It’s a good solution, keeping characters fresh or allowing for new spins on the idea of what, exactly, makes someone Captain America (or Iron Man or Thor). It frees up actors from being stuck playing Tony Stark until they’re 80, lets storylines resolve, and gives characters room to grow instead of hitting the reset button each film. (There’s also the helpful side effect of keeping Disney’s costs down by rotating in a new, younger star who hasn’t skyrocketed to fame through years of superhero films yet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="P4hixC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The perfect blueprint for handing down heroic roles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NDOSCd"&gt;In that regard, &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt; is the perfect blueprint for handing down heroic roles for the rest of Marvel’s universe. Sure, Disney could have just picked up in the next film with Sam Wilson wielding the shield that he got at the end of &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt;, but that kind of off-screen handoff would likely feel like a cop-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqJU4C"&gt;Instead, Disney devoted an entire miniseries to the transition. It explores how and why Sam doesn’t — and then ultimately does — choose to take up the shield, showcases different contenders for the title, and ultimately shows (instead of just telling) everyone why &lt;em&gt;Sam,&lt;/em&gt; in particular, is the right choice. Even more importantly, it gives fans &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; with Sam in a way his previous bows as Steve Rogers’ sidekick didn’t quite allow for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRSCmt"&gt;It’s the kind of strategy that Marvel is already gearing up to employ for other future second-generation Avengers. Later this year, we’ll see &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; hit Disney Plus, which looks to deal with a similar inheritance of Clint Barton’s role to Hailee Steinfeld’s Kate Bishop. The &lt;em&gt;Ironheart&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Armor Wars&lt;/em&gt; shows set to stream in the coming years will look to explore a similar shift of Tony Stark’s legacy to War Machine and Riri Williams. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Iron Man Suit (source: Paramount Pictures)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yrSZQwdqRlCfecpahdcsf9X8IX0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14619916/iron-man.1419980327.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Paramount Pictures&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OpmovB"&gt;Even the films are looking to get in on the action: &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; is rumored to &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2020/07/black-widow-florence-pugh-more-mcu-movies-1234571414/"&gt;see Florence Pugh take over the title&lt;/a&gt; of Scarlett Johansson’s Russian super-spy, and &lt;em&gt;Thor: Love and Thunder&lt;/em&gt; will see Natalie Portman wield the hammer as the new god of thunder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mh1EXw"&gt;Giving these character changes room to breathe doesn’t just make for better storytelling, either; it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22229076/wandavision-marvel-studios-disney-plus-streaming-loki-falcon-winter-solider-black-widow-theatrical"&gt;furthers the interconnectedness of the MCU’s storyline&lt;/a&gt;, making each subsequent show and movie a must-watch to understand the next one. And much like the first decade of the Marvel universe, it’s easy to see how Kevin Feige’s Marvel Studios could bring all of these new heroes together for the kind of box office-shattering crossovers the Marvel films are known for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmj0ZG"&gt;After all, if it worked the first time, there’s no reason why Marvel can’t pull off the same trick with a new and more diverse generation of heroes again. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Humble extends its Spring Into VR Bundle into next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Job Simulator" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r1XQLGPQcEcr-bF4m5UF1zuUkhM=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69175228/job-simulator-htc-vive-adi-robertson.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Job Simulator, HTC Vive&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Oif4zu"&gt;Last week, Humble launched its &lt;a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/spring-into-vr-bundle?partner=VoxMedia"&gt;Spring Into VR Bundle&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a pack of games for use with a virtual reality headset. Originally set to end on April 21st, the company has decided to extend the deal until April 28th, giving you more time to take advantage of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBS2M9"&gt;You can pay as little as $1 to receive one game or pay at least $15 to unlock all eight games available in the pack — once you’ve paid, you’ll get keys that you redeem on Steam. The bundle contains the following games, all of which are compatible with wired headsets that support Steam VR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qVyD9y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borderlands 2 VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="exIXJx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Job Simulator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="O4DlSk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sairento VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IrOCET"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Bridge Crew&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="s1MEuE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surgeon Simulator: Experience Reality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QpvZ4N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Swords of Gurrah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="APjjZg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Espire VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VoNmmA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detached&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="jAQ8br"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10461935"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ys0zRX"&gt;If you have been keeping up with the news about next-gen consoles, you will know that it is extremely difficult to purchase any next-gen gaming system. This includes not only the PS5, but some of its accessories, like the HD Camera.  If you managed to get your hands on a PS5 and are looking to buy this camera accessory, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1595098-REG%2Fsony_3005726_hd_camera_for_playstation.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo has the product in stock and has knocked $10 off its original price&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $50. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nbqEF5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562900"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x1DfUC"&gt;While we are on the topic of PS5 accessories on sale, the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1595096-REG%2Fsony_3005715_dualsense_wireless_controller.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DualSense controller is back down to its lowest price&lt;/a&gt; of $60 at B&amp;amp;H Photo. When you purchase a PS5, it includes one DualSense controller, but if you plan to share this console with other people or play local co-op games with friends and family, you’re going to want to purchase an extra controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EjTg5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562878"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7r5lMU"&gt;Finally, at our sister site, &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/strategist/article/the-strategist-two-day-actually-good-sale.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Strategist&lt;/em&gt;'s Two-Day (Actually Good) Sale&lt;/a&gt; is underway. The two-day event contains deals on over 40 items selected by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Strategist&lt;/em&gt;'s editors. One highlight is Sony’s WH-1000XM4 headphones, which are marked down to $268 from $348 at B&amp;amp;H Photo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Wg6UGp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Honda will phase out gas-powered cars by 2040</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Honda e Prototype" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M0vVt3aAmSS1VegWNB8yZEIb790=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69175187/geneva_honda_eprototype_vladsavov33.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vlad Savov / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4lFvha"&gt;Honda said it will stop selling gas-powered vehicles by 2040. The automaker expects 40 percent of its sales globally to be comprised of battery-electric and fuel-cell vehicles by 2030, followed by 80 percent in 2035, and 100 percent of sales by 2040. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orTqvi"&gt;Honda is the latest car company to commit to an all-electric future, with General Motors, Ford, Volkswagen, Volvo, and others making similar promises in recent months. Honda also said it would “strive to realize carbon neutrality for all products and corporate activities” by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="krbdpv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I believe it is the responsibility of an automaker to achieve our carbon-free goal on a ‘tank-to-wheel’ basis”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jTBF8i"&gt;The announcement came from Honda’s new CEO, Toshihiro Mibe, who took the helm in April. Speaking at a press conference, Mibe said that Honda was committed to helping Japan’s government reach its climate goal of a 46 percent reduction in emissions by 2030. “I believe it is the responsibility of an automaker to achieve our carbon-free goal on a ‘tank-to-wheel’ basis,” Mibe said, according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QIAkzI"&gt;Mibe said Honda will invest a total of about 5 trillion yen ($46.3 billion) in research and development initiatives, including electrification, over the next six years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hg00dJ"&gt;Honda’s current electric lineup is limited. The automaker recently &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2020/03/09/honda-clarity-electric-vehicle-killed-honda-discontinues-ev/5001659002/"&gt;discontinued its Clarity EV&lt;/a&gt;, though it will continue to sell hydrogen and plug-in hybrid versions of the vehicle. Its Honda E electric city car started selling in Europe last summer. Honda also has plans to work with GM on the release of two new EVs, using the American company’s modular vehicle platform. And Honda has said it would release two electric SUVs in North America, but not until 2024. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbqDcr"&gt;Honda’s electrification strategy will also extend to its lineup of motorcycles and scooters. The company plans to release three new electric models “in the area of personal use” by 2024, as well as an electric motorcycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FG5GHK"&gt;Japanese automakers — Toyota in particular — once were the leaders in hybrid vehicles but have lagged behind American companies in the all-electric vehicle market in recent years. But with California banning sales of new internal-combustion engine vehicles by 2035, and the Biden administration moving toward taking the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249237/biden-electric-vehicle-government-fleet-ev"&gt;government vehicle fleet all-electric&lt;/a&gt; along with other plans to reduce emissions, automakers have their EV work cut out for them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nier: Replicant is a second chance for a fascinating and flawed game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kmFjX7ZKIucKtrwOJK1D4BWH27k=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69174921/NIERRV1P2_SS_EV_KAINE.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x7TpGT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nier: Replicant&lt;/em&gt; is a shape-shifter. It makes you think it’s a simple action roleplaying game set in a bleak fantasy universe, but steadily reveals itself to be a lot more. It’s a game that shifts wildly in both tone and play style. It’s weird and heartbreaking, frustrating and playful, often all at the same time. This release is also a second chance for a game that failed to reach a big audience when it first launched in 2010, now updated for modern tastes. It still requires a little patience — but it’s worth putting up with some clunky gameplay to find all that &lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt; has to offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="42Qzeu"&gt;If the &lt;em&gt;Nier&lt;/em&gt; name sounds familiar, it’s probably because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/10/14875244/nier-automata-review-ps4-steam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nier: Automata&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a 2017 action-RPG from director Yoko Taro and studio PlatinumGames that became a surprise hit. Its blend of tight action, haunting storytelling, and downright absurdity helped it reach an audience of more than 5 million players. It also renewed interest in the original &lt;em&gt;Nier&lt;/em&gt;, hence this new release, which has been given the incredibly awkward-but-fitting title &lt;em&gt;Nier Replicant ver.1.22474487139… &lt;/em&gt;This version isn’t exactly a full remake but instead an updated version that sands off some of the original’s rough edges.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4O-ISWLHZu0ibRDNvFZt3bjEUb8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22464422/NIERRV1P2_SS_EV_EMIL.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U6Me9d"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt; is not an easy game to explain. The story starts out in the near future, where some kind of plague is decimating humanity; it then fast-forwards a few thousand years into a future when the world is pretty much unrecognizable. There are elements of a traditional post-apocalyptic landscape, like the ruins of our society, but the world of &lt;em&gt;Nier&lt;/em&gt; more closely resembles a fantasy realm with magic and monsters and lots of big swords.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f4XGU5"&gt;The fascinating world is a large part of the appeal, and you’ll spend a lot of time crisscrossing it over the course of &lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt;. It’s bleak and desolate, with small pockets of humanity still surviving. The game puts you in the role of a young fighter on a desperate mission to cure his sister, who’s struggling from a strange and mysterious disease that’s steadily spreading throughout the world, which &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; happens to be dealing with an onslaught of dark monsters called shades. It’s a dangerous place, and you’re eventually joined by a cast of characters including a talking spell book, a warrior perpetually dressed in lingerie, and a young boy with magical powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="skOjck"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1899294"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ATrxgx"&gt;In some ways, &lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt; is like a traditional fantasy RPG. You’re on an epic quest — which eventually includes not only finding a cure but fighting the big baddie in charge of all the monsters — and along the way you’ll acquire new abilities and weapons. But those aren’t the things that make &lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt; interesting. It’s when the game goes in unexpected directions that it’s at its best. You’ll visit strange towns, including one where the residents strictly follow thousands of rules, and another where everyone refuses to leave their homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJoclZ"&gt;The most jarring moments, though, are when the game shifts genres. That includes exploring an underground research facility as if you were playing an isometric RPG like &lt;em&gt;Diablo&lt;/em&gt;, and slinking your way through a &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt;-style haunted mansion. At one point, &lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt; basically becomes a novel where you read through a town’s shared hallucination. When the game returns to its standard action setup, it’s like waking up from a surreal dream.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H0U7VDjVrnGhQiGZNFHhOaAfuvE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22464423/01.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vbSnEi"&gt;I didn’t play the original &lt;em&gt;Nier&lt;/em&gt;, so the most that I can say about the changes in this new version is that the game now feels a lot like &lt;em&gt;Automata&lt;/em&gt; — which is to say it’s a mostly modern action game with fast and frantic combat, massive bosses, and an appropriately dreary world to explore. But despite the revamped visuals and gameplay, &lt;em&gt;Replicant &lt;/em&gt;still has some dated elements. For one thing, it’s very repetitive; you’ll be going on a lot of fetch quests and fighting countless, nearly identical shades along the way. These quests are often interesting narratively, but there are only so many times you can run across the same open field before it starts to get dull, especially since the game often forces you to revisit locations multiple times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4WASNe"&gt;It’s worth pushing through those mundane moments, though, because much like &lt;em&gt;Automata&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt; is absolutely packed with fascinating, heartbreaking moments. There are big, obvious ones — characters sacrificing themselves for their friends or the torture of watching someone struggle with illness — but at times it feels like every moment in &lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt; is tinged with sadness. There are twists that will make you question your own actions, and others that will completely change how you view a character. Hell, even the weapons have interesting stories; each new sword you get comes with its own brief snippet of lore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T6I9re"&gt;It’s this heartfelt element that makes &lt;em&gt;Replicant&lt;/em&gt; worth experiencing (multiple times, if you want the full story). It may be clunky in places, and uncomfortable in others, but once you settle into its strange rhythm, there’s really nothing else like it — well, aside from &lt;em&gt;Automata&lt;/em&gt;. But this is exactly what you should play if you’re craving more of Taro’s unique vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rSTTUH"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Nier: Replicant &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is out now on the PS4, Xbox One, and Steam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple AirTags and purple iPhone 12 are now available for preorder</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q1LYDo"&gt;Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;Tile-like AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, long-rumored and finally announced at this week’s Spring Loaded event, are now available for preorder on Apple’s website. The small circular trackers work with Apple’s “Find My” app on iOS and have a built-in speaker, accelerometer, Bluetooth LE, and a replaceable battery. They cost &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-airtag%2Fairtag&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;$29 for one set&lt;/a&gt; or $99 for a four-pack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ni2m3L"&gt;Apple says the AirTags’ battery should be good for a year. They should start delivering between May 3rd and May 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Qp0xO"&gt;The existence of AirTags first became known nearly two years ago, in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/30/20841204/ios13-code-apple-tile-location-tracking-tag-find-my-app"&gt;copies of the iOS 13 beta&lt;/a&gt;. Apple accidentally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21205994/apple-airtags-name-confirmed-tile-tracker-rumor-leak"&gt;confirmed the AirTags name&lt;/a&gt; in a support video last year that has since been deleted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DIeNW8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"AirTag location trackers are smart, capable, and very Apple","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="fi1d3g"&gt;Also revealed at Spring Loaded was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22396502/purple-iphone-12-color-photos-shade-hue-lilac-lavender"&gt;new purple iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;. It’s identical to the other colors of the iPhone 12; it’s very fast, has a very nice screen, 5G, and great cameras, according to our review. It’s also available for &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-iphone%2Fiphone-12&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;preorder today on Apple’s website&lt;/a&gt; and will be widely available starting April 30th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Evercade is making a retro console for your TV called the VS</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Evercade VS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b69TnBz18Vaa5aQz5KSBUzYhydE=/1x0:3508x2338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69174631/evercadevslede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Evercade VS can stow two of the company’s proprietary cartridges at once.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Evercade&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WaWc8E"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21271988/evercade-retro-games-handheld-review-classic-atari-namco-interplay"&gt;Evercade handheld that released in 2020&lt;/a&gt; can connect to your TV through its Mini HDMI port, but its 4.3-inch screen proves it was designed more for retro gaming on the go. Now, there’s a version of the Evercade just for your TV. It’s called the &lt;a href="https://evercade.co.uk/vs"&gt;Evercade VS&lt;/a&gt;, and it can output retro games at 1080p, delivering “top-of-the-line emulation,” with support for up to four wired USB controllers for multiplayer in games. It’ll cost $99.99 when it launches on November 3rd, 2021, and preorders start on May 28th, 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vf9krI"&gt;Crucially, the Evercade VS will be able to play games from the same kind of proprietary cartridges used by the handheld, and this home console can store two at a time under the NES-style flap that opens at its top. Each cartridge allows for save and load states in its updated user interface, and you can pick up where you left off by swapping them between the Evercade VS and the Evercade handheld if you own both. In terms of visual options, it will support 4:3, “pixel perfect,” or full-screen modes as well as the option for scan line filters. The company says the handheld will receive these interface features in an update by the end of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Evercade Vs" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A-fL2wiNCXGkZUFtb5hVvT0W46k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22462767/evercadevskit.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Evercade&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IQQ8Im"&gt;Evercade will release its own controller, but you can use other USB controllers, including the Xbox Adaptive Controller, 8BitDo’s wireless controllers that have USB wireless receivers, and likely many others. Even the Evercade handheld can serve as a controller if you purchase a link cable. The console will include a Micro USB power cable but not a wall adapter. It also won’t include an HDMI cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lPIMt"&gt;This cross-device approach to the Evercade platform seems well-thought-out. Letting you take the games out of your handheld and pop them in the VS to play on TV is a power play for any kind of proprietary format, especially from a small company that’s paying IP holders a licensing fee for games that it writes to cartridge. That’s notable (and even commendable), but this approach has hit its first major snag in the jump to the home console: some of the Evercade’s most popular retro titles won’t work on the VS. Specifically, the two cartridges featuring Namco Museum collections are licensed exclusively for use on handheld, so the VS simply cannot play &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Dig Dug&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Galaga&lt;/em&gt;, and the other games built into those cartridges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjKqsp"&gt;Blaze Entertainment expects to have over 280 games available to play on its Evercade ecosystem by the end of 2021, and barring other licensing conflicts ahead of the VS’s launch, all games outside of the Namco Museum cartridges will be playable on the TV-based console. Also, the company is committing to all future cartridges supporting both the VS and the handheld.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify reportedly won’t take a cut from podcasters who sell in-app subscriptions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FUT6rGNyhpr3LM9XvG6ojTWcAAw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69174513/acastro_180213_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a1TEE3"&gt;Spotify is reportedly planning to debut its in-app podcast subscription offering next week. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-spotify-and-the-new-battle-over-who-wins-podcasting-11619170206?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;reports today&lt;/a&gt; that the company will not take a cut from podcasters who choose to sell in-app subscriptions and also will allow them to set their own pricing. Listeners on its iOS app will be routed through a website to purchase the subscriptions, thereby allowing Spotify (and podcasters) to skirt around Apple’s fees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jyKhaC"&gt;The news comes right after Apple Podcasts debuted its own in-app subscriptions. The company will allow podcasters to sell access to ad-free, bonus, or early-access content at whatever price they choose to set. Unlike this reported Spotify plan, however, Apple requires podcasters to pay $19.99 per year to even list their subscriptions, as well as a 30 percent cut for each subscriber’s first year. That drops to 15 percent for every following year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oSJsd5"&gt;It’s increasingly likely podcasters will have to manage their subscriptions across multiple platforms’ backends. Apple doesn’t allow podcasters to use RSS to distribute their exclusive content — it has to be uploaded manually through Apple’s system. Spotify has never accepted RSS, and presumably, podcasters will have to do something similar to get their subscription content on the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3AVaMs"&gt;The things we still don’t know: what kind of data, if any, Spotify will provide podcasters; how long this no revenue share agreement will last; if all podcasters will be able to participate; and whether content has to be exclusive to Spotify. We’ve reached out to Spotify for comment and will update if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fbCQ5P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Dan Seifert? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A long look at the workspace of one of The Verge’s leading tech enthusiasts." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y870UlgZ0Oia76xZnZlNb5QlxkI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69174303/dseifert_20210415_4535_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A long look at the workspace of one of &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s leading tech enthusiasts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Visit the office of a Verge gearhead&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="sNynCU"&gt;If you’ve read a review, a gift guide, or a how-to on &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, then you’ve read something that’s been assigned by, edited by, or written by Dan Seifert. A longtime presence here, Dan’s knowledge of tech is vast and impressive — and is reflected by the number and quality of the devices you can see here in his home office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AqVuZd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about yourself. What is your background, and what do you do at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTQcpJ"&gt;I’ve been at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for nearly nine years and have held many hats and done many jobs over that time. But I’ve always had an involvement in the product reviews program, because I’m a complete gearhead who loves playing with new gadgets and technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOyWjy"&gt;Currently, I’m a deputy editor who helps run &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; machine every day. I oversee our entire product reviews and service journalism program, including reviews, gift guides, buying guides, how-to articles, deals articles, and yes, the “What’s on your desk?” series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jt7mtp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you decide where and how to set up your workspace?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ytapus"&gt;I’ve been working from home a few days per week for a long time, so when we bought our current house a few years ago, one of the requirements was that it would have a dedicated office space that I could work from. That’s proven immensely helpful over the past year as we transitioned to a fully remote working environment during the pandemic. I cannot put enough emphasis on how valuable a separate workspace, complete with a door you can close, is when you work from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wF4Lwy"&gt;That hasn’t stopped me from spending far too much time in here, though, as I also use this space for personal hobbies like tinkering with keyboards or playing the occasional PC game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dan’s desk is large enough to have space for multiple devices at the same time." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SmztO5AbQ4OLsqSQ2o6nBI5KrdY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461580/dseifert_20210415_4535_0018.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dan’s desk is large enough to have space for multiple devices at the same time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zPhTSh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50C7bG"&gt;The desk is one that is probably familiar to &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers, as it’s shown up in a few “What’s on your desk?” articles already. It’s a &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fully.com%2Fcatalog%2Fproduct%2Fview%2Fid%2F233%2Fs%2Fjarvis-adjustable-height-desk-bamboo%2Fcategory%2F3%2F%3Futm_source%3DNYMag%26utm_medium%3Drakuten%26ranMID%3D44880%26ranEAID%3DOHlcvPYhHQM%26ranSiteID%3DOHlcvPYhHQM-I22_PHu1Y9zpq1rraujdUw&amp;amp;xcust=VergeWOYDDanSeifert04212021"&gt;Fully Jarvis adjustable standing desk&lt;/a&gt; that I purchased about five years ago, back before the company rebranded from Ergo Depot to Fully. Believe it or not, I actually use the standing feature quite a bit and switch between standing and sitting modes multiple times per day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cOOD7c"&gt;Mine is big — one of the things I wanted from it was the space to have multiple devices on the desk at the same time, since I’m constantly having to test new things. It’s 60 inches wide, has a bamboo top, and has the “ergo cut” in the front that makes it a little easier to pull my chair up close to it. Mounted underneath and out of site is a swiveling pencil tray that I keep odds and ends in, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Delivery-Anker-PowerStrip-Outlets-Control/dp/B07DFFX34P?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=ad7cde89cb7f54d6cfe0c7619be64272&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;Anker power adapter&lt;/a&gt; that has two three-prong power outlets, two USB-A ports, a USB-C port for easy device charging, and cable trays for all of the power strips that I need to run everything on my desk. Those plug in to a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/CyberPower-CP1500AVRLCD-Intelligent-Outlets-Mini-Tower/dp/B000FBK3QK?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=77ab0d3b5730457eb060aeb644d94dcf&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;CyberPower UPS&lt;/a&gt; down on the floor, which I bought when we started having some issues with power flickering in our house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="IEiK01"&gt;
&lt;div id="MP84Ae"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10458129"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="0ZG3eN"&gt;
&lt;p id="3oeQ17"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And how about your desk chair?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7UQzF"&gt;My chair is a relatively recent addition — the one I had for years worked fine for a couple of days per week working from home, but when I transferred to full-time remote, it just wasn’t cutting it. So I jumped last year when Amazon had a sale on the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Steelcase-442A40-5S25-Gesture-Graphite/dp/B016OIF2JU?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=9d31b2bf1192b3922f7ffdd8d3d731ef&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;Steelcase Gesture&lt;/a&gt;, which was admittedly way more expensive than a chair should be (even on sale!), but it’s comfortable and endlessly adjustable, so I’ve been happy with it so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkQM8M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have a LOT of tech — more than we usually get to talk about. Why don’t we start with your main working setup? (That’s quite a monitor, by the way — and an interesting keyboard.)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruPwvO"&gt;I did warn you — I love gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RACHbc"&gt;The monitor is a 34-inch LG 34UM94-P ultrawide that I’ve had for about five years now. It’s great — I’ve plugged countless laptops, desktops, and other devices into it and it just gives me so much room for digital activities. It’s not the best for gaming, since it only goes up to 60Hz refresh rates, but its 3440 x 1440 resolution is ideal for productivity and photo editing. It’s mounted on an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Premium-Single-Monitor-Stand/dp/B00MIBN16O?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=fbe892d1a6c334c8fadd6fe81d23d056&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;Amazon Basics monitor arm&lt;/a&gt;, which keeps it at eye level for me and frees up more space on my desk. That weird little white puck in the middle of the stand post is a SmartThings motion and temperature sensor, which controls the smart lights and fans in my office. It’s in that spot because that’s where it can reliably see my fingers moving on the keyboard or mouse, which prevents the lights from shutting off in the middle of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0qW4n"&gt;The keyboard is something I’ve spent a ton of time (and way too much money) tinkering on, and I’m constantly changing parts of it to try different things. The board itself is an &lt;a href="https://epomaker.com/collections/mini-64/products/epomaker-gk68xs?variant=31743346737225"&gt;Epomaker / Skyloong GK68XS aluminum&lt;/a&gt;, which has a compact 65 percent layout, hot swappable switches, and built-in Bluetooth support. I bought it completely assembled, but before I even plugged it in, I pulled all the keycaps and switches out of it and replaced them with ones of my own choosing. The caps are currently the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrop.com%2F%3Forigin%3D%252Fbuy%252Fdrop-matt3o-mt3-susuwatari-custom-keycap-set&amp;amp;xcust=VergeWOYDDanSeifert04222021"&gt;Matt3o MT3 Susuwatari set from Drop&lt;/a&gt; and the switches are &lt;a href="https://mkultra.click/gazzew-boba-silent-tactile-u4-switches"&gt;Gazzew Boba U4 silent tactiles&lt;/a&gt;, which I have dismantled and put 55g springs inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="7l56kz"&gt;I recently rewatched &lt;em&gt;Halt and Catch Fire&lt;/em&gt; and was enamored with the vintage PC keyboards they used in the show, so I built this one with that aesthetic in mind. As mentioned, it’s a wireless board, but I couldn’t resist getting one of those &lt;a href="https://mechcables.com/collections/pre-made/products/stealth-gray-coiled-aviator-cable"&gt;fancy coiled cables&lt;/a&gt; for it, so I typically use it plugged in most of the time. I don’t like noisy keyboards at all, but this setup is surprisingly quiet — even quieter than the keyboard on my MacBook Air. I have no issue using it during Zoom calls and will probably bring it to the office with me when we return to work there since it won’t disturb others. That will free up space on my desk for another keyboard, giving me a whole new thing to tinker with.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vnWAtn"&gt;Next to it is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Vertical-Wireless-Mouse-Rechargeable/dp/B07FNJB8TT?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=98868343bc48c0c2d331becc3cea68a5&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;Logitech MX Vertical mouse&lt;/a&gt;, which I got when I started having some pain in my right shoulder after using a mouse all day. It seems to have relieved it, but if you can avoid getting old, I recommend that instead — it’s no fun. The other piece of ergonomic equipment I have is the wrist rest in front of the keyboard, which I can’t type without. I’ve tried soft wrist rests before, but I really like the support this &lt;a href="https://www.nizkeyboard.com/collections/ornaments/products/walnut-wood-keyboard-handle-60-81-84-87-108-size-customization?variant=31000131829831"&gt;walnut one from NIZ Keyboard&lt;/a&gt; provides. It also looks nice, which I can’t always say for soft types.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lJ1H1"&gt;Every device on my desk — monitor, keyboard, speakers, microphone, external storage drives, laptop, camera, Ethernet — is plugged into a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/CalDigit-TS3-Plus-Thunderbolt-Dock/dp/B07CZPV8DF?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=44e010434d44d85df190150cf59f5f6f&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;CalDigit TS3 Plus&lt;/a&gt; Thunderbolt 3 dock. I love this thing because it lets me easily swap between computers with just one cable, keeps my laptop charged up, and gives me all the ports I need. It even has a high-speed SD card slot on the front which I use all the time when dumping images from my camera. My only gripe is the obvious cable management mess you can see behind it — I’ve given up trying to make it any better than it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="X67m9v"&gt;
&lt;div id="1NVm1L"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10199988"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="6vcgEs"&gt;
&lt;p id="B0JrpB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have a more complete assortment of devices for online meetings than most, with a camera, microphone, headphones…  And I see you use a “regular” camera for your video.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmtCxf"&gt;Yeah, it’s… a lot. The headphones are a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NEW-Microsoft-Surface-Headphones-Light/dp/B086Q9YGD3?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=d3a04f9c332ba2e81dc27685ed0aa4d2&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;Microsoft Surface Headphones 2&lt;/a&gt; that I put on an old Twelve South Fermata stand, which has a built-in cable to charge them up when I’m done. I use these wirelessly the vast majority of the time and for every video call meeting I take, so even though they have relatively good battery life, I still have to charge them every other day or so. A lot of times, I just have them on with nothing playing because the noise cancellation blocks out the sounds of my kids playing just outside the office door. I’ve also got a set of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MWP22AM-A-AirPods-Pro/dp/B07ZPC9QD4?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=12835663ef7b1640a2b324d53871b825&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mophie-Wireless-Charge-Pad-Charging/dp/B07XPWD4WW?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=ed53412036c3100213a44762a5f822b5&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;Mophie 3-in-1 wireless charger&lt;/a&gt; that I use if I forget to charge the Surface Headphones or just need a break from something sitting on my head. Also on my desk and plugged into the Thunderbolt dock is a set of &lt;a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&amp;amp;_trksid=p2546172.m570.l1313&amp;amp;_nkw=lower+east+side+speakers&amp;amp;_sacat=0&amp;amp;mkcid=1&amp;amp;mkrid=711-53200-19255-0&amp;amp;siteid=0&amp;amp;campid=5338794975&amp;amp;customid=VergeWOYDanSeifert04222021&amp;amp;toolid=10001&amp;amp;mkevt=1#donotlink"&gt;long-discontinued Audyssey Lower East Side speakers&lt;/a&gt;, which have enough punch on their own that I don’t need a subwoofer for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8jzsD"&gt;When I need to record better audio for a podcast, I use the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Yeti-USB-Microphone-Blackout/dp/B00N1YPXW2?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=7d3b63ea07e45c2f39167a4364e3ce95&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;Blue Yeti mic&lt;/a&gt; on a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07DHLSTLV?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=af2adee52e919fd7d8f7cac2cb215183&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;swiveling boom arm&lt;/a&gt; that I can just push out of the way when I don’t need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ARkpx"&gt;The camera is a Fujifilm X-H1 mounted on an adjustable rig I &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1015864-REG%2Fimpact_3_section_double_articulated.html&amp;amp;xcust=VergeWOYDDanSeifert04212021"&gt;cobbled&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/824360-REG/impact_cc_106r_super_clamp_with_ratchet.html"&gt;together&lt;/a&gt; and is plugged into an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Y7BFXVM?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=5e10fc3b8f0697b5ee4b6b4014cdbdcd&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;HDMI capture card&lt;/a&gt; that’s mounted out of sight behind the monitor. Its video quality is a lot better than any webcam you can purchase, even if it’s decidedly overkill for the Zoom calls that I do all day long. Hooking it all up is surprisingly easy to do if you have a camera lying around — I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21244380/webcam-camera-how-to-dslr-mirrorless-capture-card-usb-hdmi"&gt;wrote about how to do it for the site&lt;/a&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YXR5e6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Next to the window, you have a tablet and — what looks like a small pile of tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3UjaLd"&gt;Ah yes, the overflow pile. Over there is where I have a pencil cup, some notebooks, and random headphones. There’s also an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Show-8/dp/B07PF1Y28C?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=886f2bf0e5b8c636c150ddc51968b7f6&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl"&gt;Amazon Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt; that alerts me when someone has rung the doorbell and also lets me tap into the baby camera so I can keep an eye on her when she’s napping. There are a couple other smart home sensors there, too, which help my HVAC system know when I’m in the office and adjust itself accordingly. Mounted on the wall is a bulletin board where I’ve got some pictures of my kids and artwork they’ve made for me. And, oh yeah, there’s a lightsaber.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The overflow pile includes review devices, sensors, and an Echo Show 8." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9lLVA8NbCTJSVKnshft3fk0122U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22461579/dseifert_20210415_4535_0017.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The overflow pile includes review devices, sensors, and an Echo Show 8.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3O7mO4"&gt;My daily work computer is an &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1041045/7613?sharedid=VergeWOYDDanSeifert04222021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-mac%2Fmacbook-air"&gt;M1 MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, which works great for nearly everything. But if I want to play games, I need a Windows machine, so over on the other side of the desk is my gaming laptop (an &lt;a href="https://www.eluktronics.com/MAG-15-1P16R"&gt;Eluktronics MAG-15&lt;/a&gt; with an RTX 2070), plus a 12.9-inch 2018 iPad Pro that I used to use a lot more when I commuted. It has built-in LTE, which is a lifesaver on the train but not especially useful when I’m home on Wi-Fi all the time. This pile is also where the rotating cast of review devices tend to live when I’m testing them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="hJ4lKP"&gt;
&lt;div id="O0ar7I"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9573987"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="x58Rfn"&gt;
&lt;p id="6rbGVI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All in all, you seem pretty organized — you even have a box for your really small items.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eSILu5"&gt;If there’s one complaint I have with my desk, it’s that there’s no under-desk storage, so I basically have to keep everything on top of it or in other organizing systems elsewhere in my office. So in addition to the hidden pencil tray mounted underneath the desk, I have some &lt;a href="https://www.muji.us/store/furniture-interior/storage-organizers.html"&gt;small stackable Muji makeup trays&lt;/a&gt; to keep random things like SIM card tools, batteries, microfiber cloths, SD cards, USB cables, etc. somewhat organized. There’s often a lot of spill over, though, and since this desk is so big, it’s easy for me to ignore the mess and let it pile up. It’s possible I may have cheated a little and cleaned up before taking these pictures, but I won’t tell if you don’t. &lt;em&gt;[Editor’s note: it’s too late — we’ve all seen your desk at the office...]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3fcH8A"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And with all that tech, you still have an old-fashioned notebook and pen by your keyboard.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aqm5Ur"&gt;I’ve spent so many years trying to make a digital note-taking system work for me, but I just can’t get along with writing on a screen. I keep a Moleskine notebook open next to me at all times so I can quickly jot down things I need to remember or notes when I’m in a call or meeting. I find I can pay attention to meetings better when I’m handwriting notes compared to typing them out, even if I struggle to actually read my handwriting afterward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f8GgIZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything else about your workspace that we haven’t covered?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="JTQIQH"&gt;Being forced to tally all of this stuff up makes me realize just how much is involved with my work setup. It could probably use a bit of pruning and simplification. But since I spend so much time here, investing in the space has been worth it, even if it seems like a lot when it’s all added up. Between the comfort and efficiency my workspace gives me, I don’t totally dread spending most of my day in this spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0u0R6Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BXYT5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft releases Office 2021 for Mac preview</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HU0XifkQndRgA4G7dtf1vQyddk0=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69174157/officeicons.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B3VY3V"&gt;Microsoft is releasing a preview version of Office 2021 for Mac and Office LTSC this week. While Office LTSC (Long-Term Servicing Channel) is &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/commercial-preview-of-microsoft-office-long-term-servicing/ba-p/2260013"&gt;designed for commercial customers&lt;/a&gt;, both versions are perpetual versions of Office that don’t rely on subscriptions or the cloud. Microsoft announced its plans for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288959/microsoft-office-2021-windows-mac-features-release-date-price"&gt;Office 2021 back in February&lt;/a&gt;, and a Windows version — which won’t be available in preview — will also be released later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFjn18"&gt;Office 2021 for Mac will support both Apple Silicon and Intel-based Macs, and require at least 4GB of RAM and 10GB of storage space. It’s designed to be a static release of Office, but during the preview there will be monthly updates that could include new features. Once Office 2021 for Mac is final and released, no new features will be added. Current &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/deployoffice/office2021/overview-mac-preview"&gt;improvements include&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="kykYrT"&gt;Line Focus, this feature removes distractions to let Word users move through a document line by line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iNW3AM"&gt;XLOOKUP, an Excel feature that lets you find things in a table or range by row.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1Pddsg"&gt;Dynamic array support in Excel, which has new functions for dynamic arrays in spreadsheets.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nFdtpj"&gt;Record a slide show with narration in PowerPoint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="MV6Iiw"&gt;Microsoft’s Office LTSC variant will also include things like dark mode support, accessibility improvements, and the same Dynamic Arrays and XLOOKUP features found in Excel 2021 for Mac. Office 2021 for Windows will include similar features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NqNCk3"&gt;If you’re interested in trying out Office 2021 for Mac, you’ll need to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.microsoft.com%2Ffwlink%2Fp%2F%3Flinkid%3D2159127&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F23%2F22399042%2Fmicrosoft-office-2021-for-mac-preview-download" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;download the installer from Microsoft’s site&lt;/a&gt; and a special &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.microsoft.com%2Ffwlink%2Fp%2F%3Flinkid%3D2147058&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F23%2F22399042%2Fmicrosoft-office-2021-for-mac-preview-download" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Volume License Serializer&lt;/a&gt; to activate the preview.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: Ignore that unexpected email from Twitter asking you to confirm your account</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AM4i0rVQWihAGJd4coz7m9vTIAE=/0x0:1125x750/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69174153/EzprcS_WUAA3Q0g.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The confirmation emails were sent out in error.&lt;/em&gt; | Screenshot by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N11LGg"&gt;Twitter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1385439529788715015"&gt;has apologized&lt;/a&gt; for accidentally sending out emails asking users to “confirm your Twitter account.” The company says the messages were sent out by mistake. “If you received one of these emails, you don’t need to confirm your account and you can disregard the message,” the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCCoVq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s own Tom Warren was a recipient of one of the emails, which looks like the one Twitter sends out to validate an email address during its sign-up process. Users who weren’t expecting to receive the emails quickly assumed they were being sent out by someone trying to imitate Twitter as part of a phishing scam, &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/technology/twitter-accidentally-sends-suspicious-emails-asking-to-confirm-accounts/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BleepingComputer&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oQVyJp"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;these Twitter confirm emails are nothing to worry about. It’s just a Twitter mistake &lt;a href="https://t.co/jJL3eJGBT9"&gt;https://t.co/jJL3eJGBT9&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/MS4r5idW9p"&gt;pic.twitter.com/MS4r5idW9p&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1385537973106716676?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3WXQxA"&gt;On this occasion the cause of the emails was the result of what seems to be a simple error, but it’s always best to play it safe when you receive an email you weren’t expecting, especially if it’s imitating a major company and asking you to click a link.
