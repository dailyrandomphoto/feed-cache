    <title>How to watch BlizzCon 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BlizzCon 2021" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7I-R9yizCKHBuPZuLtqkSmgfYRg=/0x0:2025x1350/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68843008/blizzcon2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Blizzard&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PySwen"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21271059/blizzcon-2020-canceled-blizzard-entertainment"&gt;canceling BlizzCon 2020 due to the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, Blizzard is back — earlier than usual in the year — for BlizzCon 2021. Blizzard is actually calling it “BlizzConline 2021.” Expect to hear updates on anticipated titles, including &lt;em&gt;Diablo IV&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hearthstone&lt;/em&gt;, and perhaps a sneak peek at the rumored &lt;em&gt;Diablo 2&lt;/em&gt; remaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u97fng"&gt;Activision, Blizzard’s parent company, announced during a recent earnings call that both &lt;em&gt;Diablo 4&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt; wouldn’t see a 2021 release. And while that’s disappointing, there will likely be some news on games releasing this year. A likely candidate is the &lt;em&gt;Diablo Immortal&lt;/em&gt; game for iOS and Android phones, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22180377/diablo-immortal-iphone-android-technical-alpha-preview"&gt;my colleague Andrew Webster got to experience hands-on&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0e2QmI"&gt;If you want to watch the festivities (which should still be plenty festive even if they won’t be replete with the usual amount of in-person cosplay), here’s how to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="48AXhs"&gt;When is BlizzCon 2021 happening?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IBAToo"&gt;BlizzCon will start with the usual opening ceremony at 5PM ET / 2PM PT on Friday, February 19th, and it’s slated to last for an hour and 10 minutes. From then, the convention splits off into five different broadcasts, each focusing on a different game. &lt;a href="https://blizzcon.com/en-us/schedule"&gt;Here’s the full schedule&lt;/a&gt;. All broadcasts are scheduled to wrap up by 8:40PM ET / 5:40PM PT. If you’re looking for news on games, it’ll likely happen on day one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpmEFx"&gt;However, it’ll start up again on Saturday, February 20th, at 3PM ET / 12PM PT. The day two schedule consists of Q&amp;amp;A sessions, community showcases, and additional entertainment, like a &lt;em&gt;Diablo &lt;/em&gt;tabletop campaign hosted by the &lt;em&gt;Critical Role&lt;/em&gt; crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EIjr67"&gt;Does it cost anything to attend BlizzCon 2021?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="lCUgG5"&gt;Nope. It’s free to attend, unlike previous in-person BlizzCon events that required tickets. If you want some of the goodies that usually came with a ticket, you can buy a BlizzCon bundle of &lt;a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/celebration-collection"&gt;in-game items and cosmetics right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DiN5Ym"&gt;Where can I watch BlizzCon 2021?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BKpSNg"&gt;Blizzard is hosting its online convention at &lt;a href="http://BlizzCon.com"&gt;BlizzCon.com&lt;/a&gt;, or through &lt;a href="http://Battle.net"&gt;Battle.net&lt;/a&gt;, Activision Blizzard’s game launcher on desktop and mobile. It’s also going to stream live from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/blizzard"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/blizzard"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VW’s next electric SUV, the ID 5 coupe, will go into production in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vNpyltLz_q-SW_ia-mXOYPAmUyg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68842984/akrales_200915_4161_0361.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LDwQl2"&gt;Volkswagen confirmed that its next electric vehicle, the ID 5, will start production in Germany in the second half of 2021. The first pilot series of the ID 5 has already started production, the automaker confirmed in a recent tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJf1sw"&gt;The ID 5 will be a coupe version of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21444141/volkswagen-vw-id4-electric-suv-price-range-specs"&gt;the ID 4 compact SUV&lt;/a&gt;, which went on sale in Europe, China, and North America in late 2020. The ID 4 is the first vehicle built on VW’s modular MEB electric architecture to be available in North America. Its predecessor, the hatchback ID 3, is only being sold in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5DkR6"&gt;The ID 5 may also fail to reach this side of the Atlantic Ocean, although a VW spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="45XwS4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="de" dir="ltr"&gt;Es ist offiziell: Auf den &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VWID3?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#VWID3&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VWID4?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#VWID4&lt;/a&gt; folgt der &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VWID5?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#VWID5&lt;/a&gt;! Wie &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VW?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#VW&lt;/a&gt;-Markenchef Ralf Brandstätter heute im Gespräch mit &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WN_Wolfsburg?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@WN_Wolfsburg&lt;/a&gt; bekanntgab, wird das Coupé-SUV bei uns in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Zwickau?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Zwickau&lt;/a&gt; gebaut. Markteinführung: 2. Halbjahr 2021! Die ersten Vorserien laufen bereits…  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/emobility?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#emobility&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/c9W5hxnE7E"&gt;pic.twitter.com/c9W5hxnE7E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— vwsachsen_de (@vwsachsen_de) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vwsachsen_de/status/1359873451285184512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P3YeW2"&gt;A rough translation of that tweet reads, “It’s official: on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VWID3?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#VWID3&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VWID4?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#VWID4&lt;/a&gt; follows the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VWID5?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#VWID5&lt;/a&gt; ! As &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/VW?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#VW&lt;/a&gt; -Mark boss Ralf Brandstätter in conversation with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WN_Wolfsburg"&gt;@WN_Wolfsburg&lt;/a&gt; announced, the coupé SUV will be sold in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Zwickau?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#Zwickau&lt;/a&gt; built. Market launch: 2nd half of 2021! The first pilot series are already running ...&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/emobility?src=hashtag_click"&gt;#emobility&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="boooF8"&gt;VW’s ID electric lineup also includes concept versions of a large SUV (&lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/the-volkswagen-i-d-roomzz-concept-has-room-for-days-an-1834048772"&gt;ID Roomzz&lt;/a&gt;), a dune buggy (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18254329/volkswagen-id-buggy-electric-concept-car-geneva-motor-show-2019"&gt;ID Buggy&lt;/a&gt;), and a revamped version of its iconic microbus (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/19/16173938/volkswagen-microbus-i-d-buzz-concept-production-nostalgia"&gt;ID Buzz&lt;/a&gt;), for which VW has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17882400/vw-volkswagen-id-buzz-cargo-van-concept-electric"&gt;promised a delivery variant&lt;/a&gt;. All are being built on Volkswagen’s modular electric vehicle platform known as MEB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QEOAGa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The first pilot series are already running”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bo5mmt"&gt;The ID family of vehicles won’t be VW’s first foray into battery-powered drivetrains. The e-Golf was first launched in 2012 but was discontinued in 2020 as the automaker shifts focus to its MEB-built vehicles. VW subsidiary &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20983836/porsche-taycan-turbo-electric-car-first-drive-hands-on-photos-video-range"&gt;Porsche’s first all-electric sports car, the Taycan&lt;/a&gt;, went on sale in 2019. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17876012/dieselgate-volkswagen-vw-diesel-emissions-test-epa-german-auto-industry-mercedes-benz-bmw"&gt;The E-Tron&lt;/a&gt;, the first battery-electric SUV from Volkswagen Group-owned Audi, debuted in 2018. Together, these vehicles represent the tip of the spear in VW’s effort to dominate the emerging EV market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipYYGi"&gt;They’re also crucial in helping VW turn the page on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17876012/dieselgate-volkswagen-vw-diesel-emissions-test-epa-german-auto-industry-mercedes-benz-bmw"&gt;now six-year-old Dieselgate scandal&lt;/a&gt;, in which VW was accused of installing illegal software in 11 million diesel cars in order to trick emissions tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBjG5v"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SrSHDHNRiQrX7uCuXdtZyYvmZKk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/akrales_190820_3597_0355.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch, like everything else that can lighten the mood during this incredibly tough time, is in short supply. And as soon as retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart get it in stock, it quickly sells out. It can be disheartening to miss out on the opportunity to buy a Switch — but fear not! The purpose of this article is to help you do just that without paying more than it would usually cost at retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BazuMH"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy a Nintendo Switch (the one you can dock to your TV or remove for portable use) or a Switch Lite (the portable-only version of the console) as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — even Switch consoles that are preowned or refurbished — will likely continue to sell out quickly during the pandemic. But we’ll do our best to keep this article up to date with the latest in-stock offers, and we’ll tell you when each offer was posted. When something gets sold out, we’ll try to let you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="D0nXc0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The 8 best games for your new Nintendo Switch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/25/21012569/nintendo-switch-best-games-2019-pokemon-zelda"},{"title":"The best games of 2020","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21126558/best-games-2020-ps4-ps5-xbox-nintendo-switch-pc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qGGw5PwDrzANZ-regrcl3nOYK_A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19086558/akrales_190820_3597_0150.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch Lite is the smaller, portable-only version of the console that comes in a few different color options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch or Switch Lite right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="guePeD"&gt;Currently, you can buy the Nintendo Switch Monster Hunter Rise Deluxe Edition for $370 at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-monster-hunter-rise-deluxe-edition-console%2F-%2FA-82493733%3Fclkid&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. The console is bundled with a special-edition Switch, as well as a digital code for &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; along with some DLC. Compared to other special edition consoles, this is one of the few Switch bundles that include a game with the console. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gG8y3P"&gt;You can buy the limited-edition &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; Nintendo Switch at &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fswitch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-animal-crossing-new-horizons-edition%2F11100143.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-animal-crossing-new-horizons-edition%2F-%2FA-79494599%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0qFYuNkpFykDpDolNE5TF7UWkjs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22315233/switch_monster_hunter.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o2G175"&gt;If you’re not against buying a preowned or refurbished console, you’ll want to check out &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fswitch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-with-gray-joy-con%2F206007.html%3Fgclid%3DCjwKCAiAt9z-BRBCEiwA_bWv-HzeKt4-dsaWdi9G9SGmxFTUUEAxrCA4NxZS0xEWCkIacwTZ_cUKPRoCEYUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. Another good place to look is &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html"&gt;Nintendo’s own online store where it sells refurbished Switch consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Those have been sold out recently, but there’s no telling when it will restock the page with some repaired, refreshed consoles. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can buy games on Switch cartridges or store several digital downloads purchased through the eShop on a microSD card.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8hV7z9"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Nintendo Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hgAR00"&gt;Frankly, the Switch comes with everything that you need to get started and have fun. However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sHCpf"&gt;First off, a microSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage. Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers regularly sell cards with up to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SC7BZHR/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=d9d13492d7a2383ae455b1e464853cbe&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;th=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for around $70&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074RNRM2B/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=ebcbe0aae0692190d419f2c892d31718&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A 400GB microSD card will cost you around $40&lt;/a&gt;, and with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes, the card has enough space to store several of them.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nintendo Switch does not include a Pro Controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdvLy"&gt;Let’s talk quickly about controllers. The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; titles require the Joy-Cons to play. If you are looking for a Switch Pro controller, Walmart also has the normal &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Black%2F55485228&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Switch Pro controller for $59&lt;/a&gt;, knockings $11 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zmgu8T"&gt;If you are looking to use your Nintendo Switch to also g&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UODwlY"&gt;Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ulULMw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N3ASPNV/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=03e07706174eba9d98e121bd33c717da&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A two-pack of amFilm tempered glass protectors for the Nintendo Switch is $8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="cx5X9k"&gt;If you want to play online with friends, ensure that your saves are backed up in the cloud, and get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era, you’ll want to get a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergehowto-20&amp;amp;linkId=e9815cab861c6f59255b7b948189eef3&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $20 per year for a single user&lt;/a&gt; on a console or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1728487093072266361" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35 a year for up to eight users on different consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="RSd3ZJ"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; our chat show to discuss this week in tech news featuring our reporters and editors. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="k0XhRp"&gt;Here’s what the show covered on this episode: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpPx4C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor-in-chief Nilay Patel talks with Adi Robertson and Casey Newton about &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/australias-bad-bargain-with-platforms"&gt;Australia’s News Media Bargaining Code&lt;/a&gt;, the country’s new regulation for news media on the internet. Casey and Adi explain the deal Google is making with Australia, why Facebook walked away, and what’s at stake for the open web.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="5ncyC5"&gt;On the second half of the show, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor Chris Welch and reporter Julia Alexander return to discuss with Nilay the state of TV and streaming — there’s a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289197/amazon-fire-tv-stick-2020-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Amazon Fire TV stick&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287905/apple-tv-app-now-available-chromecast-google-tv"&gt;you can play Apple TV on the latest Google Chromecast now&lt;/a&gt;, and streaming services are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287816/hbo-max-kids-content-shows-competitors"&gt;amping up their content&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WandaVision’s seventh episode answers two big questions but introduces many more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pH3qJfmXC1pXV4uQmazOXrKMyr8=/72x0:1422x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68842711/Screen_Shot_2021_02_19_at_4.00.05_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AHRzHJ"&gt;Let’s cut to the chase: a couple of really big things happened on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/998747/9358?subId1=WandaVisionSeventhEpisode021921&amp;amp;sharedid=Verge%20&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Fwandavision%2F4SrN28ZjDLwH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;this week&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIpekI"&gt;Most of it is still in line with &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s current strategy of setting up the Big Reveal, whatever that may be. It could be the heavily teased unnamed character likely to appear in the final two episodes. It could be setting up several films and TV shows within the Marvel Cinematic Universe that fans are eagerly awaiting, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20702391/marvel-cinematic-universe-phase-5-x-men-mutants-fantastic-four-captain-marvel-2-black-panther"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel 2 &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It could be setting up entirely new rosters of superheroes that have yet to grace the MCU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QdWXCd"&gt;At its core, the seventh episode was also about acceptance. That’s a pretty key idea to several of Wanda’s spanning arcs in the comics, so let’s not just glance over it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0cNlcn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All right, here’s your warning. We’re going to get into the nitty-gritty of this episode, so reader beware: you’re in for some spoilers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QXwoHMep9WTEplGhklzU42qA89o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22314861/Screen_Shot_2021_02_19_at_10.30.59_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GymrRv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was Agatha all along!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1zaMT7"&gt;Easily the most shared theory throughout the Marvel fandom became fact with this episode. Wanda and Vision’s strange neighbor, Agnes, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/22/22243271/wandavision-episode-3-recap-explainer-mephisto-agatha-harkness-tommy-billy-sword"&gt;actually Agatha Harkness&lt;/a&gt;. In the comics, Harkness plays two vital roles: she’s the protector of Franklin Richards, the son of Fantastic Four members Sue and Reed Richards, but more importantly, she’s the witch who helps Wanda learn how to use her chaos magic powers. More specifically, it’s Agatha who helps Wanda understand that her kids aren’t real, erasing her memory to save her from the pain of realizing her loss. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3dzuB"&gt;We get a glimpse of how &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;has incorporated some of that relationship in the seventh episode. After Wanda makes her way into Agatha’s basement (the grim interior lined with massive vines and decorative skulls seems directly inspired by Agatha’s residence on &lt;a href="https://headhuntersholosuite.fandom.com/wiki/Whisper_Hill"&gt;Whisper Hill in the comics&lt;/a&gt;), Agatha pops out and proclaims she’s the person running the show. We see wisps of purple magic radiate from the witch, as Agatha takes over Wanda’s brain once again. Remember when Wanda played with the minds of several Avengers in &lt;em&gt;Age of Ultron &lt;/em&gt;(except Hawkeye, who dealt with his own mind control problems after an encounter with Loki in &lt;em&gt;The Avengers&lt;/em&gt;)? Sucks to be on the receiving end of it, huh?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GqjSou"&gt;This leads to the biggest mystery still surrounding Agatha in &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;: friend or foe? She’s an ally in the comics, a mentor to Wanda, but the most recent episode seems to set her up as the show’s big villain. After all, she’s the person who apparently controlled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22267989/wandavision-5th-episode-recap-sitcom-horror-disney-plus-streaming-crossover-multiverse"&gt;Pietro when he came back to life&lt;/a&gt; just to keep the charade going and is directing every one of Wanda’s moves within the hex. Except this is Marvel Studios, and nothing is ever that simple. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vqXl0Cav4cDwp1kJRr6P-u2SOGQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22314864/Screen_Shot_2021_02_19_at_10.31.59_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="I8KFNa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The devil’s in the details &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ro5t4w"&gt;One of the more curious clues in this never-ending riddle is an ominous-looking book sitting in Agatha’s basement. Like Agatha and Wanda, it radiates magic. Orange and red magic pulses around the book, which is different from Wanda’s striking red chaos magic and Agatha’s purple strain. There’s no obvious answer as to what the text is, but there are a few theories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7dWDK9"&gt;The first ties into an ongoing theory we’ve had since the show’s very first two episodes — it’s the devil Mephisto at work. While Mephisto doesn’t have a direct connection to the book, he &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; have a direct connection to both Wanda and Doctor Strange, who may have a direct connection to said book. Mephisto is the one who absorbs Wanda’s children, Tommy and Billy, and it’s because of his actions that Agatha works to wipe Wanda’s mind. (Tommy and Billy eventually come back as two superheroes named Wiccan and Speed as part of the Young Avengers, but more on that in a second.) In one comic arc from the 1970s, Mephisto also attempts to steal some of Doctor Strange’s books to lure the sorcerer and protector of Earth to hell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6HBUA"&gt;(There’s also that whole thing about Mephisto first &lt;a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Mephisto_(Earth-616)#cite_note-16-16-46"&gt;appearing as a fly&lt;/a&gt;, like the one that Wanda sees on Agatha’s curtains.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPJp8K"&gt;By this point, you may be asking, “Why does that matter?” Well, one of the theories is that the strange book is made up of dark matter, which exists in the Doctor Strange universe. As it presents a threat to Earth’s citizens and as Doctor Strange still exists as the Sorcerer Supreme, it’s his job to fight threats from magical or mystical beings. A book made up of dark matter and potentially harnessing secrets of dangerous ancient spells, possibly being used to either summon Mephisto or use his powers, would certainly fall under Doctor Strange’s purview. Since we already know that &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;plays into &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, &lt;/em&gt;this is one way to go about it. Also, here’s a quick screenshot from the episode that features a devil caricature etched into Agatha’s house. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fmng6f"&gt;The other theory I’ve seen floating around — one that makes less sense to me — is that said book is actually the &lt;a href="https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/Darkhold#cite_note-1"&gt;Darkhold from &lt;em&gt;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Look, anything is possible. The Darkhold is a supernatural text that contains ancient and nefarious curses, making its appearance and use by Agatha certainly a possibility. Plus, &lt;em&gt;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. &lt;/em&gt;has interwoven with the MCU in the past. I just can’t see the reasoning for bringing a book with heavy &lt;em&gt;Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D &lt;/em&gt;ties into the current Marvel Cinematic Universe as it stands at this point in time, but I’m willing to be proven wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjQKqD"&gt;So if it is Mephisto, the bigger question is whether his role is unique to &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;and as a character that sets up a larger cosmic universe that &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness, The Eternals, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel 2 &lt;/em&gt;will explore, or something even bigger? Speaking of &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel 2 &lt;/em&gt;and bigger things, let’s address the other massive reveal in this week’s episode.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BvH2MuULpVTYx0DMEZQmaMEmTDk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22314868/Screen_Shot_2021_02_19_at_10.33.36_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ff6LXd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome, Spectrum! (Or maybe Photon, Pulsar, or... Captain Marvel?)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="EpvAFv"&gt;Monica! Freaking! Rambeau! Easily the character with one of the best on-screen superhero introduction moments, &lt;em&gt;WandaVision &lt;/em&gt;finally gave us our first look at Monica’s extraordinary new identity. We just have to figure out which identity it is. Buckle up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JYiSD"&gt;It should come as no surprise to comic readers that Monica Rambeau finally took on her role as a superhero. In the comics, she actually portrays a version of Captain Marvel for a period of time within the Avengers before taking on the name more commonly associated with her character, Spectrum. The rebranding is important for a couple of reasons, but one in particular is that it effectively coincides with Thanos’ attack on Earth in the comics. With many of the Avengers up in space, Spectrum was one of the few based in New York left to fight one of the Mad Titan’s children, Proxima Midnight. As part of the Mighty Avengers, Spectrum teams up with Blue Marvel (otherwise known as Adam Brashear) who saves her life after she’s poisoned by Midnight Proxima. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3ROnb"&gt;This is a lot of back detail for an event that already happened and played out differently (as far as we know) in &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Infinity War &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt;, but Adam Brashear’s name might sound familiar to the avid theorists. Adam Brashear is a superhero, but he’s also an engineer and theoretical physicist who has some expertise working with aerospace equipment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hPknDx"&gt;When Monica suggested she knew the perfect aerospace engineer who could help with solving the energy force shielding the Hex, people naturally assumed it was Reed Richards. Instead, Monica initially revealed it to be a character named Major Goodner. Much like Agatha Harkness and the feeling that something else is just around the corner, I don’t think it ends with Major Goodner. I also don’t think it’s likely that Reed Richards will pop up in a finale of &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, although — like the Darkforce situation — anything is possible. Considering Monica Rambeau and Adam Brashear end up as a couple, and he’s an aerospace engineer who can work with energy forces, I’m waiting to see him appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sAHwIP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Monica! Freaking! Rambeau!&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUB3GB"&gt;If anything, at least that will let us know Monica is Spectrum — maybe. It does, however, set up a role for Monica Rambeau in &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel 2&lt;/em&gt;. Clearly, Monica has a complicated relationship with Carol Danvers, a person she looked up to as the wickedly cool aunt in the first &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/em&gt;. With new extraordinary powers, a desire to defend the world from existential threats, and a personal connection to Captain Marvel that is ready to be explored, expect more from Spectrum in the MCU. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7Ia2H"&gt;Speaking of cool superhero team-ups I want to see, the more we see of Tommy and Billy’s powers, the more excited I am for what &lt;em&gt;seems to be &lt;/em&gt;an inevitable Young Avengers arc. Speed and Wiccan are making their way in &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye &lt;/em&gt;will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167550/hawkeye-premiere-date-marvel-disney-plus-jeremy-renner-hailee-steinfeld-wandavision"&gt;introduce Kate Bishop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier &lt;/em&gt;is &lt;a href="https://www.cbr.com/falcon-winter-soldier-marvel-comics-patriot-explained/"&gt;rumored to introduce Patriot&lt;/a&gt;, Cassie Lang already exists in the &lt;em&gt;Ant-Man &lt;/em&gt;universe, and &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel &lt;/em&gt;is just around the corner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmvQi6"&gt;Marvel Studios head Kevin Feige also hasn’t shied away from telling people that Young Avengers will play a &lt;a href="https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/marvels-kevin-feige-admits-studio-is-planting-seeds-for-young-avengers-to-appear-in-mcu"&gt;role in the MCU’s fourth phase&lt;/a&gt;. I’m just excited for my teen superheroes to get their time to shine, however that may be in the end. Give them all a show and then bring them together for a Young Avengers on Disney Plus — like the time Marvel TV gave us &lt;em&gt;Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Iron Fist &lt;/em&gt;before releasing &lt;em&gt;The Defenders — &lt;/em&gt;but I digress. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IWEgYA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A commercial is never just a commercial &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ep0Ztn"&gt;One of &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;’s most fun traits is the seemingly innocuous but never truly innocent commercials. This week’s commercial focuses on an antidepressant of sorts called Nexus. The pill allows people to remain rooted in reality — or a reality of their choice. The wink-wink to Wanda’s current fictional world aside, Nexus also connects to Marvel’s Nexus beings, a breed of unique and powerful beings that are anchors within the multiverse. They are keystones to everything. In the current Marvel-616 comics continuity storyline, Wanda is one of those Nexus beings. Not only does that make her stability crucial to all of mankind (this is your periodic reminder to read &lt;em&gt;House of M &lt;/em&gt;if you haven’t yet), but it also makes her situation especially important to Doctor Strange. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BmHIa4"&gt;Since we know Marvel Studios is going to greatly explore the multiverse in at least two prominent movies, &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man 3&lt;/em&gt;, the commercial suggests that whatever happens with Wanda, Agatha, and whoever else in the final episodes will likely intersect with the events of those films. Remember, this was Marvel Studios and Disney’s vision all along for the version of the MCU that exists on Disney Plus — movies will play into TV shows, and TV shows will play into movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukTTmF"&gt;What’s increasingly obvious is &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/998747/9358?subId1=WandaVisionSeventhEpisode021921&amp;amp;sharedid=Verge%20&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Fwandavision%2F4SrN28ZjDLwH" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;still has a lot of story to tell, even with just two episodes left. The countdown begins until the eighth episode. Only about 160 hours left at the time of this writing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkVOT6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to score a COVID-19 vaccine appointment </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_u2r1v0qpkmDCofvfzLEcU6WDG4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68809161/acastro_201217_1777_vaccine_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DzZXIa"&gt;One of the most frustrating tasks for many of us these days is finding how and where to get an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. It can be a real exercise in exasperation: the websites are often difficult to navigate and prone to frequent crashes; in addition, after finding an open appointment slot and filling out multiple pages of questions, you are often told that the opening has disappeared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Vp4Bt"&gt;In view of all this, we’ve tried to gather as much helpful information as we can about ways to research and snag vaccination appointments for yourself and others. We’ll update this as more information presents itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JYv8ZW"&gt;Research the vaccination qualifications in your state&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jJJ2mU"&gt;To begin with, it’s a good idea to try to pin down if you or the person you are assisting is currently qualified for the COVID-19 vaccine. Find the vaccine information site (or sites) that is being run by your state and / or city. This will also help you figure out when you might be qualified if you aren’t already. If you can’t find it via a quick search, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/plan-your-vaccine/"&gt;NBC News has created a simple website&lt;/a&gt; that lets you find out what the current situation is in your specific state. &lt;a href="https://www.goodrx.com/covid-19/where-to-get-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;Prescription company GoodRx&lt;/a&gt; offers similar information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="N5dWHX"&gt;Find all the places that might offer appointments&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XK1Cc0"&gt;There are, fortunately or unfortunately, many different sites where you can go to find out if you can get an appointment to be vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgvDmn"&gt;For example, here in New York City, we’ve had to navigate separate sites run by the city and the state. Various hospital systems also have their own sites, as do pharmacies such as Walgreens and CVS, which have recently begun offering appointments for vaccinations. It’s a lot to check — and it can be enormously confusing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usTdFX"&gt;As a result, your first step is probably to check your state’s government health website (searching your state name and “COVID vaccine” will probably do it). If you’re an urban dweller, check for your city’s information site as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H8ot2F"&gt;While most personal physicians do not have access to vaccines, your doctor may be able to tell you some of the places to check. Other resources include your local hospital system, your union (especially if your employment qualifies you for a vaccination), and, of course, friends and colleagues, many of whom have probably been doing their own searches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZ6Bfn"&gt;As you find resources and sites, make sure to bookmark them. I keep a folder on my bookmarks bar called “COVID” — you may want to name yours something more cheerful.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Looking for an available vaccine appointment can be frustrating, but persistence can pay off." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8lP4_R3np2CX9crqTcg9Mq6I2Js=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13963741/IMG_1653.1419968302.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looking for an available vaccine appointment can be frustrating, but persistence can pay off.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6uguNM"&gt;Have all your information ready&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1Dt0LZ"&gt;Many of us who have tried to register for vaccination appointments have gone through the experience of filling out several screens of information only to find that, by the time we got to the end, the appointment was gone. So it’s a good idea to have all your data — such as your name, age, address, insurance info, and the registration ID / password for the site — immediately at hand. The faster you can go through the registration process, the more likely you are to actually get an appointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tRD8jU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleague Cory Zapatka says that he highly recommends using a password manager if you have one. He created accounts with all the vaccination sites in his area, even if they didn’t have appointments available at the time, so that if / when the time came, he could just auto-fill and get in right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9bBlc"&gt;And if you do get an appointment, make sure you have the appropriate paperwork already handy — especially since available appointments can be last minute. Necessary paperwork could include proof of employment, proof of age, or proof of a qualifying condition. Since the last one may require a doctor’s note or other record, it’s a good idea to call your doctor now — or if you’ve got access to a doctor’s or hospital website, that may offer you access to the proof you need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dqUcf"&gt;One more thing: check to see if you’ve gotten all the email that has been sent to you by your vaccine supplier. At least one staff member of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; found a necessary consent form hiding in her spam folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wCK4vB"&gt;Watch for news of upcoming vaccination sites&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bDlWg4"&gt;Keep an eye on the news. More and more sites and hubs are being added as the US gears up for a stronger push. If you see a news item saying that a hub is about to open, find the site for the hub and keep checking — once it does open, the available slots will probably go quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rz172X"&gt;One thing that sometimes helps is to look for patterns in the appearance of new appointments. For example, when I heard that the pharmacy chain Walgreens was going to begin giving out vaccines in my area, I spent a couple of days going onto the site, and suddenly realized that there was a pattern: the company was only scheduling appointments two to four days in advance and was adding new appointments each day just after midnight. Once I understood the pattern, I was able to get appointments for a couple of friends, and let others know about it as well. (Note: since vaccine supplies and scheduling methods can change on a dime, this particular strategy may no longer work by the time you read this.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sites like the NYC Vaccine List can help by gathering together available resources in one place." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsRia6ki1VqiuNodQvjKHdK9-ek=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22299690/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_8.47.56_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sites like the NYC Vaccine List can help by gathering together available resources in one place.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gz26d4"&gt;Look for help online&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PgrwN8"&gt;There are a number of online resources popping up headed by developers and other technology-savvy folks who have taken the time and effort to try to make sense of this confusion. (Thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/02/10/covid-vaccine-appointment-websites/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/09/nyregion/vaccine-website-appointment-nyc.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for some of these listings.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Vhk2GI"&gt;An NYC site called &lt;a href="https://www.turbovax.info/"&gt;TurboVax&lt;/a&gt; pulls “the latest appointments from 43 city and state-run vaccine sites in the NYC area” and puts them on Twitter. Followers who set their Twitter notifications for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/turbovax"&gt;@turbovax&lt;/a&gt; can quickly find out about newly opened appointment slots. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="c0AX5B"&gt;Another called &lt;a href="https://nycvaccinelist.com/"&gt;NYC Vaccine List&lt;/a&gt; uses a combination of scripts and checks by volunteers to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22256167/covid-vaccine-website-nyc-appointment"&gt;scour various sites for openings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="111Dwk"&gt;In California, &lt;a href="https://www.vaccinateca.com/"&gt;VaccinateCA&lt;/a&gt; checks pharmacies and hospitals for information about open appointments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZYJAS8"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://vaccinatenj.com/"&gt;Vaccinate NJ&lt;/a&gt; also uses volunteers to try to help state residents find vaccine opportunities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZJic26"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.covid19vaccinetx.com/"&gt;Covid 19 Vaccine TX&lt;/a&gt; is a crowdsourced resource for registering with local counties and finding locations where vaccines may be available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WLYqtL"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.macovidvaccines.com/"&gt;MA Covid Vaccine Appointments site&lt;/a&gt; offers lists of and links to sites with available appointments. A volunteer-run Massachusetts site, &lt;a href="https://vaccinatema.com/"&gt;Vaccinate MA&lt;/a&gt;, tries to improve on the state website with a map-based design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yR8waA"&gt;A volunteer group in the state of Washington has launched the &lt;a href="https://www.covidwa.com/"&gt;WA COVID Vaccine Finder&lt;/a&gt; as an aggregation resource for vaccination appointments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="C1YLfR"&gt;There is also a site that aggregates the aggregators: &lt;a href="https://wherecanigetavaccine.com/"&gt;Where Can I Get A Vaccine?&lt;/a&gt; offers a list of sites available for various US states. And &lt;a href="https://covidshotfinder.com/"&gt;COVIDShotFinder&lt;/a&gt; lets you select a state or county and look for the various vaccine resources available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jdCWU8"&gt;One possible strategy is to use page-change-monitoring tools such as &lt;a href="https://visualping.io/blog/how-to-be-alerted-of-covid-19-vaccine-availability-in-your-local-pharmacy/"&gt;Visualping&lt;/a&gt; to generate alerts for when new appointments become available. These apps watch websites for you and send alerts to your email, text, or even Slack account when new information appears. They can be very useful (and allow you to take time for, say, lunch). But since these are, for the most part, business apps, you may need to pay for the privilege. For example, while &lt;a href="https://visualping.io/pricing"&gt;Visualping does have a free service&lt;/a&gt;, it is limited to pinging you once an hour up to 65 times a month, which may not be often enough if you’re trying to score an appointment.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="nhHjOx"&gt;By the way, if you’re a developer and / or coder who wants to help, check out &lt;a href="https://www.usdigitalresponse.org/"&gt;US Digital Response&lt;/a&gt;, an independent organization which, according to its website, “connects experienced, pro-bono technologists with local government and non-profit organizations responding to crisis.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you are able, it’s a good idea to reach out and help those who may not be able to get appointments on their own.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8mSy40"&gt;If you can, help others&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Kz9AlN"&gt;One of the worst things about the distribution of the COVID-19 vaccines is that those who need it the most are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227531/covid-vaccine-website-appointments-accessible-seniors"&gt;often the least likely to be able to navigate the technology required to get an appointment&lt;/a&gt;: older people, differently abled people, or those who don’t have or can’t afford computers and / or internet connections. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2VOR9"&gt;If you have the time and talent, reach out to anyone you know who may not be able to get an appointment on their own. This could be as simple as finding phone numbers they can call to try to schedule an appointment, going online and getting an appointment for them, or helping them get to and from the vaccination site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Evm4o5"&gt;You could also see if there are any groups that are organizing help. &lt;a href="https://www.westsiderag.com/2021/01/19/need-help-signing-up-for-a-vaccine-a-young-tech-savvy-person-can-help-you"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The West Side Rag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, for example, reports that a group of New Yorkers created the &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScO11RAr7tqHU6LJp_ZNMl5mRbxdg-zc1lO1SuVHBBDLTyJrg/closedform"&gt;Vaccine Appointment Assistance Team (VAAT)&lt;/a&gt; to help their non-technically-savvy neighbors navigate the process. (At the time this was written, because of low supplies of vaccine, VAAT had temporarily suspended their services.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rm5plO"&gt;Look for leftover vaccine&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M5v0nn"&gt;While the vaccines can last for six months while they’re kept frozen, once thawed and refrigerated, the Pfizer vaccine will last five days while the Moderna vaccine will last for 30 days. As a result, when people don’t show up for their appointments, some centers will &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/22229169/leftover-vaccines-random-people-grocery-stores-pharmacies"&gt;offer vaccinations to those who may not immediately qualify&lt;/a&gt; rather than waste vaccines that would otherwise be rendered unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EI3933"&gt;However, running to a nearby pharmacy or vaccine hub in the hit-and-miss hopes that there will be some shots waiting at the end of the day isn’t the most effective way to be vaccinated. (Besides, getting hypothermia while waiting in the cold isn’t going to help.) At least one group is trying to ameliorate the situation: a pilot project called &lt;a href="https://vaxstandby.com/"&gt;Vaccination Standby&lt;/a&gt; says that it will monitor providers around the US for word of extra doses and text notifications to those whose zip codes are near the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAc3tM"&gt;There are also local organizations that are offering standby lists. For example, Buncombe County in North Carolina has a &lt;a href="https://www.buncombecounty.org/countycenter/news-detail.aspx?id=19137"&gt;vaccination waitlist and standby list&lt;/a&gt;, as does the &lt;a href="https://www.co.monroe.in.us/egov/documents/1611179705_09719.pdf"&gt;Monroe County Health Department&lt;/a&gt; in Indiana. Check your local government site to see if there’s one in your area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Fg3eNk"&gt;Be persistent!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JTTPvK"&gt;Yes, it’s frustrating as hell, but keep at it. If a website crashes, try again. If you’re dropped from a phone call, call again (and have a game, video, or book ready to keep yourself occupied while you’re on hold). If you can’t find anything during working hours, try late at night or very early in the morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBXxUO"&gt;Persistence may be one of the most important aspects of getting an appointment for a COVID-19 vaccination. You may be tempted to give up, especially after hitting the “no appointments available” wall time and time again. But until vaccine production is ramped up enough to cover more of our population, and until distribution becomes more organized and easier to manage, simple stubbornness may be your best tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwiVs8"&gt;And hopefully this article, and all the advice it contains, will soon be unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QdqaC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 12th, 11:10AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to include the WA Covid Vaccine Finder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rW1K6i"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 16th, 10:10AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article has been updated to include a mention of webpage change monitoring tools.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Jkqbm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 19th, 11AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article has been updated to include another Massachusetts site and two general vaccination finding sites.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Animal Crossing: New Horizons manga is getting localized for the West on September 14th</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MrQqON"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; is one of the most popular titles on the Nintendo Switch right now. But if you’re interested in experiencing one of Nintendo’s popular franchises in other media forms, an official manga based on the latest entry is getting an English translation this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0oH8Q"&gt;Viz Media announced that the first volume, titled &lt;em&gt;Deserted Island Diary,&lt;/em&gt; will release in the West on September 14th. The manga will focus on what the villagers residing on a deserted island are up to. The manga was originally released in Japan in 2020 and currently has &lt;a href="https://www.shogakukan.co.jp/books/volume/49514"&gt;two volumes&lt;/a&gt; available. &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; also inspired &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7MLd2fJfcs"&gt;a separate manga series&lt;/a&gt;, with the first chapter debuting in the February 2020 issue of &lt;em&gt;Ciao&lt;/em&gt; magazine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0wZ77v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This year is important for the ‘Animal Crossing’&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;series as the original game celebrates its 20th anniversary&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zot7m8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; is no stranger to the manga form, as previous games in the series like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FJAPAN-manga-LOT-Animal-Crossing-New-Leaf-Tobidase-Doubutsu-no-Mori-vol-1-2-%2F313065605706&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F19%2F22289384%2Fanimal-crossing-manga-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Leaf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FAnimal-Crossing-manga-Oideyo-Doubutsu-no-Mori-Shiawase-Tsuushin-Japan-Comic-%2F173875876031&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F19%2F22289384%2Fanimal-crossing-manga-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wild World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also received manga adaptations. Last year, Nintendo also shared a four-panel comic strip on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/animalcrossing/status/1235263744948592640?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1235263744948592640%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2Fcomics%2F2021%2F2%2F19%2F22289463%2Fanimal-crossing-new-horizons-manga-deserted-island-diary"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlLZAg"&gt;This year is important for the &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing &lt;/em&gt;series, as the original game celebrates its 20th anniversary. &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; has always been one of Nintendo’s more popular franchises. Its latest installment, &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;, has been met with critical acclaim, and the entry has provided &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21185608/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-coronavirus-escape-interview"&gt;a sense of escapism&lt;/a&gt; for many players during lockdowns caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Magic Keyboard is still $100 off at several retailers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nQGSsgTaTgKIdrdk9BGvc6fNh0Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68842047/vpavic_042018_3979_0072.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2WwO3t"&gt;With the right keyboard accessory, you can transform your iPad into a laptop. Apple’s Magic Keyboard for the 11-inch iPad Pro and fourth-generation iPad Air can add a laptop-like experience to either tablet. It includes a set of backlit keys and a trackpad. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YprKv7"&gt;At $300, the Magic Keyboard accessory is not cheap, but you can sometimes find it at a much lower price. It is currently going for $199 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0863BQJMS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Magic-Keyboard-for-11-inch-iPad-Pro-2nd-generation%2F984505060&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LDuKNu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295314"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cm7W5h"&gt;If you’re in the market for a new TV for your home, Best Buy has an incredible deal: you can buy &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1728939351250604130" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hisense’s 75-inch 4K LED TV (model H6510G) for only $600&lt;/a&gt;, which is $400 off its usual price of $1,000. The model includes Android TV software built in, four HDMI ports, plus a panel that supports Dolby Vision, HDR 10, and HLG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BUysEF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10265690"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="As8ore"&gt;Over at Walmart, you can grab a new pair of &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-Galaxy-Buds-White-Charging-Case-Included%2F245851301%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds for $49&lt;/a&gt; in white. Despite the product being almost three years old, at $49 this is a good alternative for people looking for a decent pair of wireless earbuds without shelling out too much cash. As pointed out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/8/18255221/samsung-galaxy-buds-headphones-truly-wireless-review-price-specs-features"&gt;in our review&lt;/a&gt;, the Galaxy Buds feature a six-hour battery life, a comfortable design, and include better sound isolation compared to Apple’s standard AirPods. The Galaxy Buds also include a company case that supports wireless charging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KlVX18"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9586872"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>How to stop your emails from being tracked</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nHKkuFlkTI9-ornuyWoyTQgbwg8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68841883/acastro_190703_1777_pixel_tracking_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wmDbQw"&gt;All of those obnoxious marketing emails that crowd your inbox aren’t just pushing a product. They’re also tracking whether you’ve opened the email, when you opened it, and where you were at the time by using software like MailChimp to embed tracking software into the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1f75NZ"&gt;How does it work? A single tracking pixel is embedded into the email, usually (but not always) hidden within an image or a link. When the email is opened, code within the pixel sends the info back to the company’s server. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYBZIp"&gt;There have been some attempts to restrict the amount of information that can be transmitted this way. For example, since 2014, &lt;a href="https://gmail.googleblog.com/2013/12/images-now-showing.html"&gt;Google has served all images through its own proxy servers&lt;/a&gt;, which could hide your location from at least some tracking applications. And extensions such as &lt;a href="https://uglyemail.com/"&gt;Ugly Email&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixelblock/jmpmfcjnflbcoidlgapblgpgbilinlem"&gt;PixelBlock&lt;/a&gt; have been developed to block trackers on Chrome and Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6EFgJ"&gt;There is also a simple basic step you can take to avoid trackers: stop your email from automatically loading images since images are where the majority of these pixels hide. You won’t be able to avoid all of the trackers that can hide in your email this way, but you will stop many of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjXsAd"&gt;Here’s how to do it in the major desktop and mobile email apps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="91Fgwl"&gt;Disable image autoloading in Gmail:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zbqpz9"&gt;Click on the gear icon in the upper right corner to access your settings, and click on “See all settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZEfys0"&gt;In the “General” tab (the first one), scroll down to “Images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="z0QTtq"&gt;Select “Ask before displaying external images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VeQHzw"&gt;Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on “Save Changes.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="yRek5v"&gt;Note that this will also turn off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282636/amp-gmail-shopping-rsvp-forms-inbox-google-beta"&gt;Gmail’s dynamic email feature&lt;/a&gt;, which makes emails more interactive. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Disable image autoloading gmail" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rt4n2w6dt0YA29AkQaJs88b8OSk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18278777/Gmail_settings.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="XrhZKY"&gt;Disable image autoloading in Microsoft Outlook (Office 365):&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MIRvx9"&gt;Click on “File” &amp;gt; “Options.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="132JwF"&gt;In the “Outlook Options” window, select “Trust Center.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bgp9g6"&gt;Click on the “Trust Center Settings” button. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8dvLox"&gt;Check the boxes labeled “Don’t download pictures automatically in standard HTML messages or RSS items” and “Don’t download pictures in encrypted or signed HTML email messages.” You can make a number of exceptions to the first item if you want by checking the boxes underneath it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Disable image autoloading in Microsoft Outlook " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c5oSbMQ9LNmjTkrf0o1boDgulmk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18278781/outlook_6.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sN1ICl"&gt;Disable image autoloading in Apple Mail:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="0n9f5S"&gt;Select “Mail” &amp;gt; “Preferences.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="A7ND3F"&gt;Click on the “Viewing” tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qwEieV"&gt;Uncheck “Load remote content in messages.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Disable image autoloading in Apple Mail: " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3aKO2_n5Ebb00LdepxXPrCAzEn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18278801/Apple_Mail_preferences_2.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="HHDXvZ"&gt;Disable image autoloading in Android Gmail:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="c5Wulc"&gt;Tap on the three lines in the upper left corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="R8HSTQ"&gt;Scroll down to and select “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KjX4Gw"&gt;Tap on the email account that you want to work with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="g1X0ro"&gt;Scroll down to and select “Images.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eEYbil"&gt;Tap on “Ask before displaying external images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Disable image autoloading in Android Gmail: " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0WEEv9FyZisUtRpDpCK4ZFZ-3Xo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18278832/Gmail_a__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Disable image autoloading in Android Gmail: " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SIPHfcdjyw0EzWrK6Vq0BMMkdco=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18278833/Gmail_2__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="xbW3d5"&gt;Disable image autoloading in iOS Gmail:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="eUXclZ"&gt;Open Gmail for iOS, tap the hamburger menu in the upper left, and scroll down to settings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dr88Ar"&gt;Tap the account you want to personalize, and tap into “Images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xTabJG"&gt;Switch from “Always display external images” to “Ask before displaying external images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="lo9CuX"&gt;Note that for those wishing to do this on Gmail’s mobile client, it appears it will only work for personal accounts and not enterprise ones managed through G Suite, for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="M1JF9m"&gt;Disable image autoloading on iOS Mail:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MIPm7O"&gt;Tap on “Settings” &amp;gt; “Mail.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8CgUR7"&gt;Find the “Messages” section and toggle off “Load Remote Images.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Disable image autoloading on an iPhone: " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8J0Rc6S3VmfrsQIy1rnx9Ne4Fwg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18278978/IMG_2A872FA43FDA_1.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Disable image autoloading on an iPhone: " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wqH9jGDkO4JBmuzkqV8X-MeiqBg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18278984/IMG_DFD17EB54AF5_1.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w1Qtvj"&gt;Another option is to use an email client such as &lt;a href="https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/"&gt;Thunderbird&lt;/a&gt;, which blocks remote images by default; the application allows you to download embedded content on an individual basis or allow pictures from contacts that you trust not to send hidden code in their images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06msoO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 3rd, 2019, 3:47PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to include additional information about email clients.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GbvWNJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 3rd, 2019, 7:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to include directions for disabling image autoloading on Gmail for iOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7Bwbn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 17th, 2021, 5:30PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instructions for Microsoft Mail have been removed, and a few instructions updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;You can get a great smartphone at this price, whether you want an iPhone, a big screen, or a great camera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6vCZGK"&gt;If you’re shopping for a new phone on a budget, we’ve got good news: there are more great, affordable phones on the market than ever. Companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung are spreading the wealth of features enjoyed by their flagships down to less expensive options. Other brands like OnePlus are finding ways to challenge more established manufacturers with budget devices that make smart sacrifices to keep costs down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="16ya9R"&gt;The bad news is this makes the job of picking the best budget phone that much harder. Bear in mind that it’s impossible to buy a phone that does everything at this price point; instead, prioritize the features that matter most to you. You’ll have an easier time deciding, and you’ll end up with a great phone that you should be able to use for years to come. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BWHEzs"&gt;Our pick for the best inexpensive iPhone is the 2020 edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Even though it’s coming up on a year old, we think it’s still the best bet for most people.  While it does a competent job at everything, its standout feature is that it should last four or more years if treated well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXvGVa"&gt;If you’re looking for the best cheap Android phone, then we think the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a great option. It has an excellent camera and good software, though its screen is smaller than a lot of the competition at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHj2r3"&gt;What most people are looking for in a sub-$500 smartphone are the same things people want in a more expensive model: long battery life, good screen, good camera, and decent performance. It’s difficult to get high straight A’s in every single one of those categories, but if you’re able to decide where you’ll tolerate the occasional B grade, you’ll find a phone you’ll love.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PEjixV"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YvXuY9"&gt;The best smartphone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="R7dgPY"&gt;The phone that strikes the right balance of camera, build quality, speed, battery life, software, and longevity for most people is the Apple iPhone SE 2020. Even though it’s almost a year old now, it should still give you an excellent return on your investment. We recommend upgrading to the model with 128GB of storage for $449, which is $50 over the base price but well worth it long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FnYJlm"&gt;The iPhone SE follows a very tried and true formula. It has the same body and 4.7-inch LCD screen that Apple has been using since the iPhone 6. That puts the display on the smaller end of screen sizes today and also means the phone’s bezels are bigger than anything else sold on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4OnLv"&gt;It’s a familiar design and not one that screams “modern.” But in exchange, you get a lot of value. The 2020 SE is part of the iPhone 11 generation, so its A13 Bionic processor is a year behind the latest and greatest. (That would be the A14 chipset in the iPhone 12 lineup.) However, it’s still one of the fastest processors you can get on any phone, but &lt;em&gt;especially&lt;/em&gt; one in this price bracket. Normally, speed isn’t something we prioritize on phones at this price point, but it’s nice to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFxDqg"&gt;Why that processor &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters, though, is overall longevity. Apple consistently supports its phones for four or more years with software updates. (That’s in opposition to Android, where getting software updates on anything but the Pixel is still a struggle.) So Apple’s choice of a fast processor means, in a few years, the iPhone SE will still feel snappy and still be supported with iOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XX01cV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BTqdjy"&gt;Battery life is good but not best in class. It should last about a day. Luckily, this iPhone supports wireless charging, which is still uncommon at this price point. And because it has the exact same shape as the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, and 8, there is a huge ecosystem of chargers and cases for it. Unlike many inexpensive Android phones, finding compatible accessories for the iPhone SE will be a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBJCKR"&gt;The iPhone SE has just one camera on the back and just one selfie camera on the front, 12 megapixels and 7 megapixels, respectively. Neither is great by 2021 standards, but both are significantly better than what Apple shipped in older iPhones. It’s also fairly good by the standards of sub-$500 phones, though the Google Pixel 4A continues to win this category by a knockout. You will get a lot of camera features on the iPhone SE, including portrait and HDR, but unfortunately, there is no night mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lM0nvh"&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people. If you think of it on a cost-per-year metric, it ends up being significantly less expensive than the competition because it’s likely to last four or five years if you take care of it. Just as importantly, it’s a great phone on its own merits. You get access to the vast array of iOS apps, Apple’s strong support network, and a huge ecosystem of accessories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="lIP45s"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PmYbc8"&gt;The best inexpensive Android phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ndqid1"&gt;If you prefer Android, want to spend a little less money, or just want the best camera, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice&lt;/a&gt;. Its screen is on the small side, and it doesn’t have the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android and is first in line for updates from Google. The 4A came out in August last year, but it’s still guaranteed to get software updates until at least August 2023. It comes in either black or baby blue with 128GB of storage for $349. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlVUW4"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,500 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software. (The sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special.) That means the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XiTOqY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rrz5GM"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jI4c7K"&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff you probably don’t want. More importantly, it means that Google can supply the software updates directly instead of waiting for another manufacturer or carrier to approve it. That puts you first in line for Android updates and also guarantees you’ll get them for three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkeXFo"&gt;Unfortunately, in a couple of years, it’s quite likely that the Pixel 4A will be on its last legs. Android phones generally don’t last quite as long as iPhones do because Android tends to bog down on older hardware more quickly. The Pixel 4A’s processor is fast enough today to not be a bother, but over time, it’s possible that it won’t age well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zlXbHh"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for less than $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bFMC0d"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;OnePlus Nord&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PWBCf6"&gt;The best all-around Android phone outside the US&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="VceItk"&gt;Technically, saying the OnePlus Nord costs less than $500 doesn’t make much sense because it’s not available in the US, and the company doesn’t plan to sell it in the States. But if you live in a market where it’s available, the OnePlus Nord is the kind of phone that aims for a solid B grade in every category instead of trying to ace one or two. For £379 / €399, it’s a safe Android bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCe0u5"&gt;The OnePlus Nord has a couple of features that are normally reserved for much more expensive phones: support for sub-6 5G networks and a high refresh rate 90Hz display. If you live in an area where 5G is built out, you may notice faster download speeds. But it’s the display that’ll have a bigger impact on your day-to-day experience. It makes everything feel smoother and better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AdWibC"&gt;You will miss out on wireless charging and a headphone jack with the Nord, but they’re really the only big things that are lacking. Battery life is strong, the 6.44-inch screen is big and beautiful, and the software is less annoying than some competitors (though not as clean as Google’s). The £379 / €399 model comes with 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, both plenty good for this price point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5llXq"&gt;As for cameras, there are a bunch of them — maybe even too many. There’s a standard, an ultrawide, and a macro camera on the back as well as a couple of selfie cameras on the front. As is the norm with most smartphone cameras these days, they will get you decent photos in decent light but fall down a bit in the dark. You’ll mostly want to use the main camera, as the ultrawide has a noticeable drop in quality, and the macro is only good for, well, macro or close-up shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ijydf9"&gt;All too often, phones at this price point have some critical compromise you’re forced to make in order to get the feature you really want. With the OnePlus Nord, there’s no big flaw you’ll have to work around. Again, though, it’s not available in the US. You can import it, but it’s not recommended as it won’t work correctly on US LTE networks.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="L6XTYh"&gt;A big screen with timely software updates&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="0TPXKd"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G is good for all the reasons that the Pixel 4A is good: it has a great camera, good battery life, and clean Google software. Maybe most importantly, it has a bigger 6.2-inch screen, which is spacious but doesn’t make the phone feel too gigantic. It also uses Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 765G processor, which means it’s faster than the Pixel 4A and nearly all the rest of the sub-$500 Android phones you can find. And there’s support for 5G, of course, which is largely underwhelming in the US right now, but might actually be good toward the end of this phone’s lifespan. It all adds up to a $499 price that’s just under the wire for this category, though the Verizon version, unfortunately, costs $100 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ll5Zxc"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G has a slightly better camera system compared to the Pixel 4A, thanks to the inclusion of an ultrawide sensor. Google has also made its excellent Night Sight mode automatic and improved video with some new stabilization modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0i98AR"&gt;Otherwise, it follows the standard low-cost Pixel formula. It has a plastic back with a fingerprint sensor and a headphone jack. Google doesn’t load down the software with extra crapware you don’t want, but it does include some nice little touches like a voice recorder that automatically creates a transcription as it records.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CvxYa1"&gt;Someday, not having 5G will be a serious downside for smartphones, but that reality is still at least a year or two away. Even if you ignore the potentially faster network speeds, the Pixel 4A 5G is a surprisingly great phone.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The N10 5G is priced well under $500.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2pPPrl"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qyzV16"&gt;If you want 5G for the least amount possible&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="0wGhHB"&gt;At $299, the N10 5G is well below the threshold for this category. Given its price, you might expect to see some significant sacrifices compared to a $400 or $500 phone, and OnePlus has made a few. But they’re smart sacrifices that add up to a device that’s really quite good for the money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vb4uVX"&gt;You won’t find a fantastic screen here, although its large 6.46-inch LCD does come with a faster-than-average 90Hz refresh rate. Worth noting is the device’s somewhat “tall” 20:9 aspect ratio, which is a little unusual at first glance but makes the phone slightly narrower and easier to use with one hand. Its processor is capable enough, though it sometimes shows its limits. It also ships with Android 10, which OnePlus says it will update to 11, and is only offering two years of security updates in addition to that.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VXW2WO"&gt;On the camera side, the N10 offers a 64-megapixel main camera that’s surprisingly good in daylight and even moderately low light. There’s an 8-megapixel ultrawide, too, along with macro and monochrome cameras that aren’t really worth talking about. It’s not Pixel 4A-level good, but if you don’t push it too hard, the N10’s main camera takes good photos in the right light. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y00B08"&gt;If you can afford to spend a little more, you probably should. A device with better support in the long run will save you some money later. But if budget is a major consideration, the N10 5G is about as good as it gets at this price. It offers the future-proofiness of sub-6GHz 5G support, a thoroughly decent camera, good battery life, a capable processor, and a fairly clean implementation of Android. It’s not a standout in any one way, but as a total package, it’s very hard to argue with its capabilities at this price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="KnMCx2"&gt;The best phone if you want a big screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="T9fywV"&gt;Samsung’s $399 Galaxy A51 Android phone may well turn out to be the bestselling phone of 2020. Its predecessor, the Galaxy A50, outshone all expectations. For the A51, Samsung focused on nailing a big screen, good battery life, and the camera. It got the screen just right; the other two are just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rJX5CI"&gt;The 6.5-inch OLED display on the A51 is bright and vivid, and you’d have to be pretty persnickety to find fault in it. It doesn’t offer the same high refresh rate you can get on the OnePlus Nord, but it makes up for that with Samsung’s great quality. If there’s one weird thing about the screen, it’s that Samsung put a chrome bezel around the hole punch for the front-facing selfie camera. It’s distracting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCdhK7"&gt;The A51 sports nice build quality, though you can definitely feel that it’s plastic on the back. It has a headphone jack and 128GB of storage, which is the number you should be aiming for on any phone these days. Battery life should be superb, thanks to a 4,000mAh battery, but because it has to power that big screen, it nets out to being just so-so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jy99L8"&gt;As is becoming a (weird) standard on this class of phone, the A51 has a regular wide-angle, an ultrawide, a depth sensor, and a macro camera. And as is also standard, the regular wide-angle will get you the best images. The A51 can’t beat the Pixel 4A for quality, but the different lens options might be more fun for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ryPHx5"&gt;Samsung recently committed to providing the A51 with three generations of Android software updates, which is great news. Less great is that it usually takes Samsung longer than you may like to get software updates out to the A-line of phones. Samsung has also started to junk up its previously elegant One UI software interface with ads and other junkware, so be prepared to do some cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNhSDh"&gt;On the whole, though, what the A51 gets you is a very big, very beautiful screen. If that’s your highest priority — and for many people, it is — the A51 is a solid choice.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2021 Moto G Power offers days-long battery performance but makes a lot of sacrifices for it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qq9tmB"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;Motorola Moto G Power (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tXDuyi"&gt;The phone with maximum battery life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="NSb4tw"&gt;The Moto G Power does exactly what it says it will: provide days and days of power on a single charge, thanks to its larger-than-average 5,000mAh battery. This is a slightly different version of last year’s phone with the same name, and it starts at a lower $200 price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H7tVXv"&gt;The lower price tag does come with trade-offs. It includes just 32GB of built-in storage, so adding a microSD card for some extra space is a must. There’s also a slightly slower processor on board, and while it’s capable enough for all of your daily needs, it’s a little laggy jumping between apps and opening the camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8syWIE"&gt;As for the camera: it’s just okay. Motorola did away with the ultrawide in this year’s models, so you’ll just be working with the 48-megapixel standard wide and 2-megapixel macro cameras in addition to an 8-megapixel selfie cam. Photos in bright outdoor light look good with plenty of detail, though colors can be a little washed out. The camera struggles with high-contrast scenes and low light, but all things considered, it’s fine for a $200 phone.&lt;/p&gt;
