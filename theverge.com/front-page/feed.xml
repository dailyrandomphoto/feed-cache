    <title>You can escape this room, but you’ll never escape Google Docs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8JsUKxpR7jx98iUokHTZ8kfkgk=/71x21:831x528/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68595059/Screen_Shot_2020_12_29_at_9.13.21_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mDFCyN"&gt;For anyone who’s been lucky enough to spend the majority of the pandemic working from home, the idea of escaping the room (or couch) that’s become a makeshift office is probably a relatable one. Enter this &lt;a href="https://news.avclub.com/escape-your-boredom-with-this-at-home-escape-room-made-1842427574"&gt;series of “escape rooms” built in Google Docs&lt;/a&gt;, that let you do just that, inside web software you’ve probably become far too familiar with. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AnthonyBLSmith/status/1343965296885981184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1343965296885981184%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;”Part 3” of the game was finally released today&lt;/a&gt;, but you’ll never fully escape using Google Docs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8VyEy"&gt;“Escape: A Game” by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AnthonyBLSmith"&gt;Anthony Smith&lt;/a&gt; is styled as a choose-your-own-adventure game set in a series of interlinked Google Docs. You “wake up” from a mysterious dream in a cabin room filling with smoke, and are tasked with getting out. “Part 2” has you do the same thing in a hotel corridor, and “Part 3” that just released today, I won’t spoil for myself or anyone reading this. We’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21324558/google-forms-virtual-escape-rooms-librarians-games-puzzles-homeschooling"&gt;other escape room games built in Google’s software before&lt;/a&gt;, but “Escape” has an odd, creepy charm that’s hard to deny.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oo3i3AOzkaWQAJcxD_xVY5xeAHA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22203108/Screen_Shot_2020_12_29_at_12.30.11_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The first of many choices in “Escape: A Game”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TXRgeM"&gt;As cool as this all is, Google Docs is not the best place to play a game. Clicking links in Docs can require multiple clicks to actually take you somewhere else, and the new tabs quickly add up. I could tell my laptop was straining under the number of tabs I had open for cross-referencing clues and dialing the in-game phone. What is a nice benefit of playing in a collaborative word processor is the possibility to get help solving puzzles. Both “Part 1” and “Part 2” feature pages that pull double duty as guestbooks for people to leave their names, and help each other solve puzzles. You need to request access to edit the page for “Part 1”, but even without live edits, it’s still handy for hints. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5ItmMe"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JR0gwhfHCWg?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=150&amp;amp;start=150" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pi1xj9"&gt;The actual narrative early on in “Escape” is slim, but it leaves plenty of room to fill in the weirder edges with your own connections. For instance, for the entire time I played, I couldn’t shake the similarities between the game’s smoked filled cabin, and &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;’s “Oceanview Motel”. That &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt; level featured an escape room-style puzzle and functioned as a liminal space in the game that you returned to multiple times. “Escape” lacks the cool visual aesthetics of &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;, but there’s some shared heritage in their weirdness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATnO5x"&gt;I spent around an hour working through the first part of “Escape” and ended it with over 50 tabs open and a pretty weird YouTube history. I learned some facts about dentistry, grew frustrated with myself for not remembering all of the 151 original Pokémon, and became increasingly concerned that this was all a trick to get me to better understand how links work in Docs. All in all, it’s not a bad way to spend some time online&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uoqKf9"&gt;“Escape: A Game” can be played for free in Google Docs. &lt;a href="https://t.co/L5JZqy920k?amp=1"&gt;”Part 1“&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://t.co/TLZI1ggQfl?amp=1"&gt;”Part 2“&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Pxn3DP-w3ohhS6DqWm7WD2zRGYn7Uw-bttUFgzlCNBY/edit"&gt;”Part 3“&lt;/a&gt; are available now for your puzzle solving pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>No, NFL player Russell Okung is not being paid in Bitcoin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Carolina Panthers Training Camp" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kE4eRDFuoPvUOYzwL6ogU1bIhzo=/0x0:3196x2131/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68595057/1268340895.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Grant Halverson/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RXkw8T"&gt;“Panthers’ Russell Okung Becomes First NFL Player to Be Paid in Bitcoin,” &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/panthers-russell-okung-becomes-first-nfl-player-to-be-paid-in-bitcoin"&gt;the headline proclaimed&lt;/a&gt; — and soon, ones just like it started sprouting up across the web, with sports publications, tech publications, and mainstream media outlets alike jumping to tell how the Carolina Panthers offensive lineman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RussellOkung/status/1128149326943834113"&gt;finally fulfilled his spoken desire&lt;/a&gt; to get paid in cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="67uDbi"&gt;Unfortunately, the headline isn’t true. “Not accurate,” an NFL spokesperson tells me, adding that “his people are converting some of the money into bitcoin” after he gets paid in US dollars, just like every other NFL player.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gxC3xu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;More like “NFL player decides to spend half his salary on Bitcoin”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8mtSAF"&gt;Okung’s own team, the Carolina Panthers, also confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that teams pay their players in US dollars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQuhRW"&gt;By that standard, anyone can get their salary “paid in bitcoin” anytime they want: just go buy some bitcoin with your salary after it arrives, which is probably what the company that Okung is pumping — &lt;a href="https://strike.zaphq.io/"&gt;Zap&lt;/a&gt; — is hoping you’ll do when you see he’s repping it online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ci2WqJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Do it, now. &lt;a href="https://t.co/9eAJxcBxLi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9eAJxcBxLi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— russ (@RussellOkung) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RussellOkung/status/1343941366024433665?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 29, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kp8kG8"&gt;It’s not clear why Okung chose this particular startup to convert his paycheck (it does accept direct deposit), or why he’s tweeted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RussellOkung"&gt;fourteen times this afternoon&lt;/a&gt; encouraging his followers to hop on board the bitcoin and Zap train. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POH3o4"&gt;He doesn’t disclose any kind of relationship with Zap on Twitter, although Zap founder Jack Mallers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JackMallers/status/1343961558196641796"&gt;does call him a “friend.”&lt;/a&gt; (Mallers didn’t respond to repeated requests for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IybiVh"&gt;But even if Okung doesn’t have a deal of some sort with Zap, he would have some financial incentive simply by being a bitcoin investor — the more people get excited enough to buy gobs of bitcoin, the higher the price and the more his stake is worth. (Okung converted half of his $13 million salary to bitcoin, according to the &lt;em&gt;Coindesk &lt;/em&gt;report.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHgQSS"&gt;To generate that kind of excitement, it helps to have headlines like “First NFL player to be paid in Bitcoin” spread around the web. It certainly sounds more intriguing than “NFL player decides to spend 50 percent of his salary on Bitcoin,” right? It’ll be interesting to see if any of those headlines change overnight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jiAvHY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyUh41"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YfCBfO"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple loses early challenge in virtualization copyright claim</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WhBlzuFDWgPzYqzREkpMKgKDL4k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68594967/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bQIxyi"&gt;Apple has lost an early challenge in its lawsuit against Corellium, a security firm that offers a virtualized version of iOS for security testing. &lt;a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20438330-20656722-0-117887"&gt;Ruling on a motion for summary judgment&lt;/a&gt;, the judge presiding over the case has dismissed Apple’s copyright infringement claim over Corellium’s software, finding that Corellium’s use of Apple code constituted fair use. The judge deferred ruling on a separate Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) charge, but the result is still a significant setback for the iPhone manufacturer’s legal case. The news was first reported &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/29/apple-corellium-lawsuit/"&gt;by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tUUX4"&gt;In particular, the judge found that additional features within Corellium’s tool strengthened its case for fair use, particularly the ability to modify the kernel or observe and halt processes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7vvTFM"&gt;“Corellium makes several changes to iOS and incorporates its own code to create a product that serves a transformative purpose,” the judge wrote in his ruling. “Hence, Corellium’s profit motivation does not undermine its fair use defense, particularly considering the public benefit of the product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GvbcNn"&gt;Crucially, the court didn’t dismiss all of Apple’s case. Apple has alleged that Corellium circumvented its authentication server and secure boot chain, among other measures, violating the DMCA’s ban on circumventing copy protection measures. Corellium also mounted a fair use defense against the DMCA charges, but the judge did not find it compelling enough to dismiss the DMCA allegations before a full trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpF69j"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/16/20809109/apple-corellium-startup-company-lawsuit-court-virtual-iphone-software-copy"&gt;began its lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Corellium on copyright grounds in August 2019, adding alleged DMCA violations to the case &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21047275/apple-corellium-dmca-lawsuit-copyright-research-jailbreak-security-copyright"&gt;the following January&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout the case, Apple has insisted that its purpose is “not to encumber good-faith security research, but to bring an end to Corellium’s unlawful commercialization of Apple’s valuable copyrighted works.” Still, the lawsuit has been alarming to many security firms who rely on Corellium products for iOS analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82IFH4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504715/google-v-oracle-supreme-court-hearings-android-java"&gt;The Oracle v. Google case&lt;/a&gt; has cast a heavy shadow over the trial, and is referenced several times in the ruling as a preeminent example of successful copyright claim over software. However, the judge ultimately found the case had little bearing on the specific allegations made by Apple.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple supplier Lens Technology accused of using forced Uighur labor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CY-cFBGdj7HTZbhMFWp52ONzTFw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68594678/akrales_190914_3666_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ShKwu3"&gt;A major Chinese supplier of consumer electronics components, Lens Technology, has been accused of using forced Uighur labor workers from the predominantly Muslim region of Xinjiang, China, according to a report from the Tech Transparency Project (TTP) shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k0TLGt"&gt;The report says Lens Technology — a gadget glass supplier to companies like Amazon, Apple, and Tesla — has used thousands of such workers as part of the Chinese government’s ongoing detention and forced labor campaign against the Uighur minority. &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/29/lens-technology-apple-uighur/"&gt;first reported TTP’s findings on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZEGmg"&gt;TTP’s investigation cites &lt;a href="http://archive.vn/nCi0d"&gt;media reports from &lt;em&gt;Global Times of China&lt;/em&gt; and government records&lt;/a&gt;, which allegedly show Lens Technology was sent thousands of workers from Xinjiang to work in its factories in the Hunan province as part of a “poverty alleviation” program carried out by the Xinjiang–Suzhou Chamber of Commerce. TTP also cites an online video titled “Lens Tech Uyghurs celebrating National Day,” which shows hundreds of workers sitting on the ground outside a building with banners revealing the workers’ Xinjiang origin and their employment at Lens Technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pNj2kp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple has denied any role in or connection to China’s forced labor programs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pyL02J"&gt;Many of these workers previously lived in indoctrination camps and are often forced to renounce Islam and learn Mandarin before they are transported to various factories throughout China, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/world/asia/china-muslims-xinjiang-detention.html"&gt;extensive reporting on the crisis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FCRNHY"&gt;Apple has denied any role in or connection to China’s forced labor practices, saying it regularly investigates its suppliers as part of its auditing process and has seen no evidence that Lens Technology has used such workers on Apple production lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3wpns"&gt;“Apple has zero tolerance for forced labor. Looking for the presence of forced labor is part of every supplier assessment we conduct, including surprise audits,” Apple spokesperson Josh Rosenstock said in a statement. “Earlier this year we confirmed that none of our suppliers have Uighur workers from ‘pairing programs’ from Xinjiang on any Apple production lines.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4e51Re"&gt;The TTP report is consistent with that claim, as it only purports to show Xinjiang workers at Lens rather than working specifically on Apple components. Still, it’s an unsettling reminder of the limits of supply chain auditing efforts and how little is publicly known about many prominent tech suppliers, especially as the Chinese government resists efforts from outside independent agencies and human rights groups to investigate working conditions and labor practices in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1A2dCY"&gt;Neither Amazon nor Tesla were immediately available for comment regarding contracts with Lens Technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DoIxwt"&gt;A major &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News &lt;/em&gt;investigation &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/alison_killing/xinjiang-camps-china-factories-forced-labor"&gt;published on Monday&lt;/a&gt; further revealed the extent of China’s campaign against the Uighur minority, including a look at the vast network of factories the government has built within its detention camps for putting imprisoned residents of Xinjiang to work. The investigation also cites an &lt;a href="https://www.aspi.org.au/report/uyghurs-sale"&gt;Australian Strategic Policy Institute report&lt;/a&gt; identifying nearly 100 companies with suppliers that have used Uighur workers outside the Xinjiang region who were forcefully relocated and placed in labor camps. The list includes high-profile brands like Apple and Amazon, as well as H&amp;amp;M, Nike, Nintendo, and dozens of others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qwb1im"&gt;Outside of China, concern has steadily grown over government’s treatment of Uighurs, which began under the pretense of combating foreign extremism and promoting the values of the Chinese Community Party. Activists and human rights watchers have fiercely criticized the detention camps and forced relocation and work programs. More recently, such groups have called on companies like Apple to take more forceful stances against the abuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cyufeq"&gt;The TTP report also says the focus on Apple is warranted because of the company’s role in allegedly lobbying against the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, a bill that would sanction US tech companies for connections to the Chinese government’s forced labor campaign, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/11/20/apple-uighur/"&gt;separate report from &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;published last month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Boston Dynamics robots take over the dance floor in latest video</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XbhOcAe8ewo4gH6Sjf7iDPnwcC0=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68594629/Do_You_Love_Me.2020_12_29_15_04_30.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="puhQG1"&gt;Boston Dynamics’ Atlas and Spot robots can do a lot of things: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/5/10/17341400/boston-dynamics-atlas-spotmini-robots-videos-autonomous-navigation"&gt;sprinting&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20881385/boston-dynamics-atlas-gymnastics-routine-somersaults-split-leap"&gt;gymnastic routines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/10/11/17964912/boston-dynamics-atlas-parkour-video-jumping"&gt;parkour&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/16/16667376/boston-dynamics-atlas-backflip-video-watch"&gt;backflips&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/2/12/17005060/boston-dynamics-robot-dog-open-door"&gt;open doors&lt;/a&gt; to let in an army of their friends, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tf7IEVTDjng"&gt;wash dishes&lt;/a&gt;, and (poorly) get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21144648/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-mass-state-police-trial-issues"&gt;actual jobs&lt;/a&gt;. But the company’s latest video adds another impressive trick to our future robotic overlords’ repertoire: busting sick dance moves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VSmUMh"&gt;The video sees Boston Dynamics entire lineup of robots — the humanoid Atlas, the dog-shaped Spot, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/28/18285923/boston-dynamics-handle-robot-updated-box-stacking"&gt;the box-juggling Handle&lt;/a&gt; — all come together in a bopping, coordinated dance routine set to The Contours’ “Do You Love Me.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gjZ7qGL8PLd1ZHKWOxxc9qoSrOk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22203026/Do_You_Love_Me.2020_12_29_15_04_30.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kNEYtv"&gt;It’s not the first time Boston Dynamics has shown off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2018/10/16/17983000/dancing-robot-boston-dynamics-video-spotmini-uptown-funk"&gt;its robots’ dancing skills&lt;/a&gt;: the company showcased a video of its Spot robot doing the Running Man to “Uptown Funk” in 2018. but the new video takes things to another level, with the Atlas robot tearing it up on the dance floor: smoothly running, jumping, shuffling, and twirling through different moves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2ZdMj"&gt;Things get even more incredible as more robots file out, prancing around in the kind of coordinated dance routine that puts my own, admittedly awful human dancing to shame. Compared to the jerky movements of the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVlhMGQgDkY&amp;amp;t=80s"&gt;2016 iteration of Atlas&lt;/a&gt;, the new model almost looks like a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1344019835341180930"&gt;CGI creation&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Yc4NHg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

The company was originally founded in 1992 as a spin-off from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where it became known for its dog-like quadrupedal robots (most notably, the DARPA-funded BigDog, a precursor to the company’s first commercial robot, Spot.) It was bought by Alphabet’s X division in 2013, and then by Softbank in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmHZDY"&gt;While the Atlas and Handle robots featured here are still just research prototypes, Boston Dynamics has recently started selling the Spot model to any company for the considerable price of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292684/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-on-sale-price"&gt;$74,500&lt;/a&gt;. But can you really put a price on creating your own personal legion of boogieing robot minions? &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Section 230 has become a bargaining chip in ongoing stimulus talks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Republican Leadership Hold Weekly Press Conference On Capitol Hill" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rQ-dYPo7ikgGLkSLwQg6wKuyuf0=/0x30:4000x2697/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68594391/1230017721.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ksQvgr"&gt;A series of unexpected negotiating maneuvers have put Section 230 — a critical liability shield for online platforms — back in play in ongoing congressional stimulus talks. In a floor statement made Tuesday, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) linked a handful of unrelated policy measures to the future of the increased stimulus checks; amongst them, Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, a law that shields tech companies like Facebook and Google from legal liability over the content users post on their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xMGRI"&gt;McConnell’s statement comes amid increasingly chaotic negotiating over the level of direct payments to be included as part of stimulus efforts. On Sunday, President Trump signed into law Congress’ $900 billion COVID-19 relief and government spending package that would provide $600 in stimulus payments to most Americans. &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-from-the-president-122720/"&gt;In a public statement&lt;/a&gt; after signing the bill, Trump urged congressional leaders to hold a standalone vote on increasing direct payments to $2,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="6skZcg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:8777491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SI5Ixc"&gt;By Tuesday morning, many Republicans who previously opposed the increased stimulus checks flipped to support of them alongside Democrats. In particular, both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754927/jon-ossoff-tiktok-snapchat-account-influencer-marketing"&gt;Georgia Senate runoff&lt;/a&gt; incumbents, Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler (R-GA), announced Tuesday that they would vote to approve the additional payments after days of sidestepping the question, creating a difficult position for McConnell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8TaJD"&gt;Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) said in a tweet Tuesday that the Senate has “got the votes” to approve the increased payments. But later that day, McConnell blocked a House bill that would provide $2,000 in stimulus payments to most Americans, citing the need to tackle higher payments alongside other issues raised by President Trum&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-from-the-president-122720/"&gt;p&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXMDZU"&gt;“During this process, the president highlighted three additional issues of national significance he would like to see Congress tackle together,” McConnell said Tuesday afternoon. “This week, the Senate will begin a process to bring these three priorities into focus.” McConnell did not immediately explain how the Senate planned to address Section 230 or election fraud, but tying the increased stimulus payments to the pivotal internet law could undermine democratic support for the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYG9WU"&gt;Some lawmakers fear the majority leader is now using Section 230 as a poison pill to doom the broader package — particularly if it is included alongside restrictions changes to voting rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrN6LL"&gt;“That is an invitation for this entire effort to fall apart,” Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) said on the Senate floor Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c90SrW"&gt;In recent months, Trump has often used Section 230 as a negotiating tool to push forward other policy priorities or tie up unwanted legislation. Last week, Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22197796/trump-ndaa-veto-section-230-defense-bill-facebook-twitter"&gt;vetoed the $740 billion National Defense Authorization Act&lt;/a&gt; (or NDAA), after complaints that the defense bill did not include a provision that would repeal Section 230. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) threatened Tuesday to block a Senate vote to override Trump’s NDAA veto if McConnell did not agree to open a standalone vote on $2,000 checks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oLWU5E"&gt;“Big Tech must not get protections of Section 230!” Trump said in a statement Sunday. “Voter fraud must be fixed!”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Brexit deal calls for DNA profiles to use a 20-year-old email app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ReXMQ7w1-Vlx5LUE_yEh1J_obw=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68593780/netscape.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="js3fyr"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/25/world/europe/brexit-britain-european-union.html"&gt;mammoth, last-minute deal&lt;/a&gt; that will govern the United Kingdom and European Union’s trade relations going forward post-Brexit has been finalized in the nick of time. But some security researchers have noted some puzzling aspects of the deal, including mentions of the defunct, 23-year old Netscape Communicator email software and recommendations of outdated encryption standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rNEDLf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just in case you forget what Netscape Communicator 4.0 looked like ... &lt;a href="https://t.co/573xNdN3ZH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/573xNdN3ZH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Prof B Buchanan OBE (@billatnapier) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/billatnapier/status/1342935639663259648?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 26, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zKgRcw"&gt;The mention occurs in a series of regulations concerning “encrypt[ing] messages containing DNA profile information” between countries, which must be done using a &lt;a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/Secure_Multipurpose_Internet_Mail_Extensions"&gt;specific set of encryption protocols&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="RuUFF4"&gt;The open standard s/MIME as extension to de facto e-mail standard SMTP will be deployed to encrypt messages containing DNA profile information. The protocol s/MIME (V3) allows signed receipts, security labels, and secure mailing lists... The underlying certificate used by s/MIME mechanism has to be in compliance with X.509 standard.... The processing rules for s/MIME encryption operations... are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T55DYM"&gt;the sequence of the operations is: first encryption and then signing,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96WlXf"&gt;the encryption algorithm AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with 256 bit key length and RSA with 1,024 bit key length shall be applied for symmetric and asymmetric encryption respectively,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sa81SU"&gt;the hash algorithm SHA-1 shall be applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U9Larj"&gt;s/MIME functionality is built into the vast majority of modern e-mail software packages including Outlook, Mozilla Mail as well as Netscape Communicator 4.x and inter-operates among all major e-mail software packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="bSJpBb"&gt;The actual impact of this on major day-to-day operations of either the EU or the UK will likely be small. Netscape Communicator is simply mentioned as an example of a “modern e-mail software package” that supports s/MIME (alongside &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/encrypt-messages-by-using-s-mime-in-outlook-on-the-web-878c79fc-7088-4b39-966f-14512658f480"&gt;Outlook&lt;/a&gt; and Mozilla Mail). However, the use of outdated encryption standards is a bit more concerning, as &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/12/28/netscape-communicator-and-sha-1-written-into-brexit-agreement/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hackaday&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt; — the SHA-1 hash algorithm has effectively been broken &lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/02/23/shattered-sha-1-is-broken/"&gt;as of 2017&lt;/a&gt;, while 1024-bit RSA encryption is vulnerable to brute force attacks by more powerful modern computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aGl43W"&gt;The language itself may be older than it looks. &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55475433"&gt;As the BBC reports&lt;/a&gt;, the same text also appears on a 2008 EU document, which seems to indicate that the lawmakers cobbling together the massive 1,256-page treaty may have recycled some old text without reading it too closely. Indeed, as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/billatnapier/status/1342935639663259648"&gt;professor Bill Buchanan&lt;/a&gt; (one of the first to notice the outdated requirements) commented to the BBC, “this looks like a standard copy-and-paste of old standards, and with little understanding of the technical details.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="odIQlQ"&gt;But even then, it’s not clear why the EU felt that Netscape Communicator 4 (an app last updated in 2002, and succeeded by several generations of Netscape apps by 2008, which had also &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; subsequently been discontinued in March 2008) was a useful email application to cite in a June 2008 bill. It’s entirely possible that the recycled 2008 text was itself borrowed from an even earlier time, back when Netscape was still relevant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jZ1be9"&gt;None of this will likely shatter the state of the complex geopolitics between the European Union and the United Kingdom. If you’re going to crib old legislation, using outdated cryptographic standards or email apps for something like DNA results seems better than say, trade tariffs. But given the size of the Brexit deal and the impact it’ll have on the UK, the EU, and the entire international community, it’d be nice to see that it was founded on something a little stronger than Netscape Communicator 4. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google inexplicably takes away wide-angle astrophotography from Pixel phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The regular and ultrawide cameras" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PJxqta9Egd54-qSYt-TzfF1WArQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68591078/akrales_201013_4137_0225.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ILFVCu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;4a 5G&lt;/a&gt; users can no longer use their ultrawide cameras to take pictures of the stars: Google apparently removed the lens’s astrophotography capabilities with the Google Camera 8.1 update. The feature was a selling point of the Pixel 4, and was available on the regular and telephoto cameras. When the 4a 5G and 5 were announced with new wide-angle lenses, the feature was added to those as well. Now it’s been taken away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAOoxZ"&gt;The astrophotography feature lets users capture the night sky by pointing their phone up and keeping it still, either by balancing it on a nearby object or putting it on a tripod. The feature is still available on the phones’ other cameras, but if you go to Night Sight mode and switch to the ultrawide camera, you’ll now get a warning saying “Zoom to 1x for astrophotography.” Before the update it would say “Astrophotography on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQhXLN"&gt;Google didn’t respond to our request for comment asking why it had made the change, but it did update its &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googlecamera/answer/9708795"&gt;low-light photography support document&lt;/a&gt; to add the following caveat: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="iUEaWQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important&lt;/strong&gt;: On Pixel 4a (5G) and Pixel 5, astrophotography only works on zoom settings equal to or greater than 1x.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="FuOwKU"&gt;Taking a look &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://support.google.com/googlecamera/answer/9708795?hl=en"&gt;at the Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;, we can see that this change occurred some time between November 1st and November 7th. It’s slightly odd timing given that the update wasn’t released until &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/11/12/google-camera-8-1-redesign-older-pixel/"&gt;a couple of days later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of a forum post comparing the two cameras’ results in astrophotography mode." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wfb47QYI6FZzfUdkNLdLBexrYEQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22201553/Screen_Shot_2020_12_28_at_5.18.58_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Google Pixel Phone forum user’s posted comparisons of the ultrawide (top) and standard angle lenses shooting in astrophotography mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GkZWAI"&gt;For an explanation as to why the feature may have been cut, you can check out &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/83061074?hl=en"&gt;this thread on Google’s Pixel Phone Help forum&lt;/a&gt;. It has examples from two users, showing the results astrophotography mode produced on the Pixel 5’s regular camera, compared to what the ultrawide lens put out. I’ll let you judge the pictures for yourself. The forum post, however, is another bit of timing weirdness — it was made days after the update removing the feature had already started rolling out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HT4rtz"&gt;Given that the update was out for a month and a half before most people really started noticing that the feature had been removed, it may be obvious why Google thought it could get away without mentioning it in the changelog. Even if it’s a feature that won’t be missed by many, it still stands as a reminder that the software features you get used to on your phone may be subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSCFUc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 29th, 12:20PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this article compared the feature being taken away to Google discontinuing the Pixel’s unlimited original quality storage in Google Photos. That change only applies to new Pixel phones, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/photos/answer/6220791?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&amp;amp;oco=1#storage"&gt;&lt;em&gt;as existing ones are keeping the level of Google Photos storage that was originally advertised&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, so it wasn’t a great analogy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>26 great apps for your new 2020 Windows PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l548wvKMedEUP7-k0GIw5X0NlQQ=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68592778/twarren-surfacelaptopgo-2.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

  &lt;p id="t4RQBU"&gt;If you bought a new Windows laptop on Black Friday or received one as a gift, you may be struggling to figure out which apps to download. Never fear. I have scoured the internet, the Microsoft Store, and my own downloads folder to find all the best Windows apps for whatever purpose you may need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M0Cbu0"&gt;You might be surprised how many online services you already use that have their own dedicated Windows app. I find that the main benefit of many Windows apps is to help mentally separate my life. It can get hard to navigate all of my various streaming services, work apps, chats, and social media using Chrome tabs — and it also puts me at greater risk of getting distracted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GjqWUi"&gt;There are also some services that are significantly better in app form than they are in browser form — and some that &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; exist in app form. We’ve got some of those here, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4Zdi1"&gt;To help you search out the apps that work best for you, I’ve divided the 26 apps into separate categories. Take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2aNq8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ve rounded up our favorite and most-used games, apps, and entertainment. Check out our app picks for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21951417"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21942553"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android phones&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21943103"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows PCs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21952855"&gt;&lt;em&gt;M1-equipped Macs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; our favorite mobile games from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21942272"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Arcade&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21934070"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Play Pass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;; and our top choices for &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21929534"&gt;&lt;em&gt;gaming PCs&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21941056"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21929530"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xbox One and Series X / S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21938238"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/21941004"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.

        &lt;img alt="Duolingo" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e1aqArMt9zr7VQlWSzd2QuuSQwA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22188388/duolingo.jpeg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="y8Rhx8"&gt;Duolingo &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="j9FXbn"&gt;Duolingo is a fun and easy way to pick up a new language with just a few minutes of practice a day. I started using it to brush up on my Chinese at the beginning of this year, and I’ve found it to be quite effective without taking a ton of time out of my day. It’s a nice break. The desktop app includes courses in Spanish, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and more. You’ll start with basic phrases such as greetings and move on to more advanced exercises as you progress. And you can leave in the middle of lessons and come back to complete them later, which makes Duolingo ideal for learners with busy schedules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="89Hmdg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video Chat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Skype" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gLyxiUfFml7JJq-U9fD_Y1Er3J8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19832275/Screen_Shot_2020_03_25_at_11.14.30_AM.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nkXDDz"&gt;Zoom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uYRJDH"&gt;If there’s an app that defines 2020, it must be Zoom. I use this service two or three times a day for work meetings, virtual events, or just chatting with friends. I have a pretty slow and unstable internet connection, but I always find meetings to be stable and easy to start up. (If you’re experiencing connectivity issues, turning off your video feed usually helps.) And there are all kinds of neat features to make it easier. You can customize your background picture, set personal notes on your chat profile, swap between portrait and landscape layouts, and more. Users on the free tier can host sessions of up to 100 participants capped at 40 minutes. For an annual fee starting at $149.90, you can add benefits like unlimited call time, cloud recording, and single sign-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uQ6bkB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Zoom","description":"Free; starts at 149.90 / year for Pro version","label":"Download now","url":"https://zoom.us/"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="flSOgC"&gt;Skype&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GBRVwb"&gt;Skype doesn’t have as many business-oriented features as Zoom does. But since it’s a Microsoft product, it has extra integrations with Windows 10. You can sign in with your Microsoft account and connect it with the company’s other software like OneDrive and Outlook. With Skype, you can add people as contacts and call them directly (you don’t need to send any links) as well as message them. Another neat trick: you can share files just by dragging and dropping them into the chat window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lvGzkK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Skype","description":"Free","label":"Download now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fskype%2F9wzdncrfj364%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="2zbPi5"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gHQ1fJ"&gt;Adobe Creative Cloud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjwDBQ"&gt;The Creative Cloud apps you need will depend on the kind of work you’re doing and your budget. Photo editors can get Photoshop (the best-known photo manipulation software that’s widely used by professionals) and Lightroom (for image processing) for $9.99 per month. Amateur photographers can get the free &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fadobe-photoshop-express-image-editor-adjustments-filters-effects-borders%2F9wzdncrfj27n%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Photoshop Express&lt;/a&gt;, which has all the features you need for basic image editing. Those who do video work can get the industry-leading Premiere Pro for $20.99 per month or the consumer-focused &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fproducts%2Fpremiere-elements.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22179062%2Fwindows-pc-apps-zoom-spotify-netflix-whatsapp-instagram-2020#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Premiere Elements&lt;/a&gt; for a one-time price of $69.99. You can own the entire Creative Suite for $52.99 per month, which includes over 20 desktop apps like Illustrator, InDesign, Premiere Rush, Audition, After Effects, Dreamweaver, and Acrobat Pro. You’ll want for nothing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="F6b60b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Adobe Creative Cloud","description":"$52.99 / month","label":"Buy now","url":"https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adobe.com%2Fcreativecloud%2Fplans.html&amp;amp;amp;xcust=verge"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="eqnfeO"&gt;Paint 3D&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YWQyAz"&gt;Paint has come a long way since you had to use it to draw stick figures in computer class. It’s easy to dismiss Paint 3D as crapware that came preloaded onto your Windows PC, but it’s actually one of the best-rated apps on the Microsoft Store. I use it for basic image work, and it has all of the tools I could ever need. Artists can use the free program to make 3D models in addition to 2D creations, with all kinds of textures, filters, and lighting options. And you can easily copy and paste 3D models into other Microsoft apps, including Word, PowerPoint, and Mixed Reality Viewer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="H0NHo5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Paint 3D","description":"Free","label":"Download now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fpaint-3d%2F9nblggh5fv99%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="LYvLdU"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eFkprF"&gt;Audible&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oF2jDq"&gt;If you’re looking for a way to unwind on a Sunday afternoon, an audiobook might be just what you need. From the Windows Audible app, you can browse a huge selection of audiobooks and listen to them at your leisure. An Audible Plus membership starts at $7.95 per month and gives you access to “select audiobooks, Audible Originals, podcasts, and more,” while an Audible Premium Plus membership for $14.95 per month adds one title of your choice per month and a 30 percent discount on additional premium purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bMSHZM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Audible","description":"$7.95 for Plus version; $14.95 for Premium Plus version","label":"Download now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Faudiobooks-from-audible%2F9wzdncrfj1cr%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="1hYK2N"&gt;Spotify&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="uHxXj5"&gt;If you don’t already use Spotify, you must know at least one person who does. Its Windows app is easy to navigate and gives you access to all kinds of recommendations and curated playlists. I’m not even a Spotify Premium subscriber (I’m an Apple Music loyalist), but I often pull up the Spotify Windows app just to see recommendations for new artists and songs. They’re usually good. Spotify Premium (which gets rid of ads and allows you to play music offline) costs $9.99 per month; there’s a three-month free trial period if you sign up this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ZKc5ke"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Spotify","description":"Free; $9.99 / month for Premium version","label":"Buy now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fspotify-music%2F9ncbcszsjrsb%23activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="MlNOwJ"&gt;Amazon Music&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YoJDxn"&gt;If Spotify isn’t your thing, you might prefer Amazon Music Unlimited — especially if you’re a Prime subscriber. The service costs $7.99 per month for Prime members and $9.99 for non-Prime members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SNNC0C"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Amazon Music","description":"$7.99 / month for Prime members; $9.99 / month for non-Prime members","label":"Buy now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Famazon-music%2F9nms233vm4z9%23activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="sM3uUr"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0CKtKw"&gt;Netflix&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="79ZIt6"&gt;If you’ve only heard of one video streaming service, it’s probably Netflix. Netflix is one of the most popular streaming services in the US and also one of the most popular apps on the Microsoft Store. You can use the app to quickly pull up TV shows and movies without having to navigate in a browser, and the service syncs across devices, so you can pause an episode on your PC and resume where you left off on your phone. A membership starts at $8.99 per month, and which plan you want depends on how many screens you want to watch on at the same time, and whether you want access to HD or Ultra HD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="A6QrTG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Netflix","description":"Starts at $8.99 / month","label":"Buy now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fnetflix%2F9wzdncrfj3tj%23activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="USQeaM"&gt;Hulu&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pZm62U"&gt;If Hulu is more your speed, there’s a Windows app for that, too. Not only can you access some of the most popular TV shows like &lt;em&gt;Seinfeld &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;This is Us&lt;/em&gt;, but you can also get live TV from over 65 channels and can add content from other services like HBO Max and Showtime for an extra cost. Plans start at $5.99 per month; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hulu.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22179062%2Fwindows-pc-apps-zoom-spotify-netflix-whatsapp-instagram-2020#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;there is also a bundle&lt;/a&gt; that includes Disney Plus and ESPN Plus for $12.99 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kF3qha"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Hulu","description":"Plans start at $5.99 / month","label":"Buy now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fhulu%2F9wzdncrfj3l1%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="wQ5iqS"&gt;VLC&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GFsT4n"&gt;Not a streaming service, but still quite useful, VLC is a free media player that can handle all kinds of formats. It’s like Windows Media Player, but significantly better. I’ve used VLC to watch a few different virtual meetings and presentations this year and found it more reliable and stable than using a browser. It includes some features to improve the viewing experience, including equalizer settings and presets for music playback. It can even pull content from DVDs and CDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="1ISmSt"&gt;WhatsApp Desktop&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eDEAKn"&gt;I use the WhatsApp mobile app to chat with some of my friends, and I like to use the Windows app to keep up with those chats while I’m not near my phone. It’s very useful if you’re a WhatsApp user. You can see all of your conversations in one place, and they’ll sync up across devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Wo9jzS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"WhatsApp Desktop","description":"Free","label":"Download now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fwhatsapp-desktop%2F9nksqgp7f2nh%23activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="7JwOCe"&gt;Messenger&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XUGODZ"&gt;There’s now a Facebook Messenger app for Windows that looks almost identical to the Messenger apps for iOS and Android. It’s missing some features of the web client — namely, voice and video calling. I use this app for one simple purpose: to keep my chats separate from my browser, where I’m trying to work, so I’m less prone to distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="X3JbH5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Messenger","description":"Free","label":"Download now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fmessenger%2F9wzdncrf0083"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="n8U8rl"&gt;Discord&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="B51a5m"&gt;Discord started out as a service for gamers, but the company has worked to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308194/discord-gaming-users-safety-center-video-voice-chat"&gt;expand it to more demographics&lt;/a&gt; this year. It’s more common than ever to see people using the service in business settings, fan communities, or just to chat with groups of friends. Not only does Discord provide text chat, but it’s also super easy to set up voice channels, which are convenient and generally stable. For a variety of additional features, you can subscribe to Nitro Classic for $4.99 a month or Nitro for $9.99 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="w2BZKC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Discord","description":"Free; $9.99 / month for Nitro version","label":"Download now","url":"https://discord.com/nitro"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="UytgSB"&gt;Slack&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4tPYzA"&gt;Slack is a must-have for many workplaces — especially teams that are partially or fully remote. But you don’t need to be a business user to enjoy Slack. Anyone can create a virtual workspace to chat and hang out, whether for your book club or your fantasy football league.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UcLDne"&gt;Instagram&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1kJFjA"&gt;Yes, there is a Windows app for Instagram, and it’s actually much better than the browser client. Pretty much anything you can do with Instagram on your phone, you can do in the Windows app — whether it’s viewing photos and stories, reading and replying to DMs, or watching IGTV videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="bEvEGl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Instagram","description":"Free","label":"Download now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Finstagram%2F9nblggh5l9xt%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="hF9BRu"&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Sticky Notes" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GzbRM_De1HgYkNKulHZUCF-7KBg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22176574/image__6_.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j9EI39"&gt;WPS Office &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XpXtef"&gt;I really don’t want to pay for Microsoft 365, so instead, I use WPS Office. It’s quite similar to Microsoft 365 and can open and edit Office documents — except it’s completely free. The Suite includes Writer (Word), Spreadsheets (Excel), PDF Editor, and Presentation (PowerPoint), which can open nearly all Microsoft Office formats (including .docx, .ppt, and .xls, for example). They’re all quite good, and provide a similar experience to their Office competitors. WPS has some handy features of its own: for example, Writer allows you to keep multiple documents open in browser-esque tabs. I actually prefer that layout to Word’s setup — in fact, I would probably use WPS over Word even if it wasn’t free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4IBYqm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"WPS Office for Windows","description":"Free; $29.99 / year for Premium version","label":"Download now","url":"https://pc.wps.com/"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="mOXYlS"&gt;Todoist&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WyUUwd"&gt;If you’re feeling overwhelmed by all of the stuff you need to do, Todoist can help you keep track. Widely praised as the best task-management program out there, Todoist allows you to create projects and tasks within those projects and assign them priority ratings, due dates and times, labels, and all kinds of other details. The bottom tier is free but doesn’t include some features you might want (such as the ability to comment on tasks and set reminders). A Premium subscription costs $36 per year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SR96A4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Todoist","description":"Free; $36 / year for Premium version","label":"Download now","url":"https://todoist.com/home"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="b6UmXE"&gt;Sticky Notes&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="TOT9qN"&gt;Sticky Notes is about as simple an app as you can find, but it’s a great one to try out if you haven’t yet. I use it to write notes and reminders to myself and keep them hanging on the side of my screen, the same way you would with a Post-It.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lW2JGT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Microsoft Sticky Notes","description":"Free","label":"Download now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fmicrosoft-sticky-notes%2F9nblggh4qghw%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="UJb1y7"&gt;Microsoft 365&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="I4FILF"&gt;Of course, if you need the gold standard for office work, you’re going to be looking at Microsoft 365. The subscription-based suite includes all the office tools you might be looking for, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and OneNote. Subscriptions start at $7 per month or $70 a year and come with a free terabyte of storage for all your creations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sRYeyJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Microsoft 365","description":"Starts at $6.99 / month or $69.99 / year","label":"Buy now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fmicrosoft-365%2Fp%2Fmicrosoft-365-personal%2Fcfq7ttc0k5bf%3Ficid%3DSSM_Search_Promo_Office_OfficeProducts_CTA2%26activetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="vGRKzm"&gt;

  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Drive" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X4waYr2PSlAOqMHJ6ye7bLgxk7M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22176625/image__9_.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="G3vEmz"&gt;Dropbox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d1LIpe"&gt;Anyone who uses Dropbox for work or personal use can take advantage of its nice Windows app, which gives you a convenient way to view your photos and documents. You can also download and upload items in the app. You get 2GB of storage with the free plan; if you need additional space, the Plus version ($9.99 per month, billed annually) offers 2TB, along with a number of other features, such as smart sync and full text search. A Family plan for up to six users costs $16.99 per month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dnthVw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Dropbox","description":"Free; $9.99 / month for Plus version","label":"Download now","url":"https://www.dropbox.com/?landing=dbv2"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="iSCxle"&gt;Google Drive&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XKPlKk"&gt;Check out Google Drive for a cloud-based alternative to Dropbox. The free version of Google Drive gives you 15GB of storage. That’s going to be shared between all the stuff your account might have in various Google programs — Docs, Sheets, Photos, etc. — but it’s still a lot more storage than you get from Dropbox for free. (If you need more space, &lt;a href="https://one.google.com/u/1/storage#upgrade"&gt;Google One&lt;/a&gt; offers 100GB for $2 / month or 200GB for $3 / month.) The nice thing about the Windows app is that it can sync your online files with your desktop automatically, so you can easily work offline and have backups if something goes awry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="CoDIhs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Google Drive","description":"Free","label":"Download now","url":"https://www.google.com/intl/en_cy/drive/download/"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="TQw3UQ"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dolby Access&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="95Roux"&gt;Dolby Access&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="K1r9p9"&gt;Dolby Access allows you to run &lt;a href="https://www.dolby.com/technologies/dolby-atmos/"&gt;Dolby Atmos&lt;/a&gt; through your headset or headphones. I use it to customize my audio based on the task I’m doing (gaming, music, movie-watching, etc.) — and yes, you can hear the difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lbkPPm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Dolby Access","description":"$14.99 / month","label":"Buy now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fdolby-access%2F9n0866fs04w8%23activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="kMQh3i"&gt;Your Phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LMfMBV"&gt;Your Phone allows you to connect your Windows PC to an Android device so that your PC can become an extension of the Android experience. You can get notifications, share your photos, make and pick up calls, and reply to text messages. You need to be running Android 7.0 or later to use this app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="36fX6N"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Your Phone","description":"Free","label":"Download now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fyour-phone%2F9nmpj99vjbwv%23activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="azKC7U"&gt;Total PC Cleaner&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="CcDNYb"&gt;This free utility does exactly what it says: it cleans up your PC. Run the program, and it will clear out your various caches, and dig up and remove large junk files. I like to run Total PC Cleaner and similar services every so often to free up storage. Sometimes it even boosts performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="oDpJSK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Total PC Cleaner","description":"Free","label":"Download now","url":"https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Ftotal-pc-cleaner-free-disk-space-clean-up-optimize-memory-windows-system%2F9nb3xctl0rwd%23activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="JZyBXC"&gt;7-Zip / PeaZip&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1QlLzU"&gt;If you receive a file with an extension that you don’t know what to do with (such as .RAR), you may need a program like 7-Zip or PeaZip to open it. Both programs also compress files for you and allow you to password protect your files. PeaZip has a more modern-looking interface with some advanced features, while 7-Zip nails the basics and is a better option for general users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JX5MYV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"7-Zip","description":"Free","label":"Download now","url":"https://www.7-zip.org/download.html"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;aside id="tVJ0B3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"PeaZip","description":"Free","label":"Download now","url":"https://peazip.github.io/"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
