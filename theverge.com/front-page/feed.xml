    <title>The best deals on MacBooks right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The MacBook Air is the most impressive laptop I’ve used in years" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZX5JfVeNbOPhxgT-vEb8Xev40E=/2x0:2039x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69195507/vpavic_4291_20201113_0337_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacBook Air (late-2020).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p1z5Ah"&gt;With multiple configurations and various models to choose from, including some equipped with Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21574057/apple-m1-chips-laptop-performance-intel-qualcomm-competition"&gt;new M1 processor&lt;/a&gt;, finding a deal on a MacBook or Mac Mini is not all that difficult.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5kEtb"&gt;We’ll run through discounts currently available for the latest MacBook models as well as any deals to be had on the Mac Mini. Of course, there are also frequent discounts available for older Intel-based configurations — all of which will be compatible with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt; upon its release in the fall — and we’ll also highlight those when we find them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QDx7u"&gt;Alternatively, purchasing refurbished is another way to save money on an Apple computer. &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/1022323/7613?sharedid=VergeBestDealsAppleMacbook042721&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Frefurbished%2Fmac" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s refurbished store&lt;/a&gt; provides a one-year warranty on all products and generally has discounts of 15- to 20-percent off the price of a new model. Two other retailers to look at for refurbished MacBooks are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738963691650209208#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/certified-refurbished-apple-macbook/s?k=certified+refurbished+apple+macbook" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, the latter of which is currently lining up deals ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Prime Day&lt;/a&gt;, which takes place on June 21st and 22nd. However, for now, these are the best MacBook and Mac Mini deals you can take advantage of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EVXzol"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; deals &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="aqfkV0"&gt;The MacBook Air is Apple’s entry-level laptop. It’s best suited for typical productivity work, with a comfortable keyboard, excellent trackpad, and all-day battery life. The most recent model includes the Apple-designed M1 processor and lacks a fan for quiet, efficient performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FJU3RG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737407"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LZawtk"&gt;The base configuration of MacBook Air with the M1 chip has 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD and typically sells for $999. Right now, you can get it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LNQCX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$949 ($50 off) at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The retail giant also has the 512GB configuration on sale in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5M9XBS/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;gold for $1,149&lt;/a&gt; ($100 off), as does &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RDkNac"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="DTHGG6"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JByVWG"&gt;The MacBook Pro comes in more sizes and options than the Air, and it’s more geared toward demanding use cases. The base model is the 13-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-powered variant&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a brighter screen and longer battery life compared to the M1 Air. The M1 MacBook Pro 13 normally starts at $1,299, but the base model with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage is on sale for $100 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5N6RSS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738975458064148072#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="afDps1"&gt;The upgraded, silver version of the M1-touting MacBook Pro with 8GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LH3F7/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150 off at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. The space gray variant, which typically retails for $1,499 alongside the silver model, is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5LM1K3/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$100 off at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1742946215000206869#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, bringing it to $1,399. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44XxWs"&gt;Of course, you can also buy some older MacBook Pro models, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21256520/apple-13-inch-macbook-pro-2020-review-keyboard-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch mid-2020 model&lt;/a&gt;. The older device features four Thunderbolt ports, Ice Lake processors, a new keyboard, increased RAM, and various storage configurations. Right now, you can save $200 on the 13-inch model at Amazon, which is available in two configurations: a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B0881Z844Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10th Gen i7 Intel processor and 512GB of storage&lt;/a&gt; for $1,600 at Amazon, or you can buy one with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-Storage-Keyboard/dp/B08821TJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB of storage and a 2.0GHz 10th Gen Intel Core i5&lt;/a&gt; processor for $1,800 at Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J3a3Uu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hij1MQ"&gt;If you want a bigger laptop with more horsepower, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MacBook Pro 16&lt;/a&gt; is the top-of-the-line model. Compared to its predecessor, it has a better keyboard, newer processors, and improved speakers. B&amp;amp;H Photo currently has an Intel Core i7 CPU and 512GB of storage configuration in both &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1520434-REG%2Fapple_mvvj2ll_a_16_macbook_pro_late.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1520436-REG%2Fapple_mvvl2ll_a_16_macbook_pro_late.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22399419%2Fapple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; on sale for $2,199 ($200 off). There are other configurations available with more storage and quicker processors, however, not at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zjWXtS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10469149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LYpjlZ"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570046/apple-mac-mini-2020-m1-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mac Mini&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Un7j7n"&gt;While it is not an Apple laptop, the Mac Mini is an affordable desktop computer with macOS. It does not include a display, keyboard, or mouse (so you’ll have to supply your own), but this compact machine is an excellent performer if you aren’t concerned about portability. It’s fast, efficient, and comes outfitted with Wi-Fi 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O9PC7b"&gt;Like the MacBook Air and MacBook Pro 13, the Mini features Apple’s new M1 processor. It starts at $699, with the price varying based on your RAM and storage configurations. We’ve seen the base model drop to as low as $600, which is its current price at &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/mac-mini-%e2%80%93-apple-m1-chip-8-core-cpu%2c-8-core-gpu-%e2%80%93-8gb-memory-%e2%80%93-256gb-ssd-%e2%80%93%E2%80%94silver.product.100694159.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; right now (coupon applied at checkout).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RPnQwi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9712859"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="APBdOd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>The creator economy is running into the Apple Tax — this startup is fighting back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The name “Fanhouse” on a tie-dye background. The H is shaped like a house." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3b6H9XwVqaUOTS2WG2nxLnA3Sqw=/0x342:2048x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69429382/EvRNO57WYAEsngW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The logo for Fanhouse, a platform that lets creators charge for access to a private social feed. | Image: Fanhouse&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VxoadZ"&gt;Apple is clashing with the platform &lt;a href="https://fanhouse.app/"&gt;Fanhouse&lt;/a&gt; over whether it gets to take a cut of in-app payments to creators. The incident underscores just how little Apple understands about the creator economy, with the likely outcome being less money in creators’ pockets — and more money for one of the world’s most profitable corporations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rQfXy8"&gt;Founders of Fanhouse — which is basically OnlyFans without the nudity — say the platform will be kicked out of the App Store in August if it doesn’t start forking over 30 percent of the fees people pay creators when purchases are made through the iPhone app. One of Fanhouse’s creators, the streamer &lt;a href="https://fanhouse.app/breadwitchery/fanwall"&gt;Breadwitchery&lt;/a&gt;, says that cut would mean losing two months of rent from her earnings to date. The company doesn’t have a lot of options to push back, but it’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasminericegirl/status/1402691047940100100"&gt;launching a campaign today&lt;/a&gt; to pressure Apple into easing its rules around payments to creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="D37kCi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I use this to pay the bills for my family.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aMflPk"&gt;Fanhouse is only the latest company to clash with Apple over App Store terms that are increasingly viewed as steep and domineering. Sure, it’s a small app, and its disappearance won’t necessarily cause problems for Apple, but the situation speaks to the challenges creator-focused apps face in the App Store. As the creator economy continues to grow, the rules mean Apple will be taking more money from not just businesses, but individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVCxDY"&gt;“People are using this platform to survive, starting with me, our very first creator,” Jasmine Rice, &lt;a href="https://fanhouse.app/jasminericegirl/fanwall"&gt;a Fanhouse creator&lt;/a&gt; and one of the platform’s co-founders, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “I use this to pay the bills for my family. I use this to pay my mom’s medical expenses.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3EtD4I"&gt;Fanhouse, which launched in 2020, initially slipped past the App Store bouncers and offered payments on the web without issue. Now that Apple has spotted the potential for profit, it’s given Fanhouse the same ultimatum it gives (almost) everyone else: Fanhouse either needs to pay up or get booted from the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="vVpFM6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple often takes a larger cut than the actual platforms&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bc2LQV"&gt;The app only takes a 10 percent cut on its own, so the platform’s creators could soon be earning a whole lot less. Rice says she would be okay with handing Apple a 30 percent cut of Fanhouse’s own profits. But once that 30 percent has to cut into creators’ profits, it starts to hurt &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;, not just the platform. “This money really means a second job for some people, that they have a place to live, that they can afford tuition,” Rice says. “And we tried to explain this to Apple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsCEqe"&gt;Fanhouse allows creators to charge a subscription for access to a private social media feed where they can post updates about their life or publish photos and videos. Creators can also earn money from tips, or they can post “locked” updates that fans need to pay to view. Each account also has a public feed that can be viewed without a subscription, which may be why the app was able to slip through the App Store unnoticed until now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fojC0h"&gt;Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;it’s working with Fanhouse to bring the app into compliance with its rules. The company referred to &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#in-app-purchase"&gt;its in-app purchase guidelines&lt;/a&gt; and said Fanhouse was rejected previously because of a similar violation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ue8vgJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fuckapple?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#fuckapple&lt;/a&gt;, a thread&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I cofounded &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fanhouseapp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@fanhouseapp&lt;/a&gt; 8 months ago to empower creators to monetize their content. We pay creators 90% of earnings. Now, Apple is threatening to remove Fanhouse from the app store unless we give them 30% of creator earnings. This is theft and exploitation.&lt;/p&gt;— jasmine   (@jasminericegirl) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasminericegirl/status/1402691047940100100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ciuIBg"&gt;Apple requires a 30 percent cut from in-app purchases of “digital” goods, such as &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; skins or Netflix subscriptions, though it has a number of exceptions. The figure is reduced to 15 percent for multiyear subscriptions and apps that earn under $1 million. (Fanhouse has more than $1 million in revenue, but it pays nearly all of it out to creators.) And it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/17/21293813/apple-app-store-policies-hey-30-percent-developers-the-trial-by-franz-kafka"&gt;up to Apple to decide&lt;/a&gt; what qualifies as a “digital” good and what doesn’t. For instance, Apple allows Patreon to offer third-party payment solutions for creators rather than use in-app purchases, avoiding the fee. Other apps aren’t afforded that privilege. Apple and Patreon did not respond to a request for comment on the arrangement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="QkpcIF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think it speaks to a creator illiteracy.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wAnZPt"&gt;Apple’s App Store rules didn’t even acknowledge creators &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523332/apple-app-store-guidelines-change-wwdc-2021-fraud-scam-creators-marijuana-law-roblox"&gt;until this week&lt;/a&gt;. On Monday, they were updated with a new section saying that creator-made content and experiences are allowed in apps — so long as they’re properly moderated and monetized for Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JOP5P3"&gt;The problem is likely to become more acute as platforms offer more ways for creators to get paid. Twitter plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447328/twitter-ticketed-spaces-monetization-stripe-approval"&gt;take a 20 percent cut&lt;/a&gt; from ticketed audio rooms later this year, from which Apple will take another 30 percent if fans pay on their iPhones. Facebook is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522706/facebook-creators-apple-google-fees-payment-interface-events"&gt;waiving its cut&lt;/a&gt; for the next year on fan subscriptions and other sources of creator revenue, but Apple will still be taking 30 percent when purchases are made through its store. Twitch already hands Apple a 30 percent cut of subscriptions and tips made through iOS, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/18/20921448/twitch-subscription-ios-app-store-price"&gt;it hikes prices there&lt;/a&gt; so that viewers have to cover the added costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZzZqi"&gt;Other creator-focused services simply aren’t offered on iOS because of Apple’s rules: Spotify doesn’t let listeners &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404273/spotify-podcast-subscriptions-monetize-subscriber-shows"&gt;pay for podcast subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;, despite offering them, and OnlyFans isn’t available on the platform at all because of Apple’s ban on “overtly sexual or pornographic material.” The newsletter &lt;em&gt;Means of Creation&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://every.to/means-of-creation/apple-is-holding-back-the-creator-economy"&gt;criticized these policies last month&lt;/a&gt;, writing that “Apple is now one of the main barriers to independent creators thriving on the internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDAm7R"&gt;Apple is currently caught in a legal battle with Epic, the maker of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite,&lt;/em&gt; over its App Store fees. Apple is happy with its cut: it brought in $64 billion in revenue last year, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/apples-app-store-had-gross-sales-around-64-billion-in-2020.html"&gt;according to a CNBC analysis&lt;/a&gt;. During the trial, Apple CEO Tim Cook said that allowing other payment options “would in essence give up our total return on our IP.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32RExv"&gt;“I think it speaks to a creator illiteracy,” says Breadwitchery, a narrative games streamer who works part time as a community manager for Fanhouse. “Those corporations like Apple, do you not think that if you invest in creators and treat them well, they’re going to be motivated to make more content and make more money?”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former VW, Audi bosses to pay Volkswagen millions over Dieselgate</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Volkswagen AG Headquarters Ahead of 2020 Earnings Announcement" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NLhbQcmAwnJCv_yeUpSv_I4s7oA=/0x0:3854x2569/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69429239/1231393493.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kt3hC1"&gt;Volkswagen will &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/volkswagen-reaches-351-mln-dieselgate-settlement-with-former-execs-2021-06-09/"&gt;receive around $350 million&lt;/a&gt; as part of a settlement with executives who ran the company during the Dieselgate emissions cheating scandal, after claiming they breached their “duty of care.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1IVJrU"&gt;Former CEO Martin Winterkorn has agreed to pay the company 11.2 million euro ($13.6 million), while former Audi boss Rupert Stadler will pay Volkswagen 4.1 million euro ($5 million). Volkswagen will also receive smaller amounts from two other managers who were implicated in the scandal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3w5cZx"&gt;Most of the rest of the money — some 270 million euros (nearly $330 million) — will come from what’s known as “directors’ and officers’ insurance,” or D&amp;amp;O insurance, which normally helps protect executives from individual liability but can also be used to reimburse a company for legal fees and other costs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yn8nYW"&gt;The payout is a pittance compared to the $40 billion in fines, court fees, and settlements that Volkswagen has paid to date to resolve the scandal or the $86 billion it has spent on electric vehicles since. But it’s another sign that the company and its executives, current and former, are still dealing with the fallout of Dieselgate — even if that means paying the company, which &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/volkswagen-ag-agrees-plead-guilty-and-pay-43-billion-criminal-and-civil-penalties-six"&gt;itself pled guilty in 2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="swjdNo"&gt;News of the settlement comes from &lt;a href="https://www.volkswagenag.com/presence/investorrelation/publications/sonstrechtlangelegentheiten/2021/Preliminary%20report.pdf"&gt;a 62-page preliminary report&lt;/a&gt; examining the executives’ roles in the scandal, which saw Volkswagen and many of its sub-brands install “defeat devices” that made diesel vehicles look less dirty to regulators. The board’s report follows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22352646/volkswagen-dieselgate-investigation-damages-winterkorn-audi"&gt;a massive third-party investigation that wrapped in March&lt;/a&gt;, which has not been released to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BHGW2"&gt;Notably, the report reveals that current Volkswagen boss Herbert Diess was in a meeting with Winterkorn in July 2015 where engineers revealed information about the deception. Volkswagen says that Diess, who had just joined the company that month, was “justified in trusting” that the company would resolve the issues raised at that meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="76BpFi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Senate just advanced the beef between SpaceX and Blue Origin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DLcFihlDxkzzunzON-RIoCeRbfs=/0x0:3264x2176/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69429136/IMG_3190.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZZAMXi"&gt;A controversial amendment pushed by Jeff Bezos’ space firm Blue Origin passed the Senate Wednesday night, inching closer to becoming law. Crammed inside a mammoth science and technology bill designed primarily to counter competition from China, the amendment would allow NASA to spend up to $10 billion on its embattled Moon lander program. Aside from countering China, it also marks the latest development on Bezos’ warpath to counter competition from Elon Musk’s SpaceX. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P3Y5Z1"&gt;For Blue Origin, the $10 billion boost is a key weapon in an enduring rivalry between the country’s two richest people — one way or another, the company hopes parts of the funding could help give it a better chance to compete with SpaceX. It’s just one front in a wide-ranging effort to change the outcome of NASA’s watershed Human Landing System competition: the space agency gave SpaceX, and only SpaceX, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;$2.9 billion contract&lt;/a&gt; in April to launch its first two missions to the Moon by 2024, upsetting expectations that two companies would be picked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pa9k5S"&gt;NASA says it picked SpaceX because it had the best and most affordable proposal, and &lt;em&gt;only &lt;/em&gt;SpaceX because it didn’t have enough funds to pick a second company. Last year, Congress gave NASA a quarter of what it requested to fund two separate lunar landers. Blue Origin and Dynetics, the two losing companies, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404528/nasa-bezo-blue-origin-protest-spacex-contract"&gt;filed protests&lt;/a&gt; with the country’s top watchdog agency, the Government Accountability Office, triggering a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412771/nasa-spacex-hls-moon-lander-blue-origin-protest"&gt;pause&lt;/a&gt; on SpaceX’s award that could last until August 4th. Among dozens of counterarguments, Blue Origin says NASA unfairly gave SpaceX a chance to negotiate its contract that other bidders didn’t get and unfairly snubbed its roughly $6 billion proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="US-SPACE-BEZOS" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H-S1w4ZMNe6ZfKAGJjNhBlOmKx4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22647982/1142463068.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jGkREi"&gt;The stakes are high: If the GAO supports Blue Origin’s arguments, it could reset the whole lunar lander competition and delay NASA’s goal to put humans on the Moon by 2024 — the main deadline in the agency’s Artemis program. If the GAO rejects the company’s protest, things proceed as planned and SpaceX resumes — or begins — its Moon lander work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="paEOKd"&gt;But, in its two-pronged fight on Capitol Hill and at the GAO, Blue Origin might not want any ruling on its protest at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xUSGp"&gt;Lawyers and lobbyists for Bezos’ company argue that NASA, at any time during the GAO’s review of the protest, can simply exercise its ability to make a formal “corrective action” to its HLS decision, enter negotiations with any of the two losing bidders, then pick one as a second contractor that would develop its lunar lander alongside SpaceX — without having to reopen the whole competition. If the corrective action plan settles any of the issues raised in Blue Origin’s protest, then GAO lawyers would dismiss the protest. Such settlements are not uncommon — nearly half of all 2,137 bid protests last year were dismissed because an agency took corrective action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsoYRj"&gt;But it’s extremely unlikely NASA would opt to suddenly reverse its HLS decision through a corrective action. Formally responding to Blue Origin’s protest late last month, the agency fiercely defended its award decision in a lengthy rebuttal filed with the GAO, according to people familiar with the process. Agency staff involved in the NASA effort worry that a reversal could set a bad precedent and are concerned that adding another company might jumble the terms of SpaceX’s current award and potentially spawn another legal nightmare.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Then-nominee Bill Nelson speaks at his Senate confirmation hearing before taking office as NASA administrator.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Tyb241"&gt;However, one reason to correct the decision, some argue, would be if NASA had some assurance that it’d have enough money to pay for a second contractor. That’s where Blue Origin’s herculean lobbying effort comes into play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZxwLD"&gt;Senators Maria Cantwell, a senior Democrat from Blue Origin’s home state of Washington, and Roger Wicker, a Republican from Mississippi, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432236/cantwell-authorization-bill-nasa-moon-lander-bezos-blue-origin"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; the amendment that passed the Senate last night. In its original version, it would have vaguely forced NASA to pick at least one more contractor within 30 days from the bill’s enactment and use $10 billion to fund the whole program — SpaceX’s contract and the hypothetical second company’s contract — through 2026. Cantwell had been irked by NASA’s decision to pick one company and penned the language to promote commercial competition, aides say.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sEoAJW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;When we landed on the moon, there was great collective pride in that achievement. Our space program should be something that we ALL take part in. We shouldn’t hand over $10B in corporate welfare to Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk, who are jointly worth $350B, to fund their space hobby. &lt;a href="https://t.co/f1uLPXPjuR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/f1uLPXPjuR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Bernie Sanders (@SenSanders) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenSanders/status/1397619187867062278?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hBBQNt"&gt;A bipartisan chorus of opposition followed, with Sen. Bernie Sanders — one of Washington’s leading critics of Jeff Bezos and other billionaires — calling it a “multi-billion dollar Bezos Bailout” and counter-proposing to delete the Cantwell-Wicker language entirely. “I’ve got a real problem with the authorization of $10 billion going to somebody who, among other things, is the wealthiest person in this country,” Sanders, who voted against the bill last night, said earlier this month. “Cry me a river,” said Republican Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY) in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RandPaul/status/1397663741148286980?s=20"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt; on Blue Origin’s protest. “Jeff Bezos lost out on a space contract so now Senate inserts a Bezos bailout provision for $10 billion for his space company??”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tV6ZB6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“THIS AMENDMENT IS NOT ABOUT COMPETITION. THIS IS A HAND‐OUT”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iynAkd"&gt;The “Bezos Bailout” discourse began when SpaceX lobbyists distributed a lobbying memo to lawmakers last month calling the Cantwell-Wicker amendment “a $10 billion sole‐source hand‐out” that “will throw NASA’s Artemis program into years of litigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYuTvK"&gt;“THIS AMENDMENT IS NOT ABOUT COMPETITION. THIS IS A HAND‐OUT,” the SpaceX memo, a copy of which was shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;and first reported by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post, &lt;/em&gt;screams in all-caps. It adds: “Blue Origin has received more than $778 million from NASA, the Air Force, and the Space Force since 2011, and it has not produced a single rocket or spacecraft capable of reaching orbit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQMfCk"&gt;The amendment doesn’t explicitly command NASA to add another Moon lander contractor to work alongside SpaceX, or even pick Blue Origin for that matter — chunks of the $10 billion could very well go to SpaceX in the future. But the 30-day deadline was seen as a de facto mandate to do so, since creating a new development program in that slim window would be unlikely, and because Blue Origin’s lander proposal came in second place behind SpaceX’s. After weeks of negotiations between NASA and Congress, the amendment’s 30-day deadline was expanded to 60 days, and the funding year stops at 2025 instead of 2026, according to the version of the bill that passed, locking in a concession intended to give NASA more flexibility to use the $10 billion according to its original plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3pYfvq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Blue Origin’s National Team is sticking together through the fight&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1wagGr"&gt;That plan includes future competitions, like a development program that could give companies some $15 million to mature their lunar lander designs, or a bigger competition to provide NASA with routine transportation to the Moon. But Blue Origin doesn’t want to wait for those programs to open up. It’s leading a national team of companies it marshaled in 2019 to build a winning Moon lander proposal. That team includes Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin, two publicly traded space and defense contractors that could decide to jump ship and work on their own proposals for the follow-up awards, some in the space industry speculate.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="TOPSHOT-AUSTRALIA-US-SPACE-AEROSPACE-MARS-MUSK-SPACEX" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SVxz0ZQknL9MN6yvGTwakH3Y_zY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22647987/855377428.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Peter Parks / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LgiqKs"&gt;Bezos’ National Team, though, is still together. Draper Laboratory, the third firm on Blue Origin’s team, won a separate $49 million contract late last month to build avionics software partially to support “NASA’s Artemis campaign of missions to not just return to landing on the moon, but to create a sustained presence in lunar vicinity,” according to a contract document. It’s unclear if that software will support SpaceX’s Moon lander, Starship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VIu9G7"&gt;“Draper’s work under this award may include NASA’s human landing system, but we don’t know yet,” Pete Paceley, Draper’s vice president of civil space, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, adding that Draper remains a member of the National Team. “If we do work on HLS under this contract it will be in direct support to NASA.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zJXI7O"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“no realistic chance of returning U.S. astronauts to the Moon by 2024”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eEnffg"&gt;As for the Blue Origin-backed Cantwell amendment, which survived the Senate, it’s unclear if it’ll survive the House. Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX), who chairs the House committee and subcommittee that oversees NASA, has come out against NASA’s overall approach to getting to the Moon. A spokeswoman for Rep. Johnson declined to offer comment on the fate of the amendment. In an earlier statement related to NASA’s award to SpaceX, Rep. Johnson said there was still an “obvious need for a re-baselining of NASA’s lunar exploration program, which has no realistic chance of returning U.S. astronauts to the Moon by 2024.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4hmbAS"&gt;No one knows when the House could vote on the amendment, and it’s unclear how much it’ll change in the process. Other members of Congress have thrown their support behind NASA’s Moon program. NASA’s new administrator, former Senator Bill Nelson, has been barnstorming Capitol Hill with meetings and public statements since the first week he took office, rallying support for his agency’s Moon program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGzGHf"&gt;“The U.S. Innovation and Competitiveness Act, which includes the NASA authorization bill, is an investment in scientific research and technological innovation that will help ensure the U.S. continues to lead in space and sets us on a path to execute many landings on the Moon in this decade,” Nelson said in one such statement from late Tuesday, after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22457293/semiconductor-chip-shortage-funding-frontier-china-competition-act"&gt;Senate passed the science and technology bill&lt;/a&gt; that the Cantwell amendment was crammed into. “I applaud the Senate passage of the bill and look forward to working with the House to see it passed into law.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Overwatch is getting cross-platform play on PC and console</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gOUofHdQ1x4pUCYyfIoBfx5Abe8=/0x0:1505x1003/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69428919/overwatch_crossplay.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YOn248"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch &lt;/em&gt;launched in 2016, but it’s getting a significant feature soon. Blizzard Entertainment is releasing a cross-play beta that will let PC and console gamers play in matches together. The developer says the update is coming “soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xv8ka"&gt;Until now, the communities on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch were segmented, but this update should make it easier to find online matches to join, whether it’s with your friends or with random players. Some of the most popular online titles feature cross-play support, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21175222/call-of-duty-warzone-battle-royale-review-impressions-hands-on"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Warzone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and it bodes well that this feature may be supported earlier on in the game’s upcoming sequel, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446374/overwatch-2-preview-five-player-multiplayer-new-maps-changes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ChGXQF"&gt;Cross-play is a welcome, if overdue, feature to have in &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, but it might not be all that you’re hoping for. The update doesn’t enable cross-progression between multiple copies of the game that you might own. So, your collection of skins and XP level on, say, Nintendo Switch, won’t carry over to other platforms and vice versa. Though, that might not be the case in the future. In a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/nk6uis/ask_us_anything_join_the_overwatch_development/"&gt;recent Reddit AMA&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; technical director John Lafleur said “given the additional complexities of cross-progression, it would probably make most sense to tackle cross-play, first and then explore progression as a potential add-on, if we go this route.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfhgED"&gt;Blizzard says that in order to jump into the cross-play beta, you’ll need to &lt;a href="https://account.battle.net/creation/flow/creation-full"&gt;make a Battle.net account&lt;/a&gt;, if you haven’t already (it’s been a requirement for PC players, but it has been optional on console). You’ll then need to link your respective console account to Battle.net within your account settings. Doing this will allow you to play with friends you have added on Battle.net instead of friends that exist within your console’s own friends list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2OYWGI"&gt;If you get a Battle.net account and log into Overwatch by the end of 2021, you’ll receive a “golden” loot box, which guarantees a legendary-tier in-game item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjgz7m"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this article said the cross-play beta was available now, but Blizzard says it instead will be coming “soon.” We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook plans first smartwatch for next summer with two cameras, heart rate monitor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fnucD7fqhujWrXj3xEBg2HIDThY=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69428907/VRG_ILLO_4626_FacebookWatch_2_s.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook is working on its first smartwatch (note: this is not a mockup). | Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wO6ph4"&gt;Facebook is taking a novel approach to its first smartwatch, which the company hasn’t confirmed publicly but currently plans to debut next summer. The device will feature a display with two cameras that can be detached from the wrist for taking pictures and videos that can be shared across Facebook’s suite of apps, including Instagram, &lt;em&gt;The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; has learned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dPgSxK"&gt;A camera on the front of the watch display exists primarily for video calling, while a 1080p, auto-focus camera on the back can be used for capturing footage when detached from the stainless steel frame on the wrist. Facebook is tapping other companies to create accessories for attaching the camera hub to things like backpacks, according to two people familiar with the project, both of whom requested anonymity to speak without Facebook’s permission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJqG3d"&gt;The idea is to encourage owners of the watch to use it in ways that smartphones are used now. It’s part of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s plan to build more consumer devices that circumvent Apple and Google, the two dominant mobile phone platform creators that largely control Facebook’s ability to reach people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3VQW0S"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The watch offers Facebook a way around Apple and Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R4BlPT"&gt;The planned device is Facebook’s first stab at releasing hardware specifically for the wrist, opening up another area of competition with Apple at a time when the two tech giants are already at odds on other fronts. Apple has aggressively positioned itself as a protector of privacy by limiting the kinds of data that apps like Facebook can collect, while Facebook has for years been besieged by scandals regarding its handling of user data. That dynamic could create an uphill battle for Facebook to convince people to buy its forthcoming Apple Watch competitor, especially since it plans to also position the watch as a fitness device with a heart rate monitor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pa4RHv"&gt;Facebook is working with the top wireless carriers in the US to support LTE connectivity in the watch, meaning it won’t need to be paired with a phone to work, and sell it in their stores, the people familiar with the matter said. The watch will come in white, black, and gold, and Facebook hopes to initially sell volume in the low six figures. That’s a tiny sliver of the overall smartwatch market — Apple sold 34 million watches last year by comparison, according to Counterpoint Research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kOOhep"&gt;In future versions of the watch, Facebook is planning for it to serve as a key input device for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21418353/facebook-reality-labs-vr-ar-glasses-audio-experiment-perceptional-superpowers"&gt;planned augmented reality glasses&lt;/a&gt;, which Zuckerberg thinks will one day be as ubiquitous as mobile phones. The company plans to use technology it acquired from CTRL-labs, a startup that has demonstrated armbands capable of controlling a computer through wrist movements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4p9P9U"&gt;Facebook aims to release the first version of the watch in the summer of 2022 and is already working on second and third generations for subsequent years. Employees have recently discussed pricing the device at roughly $400, but the price point could change. While it’s unlikely, Facebook could also scrap the watch altogether, as the device has yet to enter mass production or even be given an official name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vUhGdG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook’s track record for making hardware is spotty&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PDSjff"&gt;Facebook’s track record for making hardware is spotty. Its 2013 phone with HTC was a spectacular flop, and it has yet to disclose sales for its Oculus VR headsets or Portal video chat device for the home. In recent interviews, executives have said that sales for the Oculus Quest 2 headset have surpassed all previous Oculus headsets combined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6e7CZ"&gt;Facebook’s interest in building a smartwatch dates back at least a few years. It looked at acquiring Fitbit in 2019 before Google bought the fitness wearable maker. Since then, the social network has spent roughly $1 billion to develop the first version of its watch and has hundreds of people working on the effort, according to one of the people with knowledge of the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ieaqr9"&gt;A Facebook spokesperson declined to comment for this story. &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-plans-smartwatch-with-focus-on-messaging-health"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier reported that Facebook was building a smartwatch with health and messaging features, but details about its cameras and other specifics in this story are new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dMRyar"&gt;Using a custom version of Google’s Android operating system, Facebook plans to lean on its suite of apps and external partnerships to create compelling experiences for the watch, which will include a companion app for phones. Even still, Facebook’s wrist wearable resonating with people is far from guaranteed. Smartwatches with cameras on them have so far failed to catch on, and Apple has cornered the high end of the market already.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some of macOS Monterey’s best features aren’t coming to Intel Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YvzQ-RzNNfKs73oC9dJaR5FRs-M=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69428805/Apple_macos_monterey_maps_06072021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You won’t be able to see Apple Maps’ new globe view on an Intel-based Mac.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4gynH7"&gt;Apple’s next big macOS update, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;macOS Monterey&lt;/a&gt;, adds a bunch of good-looking new features, but some of the more interesting ones won’t be coming to Intel-based Macs, according to the fine print on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmacos%2Fmonterey-preview%2Ffeatures%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22526224%2Fmacos-monterey-best-features-macs-intel-m1-exclusive" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s macOS Monterey website&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/09/macos-monterey-features-for-m1-macs-only/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="96ARyd"&gt;If you don’t have an M1-based Mac — and many people probably don’t, given that the first Macs with M1 chips were just released in November — here are the new features that you won’t be able to use in macOS Monterey:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WAM4Ol"&gt;FaceTime’s Portrait mode, which blurs the background behind you while you’re on a video call&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="peoeQY"&gt;Live Text, which lets you interact with text in photos and images (such as being able to copy and paste an address on a sign)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RaCNJH"&gt;Apple Maps’ new globe view&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2sEh84"&gt;Apple Maps’ more detailed maps in cities including San Francisco, Los Angeles, New York, and London&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mjxEfy"&gt;Neural text-to-speech voices in Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, and Finnish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uc1ozd"&gt;Offline, on-device dictation &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YiEuuY"&gt;On-device dictation without a time limit (previously, dictation was limited to 60 seconds)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="62eMVY"&gt;If you’re still using an Intel-based Mac that you’re happy with and aren’t planning to upgrade anytime soon, it might be disappointing to hear that you won’t be able to use some of the new features in macOS Monterey. These M1-exclusive updates in Monterey also suggest that Apple could make features on future macOS releases only work on computers with its own chips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OAtgj7"&gt;Last June, when Apple first announced the transition to its custom-designed processors, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2020%2F06%2Fapple-announces-mac-transition-to-apple-silicon%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22526224%2Fmacos-monterey-best-features-macs-intel-m1-exclusive" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the company did promise&lt;/a&gt; that it would “continue to support and release new versions of macOS for Intel-based Macs for years to come.” But apparently, that support also means that some new features won’t be coming to Intel-based Macs. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stranger Things is getting a companion podcast and Magic: The Gathering cards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wJlA6lPwUZnnzqOlzn_NGm0ApFI=/750x0:5250x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69428783/A27_promo_stills_022519.0041_R.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NG1KZ5"&gt;We still don’t know when &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 4&lt;/em&gt; is coming, but today, Netflix revealed a few interesting projects to help fans deal with the wait. For starters, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fmagic.wizards.com%2Fen%2Farticles%2Farchive%2Fnews%2Fsecret-lair-stranger-things-geeked-week-june-9-2021&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F9%2F22526144%2Fstanger-things-4-magic-the-gathering-podcast-netflix-geeked-week" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;there’s a crossover with &lt;em&gt;Magic: The Gathering&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which will see Eleven and other characters from the show featured in the game, as part of a “secret lair” drop. It’s expected to happen later this year. And for those looking for more story, there will also be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1402665461687328768"&gt;a six-part audio drama podcast&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;em&gt;Surviving Hawkins&lt;/em&gt;, which is described as a prequel. It stars Maya Hawke as Robin and will debut on June 29th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GT0Uav"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Eleven and the crew from Stranger Things are coming to Magic: The Gathering later this year in a Secret Lair drop! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GeekedWeek?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GeekedWeek&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/rPiTbn2rvR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/rPiTbn2rvR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1402665989506887683?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yTOvSv"&gt;As for the show itself, Netflix did introduce &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Stranger_Things/status/1402664299018035202"&gt;a handful of new characters for season 4&lt;/a&gt;, including one played by Amybeth McNulty, best-known for starring in &lt;em&gt;Anne with an E&lt;/em&gt;. She’s joined by fellow newcomers Myles Truitt, Regina Ting Chen, and Grace Van Dien.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T5ifRh"&gt;Details on &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 4&lt;/em&gt; are still relatively slim, but we have had a few glimpses of the show over the past year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21137590/netflix-stranger-things-4-trailer-character-teaser-missing-return"&gt;Netflix released the very first trailer last Valentine’s Day&lt;/a&gt; and followed it up with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422642/stranger-things-4-new-trailer-netflix-eleven"&gt;a teaser in May that hinted at a very dark past for Eleven&lt;/a&gt;. For fans of &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt;, it’s been a long wait for new episodes: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20683399/stranger-things-season-3-review-duffer-brothers-finn-wolfhard-millie-bobby-brown-david-harbour"&gt;the third season came out in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 12 Beta 2 has a new way of managing Wi-Fi connections</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5PcaCJ3D7TZauszmqnOoDAu7Lfw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69428732/vpavic_210517_4586_0027.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo composite by Amelia Holowaty Krales and Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9RBzig"&gt;Google has announced that it is rolling out the second beta for Android 12 to Pixel phones today. It adds a few more of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;Android 12 features that were announced at Google I/O&lt;/a&gt; last month but weren’t included in the first beta. But it also has a couple of newer features, including a new way to manage your internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNOSlM"&gt;In Quick Settings, Android 12 now has a new button called “Internet” that replaces the old Wi-Fi button. Tap it and you’ll get a screen that will let you switch between Wi-Fi networks and also shows your current cellular connection (which you can also toggle).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new Internet settings in Android 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tVcLd8qzCsajmr3EB8U2W7qvjWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646127/Untitled.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Internet settings in Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="F21foz"&gt;Google says the idea is to help users “switch between their Internet providers and troubleshoot network connectivity issues more easily.” Google’s post asks readers to “Let us know what you think,” a sign that maybe this UX might not be a sure thing. Google often introduces and then backtracks on new user interface ideas during Android betas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lOGKY"&gt;Android 12 is also picking up a “Clipboard read notification,” which will appear any time an app reads the current clipboard. It shows up when one app reads the clipboard from something you’ve copied in another app. In other words, it won’t annoyingly pop up if you copy and paste within the same app. Unlike other notifications, this one will apparently appear from the bottom of the screen. It’s similar to a feature that arrived first on the iPhone, as more people realized that apps were asking for clipboard content when they really shouldn’t be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xWCzep"&gt;Those are the two new features, but there are a few more that Google announced but didn’t include in the first beta. The first is the Privacy Dashboard, which lets a user see how often apps request to use a phone’s microphone, camera, and location. Apple, by the way, just announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22502877/apple-app-privacy-report-ip-hiding-safari-mail-wwdc"&gt;a similar dashboard for iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; — though it includes a few more data points than Android’s. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Privacy Dashboard on Android 12" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o8VTHStoPvguK58c-MSkTn8wOyI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646153/android12privacydashboard.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Privacy Dashboard on Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fhi7bH"&gt;Google is also turning on previously announced privacy features related to the microphone and camera. When either is on, an indicator will be displayed in the upper right of the status bar. Android 12 will also now have toggles in Quick Settings to turn those sensors off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5kAU7J"&gt;It’s a neat system. If you disable either the mic or the camera in quick settings, the next time an app tries to access one, the system will ask if you want to turn them back on. If you decline, then the app will &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; it has camera or mic access, but all it actually sees is darkness and all it hears is silence. It is, as I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;noted in my original Android 12 preview&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;em&gt;mood&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f975RG"&gt;With this release, Google is keeping pace with its roadmap to release Android 12 this fall. Expect a couple more betas to land before the final release. This beta is available on Pixel phones now, and when the final update is released, it’ll hit Pixel phones first. When other phones will get updated remains an open — and vexing — question. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;Since this version of Android has the biggest redesign in years&lt;/a&gt;, don’t be surprised if other smartphone makers need a little more time to figure out how to apply their own styles to the new “Material You” design system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>Apple Podcasts says it’ll launch in-app subscriptions globally on June 15th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hB1oWJ8BHUxYyRIB0LSpudZZhEc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69428704/acastro_210429_1777_epicApple_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JMmkd8"&gt;After some major hiccups and a delay, Apple Podcasts says it’s launching in-app subscriptions next week. The global launch of subscriptions and channels, which are groups of shows, will happen on June 15th, the company said today in an email to podcasters, which &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has viewed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ceJe91"&gt;Apple first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;debuted in-app subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; in April with a launch planned for May. It then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22459129/apple-delays-podcasts-subscriptions-june"&gt;emailed creators&lt;/a&gt; to tell them the feature launch would be pushed to June to “ensure we are delivering the best experience for creators and listeners,” likely because of issues the company introduced with a recent backend update. Through the feature, listeners can subscribe to certain shows or networks for early access and ad-free content, among other perks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oNwBmt"&gt;Beyond this rollout being delayed, podcasters have complained that Apple’s latest Podcasts update, made in preparation for the subscription offerings, completely bonked the system. &lt;a href="https://podnews.net/article/apple-podcasts-lemon-bugs?utm_source=podnews.net&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_campaign=podnews.net:2021-05-28"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Podnews&lt;/em&gt; wrote&lt;/a&gt; two weeks ago that multiple creators experienced a range of issues, including their episodes being delayed, their analytics breaking, and artwork going missing. Hopefully Apple will have all that sorted prior to this rollout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VxiQLL"&gt;Meanwhile, Spotify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404273/spotify-podcast-subscriptions-monetize-subscriber-shows"&gt;announced and launched&lt;/a&gt; its plan for subscription podcasts in the time since Apple debuted its product and delayed the release. Spotify’s solution doesn’t allow people to subscribe in-app, thereby allowing the creators and the company to skirt around Apple’s App Store fees. Instead, listeners have to navigate to an external Anchor webpage. Though that also puts a big hurdle between creators and potential subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ItxBMa"&gt;Apple’s big idea is that putting a subscribe button in the podcast app could draw more premium listeners to various services, like Luminary and Wondery Plus. Those groups have had to get over the hurdle of making people subscribe in an app separate from their usual listening platform. Starting this month, we’ll finally see how powerful a subscribe button might be. &lt;/p&gt;
