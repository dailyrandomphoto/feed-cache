    <title>Here’s where to buy AMD’s Radeon RX 6700 XT graphics card </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zVPNQ3"&gt;AMD’s new Radeon RX 6700 XT GPU will be available to purchase today starting at 6AM PT / 9AM ET, with a retail price of $479.99. Like other GPUs released within the last few months, AMD’s latest Radeon RX graphics card will likely sell out quickly, though AMD tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that you &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be able to buy this graphics card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJPSYV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; Sean Hollister &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/3/17/22334662/amd-radeon-rx-6700-xt-review-gpu-graphics-card"&gt;reviewed the RX 6700 XT&lt;/a&gt; and noted in his review that the GPU is a solid performer that delivers a 1440p experience for most games, but the performance is not quite as good when compared to Nvidia's 3060 Ti and RTX 3070 cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f2iQMu"&gt;So far, only Micro Center has listings up for various iterations of AMD’s Radeon RX 6700 XT GPU. We will continue to update the list of cards and retailers selling them as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WallStreetBets donates more than $350,000 to gorilla charity to prove ‘apes together strong’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Congo Battles To Save Wildlife After Years Of War And Poaching" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J6rACJbevgH9H1oRzohQ11n6_5o=/0x3:3000x2003/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986413/71495571.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nj78JL"&gt;“Apes together strong” is one of the mottoes of Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets community. Now, members of the financial subreddit are making good on one of their favorite memes by donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to charities supporting gorillas in the wild.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HZHVb"&gt;The most prominent recipient of the redditors’ generosity is the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund, whose president and CEO Tara Stoinski describes it as “the world’s largest and longest running organization that is fully dedicated to gorilla conservation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPCygv"&gt;The fund has so far received more than $350,000 in donations, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56416954"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, with redditors adopting approximately 3,500 endangered gorillas in six days. For comparison, the charity says it usually registers 20 adoptions in a typical weekend. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xKUjbc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They’ve truly made a difference for our world”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wjV4dN"&gt;Stoinski told &lt;em&gt;BBC News&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“They’ve truly made a difference for our world and shown what can be accomplished when people come together. When we save gorillas and we save forests, we save our world.” In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SavingGorillas/status/1371507425346523136"&gt;tweet&lt;/a&gt;, the charity said that all the funds “will go straight into our field programs, where 365 days a year we’re tracking, monitoring and studying wild gorillas and their habitat, and helping people who share their first home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PNp9EM"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created='"2021-03-18T11:43:59.940375+00:00"'&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m4i2ib/a_message_to_wsb_from_the_director_of_the_dian/?ref_source=embed&amp;amp;ref=share"&gt;A message to WSB from the Director of the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund!&lt;/a&gt; from
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/"&gt;wallstreetbets&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;script async="" src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="svFuy6"&gt;Stoinski posted a video to r/WallStreetBets earlier this week, thanking the community’s members for their donations. Commenters responded with enthusiasm and joy. “Apes supporting apes,” noted one. “Just a bunch of degenerative apes protecting their own species,” said another. The Dian Fossey Fund is returning the redditors’ meme-laden good wishes, updating its &lt;a href="https://gorillafund.org/"&gt;homepage&lt;/a&gt; to feature the slogan: “Apes together strong.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="snPmEr"&gt;The slogan itself is a &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/apes-together-strong"&gt;meme&lt;/a&gt; taken from the 2011 film &lt;em&gt;Rise of the Planet of the Apes&lt;/em&gt;, but has been embraced by members of r/WallStreetBets, who see their coordinated financial action as proof that an army of “dumb” day traders can outsmart the “geniuses” of Wall Street. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XhfaM"&gt;The subreddit is notable for numerous inside jokes, many of which found their way into the group’s support for gorillas. Redditors sharing their donations to Dian Fossey fund have variously signed off as “Harambe GameStop,” “Wall St Bets Ape,” and “Karl Tendiekong.” (The latter is a reference to the community’s idolization of chicken tenders, or tendies; the only meal fit to celebrate hearty profits after a hard day trading.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yGZIRw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; WE HAVE NEWS   It’s safe to say that the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/investor?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#investor&lt;/a&gt; community on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reddit?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@reddit&lt;/a&gt; is not traditionally who we think of as our supporter base. But they definitely surprised and overwhelmed us over the weekend. A THREAD. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CNN?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CNN&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CNBC?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@CNBC&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/business?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@business&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WSJ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@WSJ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/JRB1Gj1Mub"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JRB1Gj1Mub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund (@SavingGorillas) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SavingGorillas/status/1371507415754145793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hyurb3"&gt;The subreddit shot to fame this January when members &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;piled their money into GameStop stock&lt;/a&gt;, hoping to undermine the financial positions of various hedge funds which had been shorting the retailer. Since then, GameStop’s stock has rocketed up and down, making some millions and losing others just as much. Many commenters responding to Stoinski’s video said they’d specifically donated a portion of their profits from trading GameStop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ygcs1P"&gt;It’s hard to summarize the outcome of WallStreeBets’ memefication of the stock markets, but for many experts, it changes very little. In the case of GameStop, financial journalist Matt Levine &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-04/elon-musk-s-gamestop-tweets-are-now-a-hedge-fund-signal"&gt;noted in February&lt;/a&gt; that while some hedge funds shorting the stock lost money and some redditors who got in early made lots, other hedge funds who predicted when the stock would fall &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; made money, while plenty of redditors who got in late &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; lost it. The basic mechanism of what happened, says Levine, “is that Reddit correctly noticed that &lt;em&gt;if everyone buys a stock then it will go up&lt;/em&gt;, and then they all did that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYNNgh"&gt;Is there a lesson in all this? It probably depends on whether the person asking lost or made money. But as the flood of donations to the Dian Fossey fund proves: at least the gorillas are getting something out of it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS developer who drew attention to App Store scams is now suing Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P8VOytbQjhwM4pNFyhhTl9_Tr0A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986294/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Be9Nie"&gt;Mobile app developer Kosta Eleftheriou, who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;publicly called out Apple earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; for negligence with regard to policing iOS scams and copycat apps on the App Store, has filed a lawsuit against the iPhone maker in California. He’s accusing the company of exploiting its monopoly power over iOS apps “to make billions of dollars in profits at the expense of small application developers and consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6IHJA"&gt;Eleftheriou’s company KPAW LLC, which he co-owns with his partner Ashley Eleftheriou, filed its complaint in Santa Clara County on Wednesday. It details the development and release timeline of Eleftheriou’s Apple Watch keyboard app FlickType. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jIZ8V"&gt;At the time he began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272849/apple-app-store-scams-ios-fraud-reviews-ratings-flicktype"&gt;accusing Apple of abetting App Store scams&lt;/a&gt; early last month, Eleftheriou revealed that his FlickType app had been targeted by competing software he says either didn’t work well or didn’t work at all, and yet nonetheless chipped away at this sales and App Store rankings through false advertising and the purchase of fake reviews. After he complained, he said Apple did not do enough to combat the scams, though Apple did later remove some of the apps he called attention to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bTOuKZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The App Store has a big problem &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You: an honest developer, working hard to improve your IAP conversions.&lt;br&gt;Your competitor: a $2M/year scam running rampant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1/ &lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1356011069395755009?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iCwzu7"&gt;Eleftheriou’s claims join a chorus of growing complaints against Apple and the App Store. Some developers, competing tech companies, regulators, and now state lawmakers have accused the mobile marketplace of being a monopoly in software distribution that harms competition and keeps consumers paying higher prices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SngFHz"&gt;Epic Games, the maker of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;targeting both Apple and Google with antitrust lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; over the removal of the battle royale game last summer for use of an alternative in-app payment system. Meanwhile, a group of app makers, ranging from Epic to Spotify to Tinder parent company Match Group, have begun lobbying state lawmakers to take up the fight against the App Store and Google Play Store, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22309284/arizona-app-store-bill-2005-apple-30-percent-cut-bypass-legislation"&gt;surprising success so far in Arizona&lt;/a&gt; and numerous other bills around the country in the works, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mff1OQ"&gt;In the complaint, Eleftheriou goes further into detail about what he claims is wrongful behavior from Apple, including alleged false advertising, breach of its developer agreement, and fraud. One notable claim involves Apple trying to acquire FlickType, after which Eleftheriou says he faced “roadblock after roadblock” to selling his software on the App Store. The complaint suggests Apple chose not to take action on scam and copycat apps in an effort to force Eleftheriou to sell his app to Apple. “Evidently, Apple thought Plaintiff would simply give up and sell its application to Apple at a discount,” the complaint reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cakQJk"&gt;At the heart of the dispute appears to be conversations Eleftheriou had with an Apple executive Randy Marsden, who led mobile keyboard technology at the company and later held the position of Text Input Special Projects Manager. Marsden is well known in the tech industry for co-founding the keyboard technology startup Swype, and for later co-founding the app Dryft, which was &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/04/08/apple-quietly-bought-dryft-a-keyboard-app/"&gt;acquired by Apple in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. The acquisition resulted in Marsden being put in charge of the iOS keyboard at Apple from 2014 to 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MGygaY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple systematically flexes its monopoly muscle against potential competition through the App Store”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G8H2CO"&gt;Eleftheriou says he was approached by Marsden, who expressed interest in having Apple acquire his software to improve typing on the Apple Watch. Yet, the negotiations went quiet, and afterward, Eleftheriou claims Apple removed his FlickType keyboard app and refused to approve future versions as well as a note-taking variant, on what he thinks are suspicious grounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mu2UYd"&gt;Only later did Apple permit both apps after months of appeals and after Eleftheriou let countless other app makers integrate his technology. Those apps using the FlickType tech were approved without issue, the complaint says. Meanwhile, many other wearable and mobile keyboard apps Eleftheriou characterizes as scams were also approved and allowed on the App Store. “By this time, Apple’s wrongful rejections had already cost Plaintiff over a year of revenue,” the complaint reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="462hBJ"&gt;Eleftheriou’s complaint says this is evidence of Apple “flexing its monopoly muscle against potential competition”: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="z21d1N"&gt;Apple entices software application developers like Plaintiff to develop innovative applications with the promise of a fair and secure App Store in which to sell them. In truth, Apple systematically flexes its monopoly muscle against potential competition through the App Store and profits from rampant fraudulent practices. If Apple cannot buy a desired application from a developer on the cheap, Apple attempts to crush that developer through exploitive fees and selective application of opaque and unreasonable constraints against the developer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXDx4A"&gt; At the same time, Apple permits other developers that Apple does not view as real competition, including scam competitors, to peddle similar, inferior products because Apple profits from their sales. Scammers oftentimes use screenshots and videos taken from legitimate developer’s applications and manipulate their ratings. Apple does little to police these practices because it profits from them. Apple then lies to its regulators by asserting that it must maintain its monopoly power over the sale of Apple-related applications to protect consumers, when, in fact, Apple lets them get ripped off and exploits the developers trying to deliver innovation to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="A9h9uq"&gt;Eleftheriou says even after his app became the No. 1 paid app on the App Store after it was approved, earning him $130,000 in its first month of release, he had to face down a wave of scam apps and copycat software that targeted FlickType after its visible success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oiHVGV"&gt;“Despite possessing massive resources and technological savvy, Apple intentionally fails to police these fraudsters, costing honest developers millions, and perhaps billions, while Apple continues to amass huge profits for itself,” the complaint reads. “Apple holds both its device users and developers hostage. Yet each time it faces antitrust claims, Apple justifies its monopoly by claiming it is necessary to protect its users and developers from unscrupulous conduct and ensure a fair competitive marketplace for the benefit of both. In truth, Apple turns a blind eye to rampant fraud and exploitation to make an easy profit.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZuPiN"&gt;Eleftheriou is accusing Apple of false advertising, unfair competition in violation of California’s business and professions code, breach of good faith and fair dealing with regard to the Apple Developer Program License Agreement, fraud, and negligence and negligent misrepresentation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5H0Fr"&gt;Apple was not immediately available for comment.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony announces new PS5 VR controllers with adaptive triggers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P8akL2XuFWEgzy0go6yAsdiBI60=/85x0:1003x612/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986292/03_withnotice.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XL7Gm7"&gt;Sony is revealing its new VR controllers for the PS5 today. The orb-shaped controllers look more like typical VR controllers than existing PlayStation Move motion controllers, and they also include the same adaptive trigger technology found on the DualSense PS5 controller. Each controller has tensions in the triggers, and Sony is aiming to use this tech in future VR games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0Tvm4"&gt;The controllers also have haptic feedback, and finger touch detection that will let them detect fingers without having to press areas where you rest your thumb, index, or middle fingers. “This enables you to make more natural gestures with your hands during gameplay,” &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/03/18/next-gen-vr-on-ps5-the-new-controller/"&gt;says Hideaki Nishino&lt;/a&gt;, head of platform planning and management at PlayStation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G_VIEOz49aPW9CuqGp6NF7432Kg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22379638/01_withnotice_scaled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s new PS5 VR controllers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IYStA-oWU5Jj8LBdE2F3QKauCxE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22379639/04_withnotice_scaled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each controller has haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mNepXH"&gt;Naturally, these controllers will also include tracking to Sony’s new VR headset via a ring at the bottom of the controller. These certainly look far improved over what’s currently available on the PS Move controllers, with better ergonomics, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WrGNkc"&gt;“SIE’s Product, Engineering, and Design teams have collaborated to build our new VR controller from the ground up with a goal of making a huge leap from current-gen VR gaming,” says Nishino. “Prototypes of our new VR controller will be in the hands of the development community soon, and we can’t wait to see what ideas they come up with and how the controller helps bring their imagination to life!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="001YKX"&gt;Sony hasn’t shown off the design of its next-gen VR headset for the PS5 just yet, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296998/sony-ps5-next-gen-vr-headset-virtual-reality-features"&gt;company did reveal&lt;/a&gt; it has an improved field of view, resolution, and even a single cord to make it easier to use. Sony isn’t planning to launch its VR headset for the PS5 in 2021, but it’s clear the company is getting ready to test it with game developers soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OnePlus 9 Pro supports seriously fast 50W wireless charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dG01GnSbVB8Nosjmfthf-AFsIbo=/59x0:1942x1255/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986172/OP_charge_white.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With a new wireless charger, the OnePlus 9 Pro can charge in either portrait or landscape orientation.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: OnePlus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OyFUhs"&gt;It’s not often that the actual spec is better than the rumor, but that’s the case here: the OnePlus 9 Pro supports 50W wireless charging — a little faster than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213390/oneplus-9-pro-45-watt-wireless-charging-reverse"&gt;45W rumor we reported on&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. We’ve been able to test drive this feature ahead of the phone’s official debut on March 23rd and can confirm: the 9 Pro offers really, really fast wireless charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1udiA"&gt;OnePlus claims that the phone will charge wirelessly (with the new Warp Charge 50 charger) from 1 to 100 percent in 43 minutes, and our own testing confirmed this down to the minute. That’s a big boost over the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219525/oneplus-8-wireless-charger-warp-price-specs-release-date"&gt;OnePlus 8 Pro’s 30W wireless charging&lt;/a&gt;, which supplied a 50 percent charge in 30 minutes. The improvements aren’t limited to wireless charging, or the 9 Pro for that matter; the 9 and 9 Pro have 65W wired charging that takes the battery from empty to full in 29 minutes. While the base model OnePlus 9 doesn’t get those fast wireless speeds, it can be used with the new charger at up to 15W. Additionally, both the 9 and 9 Pro support standard Qi wireless charging at 15W.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6u9e5nAlDJmvfBFl4hiaOnAeuOM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22378643/OnePlus_9_Pro_Warp_Charge_50_Wireless_Dock_Dark.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Warp Charge 50 wireless charger now features a detachable cable based on user feedback.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2yw65a"&gt;Fast charging has definitely been OnePlus’ “thing” for a while, and according to Kinder Liu, COO and head of R&amp;amp;D, it’s been a hit with customers. “Since introducing our first fast-charging technology with the OnePlus 3, we have heard a lot of positive feedback, with many OnePlus users saying it has fundamentally changed the way they charge their devices. They can simply top up for a day’s charge while getting ready in the morning instead of charging overnight.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVgrX0"&gt;The OnePlus 9-series uses a twin-cell battery design first introduced in the 8T, which is part of the 9 Pro’s formula for achieving such fast wireless charging speeds: each cell is charged at 25W simultaneously. OnePlus uses higher voltage power, which produces less heat than using higher amps and avoids frying the phone by channeling the power through a proprietary charge pump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0CHA9M"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The newly designed charger supports charging in either horizontal or vertical orientation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AyfXvH"&gt;The 9 Pro’s twin-cell battery design also helps mitigate the heat produced by wireless charging, along with some other design tweaks to help with heat dissipation, like thicker copper foil and a larger heatsink. There’s also a key feature on the charger itself that we were grateful for in our testing: a fan. The added fan noise isn’t ideal if the charger is on your nightstand, but for the Pro 9 owner who wants to keep their nighttime charging routine, there’s support for quieter charging during bedtime mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7nG92w"&gt;The newly designed charger also includes two charging coils, making it possible to charge the phone in either horizontal or vertical orientation. That’s useful if you want to multitask your charging time and watch a video, too, which OnePlus says shouldn’t affect charging speed. We couldn’t confirm that in our initial testing, but it’s something we’ll be following up on. As for the cost of the charger, we don’t have pricing yet, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21219525/oneplus-8-wireless-charger-warp-price-specs-release-date"&gt;last year’s Warp Charge 30 chargers&lt;/a&gt; didn’t come cheap — the pad version was introduced at $69.95 and the stand version for $79.95.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s Nicole Wetsman on the tools she uses for covering health news</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6EzEryuEIED3b2kjNZqnL3VO5R0=/0x485:750x985/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986194/C87392C3_0D41_4DDC_A8B0_C216575581E1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Nicole Wetsman / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JhltPH"&gt;We wouldn’t have tech without science, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; wouldn’t be what it is without its team of science reporters. In this time of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21132224/coronavirus-outbreak-genetic-sequencing-viral-dna-treatment-biotechnology"&gt;pandemics&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316093/nasas-perseverance-rover-first-drive-mars"&gt;Mars landings&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;climate controversies&lt;/a&gt;, our skilled science team is more important than ever. We talked to Nicole Wetsman, one of our top science and health reporters, to find out how she does her job and what tools she uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zoXLfG"&gt;What is your job at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wqMK6K"&gt;I’ve always been interested in science and health, but I never wanted to work in a lab or be a doctor. Reporting on those subjects gave me a way to learn and work with those ideas. I write about science, health, and health technology for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. For the past year, that’s primarily meant covering COVID-19 — everything from testing technology to the vaccine rollout to public health data systems. I also help our video team script health-related videos and sometimes jump in as an on-camera host. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="lHqMVY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10397157"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rTLEFi"&gt;What is the process you follow when you are writing a science article?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PFQtTn"&gt;I usually start by reading through any research articles on a particular topic and then talking with scientists and other experts who work in that area. That might include people who did a study or built a new health app or people who work in fields that might apply the new innovation. Then, I organize my research, synthesize what I found, and write up a story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ufVQWR"&gt;What hardware tools do you use for your work? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7I5LxL"&gt;I’m embarrassingly low-tech for a reporter at a technology website. For the most part, I just use my &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmacbook-pro-13%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22335776%2Fnicole-wetsman-verge-science-macbook-moleskine-zoom" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;13-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fairpods%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22335776%2Fnicole-wetsman-verge-science-macbook-moleskine-zoom" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fiphone-12%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22335776%2Fnicole-wetsman-verge-science-macbook-moleskine-zoom" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt; to do everything. Occasionally, I pull out a &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/1014864/1036?sharedid=VergeNicoleWestmanInterview03172021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fzof1lp.html"&gt;Zoom F1 Field Recorder&lt;/a&gt; to record voice-overs for video projects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Thi1tm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10397397"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="A65u0S"&gt;What software tools do you use for your work? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ugGVPR"&gt;I do most of my writing and research organization in Google Docs. I use the &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/"&gt;recording and transcription service Otter&lt;/a&gt; for interviews. It matches audio with the transcript, so I can easily go back and find whatever part of the interview I need, even if the transcription isn’t perfect. (It usually isn’t.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4rXNY"&gt;When I need to find scientific research on any topic vaguely medical, I turn to &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/"&gt;PubMed&lt;/a&gt;, a search engine housed at the National Institutes of Health. I also use &lt;a href="https://scholar.google.com/"&gt;Google Scholar&lt;/a&gt; to find academic research articles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KSF0yh"&gt;Are there any other tools that you use?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GqZxme"&gt;I write out my to-do lists and schedule in a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.moleskine.com%2Fplanners%2Fweekly-planners%2F0102-2&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22335776%2Fnicole-wetsman-verge-science-macbook-moleskine-zoom" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Moleskine weekly planner&lt;/a&gt;, which is the only notebook I’ve found with a layout that works for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QIfwuC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10397626"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bZ5UYl"&gt;What advice do you have for people who are considering reporting as a profession?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jAuhIo"&gt;Journalism can sometimes seem like a competitive field, with reporters jockeying for scoops, intel, and access. At the core, though, it’s inherently collaborative. Working with others means benefiting from their ideas, edits, and perspectives, and it makes the final product better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="OSRzdX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10398005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aeobAX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TfPzKx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XMtxpW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Conspiracy theorists and white supremacists want to ‘incite fear’ by targeting cell towers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-TELECOMMUNICATION-5G" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M8FQvsIpSqSEX_9GGtUt6daGt3U=/96x0:3897x2534/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68986019/1187777043.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A cell is upgraded to handle 5G signals in Orem, Utah.  | Photo by GEORGE FREY/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0KY9Kd"&gt;Cellphone towers are being increasingly targeted by conspiracy theorists, neo-Nazis, and white supremacists who wish to “incite fear, disrupt essential services, and cause economic damage,” according to an internal New York Police Department report &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2021/03/17/5g-white-supremacists-conspiracy-theorists-critical-infrastructure/"&gt;seen by &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4QS9PK"&gt;The report, issued on January 20th by the NYPD Intelligence Bureau, cites a number of recent attacks on US telecoms infrastructure, including individuals severing fiber-optic cables and removing back-up batteries from wireless sites. The sections of the report shared by &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt; do not explicitly ascribe political motivations to these attacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N12PmW"&gt;The most high-profile attack cited in the report is the case of Anthony Quinn Warner, who set off a bomb outside an AT&amp;amp;T building in Nashville, Tennessee on Christmas day, 2020. However, a separate report released by the FBI &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-15/fbi-nashville-bomber-driven-by-conspiracies-paranoia?utm_source=google&amp;amp;utm_medium=bd&amp;amp;cmpId=google&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;this week&lt;/a&gt; said that while Warner was driven by conspiracy theories and paranoia, his attack was not necessarily inspired by any “broader ideological motive.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ENvDPY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Extremist groups want to undermine the ability of the state by targeting critical infrastructure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H9viJa"&gt;The NYPD intelligence report suggests that disparate groups see attacks on US infrastructure as an effective way to achieve their goal of “fomenting a general distrust of government.” It cites discussion in one neo-Nazi chat group where members “strongly supported exploiting civil unrest in the United States by attacking the country’s infrastructure,” including suggesting attacks on “bridges, railways and electrical grids.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2MGog"&gt;“In recent months, white supremacist extremists, neo-Nazis, far-right Telegram groups, and online conspiracy theorists have all emphasized attacking valuable critical infrastructure targets,” says the report from the NYPD Intelligence Bureau. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvs6WK"&gt;In addition to the NYPD’s intelligence briefing, &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt; notes that on January 5th and 6th 2021, the Department of Homeland Security issued three reports about vandalism against cell towers in New York, West Virginia, and Tennessee. An anonymous federal law enforcement official told &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt; that while threats to infrastructure were not unusual, it was strange to see three grouped together in such a short time. Notably, the attacks took place the day before and the day of the US Capitol riots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64fZV6"&gt;In addition to threats posed by neo-Nazis and white supremacists, cell towers have been increasingly targeted by conspiracy theorists, both inside the US and elsewhere. Last year, there was a spate of attacks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21276912/5g-conspiracy-theories-coronavirus-uk-telecoms-engineers-attacks-abuse"&gt;against cell towers in Europe&lt;/a&gt; linked to false beliefs that new 5G equipment was spreading coronavirus among the population and weakening individuals’ immune systems. Dozens of sites were targeted by arson attacks in the UK, Netherlands, Ireland, Belgium, Sweden, Italy, and beyond. Although such attacks may have been motivated by anti-5G conspiracy theories, they had the same outcome desired by far-right groups, including disrupting the work of first responders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxEJHs"&gt;The NYPD did not respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;regarding the authenticity of the report seen by &lt;em&gt;The Intercept&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is removing any posts celebrating the Atlanta attack or the suspected shooter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R-miGHEpsbEPWafJyH5Wz2D2jQw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68985872/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EBD6oM"&gt;Facebook says it will remove any posts that celebrate the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/03/17/us/shooting-atlanta-acworth"&gt;recent shooting in Atlanta&lt;/a&gt; or support the suspected shooter. Eight people were killed in the attack. Seven of the victims of the shooting were women and six were of Asian descent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5nw6i"&gt;The social network has designated the shooting to be a “violating event,” a classification that it’s previously used for the US Capitol riots in January this year and the killing of two people during Black Lives Matter protests in Kenosha in August 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dbyKPn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook wants to remove content that celebrates violent acts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vNxZGQ"&gt;This classification is part of Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/policy-update-actions-against-violence-on-facebook-instagram"&gt;expanded policies&lt;/a&gt; on Dangerous Individuals and Organizations. The social network noted last August that it wanted to address movements “that, while not directly organizing violence, have celebrated violent acts.” That means removing content related to movements that “have demonstrated significant risks to public safety but do not meet the rigorous criteria to be designated as a dangerous organization and banned from having any presence on our platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NhXQb9"&gt;As is common with Facebook moderation, it’s not clear exactly what criteria the company is applying. A Facebook spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it would remove content that praises, supports, or represents the shooting or the suspect, but did not offer further details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ie1LEx"&gt;Facebook also said that it had found and removed an Instagram account it believes was linked to the alleged shooter, but noted that this account had been inactive for some time. The company has also confirmed that a widely-circulated image, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/daveyalba/status/1372202957090000897"&gt;purporting to be a Facebook post from the shooter&lt;/a&gt;, is a fake. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zBxyB9"&gt;The social network said it would temporarily stop new accounts being registered on Facebook and Instagram using the same name as the suspected shooter, presumably to limit the creation of new hoaxes or misinformation. Facebook says it’s working with law enforcement to help their investigations into the shooting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ryder says EV startup Chanje owes millions for undelivered vans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZHujxot8l5uTlfe9Q25d91R79tw=/375x0:2925x1700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68985114/Exterior___Rear_3_4_Downtown_edited.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mt1ETy"&gt;Truck rental company Ryder says it’s owed nearly $4 million from EV startup Chanje after it failed to deliver 100 of the 125 vans promised back in 2017, according to &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.flsd.589122/gov.uscourts.flsd.589122.1.0.pdf"&gt;a previously unreported lawsuit in Florida&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O6ZDRQ"&gt;The lawsuit comes as a massive shift toward electric propulsion is underway in the commercial vehicle space, with new startups raising billions of dollars and established automakers announcing electric delivery vans and trucks at a regular clip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HsHqG5"&gt;Chanje emerged from stealth in 2017 and is one of a number of electric vehicle startups that have called California home. Like many of its peers, it got early attention by hiring a few former execs from Tesla, and even poached some talent from fellow startup Faraday Future. Also like many of those California EV startups, Chanje is owned by a larger Chinese automotive company — in this case one called FDG. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7pshlM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Chanje said at one point it didn’t have the cash to pay Ryder back&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eXyb4y"&gt;But whereas others at the time were focused on luxury passenger cars, Chanje set out to make electric delivery vans instead. Ryder was Chanje’s first big customer, pledging to buy 125 vans back in 2017. The truck rental company agreed to pay $45,000 for each of the vehicles from Chanje, with $35,000 per vehicle up front and $10,000 per vehicle upon delivery. As such, Ryder made an initial deposit of $4,375,000 in 2017. Ryder was also supposed to be the exclusive sales and service provider for the startup’s vans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uJOJgm"&gt;Ryder received 22 vehicles from Chanje by the end of 2017, but when it went to pay the $10,000 deposit on those, it mistakenly paid the full $45,000 for each, an overpayment of $770,000. That’s when the trouble started, according to the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RzFSN"&gt;Ryder made “repeated requests” to be reimbursed for the overpayment, but Chanje told the truck rental company it did not have the cash to pay Ryder back, according to the complaint. Chanje eventually delivered three more electric vans, but never delivered the remaining 100. Ryder tried to terminate the contract and recoup the $3.5 million in deposits it paid on those vans it never got, but Chanje balked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tu2e2e"&gt;In early 2019, according to the lawsuit, Ryder got FDG to agree to loan money to Chanje to pay the $770,000 in overpayments. In late 2019, Ryder again got FDG to agree to loan money to Chanje to pay back the $3.5 million in deposits. Chanje ultimately paid Ryder back $500,000 of the overpayment money, but hasn’t paid the truck rental company another dollar since. Ryder therefore says it’s still owed $3,770,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqzUma"&gt;Ryder, Chanje, and FDG did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mAzF5g"&gt;In 2018, Ryder had arranged to have FedEx lease 900 Chanje vans and buy 100 more. But as it started to fight Chanje and FDG for the money it was owed in 2019 and 2020, Ryder tried to give the electric van startup and its parent company an out. It struck an agreement with Chanje and FDG that said if they delivered at least 700 vans to FedEx, Ryder would waive the $3.5 million in deposit money. “Chanje did not meet its obligations and deliver the 700 vehicles” to FedEx, Ryder’s lawyers write. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fj17Lf"&gt;It’s unclear if Chanje delivered any vans to FedEx. FedEx also said in early 2020 that it was developing “groundbreaking charging infrastructure” with Chanje &lt;a href="https://newsroom.fedex.com/newsroom/fedex-and-chanje-to-develop-groundbreaking-charging-infrastructure/"&gt;at a few dozen stations in California&lt;/a&gt;, and the status of that project is also unclear. FedEx did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KV8mjA"&gt;Chanje has been quiet since its debut in 2017, aside from the announcements with FedEx. The startup has been sued more than once in Los Angeles Superior Court by former employees who say they’re owed tens of thousands in back pay and bonuses. Chanje has also been hit with liens from the California Secretary of State for not paying taxes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v54fGF"&gt;In the time since Chanje came onto the scene, commercial electric vehicle companies have taken off as governments around the world push to reduce harmful emissions. The UK’s Arrival recently announced a deal to go public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/18/uk-electric-vehicle-maker-arrival-is-going-public-via-spac.html"&gt;raising nearly $700 million at a $5.4 billion valuation&lt;/a&gt;. General Motors even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225394/gm-brightdrop-electric-delivery-ep1-ev600-ces-2021"&gt;spun out an entire business dedicated to commercial EVs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrome now instantly captions audio and video on the web</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YaG09nhFGqzAaatWO8xFBUwcnDo=/139x234:888x733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68984871/Screen_Shot_2021_03_17_at_4.21.12_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5UtL8v"&gt;Google is expanding its real-time caption feature, Live Captions, from Pixel phones to anyone using a Chrome browser, as first spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-chrome-live-caption-feature-rolls-out-transcribe-speech-videos/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Live Captions uses machine learning to spontaneously create captions for videos or audio where none existed before, and making the web that much more accessible for anyone who’s deaf or hard of hearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t1xrjd"&gt;When enabled, Live Captions automatically appear in a small, moveable box in the bottom of your browser when you’re watching or listening to a piece of content where people are talking. Words appear after a slight delay, and for fast or stuttering speech, you might spot mistakes. But in general, the feature is just as impressive as it was when it first appeared &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923660/google-pixel-4-xl-review-camera-radar-face-unlock-90hz-display-telephoto"&gt;on Pixel phones in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Captions will even appear with muted audio or your volume turned down, making it a way to “read” videos or podcasts without bugging others around you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3Y8co8Pyq5oIHT9uKzMkPMbKxmY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22378878/Screen_Shot_2021_03_17_at_4.35.39_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live Captions captioning audio from a podcast player&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ayaFKF"&gt;Chrome’s Live Captions worked on YouTube videos, Twitch streams, podcast players, and even music streaming services like SoundCloud in early tests run by a few of us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. However, it seems that Live Captions in Chrome only work in English, which is also the case on mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYfmP4"&gt;Live Captions can be enabled in the latest version of Chrome by going to Settings, then the “Advanced” section, and then “Accessibility.” (If you’re not seeing the feature, try manually updating and restarting your browser.) When you toggle them on, Chrome will quickly download some speech recognition files, and then captions should appear the next time your browser plays audio where people are talking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arX95B"&gt;Live Captions were first introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18528447/google-android-q-live-caption-video-transcription-io-2019"&gt;in the Android Q beta&lt;/a&gt;, but until today, they were exclusive to &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accessibility/android/answer/9350862?hl=en"&gt;some Pixel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/09/16/live-captions-now-available-for-galaxy-s10-note-10-w-one-ui-2-5-update/"&gt;Samsung phones&lt;/a&gt;. Now that they’re on Chrome, Live Captions will be available to a much wider audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FW71tJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZcUEd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QU26h"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
