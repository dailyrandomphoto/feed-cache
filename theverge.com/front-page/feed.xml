    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sjLtmn"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://gigworkerscollective.medium.com/instacart-shoppers-announce-walk-off-3db7f7208ef3"&gt;Instacart shoppers are striking&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday, to protest the company’s pay structure and failure to communicate directly with workers.  The Gig Workers Collective (GWC), which represent some of the company’s shoppers, want the Instacart to address five of its policies. The group is calling for Instacart to pay shoppers by order instead of by batch, reintroduce its item commissions, fix fraud issues with its rating system, provide occupational death benefits, and raise the default tip for shoppers on the platform from 5 percent to 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kNzXR"&gt;The group said the company ignored its demands, which led to the decision to walk off the job on Saturday. “Instacart has refused to finally address these fixes that workers have been begging the company for, in discussions both private and public,” the GWC wrote in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQyG8D"&gt;An Instacart spokesperson wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday that the company takes worker feedback “very seriously.” adding that “historically the actions by this group have not resulted in any disruption or impact to our service.” The claims by the Gig Workers Collection “do not reflect the current shopper experience,” the Instacart statement said, adding that the company has “a variety of channels” for engaging with its shoppers to gather feedback. “The reality is that over the last year, shopper sentiment and engagement remain the highest they’ve been in company history.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wq3n0U"&gt;As noted by the Instacart statement, Saturday was not the first time the GWC has pushed for a work action among Instacart shoppers. The group organized a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21064108/instacart-workers-organizing-tip-protest-delivery-default"&gt;boycott of Instacart in January 2020&lt;/a&gt; to encourage the company to reinstate the minimum 10 percent tip, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21197078/instacart-workers-protest-coronavirus-protections-date-sick-leave"&gt;staged a walk-off in March 2020&lt;/a&gt; to protest the company’s lack of sick leave and protections for workers from the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4SHnF"&gt;Following the March 2020 walk-off, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21200348/instacart-strike-coronavirus-no-impact"&gt;Instacart said it had seen “absolutely no impact”&lt;/a&gt; on its business as a result. But a spokesperson for the GWC pointed out that several days after the March walk-out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206630/instacart-health-and-safety-kits-face-mask-hand-sanitizer-sick-pay-strike"&gt;Instacart said it would provide its shoppers&lt;/a&gt; with health and safety kits that included masks and hand sanitizer, two items that were among the workers’ demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uFw7ae"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Instacart’s reported plan to automate its workforce seems a lot like bluster","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463023/instacart-plans-automation-grocery-shopping-business-model"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="RanXZU"&gt;And, the GWC spokesperson added, the walk-offs are about more than disrupting the company’s operations; it’s hoping to change the narrative around &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/instacart-may-delay-ipo-until-121347561.html"&gt;Instacart’s plans to go public later this year&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s been a huge success,” the GWC spokesperson said of its past efforts. “Prior to this, the media stories were about how ‘Instacart’s prepping for an exciting IPO.’ Now, the stories are focused on their exploitative practices.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7I8kp"&gt;It’s also not totally clear how many of Instacart’s workers the collective represents, but its spokesperson said the company’s claims that the group doesn’t speak for the majority of its shoppers is incorrect. “Instacart knows that we’re speaking for a majority of its shoppers, because they hear about these specific grievances nonstop,” the spokesperson said. “We hope Instacart’s customers are watching how the company handles this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCImJT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Analogue’s Pocket will have an extremely fancy OS to save games to and from cartridges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XGgUOmRuAUFVgy7Vf3V4LssHSac=/0x84:2000x1417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70003715/Hero.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zwqIcZ"&gt;There’s still no firm release date for the delayed Analogue Pocket (outside of the broader “December 2021” window that the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667465/analogue-pocket-preorders-delay-december-2021"&gt;last provided in September&lt;/a&gt;), but Analogue is looking to whet players’ appetites with the next best thing: a deep look at AnalogueOS, the new custom software that will power the Pocket whenever it does actually arrive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9AG2vK"&gt;As one might expect for a retro gaming device, AnalogueOS features a minimal, pixel-art style design that’s meant to get you into games as easily as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QkDgB5Da5zN4ILyLcW6TYw6UgFk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22930446/2_OS_Hero.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ft66YA"&gt;But Analogue is taking its goal of making the ultimate retro gaming device seriously. There’s a new “Library” feature, with a massive database that the company has built from the ground up with the goal of serving as a comprehensive historical archive for retro gaming. Players will be able to browse around and explore the history of classic games and developers, sorted by region, system, publisher, and more. The Library will also let players pull in box art or title screens for games that they’re playing and even read physical cartridges to identify the exact revision and version of a game. There’s also playlist support, too, for creating custom lists of favorites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wGpdmc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The biggest features won’t be in AnalogueOS 1.0, though&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YO2MEo"&gt;But one of the most interesting features is what Pocket calls “Memories,” which should allow players to capture and load save states directly to and from a cartridge and even share them with other players to load onto &lt;em&gt;their &lt;/em&gt;cartridges — something the company says has never been done before. Memories will also allow for players to save and share screenshots, too — a staple of modern consoles that it’s looking to bring to older games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nQZ8J"&gt;Lastly, AnalogueOS will offer a variety of tools for tracking gameplay, including logging how long and when you played specific games. AnalogueOS is also meant to be a stepping stone for the company — one that will (eventually) be available for other Analogue products, too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KoRCv64TPTodbydzCBCLX7aFb_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22930447/4_OS_Hero.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iNpuFQ"&gt;And while all that sounds very neat, there are a lot of caveats in Analogue’s announcement here. For example, while the Library, Memories, and Tracking features all sound great, they won’t be available on the initial AnalogueOS 1.0 — rather, they’ll be coming later “on AnalogueOS 1.1 and beyond.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3eu8H"&gt;Additionally, when the Library feature does arrive, it’ll only support Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Color, Game Boy, and Game Gear games. Neo Geo Pocket Color, Neo Geo Pocket, TurboGrafx-16 and Atari Lynx support will come alongside the cartridge adapters in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jEcyy"&gt;The first Pocket Analogue consoles are expected to ship “at the latest in December.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>International Space Station tilted after thrusters on a Russian craft fired unexpectedly</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="ISS international space station" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZGQeJpjyglkMKEhPveKLHSP9y74=/8x0:4280x2848/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70003698/STS-133_International_Space_Station_after_undocking_5.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The International Space Station | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nnO0JZ"&gt;The International Space Station was unexpectedly tilted on Friday after a test firing of thrusters on Russia’s Soyuz MS-18 spacecraft continued longer than expected. First reported by the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/15/science/international-space-station-russia.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the personnel aboard the ISS were never in danger according to a &lt;a href="http://en.roscosmos.ru/22425/"&gt;statement from Russia’s Roscosmos&lt;/a&gt; space agency. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDlCRO"&gt;Ground teams for NASA and Roscosmos were able to regain control of the station about 30 minutes after it lost positioning control at 5:13AM ET. But it’s the second such incident aboard the ISS within the past year, and it occurred with a craft that is supposed to return to Earth early Sunday morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vGMcL"&gt;The incident started when cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky was testing the engines aboard the Soyuz MS-18 spacecraft, which is docked with the station. A NASA spokesperson told the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; that the Soyuz thruster firing unexpectedly continued past the time when the engine test was supposed to end. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PFE8Qy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600306/uncontrolled-firing-from-russian-module-causes-brief-tug-of-war-on-international-space-station"&gt;In July, thrusters on Russia’s Nauka&lt;/a&gt; module fired “uncontrollably,” reorienting the ISS by about 45 degrees. It took about an hour to regain control, and NASA said at the time such incidents were rare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fH8QK"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22709501/russia-soyuz-launch-actress-producer-filming-movie-space-station"&gt;Russian film crew that went up to the ISS&lt;/a&gt; on October 5th for a movie shoot is supposed to return to Earth early Sunday aboard the Soyuz craft that had the thruster incident on Friday. The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reported that the thruster incident delayed some of the movie’s filming schedule. NASA said the craft is still scheduled to undock from the ISS later on Saturday as planned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3M55V"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A brief chat with the fired #AppleToo organizer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z6gH_pldp31MNJbVlt325SjeG60=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70003556/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uUNI6p"&gt;On October 14th, Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727123/apple-fires-leader-apple-too-movement"&gt;fired a leader of the #AppleToo movement&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly failing to comply with an internal investigation. The employee, Janneke Parrish, has been working behind the scenes for months to organize fellow employees who’ve faced harassment and discrimination. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mujZpQ"&gt;Now, Apple appears to be cracking down on those efforts — under the guise of trying to stop internal information from leaking to the press. In September, Apple fired Ashley Gjøvik for allegedly violating her confidentiality agreement. Then, it placed software engineer Cher Scarlett on medical leave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQWGW4"&gt;Both Gjøvik and Scarlett have filed claims with the NLRB. Parrish’s lawyer, Vincent P. White of White, Hilferty and Albanese, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Parrish plans to sue for wrongful termination and will also be filing a charge with the NLRB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLOmo5"&gt;Parrish spoke with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; about her organizing efforts and the circumstances around her termination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="hhBFfR"&gt;
&lt;p id="wiYBzL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me what the last few months have been like for you. You started doing internal advocacy with &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432909/apple-petition-hiring-antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-facebook"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;the Antonio García Martínez&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;letter&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9xD2s"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Janneke Parrish:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes, and that was the first time I really saw employee activism at Apple having an impact. I was already in the remote work advocacy Slack channel at the time, wanting people to be able to make the best decisions for them in regards to how and where they work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoXJkT"&gt;But with the Antonio García Martínez letter, we saw that activism can be effective — that when we speak up, executives might listen. That led to more letters from the remote work group, asking for flexibility in terms of where we work. But we didn’t get the same response this time — the response was essentially, “We think it would be better to be back in the office.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qOag5Q"&gt;Employee advocacy is incredibly important to help make our voices heard, but there’s a limit to what we can do internally. If you’re speaking to people who don’t want to listen to you, you might as well not be speaking at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I50LGh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you and Cher Scarlett start working together on #AppleToo?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ga1VAc"&gt;While I was doing this work with remote advocacy, Cher was doing work with pay advocacy. We met through needing to advocate for pay equity and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638150/apple-appletoo-employee-harassment-discord"&gt;transitioned it into #AppleToo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTnJak"&gt;I led the employee stories component — telling the stories of workers who’ve been abused and discriminated against, who’ve reached out through the channels Apple tells us to and heard nothing. It’s the story of remote advocacy being told on a macro scale across the entire business — that we are consistently unheard and devalued. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JwNQWB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Apple doesn’t need to know how much money I lost on GameStop.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wVM59P"&gt;I do not know how somebody looks at hundreds of stories like that and does not take action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFBYg2"&gt;So I’ve been doing that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RxFe7l"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has the impact been? It seems like you haven’t gotten the same pushback internally as Cher and Ashley.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7OPwWQ"&gt;I have received a lot of supportive messages, and no, I haven’t gotten as much criticism. I honestly don’t know why. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XCsT6U"&gt;I’m a program manager. I’m not an engineer, and I’m in a department that doesn’t have the same visibility theirs does. I’m in Maps, and it just doesn’t have the same visibility. I also continue to put myself out of the limelight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0E1v2n"&gt;And I’m in Austin, not California. A lot of Apple’s arguments around coming back to the office are very California-centric and don’t apply to people in Texas. They talk about running into people in the halls — I never run into execs in Austin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5Bb3L"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When did the investigation start?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1FzVHo"&gt;On September 18th, there was a town hall that was live leaked to you. And afterward, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22687747/tim-cook-employee-leak-memos-do-not-belong-at-apple"&gt;Tim Cook sent out a memo&lt;/a&gt; saying we’re disappointed and going to find the leakers. In the wake of that memo, Apple started doing investigations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYheQe"&gt;On September 30th, I was called into a meeting with HR and global security and told I was being investigated for possibly leaking the meeting. My devices were confiscated, but before they were, I deleted apps with personal information, like Robinhood. Apple doesn’t need to know how much money I lost on GameStop. I work on political campaigns, and Democratic political campaign information has to be kept private. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QbnYEu"&gt;So before turning in the devices, I removed this information. I was given a loaner and asked to continue working, which I did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5p0Sp"&gt;On October 8th, I was reached out to again by global security and HR, and they said I was being suspended and took the loaner devices and deactivated all my internal accounts. I was in mid-conversation with some people, and then my internal accounts immediately showed “deactivated.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MSsbqu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I believe I was fired in retaliation for speaking out”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C458fa"&gt;Doing this set my work back as well. The very fact that it happened at all — I work in Maps, we work with highly confidential information, and our need to keep stuff secret is vital for our success. So even being investigated, my career on Maps was over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KdFkzv"&gt;On Thursday, I received a call from global security and HR saying I had been terminated for deleting the files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hvbuT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why was that personal information on your work device in the first place?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hcj7er"&gt;On Maps, we’re encouraged to test out the maps and new features. My particular role was the program manager for tools, so I needed to know our tools behaved correctly. For me, using my work phone as a personal phone gave me a great opportunity to test things in the field, which we are highly encouraged to do. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22648265/apple-employee-privacy-icloud-id"&gt;Apple encourages us to integrate&lt;/a&gt; [our personal and work devices]. When I was first issued the phone, that seemed perfectly legitimate. But in hindsight, it probably was not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ydbDee"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your view on why you were fired?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjioA6"&gt;I believe I was fired in retaliation for speaking out, for my work with #AppleToo, and out of concern that I was organizing to help other employees tell their stories. In my view, this is entirely retaliation for trying to bring Apple’s actions to light and publicly asking the company to do better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RBTLRZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is #AppleToo done now that you’ve been fired and Cher is out on medical leave?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzEsTo"&gt;I absolutely don’t think so. I think seeing that Apple would rather fire an employee for speaking out and asking the company to do better instead of actually &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; better says volumes about the company and its priorities. I hope people see the decision Apple has made and that it is a galvanizing decision. My goal is to make Apple better for everyone. And it seems like Apple is less interested in that than I am. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MVGtAb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vwVyz"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The US has set a date to reopen its borders to vaccinated foreign visitors</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="stjlW6"&gt;The White House announced Friday that the US is reopening its land and air borders to vaccinated foreign nationals on November 8th. State Department spokesman Ned Price said at a press briefing that details will be available ahead of November 8th for airline passengers and people arriving at US land borders for what they’ll need to show full proof of vaccination against COVID-19&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlKs6h"&gt;As part of pandemic restrictions, non-essential travelers from more than 30 countries had been barred from entering the US since March 2020. This latest news comes as the White House announced Tuesday that the US was ending restrictions at the borders and ferry crossings with Mexico and Canada for foreign nationals vaccinated against COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Br9ePb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22584359/canada-border-reopen-non-essential-travel-us-citizens-vaccinated"&gt;Canada began allowing&lt;/a&gt; vaccinated US visitors into the country for non-essential travel in August. Travelers seeking to enter Canada will be required to fill out a questionnaire using the ArriveCAN app and need to demonstrate a quarantine plan in case they don’t meet Canada’s requirements for quarantine exemption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2zwaz"&gt;Last month, the White House said the US would end restrictions on air travel from more than 30 countries in early November but didn’t provide a date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSRW1J"&gt;Non-US air travelers will be required to show proof of vaccination before boarding a flight and proof of a recent negative COVID-19 test. For foreign visitors crossing into the US at a land border, only proof of vaccination will be required. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sFAVlK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 16th 9:23AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adds confirmation from White House and comment from State Department&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA launches its Lucy spacecraft to study the Jupiter Trojan asteroids</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket with the Lucy spacecraft aboard is seen in this 2 minute and 30 second exposure photograph as it launches from Space Launch Complex 41, Saturday, Oct. 16, 2021, at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ufm9TM_jJuhZIMM6nt9CKUEVtsg=/0x301:2689x2094/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70003424/lucy_in_the_sky2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket with the Lucy spacecraft launches from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida on October 16th | (NASA/Bill Ingalls)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aVPTFI"&gt;NASA’s Lucy space probe launched successfully from Cape Canaveral in Florida early Saturday, the beginning of a 12-year mission to study Jupiter’s Trojan asteroids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGji5y"&gt;The uncrewed spacecraft lifted off at 5:34AM ET aboard a United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket. Lucy sent its first signal to Earth from its own antenna to NASA’s Deep Space Network at 6:40AM ET.  Scientists believe the Trojan asteroids, which orbit the Sun along the same path as Jupiter, may hold clues about the formation of our solar system. It’s NASA’s first-ever single-spacecraft mission to explore so many different asteroids, the &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-ula-launch-lucy-mission-to-fossils-of-planet-formation"&gt;agency said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqWn4M"&gt;Lucy is named for the fossilized human skeleton &lt;a href="https://iho.asu.edu/about/lucys-story"&gt;discovered in Ethiopia in 1974&lt;/a&gt;, which provided key insights into human evolution. The fossil got her name from the Beatles song “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,” which was &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2017/inspiration-links-the-beatles-a-fossil-and-a-nasa-mission"&gt;playing at the site&lt;/a&gt; where excavators found her. NASA says Lucy the spacecraft will provide insights into our evolution much the way her fossil counterpart did, only this time on a planetary scale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JAMP4U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NASA’s Lucy will explore swarms of asteroids around Jupiter","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22711372/nasa-lucy-mission-jupiter-trojan-asteroids-12-years-launch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="V07nOe"&gt;Lucy is on a complicated trajectory that will include three trips back toward Earth for gravity assists. First, Lucy will orbit the Sun and then head back toward Earth next year for a gravity assist. That will accelerate and direct the craft’s trajectory beyond Mars’ orbit, when Lucy will head back toward Earth again for another gravity assist in 2024. This will help propel the craft toward the Donaldjohanson asteroid in 2025; after that Lucy will head toward the Trojan asteroids, arriving in 2027. Then, after four targeted fly-bys, Lucy will head back to Earth for a third gravity assist in 2031, which will propel it toward the Trojans for another encounter in 2033.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="mKDPw3"&gt;“We started working on the Lucy mission concept early in 2014, so this launch has been long in the making,” &lt;a href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/people/840/hal-levison/"&gt;Hal Levison&lt;/a&gt;, Lucy principal investigator with the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) said in a statement. “It will still be several years before we get to the first Trojan asteroid, but these objects are worth the wait and all the effort because of their immense scientific value. They are like diamonds in the sky.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snag a Samsung soundbar for a low price from Newegg</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7SNrW9JK95Gjy7Dq2eV3hQky3YQ=/0x54:1280x907/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70003340/86_508_325_S08.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T8xwj2"&gt;This slim soundbar from Samsung is currently available for its lowest price ever at Newegg, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fsamsung-hw-q60t-za-soundbar%2Fp%2FN82E16886508325%3FItem%3DN82E16886508325%26cm_sp%3DDailydeal_SS-_-86-508-325-_-10152021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;down to just $298&lt;/a&gt;. This 38-inch soundbar comes packed with 9 forward-firing speakers and a wireless subwoofer for a soundbar that punches well above its weight. There are a couple of things to keep in mind, however. This soundbar only comes equipped with a single HDMI input and output port, so you’ll need to rely on a switcher, or utilize the built-in Bluetooth connectivity if you’re using this soundbar for multiple devices. Another small drawback is the lack of additional rear-channel speakers, which shouldn’t be an issue for smaller rooms, but if you have a particularly large living room, you may want to invest in a pair of tertiary speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8cMtce"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10809472"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SnpWrW"&gt;Amazon’s first-generation Echo Buds are &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/vergeNewsletter101521/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/echo-buds-1st-gen-anr-true-wireless-earbuds-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available at Woot&lt;/a&gt; for their lowest price to date: $40. While many earbuds come equipped with voice assistance enabled, the Amazon Echo Buds are always listening, allowing you to call on Amazon Alexa anywhere, just like you would at home. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937559/amazon-echo-buds-wireless-earbuds-review-features-bose-noise-reduction-price"&gt;our initial review&lt;/a&gt;, we noted how impressed we were by the level of comfort they offer and Bose’s proprietary noise reduction technology, which helps “eliminate annoying hums and cut down on street noise.” There are definitely better-sounding earbuds on the market —  we’ve even highlighted a few in our roundup of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; — but you’ll be hard-pressed to find a pair this good for a price this low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iI5qIP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9625473"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4ivwtk"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Book Pro is a handy little notebook, and thanks to this deal on Woot, you can &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-14464697?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcomputers.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fsamsung-galaxy-book-pro-laptop-2%3Fref%3Dw_cnt_wp_0_3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;grab one for $780 while supplies last&lt;/a&gt;. This lightweight, OLED-equipped laptop is surprisingly powerful and can last for up to 20 hours on a single charge. Under the hood, the Galaxy Book Pro uses an 11th-gen Intel Core i5 processor and 8GB of RAM, making it an excellent multitasker. The 512GB of built-in SSD storage also provides more than enough space for any project you’re working on, and given the laptop weighs a mere 2.3 pounds and measures less than 0.5-inches thick, you won’t have to worry about lugging the 15-inch machine around or slotting it into a crowded backpack. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22405540/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-360-features-price-photos-video-release-date"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our hands-on impressions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7DM5zL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10750960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oTa79E"&gt;The Roku Streaming Stick Plus is currently down to its lowest price ever at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Streaming-Stick-HDR-Streaming-Long-range/dp/B075XLWML4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfNo3SnKpfE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This lightweight streaming device is remarkably easy to use and is small enough to fit in your pocket. While Roku did recently release a new version, dubbed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Roku Streaming Stick 4K&lt;/a&gt;, the last-gen Stick Plus still touts access to all the same streaming services and remains just as easy to use. You just need to plug the Stick into an available HDMI port and provide power using the bundled USB cable, making it a quick way to stream content to any TV in your home (just don’t expect Dolby Vision support). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16587340/roku-streaming-stick-plus-2017-4k-hdr-review-price-relase" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UM4VtZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9736654"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W0LYWQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;is turning 10, and you’re invited to the party. Taking place in New York City on the 22nd and 23rd of October, On The Verge is going to be a celebration of everything we’ve accomplished over the past decade, and we want you to be a part of it.

    <title>Dbrand pulls its PS5 Darkplates from sale after Sony threatens legal action</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E3znqwwjp1lcp4rpyqtuzvNGrpg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70002640/DSCF7516.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P8Au9K"&gt;Earlier this year, Dbrand started selling matte black PS5 side plates that it called Darkplates, and when it did, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279685/matte-black-ps5-faceplates-on-sale-dbrand-sue-us-sony"&gt;baited Sony&lt;/a&gt; right on the product’s info page to “Go ahead, sue us.” We got our hands on some, and they look &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306874/dbrand-ps5-darkplates-matte-black-hands-on-review"&gt;exactly like you expect&lt;/a&gt;, making the sides of your PS5 black instead of white. They even have their own tongue-in-cheek take on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/2/7/22269634/how-sony-designed-ps5-dualsense-playstation-symbol-microtexture"&gt;PlayStation icon microtexture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zovZ0O"&gt;As of Saturday, though, you can’t buy Darkplates anymore, as Dbrand has removed them from sale after (perhaps unsurprisingly) receiving a cease and desist letter from Sony. (If you visit the Darkplates site right now, it just shows &lt;a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/special-edition/ps5"&gt;a list of news articles&lt;/a&gt;, including ones from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGvP4o"&gt;Dbrand shared the letter with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, which we’ve included at the bottom of the article. Sony raises a few grievances in the letter, including taking issue with how the faceplates “replicate SIE’s [Sony Interactive Entertainment] protected product design” and with Dbrand’s versions of the PlayStation icons. Dbrand says the letter was issued earlier this year but didn’t provide an exact timeline as to when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WeILg9"&gt;As part of the letter, Sony asked that Dbrand “promptly and permanently cease and take down all marketing and promotion for and cease all sales worldwide of faceplates featuring the product configuration of SIE’s PS5 faceplates or any similar product configuration, including without limitation all faceplates currently for sale at &lt;a href="http://dbrand.com/"&gt;dbrand.com&lt;/a&gt;.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qhxjVA"&gt;Dbrand does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; appear to be agreeing to comply with a permanent cease and desist, though. It says it will comply &lt;em&gt;for now&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BbpPzY"&gt;Or more specifically: “We’ve elected to submit to the terrorists’ demands… for now,” Dbrand writes &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/q94jua/darkplates_are_dead_thanks_sony/"&gt;in this 1,666-word post&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s subreddit, one packed with harsh words for Sony and even a few F-bombs. The company signs off with “talk soon,” suggesting it has already has other plans. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n2SMzZQ-TcYG86ygoqiF9I0zka4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22931302/57d43zxbhpt71.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dbrand/comments/q94jua/darkplates_are_dead_thanks_sony/" target="_blank"&gt;Dbrand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Dbrand has an enjoyable bit of whataboutism trying to shift the blame on popular Netflix show &lt;/em&gt;Squid Game&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ikiJYl"&gt;This isn’t the first time Sony has threatened legal action over PS5 side plates. One company that started life as PlateStation5 changed its name to CustomizeMyPlates and then canceled and refunded orders, allegedly after Sony threatened legal action, &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ps5-faceplate-seller-is-now-cancelling-all-orders-following-legal-action-from-sony/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VGC&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; in November. That company returned in January and is &lt;a href="https://www.customizemyplates.com/"&gt;selling its custom plates again&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AVTRaM"&gt;Part of the reason that there is a market for side plates is likely because it’s not too hard to take them off a PS5. In fact, Sony shows exactly &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/CaAY-jAjm0w?t=118"&gt;how you can do it&lt;/a&gt; in its official teardown of the console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="z4rYhF"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CaAY-jAjm0w?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=118&amp;amp;start=118" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qvxiwv"&gt;The ease with which you can take the PS5’s plates off not only makes it easy to get to the inner workings of the console but could also hint that it plans to release other versions of the side plates in the future. You can now buy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22433966/sony-black-red-dualsense-controllers-playstation-5-ps5"&gt;red and black DualSense controllers&lt;/a&gt; and a black Pulse 3D Audio headset &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675347/sony-pulse-3d-audio-headset-wireless-gaming-midnight-black-color-release-date"&gt;is on the way&lt;/a&gt;, suggesting that Sony is at least experimenting with other color combinations for its accessories, so an official set of black side plates doesn’t feel out of the realm of possibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32QsQR"&gt;If you don’t want to wait for Sony, though, you have one less option of third-party side plates to pick from while Dbrand’s are off the market. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After seeing new leaked photos of the Pixel 6, I think I finally get the phone’s unusual design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tQPglv-t6irHT0jFmscKCsBsPpQ=/8x0:4096x2725/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70002129/FBxXgMvWUAUanqP.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6’s distinctive look is easy to spot at a distance.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1449129719782326274" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yqjx77"&gt;We’re just a few days away from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;Google’s October 19th launch event&lt;/a&gt; for the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, but if you want an early look at what to expect, you might want to check out this &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1449129643542519811"&gt;big thread of leaked images&lt;/a&gt; from prolific leaker Evan Blass. The thread includes what appear to be official renders of both phones, images of cases, and some photos of people using the phones — and it’s that last category of images that were the most interesting to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KptRwm"&gt;Ever since early rumored renders of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446078/google-pixel-6-pro-leak-specs-camera-screen"&gt;Pixel 6 lineup&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447011/google-pixel-6-leaks-renders-pics-specs"&gt;hit the web&lt;/a&gt;, I wondered exactly why Google decided to make the massive camera bar across the back of both phones. It never really appealed to me, and since the bar isn’t flush with the back of the phones, I’ve been worried it’s going to make them wobble when laid on a desk.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google’s new Pixel 6 phones, regular and Pro" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ckQnWc66L7bV9d2osK3PMYdxPE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22755089/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check out those camera bars.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MnM2al"&gt;Blass’ photo dump includes twelve photos of people &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1449129710722629643"&gt;actually&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1449129719782326274"&gt;using&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1449129727051042816"&gt;the phones&lt;/a&gt;, and seeing these photos clicked something about the Pixel 6’s design in place for me: the camera bar and two-tone color choices give the Pixel 6 lineup a unique look that you won’t be able to mistake for any other phone. Even if somebody doesn’t know what the Pixel 6 is, they definitely won’t get it mixed up with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"&gt;an iPhone&lt;/a&gt;, and that distinctive appearance could be enough for people who haven’t tried a Pixel before to pick up a Pixel 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LdKhxg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/v1jdMmlkHc"&gt;pic.twitter.com/v1jdMmlkHc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— E (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1449129727051042816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8tNh6D"&gt;Another set of photos answered a question I had about the Pixel 6: what it would look like in a case. Based on the images Blass shared, Google’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1449129685552672777"&gt;official&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1449129697208684544"&gt;cases&lt;/a&gt; will fit around the camera bump, but edges around the bump appear to have a ridge, so the phone won’t sit flat on its back even with the cases on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E9wMyH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/y7ip43FVen"&gt;pic.twitter.com/y7ip43FVen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— E (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1449129697208684544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="niwxzX"&gt;Blass also shared renders of the Pixel 6 in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1449129643542519811"&gt;green&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1449129651062853633"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1449129658537193478"&gt;orange&lt;/a&gt; and the Pixel 6 Pro in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1449129665612943364"&gt;silver / gray&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1449129672390885376"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1449129679202443264"&gt;gold&lt;/a&gt;. These renders don’t have many surprises, since Google already revealed the designs and colors of the phones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;in August&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H7xBnx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="es" dir="ltr"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro &lt;a href="https://t.co/CdXMDezk57"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CdXMDezk57&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— E (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1449129665612943364?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BqRCI6"&gt;Last week, Blass leaked some other photos of the upcoming phones as well, including images of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714141/google-pixel-6-pro-marketing-images-leak-evleaks-wireless-charger-face-unlock"&gt;new Pixel Stand wireless charger&lt;/a&gt; (which, according to an entirely different leak, is rumored to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22651097/google-pixel-6-pro-stand-23w-wireless-charging"&gt;support 23W wireless charging&lt;/a&gt;). We won’t have long to wait until we learn more about the Pixel 6, though, so you should keep it locked to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; for our coverage of the phone’s October 19th launch event.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A year later, Apple’s MagSafe continues to underwhelm </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The watch charger flips up so you can use the Apple Watch in nightstand mode." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P6OOA5yf8u1He-TS4NYA6S22rRU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70002069/dbohn_201109_4283_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QxPh0J"&gt;One year ago yesterday, I wrote &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/14/21515490/apple-iphone-12-magsafe-accessories-ecosystem"&gt;how MagSafe could be the biggest reason to buy an iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;. I believed it, too. It looked like Apple had cracked the code to effortlessly accessorize the iPhone and even add modular new capabilities. The company showed its pricey new MagSafe cases and wallets seemingly snapping into place, plus faster wireless charging. The future looked bright. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzRPOV"&gt;But if you became an early adopter like me, you might have wound up disappointed. As &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Mark Gurman &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1449111887388549126"&gt;points out&lt;/a&gt;, two of Apple’s first overpriced MagSafe accessories are already out of date. First, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/15/magsafe-duo-apple-watch-series-7-no-fast-charge/"&gt;we just learned Friday&lt;/a&gt; that Apple’s $129 MagSafe Duo Charger can’t fast-charge an Apple Watch Series 7. Second, Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674261/apple-iphone-leather-wallet-magsafe-find-my-tracking"&gt;already replaced the $59 MagSafe Leather Wallet with a better version&lt;/a&gt; that supports Find My so your phone can remember where it was when it got removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ODYxiT"&gt;I think Gurman might actually be undercounting, though. The new Leather Wallet with MagSafe &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t support Apple’s $49 Clear Case with MagSafe, so hope you didn’t buy one of those thinking it’d be futureproof — apparently, it blocks the NFC tags that MagSafe accessories like the Wallet use to passively ID themselves to the phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aieFb5"&gt;And while we’re on the subject of cases, &lt;em&gt;every official iPhone 12&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;case&lt;/em&gt; (and likely the vast majority of third-party ones) are incompatible with the iPhone 13 lineup, because the camera bump got wider this time around. I took advantage of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/24/22684911/iphone-13-true-cost-of-free-phone-iphone-13-pro"&gt;those “free” iPhone offers &lt;/a&gt;to upgrade to an iPhone 13 Mini (loving &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22709829/iphone-13-mini-pro-max-battery-tests"&gt;the improved battery life&lt;/a&gt;, by the way), and now I have an expensive but useless Clear Case with MagSafe that I’m not sure what to do with. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/veSIf7yagsYNfzHMXo1A66G1tO4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21958778/iphone_magsafe_gif.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5lxINl"&gt;Those are just the latest disappointments, though. It didn’t take long before iPhone 12 buyers like me discovered that no, Apple’s new cases don’t actually snap into place like they do in the Apple animations I showed you last year (see above and below). They still rely on a rim that grasps the edges of your phone and requires pressure to insert and remove. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FoW1bR2d1LZ27Mtsv47mblNFWzE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21958810/iphone_magsafe_4_gif.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dhjfvk"&gt;Several &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editors have also complained that the $39 MagSafe charging cable doesn’t have a long enough cord to use on the couch or in bed where its quick-detach feature might actually help — but Apple’s still selling the same 1-meter cable a year later. My MagSafe pad now sits unused on a shelf, while I begrudgingly plug in a Lightning cable instead. Meanwhile, both it and the $129 MagSafe Duo still don’t come with charging bricks, even though the previous Apple USB-C chargers you might own (18W and 29W) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169285/apple-29w-usb-c-power-adapter-brick-magsafe-duo-incompatible"&gt;aren’t good enough to drive them at full speed&lt;/a&gt;. They require 20W and 30W chargers, respectively, which Apple sells for $19 or $49 each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWq5PO"&gt;And though it took most of a year for Apple to release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588777/apple-magsafe-battery-review-size-iphone-12-mini"&gt;its own MagSafe Battery Pack&lt;/a&gt;, we were underwhelmed by its capacity in our review. I bought and returned one myself, though not for any of the reasons Dieter laid out. I just couldn’t stand how weak the vertical magnet was even with Apple’s own Clear Case, the pack always twisting in my hand. (Without the case, it made my iPhone 12 Mini uncomfortably warm to hold.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qry9ui"&gt;Every one of these examples speaks to a lack of foresight around MagSafe, and that’s unusual. Foresight is generally one of Apple’s strengths, bringing out new products and technologies only when their time has come. But to me, the real tragedy of MagSafe’s first year is the lack of a larger ecosystem. The entire time we’ve been waiting for Apple to show us what MagSafe is truly capable of, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/18/22629703/apple-magsafe-charging-mfi-standard-accessory"&gt;it’s been keeping the rest of the world from getting out ahead&lt;/a&gt; — using its MFi program and artificial charging restrictions built into the iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dc0B0S"&gt;Combining the Qi wireless charging standard with non-patentable magnets, MagSafe should have been a lightning rod to customization and modularity. So far, Apple has insulated itself — and us — from the possibilities. &lt;/p&gt;
