    <title>This simple dock turns your Apple Watch into a bedside orb</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DouBt1NpuEalMEFtk6e5MK_bSnw=/0x0:1094x729/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69453818/bedroom_black_watch_1296x.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slot in your Apple Watch, and the NightWatch magnifies its screen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NightWatch&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DvbADM"&gt;Have you ever tried using your Apple Watch as a bedside clock, but given up because the screen is just &lt;em&gt;too dang small?&lt;/em&gt; Well, boy do we have a $49.99 dock for you. The &lt;a href="https://nightwatch.shop/"&gt;NightWatch&lt;/a&gt; is combination charging dock, magnifying glass, and acoustic amplifier, bringing together these functions to turn the Apple Watch’s nightstand mode into a bona fide bedside alarm, complete with a tap-to-wake feature to show you the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i35Y4q"&gt;We’ve previously covered novelty docks that turn the Apple Watch into a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/12/14257268/apple-watch-elago-w3-stand-macintosh-smartwatch"&gt;miniature Macintosh replica&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/20/20701999/apple-watch-elago-w6-stand-classic-ipod-smartwatch"&gt;an iPod&lt;/a&gt;. But the NightWatch attempts to make the Apple Watch work &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; in nightstand mode, by making its screen bigger and easier to read and using “integrated sound channels’ to amplify the sound of your alarm. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x5jO8yziUObZDaof3uw_LfHMYMY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22659578/test_lighting_03_1080x.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: NightWatch&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You slot in your existing charging puck behind the watch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dbI95e"&gt;It’s a pretty simple accessory, all told, and basically consists of a single block of polished lucite. That means it doesn’t come with its own charger, so you’ll have to slot in your existing charging puck, and the advertised “tap display” seems to just be relying on the fact that the Apple Watch’s screen will light up at the slightest nudge. “Even nudging or tapping the table might work,” the NightWatch’s &lt;a href="https://nightwatch.shop/pages/support-1"&gt;support page says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i27rZO"&gt;The NightWatch’s launch comes at a potentially awkward time. Last year Apple added a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;new sleep tracking feature to the Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, which means many people now sleep with their watches on their wrists rather than on their nightstand. But if you’re not interested in tracking your sleep data, the NightWatch supports all Apple Watches, is available for pre-order now &lt;a href="https://nightwatch.shop/"&gt;over on its website&lt;/a&gt;, and will be coming to Amazon next week. Shipping is due later this month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon brings its cashierless tech to a full-size grocery store for the first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h9d5TOB1dq6jTtbgtEQaNH6uQ3A=/0x0:7800x5200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69453690/Factoria_JWO_Exit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c56uEo"&gt;Amazon’s cashierless Just Walk Out technology is coming to a full-size grocery store for the first time, the &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/amazon-fresh-grocery-store-meet-just-walk-out-shopping"&gt;company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The new 25,000 square foot Amazon Fresh store is significantly bigger than the 10,400 square foot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21151021/amazon-go-grocery-store-expansion-open-seattle-cashier-less"&gt;Amazon Go Grocery store it opened last year&lt;/a&gt;, or its standard 1,200 and 2,300 square feet Go stores, marking a minor milestone as Amazon scales up its technology. The new store will be Amazon’s fourteenth Fresh location in the US when it opens on June 17th in Bellevue, Washington.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2UAzN"&gt;When Amazon previously opened a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403786/amazon-fresh-woodland-hills-los-angeles-california-dash-cart-grocery-store"&gt;35,000 square foot Amazon Fresh store last year&lt;/a&gt; using its high-tech Dash Carts, it prompted speculation that the company’s Just Walk Out technology wasn’t suitable for larger stores. But Amazon has always maintained that Just Walk Out, which uses a series of overhead cameras and pressure sensitive shelves to automatically detect what shoppers put in their carts, can scale up to stores of any size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rkVG7Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new store is 25,000 square feet in size&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ijnarl"&gt;“Bringing Just Walk Out technology to a full-size grocery space with the Amazon Fresh store in Bellevue showcases the technology’s continued ability to scale and adapt to new environments and selection” said Amazon’s vice president of Physical Retail and Technology, Dilip Kumar. “I’m thrilled it’ll help even more customers enjoy an easier and faster way to shop and can’t wait to get their feedback on this latest Just Walk Out offering.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48AP7G"&gt;Amazon says that when customers arrive at the new store in Bellevue, Washington, they’ll be prompted to pick a checkout option, and that traditional checkouts will still be available for customers that want them. If they decide to use Just Walk Out, they can enter the store by scanning a QR code in the Amazon app, inserting a linked credit or debit card, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496673/amazon-one-palm-reading-vein-recognition-payments-identity-verification"&gt;scanning their palm&lt;/a&gt;. Once they leave the store, they’re automatically billed for the items in their virtual cart, and a receipt is sent digitally to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YllMu5"&gt;The new store uses of Just Walk Out, but it won’t feature the high-tech Dash shopping carts Amazon debuted in its first Fresh grocery store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403786/amazon-fresh-woodland-hills-los-angeles-california-dash-cart-grocery-store"&gt;last August&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon declined to say whether it would be bringing Just Walk Out tech to its pre-existing Amazon Fresh stores in the US. Meanwhile in the UK, the technology appears in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22312970/amazon-fresh-cashier-less-store-uk-go-grocery-london"&gt;Fresh-branded locations&lt;/a&gt; that are similar in size to Amazon’s Go stores in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZZwan"&gt;In addition to Amazon’s own stores, the company also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171230/amazon-just-walk-out-technology-cashierless-go-stores-third-party-retailers"&gt;provides Just Walk Out to third-party retailers&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon says Hudson markets, OTG CIBO Express, and Delaware North are three external retailers that have started to roll out the technology at various locations.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix is producing a ‘fictionalized’ series about Spotify</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rbeQxcrHp_npDQD_jtzhHke2x3k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69452571/akrales_190522_3442_0053.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2TiwRf"&gt;Netflix has tapped the original story of one of the music industry’s biggest startup successes for a forthcoming untitled original series. The series will tell a “fictionalized account” of Spotify’s co-founders, including the service’s chief Daniel Ek.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2iqF7"&gt;The six-part series — which is already &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81186296"&gt;listed on Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, though with limited information — will pull from authors Jonas Leijonhufvud and Sven Carlsson, which documents the rise of Spotify under Ek and his business partner Martin Lorentzon, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/streaming/global/netflix-spotify-drama-cast-1234995731/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The book is &lt;a href="https://bonnierrights.se/work/spotify-untold/"&gt;said to have drawn&lt;/a&gt; from “over seventy interviews, along with previously untapped sources” for a “David vs Goliath story about how strong convictions, unrelenting willpower, and big dreams can help small players take on the titans of tech.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hyVncY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The six-part series will pull from the 2019 non-fiction book &lt;em&gt;Spotify Untold&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VIIMRO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; reports that the show has cast Swedish actors Edvin Endre in the role of Ek and Christian Hillborg as a fictionalized Lorentzon character. It’s unclear whether a Steve Jobs-like figure will appear in the film, though it’s certainly possible. &lt;em&gt;Spotify Untold&lt;/em&gt; does cover the seemingly never-ending battle between Spotify and Apple, and &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2019/music/news/spotify-book-authors-interview-daniel-ek-steve-jobs-1203277715/"&gt;Jobs does feature&lt;/a&gt; in the book’s narrative about Apple’s push-back against Spotify’s launch in the US. As the authors themselves hold that their Jobs intel was central to the book’s narrative, it would be a shame to leave that thread out of the show. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22TDFr"&gt;Netflix declined to confirm to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; whether a Jobs character would appear in the series. But speaking about the book in 2019, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2019/music/news/spotify-book-authors-interview-daniel-ek-steve-jobs-1203277715/"&gt;Carlsson told &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “we both felt a rush of adrenaline when we unraveled the details about the conflict between Apple and Spotify. After several months of research, we could finally account for how Jobs actively worked to oppose Spotify’s establishment in the U.S., and what he may have been thinking. It gave the story an edge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjJCQp"&gt;Plus, nothing spells drama like one tech titan producing a “fictionalized” series about the messy origin story of another. Show us fake Jobs, already, Netflix!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0OX1O"&gt;The show will arrive on Netflix in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch E3 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oa1-khhYmtqlpCAP5VnzRqPRboc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69386792/acastro_180604_1777_E3_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VC1JN5"&gt;E3 2021 is nearly over — there’s just one more full day left. The show has delivered some big announcements so far, including a trailer and release date for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22307059/elden-ring-george-rr-martin-fromsoftware-e3-2021-trailer-gameplay"&gt;highly-anticipated &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22531110/ubisoft-avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-game-trailer-e3-2021"&gt;a trailer for Ubisoft’s gorgeous &lt;em&gt;Avatar&lt;/em&gt; game&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531868/starfield-bethesda-game-xbox-pc-november-11-2022-release"&gt;a release date for Microsoft and Bethesda’s &lt;em&gt;Starfield&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22532295/final-fantasy-origins-square-enix-team-ninja-trailer-e3-2021"&gt;the reveal of a chaos-filled and action-heavy &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; spinoff&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fqabr"&gt;But on Tuesday, there’s still one more potentially huge event on the calendar: a Nintendo Direct with “roughly 40 minutes” of information about upcoming Nintendo Switch games. (Fingers crossed for news on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/11/18661533/nintendo-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-sequel-e3-2019"&gt;the sequel to &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.) And there are also shows from Bandai Namco (the publisher of &lt;em&gt;Elden Ring&lt;/em&gt;, I should add) and GameSpot to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer is releasing its Project Hazel mask in limited drops in the fourth quarter of this year </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DRvVk8ZcmrpnInBPxgMhclZb8fE=/198x185:1277x904/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69452440/razer_project_hazel_gallery_007.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TeJ01v"&gt;Razer had a few announcements timed for E3 2021, including its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22297493"&gt;Razer Blade 14 with AMD’s Ryzen 9 processors&lt;/a&gt;, and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22288350"&gt;updated Raptor 27 gaming monitor along with a 130W GaN charger&lt;/a&gt;. We weren’t expecting to hear about anything else, but Razer CEO Min-Liang Tan announced that its Project Hazel mask will actually go on sale, starting early in the fourth quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9BBqv"&gt;Tan said that Hazel will be released in “drops” exclusively on its website, with the first coming in that fourth quarter timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zq1ZIBm1KtGCkma7XA5YLhDVVWU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22658997/image.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A slide from Razer’s E3 2021 presentation announcing the launch plan. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eN9fKL"&gt;Alongside that availability announcement, Tan also shared some changes coming to the mask since it was first shown &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22221344/razer-project-hazel-n95-respirator-mask-coronavirus-chroma-rgb-concept"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt;. Razer is planning to keep the mask’s transparent design to make it easier to see the wearer’s mouth, but the company will also be adding interior lighting and anti-fog coating on the inside of the mask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dqb4tA"&gt;If you want to see what Project Hazel looks like on your face, Razer has &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/ar/465912324600616/"&gt;an Instagram filter&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Razer/status/1385971794226520068"&gt;lets you try it on via augmented reality&lt;/a&gt;. (I should note that for some reason, it doesn’t work for me on my iPhone 12 mini.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5VlFch"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

    <title>Razer’s updated Raptor 27 is a faster 165Hz monitor, now with optional VESA</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Raptor 27 gaming monitor" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T0RJl8DCBo7fkiBZ4p48zacJDtI=/0x0:2824x1883/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69452284/raptor27_2021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Raptor 27 looks the same as the previous model&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="csB5o1"&gt;Razer has refreshed its minimalist Raptor 27 gaming monitor with &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/free-sync"&gt;FreeSync Premium&lt;/a&gt; support with low frame rate compensation for smoother gameplay; a slightly faster 165Hz refresh rate (the previous model topped out at 144Hz); and THX certification claiming to deliver great color, tone, and image accuracy. Like the 2019 version, this one has Nvidia G-Sync compatibility, and its matte 27-inch QHD IPS panel covers 95 percent of the DCI-P3 color space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0owe3d"&gt;This monitor will cost $799.99 when it releases in Q3 2021, which is $100 more than the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18168800/razer-raptor-gaming-monitor-blade-advanced-nvidia-rtx-price-ces-2019"&gt;previous version&lt;/a&gt;. The improvements make it at least worth considering if you want to game on PC with enhanced variable refresh rate tech. That, and Razer’s Raptor 27 is tough to beat when it comes to design, with its sturdy aluminum base that lets the monitor flip 90 degrees for easy cable management. It’s undoubtedly a high price to pay, though, when some 4K gaming monitors cost just a little more. For $899, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22216979/acer-gaming-monitors-nitro-predator-xv28-xb27-xb32-ces-2021-may-price-specs-hdmi-21"&gt;Acer’s Nitro XV28&lt;/a&gt; has a 28-inch 4K IPS screen with HDMI 2.1 ports that support up to fast 120Hz refresh rate gaming on PC or the PS5 and Xbox Series X.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3HMKPP"&gt;Razer now offers a VESA adapter for this Raptor 27 and the previous model. If you want to abandon the base that comes with the monitor, this adapter (also releasing in Q3 2021) costs $100 and will let you mount the Raptor 27 to a monitor arm or some other VESA base that you might prefer. This would have been a pretty appealing accessory to include with the refreshed monitor, particularly given that the new monitor &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; costs $100 more, but alas. There’s a good chance you might want to use the standard Chroma LED-lined base anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Raptor 27" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5UJLahf3-9FdwqzT6PdLQdW1lvw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646033/raptor27_vesamount.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The optional VESA adapter will let you mount the Raptor 27 to a monitor arm or a different stand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fx0ZEq"&gt;Outside of the tweaks I mentioned earlier, not much else is different here. The ports haven’t changed with this update. It still comes with an HDMI 2.0b port, a DisplayPort v1.4 port, a USB-C port with DisplayPort support, two USB Type-A 3.2 Gen 1 passthrough ports, and a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer GaN charger" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/749QHsJoBa4lMIJ2SdHDmb7sljU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22646040/razergan.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charge up to four devices at once, with 130W of power to split.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1OYLjL"&gt;Razer has another E3 announcement, but it has little to do with gaming: it’s a $179.99 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/30/18203879/gan-chargers-anker-powerport-atom-pd-1-ravpower-45w"&gt;GaN charger&lt;/a&gt; that can supply up to 130W of total power. It’s worth noting that its two USB-C ports support up to 100W (not 130W as the name might seem to suggest), and the two USB Type-A ports can pull 18W each. If you have multiple devices plugged in at once, it’ll share the wattage between them, totaling up to 130W. The charger comes with some global adapters included, so it might be a good option for traveling, depending on where you’re going. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bexVPR"&gt;Razer’s GaN charger isn’t the only 100W option on the market. There’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21311978/hyper-hyperjuice-charger-available-price-kickstarter-specs"&gt;HyperJuice’s similar-looking $100 charger&lt;/a&gt;, for one, and that company also made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21492491/hyperjuice-stackable-gan-charger-100-watts-kickstarter-available-now-pricing-release-date"&gt;these inventive 65W and 100W GaN chargers&lt;/a&gt; that can be stacked for more power and more ports. You’ll be hard-pressed to find a faster USB-C charger than 100W, but that could change in the future, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/5/25/22453936/usb-c-power-delivery-extended-power-range-epr"&gt;the new USB-C Release 2.1 spec supports up to 240W charging&lt;/a&gt;. Though, in the meantime, it won’t take much effort to find a more affordable GaN charger than Razer’s.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Blade 14 is the first Blade laptop with AMD Ryzen processors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A user uses the Razer Blade 14 on a laptop stand connected to an external mechanical keyboard and monitor. The monitor screen displays a game; the laptop screen displays a Razer logo on a red, black, and green background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1iiLqMLHuM8qPhAzCMO3_-g-_ws=/0x0:8256x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69452290/Razer_Blade_14__2021__Gaming___3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Razer Blade 14.&lt;/em&gt; | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DwsSSQ"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_rogame/status/1374818024683941891"&gt;months&lt;/a&gt; of rumors and speculation, many gamers’ dreams have finally come true. Today, Razer has announced the new Razer Blade 14, which is powered by AMD’s flagship Ryzen 9 5900HX. It’s the first Razer Blade to include an AMD processor, and it’s available for purchase now on Razer’s website starting at $1,799.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vBIbHS"&gt;The 14-inch gaming rig will also feature up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU and a QHD 165Hz display as well as an FHD 144Hz option. Razer says the Blade will be the smallest 14-inch gaming laptop on the market, with dimensions of 12.59 x 8.66 x 0.66 inches. There’s also a 720p webcam (which isn’t a given on gaming laptops these days).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHjZNa"&gt;The rest of the laptop looks like a fairly standard Razer Blade, including the signature per-key RGB keyboard and the triple-headed snake logo on the lid.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An over-the-shoulder shot of a user typing on the Razer Blade 14. The screen displays the Razer logo on a red, green, and black background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4WrA-1ysW-5u9lfJbe8tDTcFC24=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22658030/Razer_Blade_14__2021__Studio_1___Alt.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check those keys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NOeqoS"&gt;“As gamers demand lighter and more powerful form factors in gaming laptops, we have remained committed to our goal of delivering best-in-class mobile processors for premium OEM designs,” said Saeid Moshkelani, SVP and GM of AMD’s client business unit. “We are excited to collaborate with Razer, for the first time ever, by powering the Razer Blade 14 with the best mobile processors we have developed for gaming.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user sits at an outdoor picnic table, typing on the Razer Blade 14." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H97zYVSErBgzRnbHMhWZRfZLALY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22658021/Razer_Blade_14__2021__Lifestyle_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The logo we know and love.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JCt3xf"&gt;Razer’s Intel systems have consistently ranked among our picks for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;best gaming laptop&lt;/a&gt; you can buy. Its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"&gt;Blade 15 Advanced&lt;/a&gt; delivers excellent frame rates while remaining comparable in size to a number of 15-inch productivity machines. Its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21340554/razer-blade-stealth-13-review-keyboard-specs-price-features"&gt;Blade Stealth 13&lt;/a&gt; is one of very few 13-inch gaming laptops that can run AAA titles at native resolution, and its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt; delivers some of the most powerful performance you can find in a gaming laptop, period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Ypba6"&gt;But laptops with AMD CPUs have been doing better than those with Intel CPUs in recent years, in both performance and battery life. Our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;top two&lt;/a&gt; selections for the best gaming laptop are both AMD-powered, as is our best budget pick. Asus’ AMD-powered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt; delivers some of the best performance and battery life that we’ve ever seen from a 14-inch laptop. It’s exciting to see Razer combining its top-notch build quality with these top-notch processors, and we’ll see how well it stacks up to Asus’ offerings once we’ve gotten our hands on the unit. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Resident Evil Village DLC is in the works after popular demand</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uvoNMq2o4XgsJhX58lp5Er8o8fg=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69452268/8GY4TWwGyghcgqoAnv7ka9.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HvWxgJ"&gt;Capcom has announced that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22420738/resident-evil-village-review-playstation-xbox-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will be getting downloadable content. The news was revealed during an E3 2021 Showcase that was short of new announcements. A quick message during the livestream confirmed that DLC has entered production “by popular demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSFyN0"&gt;While there were no more details beyond this, the implication is that we could be getting more content featuring the game’s most popular character, Lady Dimitrescu. Another possibility could be the return of fan-favorite Ada Wong, who was originally planned to feature in &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt;, as revealed via early concept art that can be unlocked in the game. Of course, it could be a while before this additional DLC comes out, as it appears there had been no plans ahead of the game’s release, whereas &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7&lt;/em&gt; already had a season pass planned for launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UWeYFt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Resident Evil Village has more guns but fewer scares","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22420738/resident-evil-village-review-playstation-xbox-pc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="xaeHHV"&gt;It was also confirmed that online multiplayer game &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil RE:Verse&lt;/em&gt; will be releasing next month, and is free for everyone who has purchased &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dcjGxK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RgD2L7v9jm4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sj4D6o"&gt;Ahead of the Capcom E3 2021 Showcase, the publisher had said it would be focusing on updates on &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles.&lt;/em&gt; And, true to its word, that’s exactly what we got. Nonetheless, it provided another emotionally charged story trailer for &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2&lt;/em&gt;, and also confirmed that it will be getting free trial demo coming on June 25th. Players will also be able to carry save progress over to the full game when it launched on July 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x8jLmA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Doom now runs on an Ikea smart light bulb</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/doToa5VyIG7OUP8vbbzSwsQ1NF0=/105x0:1239x756/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69452209/Mounted_on_lamp.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ftNuKw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 15th, 5:39AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The creators of the mod, Next-Hack, have taken down the video. In a &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/itrunsdoom/comments/nys0bv/doom_running_on_an_ikea_tr%C3%A5dfri_rgb_gu10_lamp/h1tnx4z/?context=3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;comment on Reddit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; they say they “had a request to remove this post and all public material.” We’ve reached out to see what that request might have been. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bUSHE0"&gt;“Can it run Doom?” is a question nearly as old as &lt;em&gt;Doom &lt;/em&gt;itself, as creative hardware hackers and software savants across the internet work to try and get the 1993 classic shooter to run on virtually anything that has a microprocessor. The latest absurd entry: an Ikea Trådfri GU10 345 RGB LED bulb, &lt;a href="https://next-hack.com/index.php/2021/06/12/lets-port-doom-to-an-ikea-tradfri-lamp/"&gt;which &lt;em&gt;Next-Hack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has managed to hack into running a modified version of Doom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VN5zgq"&gt;The actual hack is a bit of a cheat, given the fact that unlike past Doom hack candidates, like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21611884/nintendo-game-and-watch-doom-port-hack-homebrew-games"&gt;Nintendo Game &amp;amp; Watch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21611884/nintendo-game-and-watch-doom-port-hack-homebrew-games"&gt;the MacBook Pro Touch Bar&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/1/19/2719205/ndoom-ti-nspire-calculator-port-color-upgrade"&gt;TI calculator&lt;/a&gt;, the Trådfri bulb doesn’t have any buttons or a display. Next-Hack had to add those, using the MGM210L RF board that powers the “smart” part of the bulb, and modifying a copy of &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; to run on its paltry 108kB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TE_NTW6KlbAH5PUSUDC7Pws3LVc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22658882/Mounted_on_lamp.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://next-hack.com/index.php/2021/06/12/lets-port-doom-to-an-ikea-tradfri-lamp/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Next-Hack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QZ5aeJ"&gt;And even then, there’s a lot of impressive workarounds to get the actual game to run, including adding additional storage, getting audio to work, and the ever-tricky management of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Kn6dK"&gt;For deeper technical details, it’s worth reading the full article, but the results speak for themselves — the processor has enough power to not only run &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt;, but run the modified version pretty well. Not bad for a light bulb. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer Chromebook Spin 713 (2021) review: victory lap</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The newest Chromebook Spin 713 is just as good as last year’s model&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="NeIr7b"&gt;Acer has made three significant upgrades to the best-in-class Chromebook Spin 713. The first is that the device now has Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. The second is that the USB-C ports both support Thunderbolt 4. And the third is that it now has an optional fingerprint reader (which isn’t available yet, but will be in the future). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxVBEo"&gt;These aren’t the most revolutionary spec bumps in the world. The rest of the Spin 713 remains the same: it has a fantastic 3:2 touch display, a good backlit keyboard, a smooth touchpad, and good value for its premium components. But the changes add up. And they serve to push the Spin 713 even further ahead of its competition than it was before. It’s very much still the Chromebook to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VYt9Li"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10515970"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="QmmuFb"&gt;The Spin 713’s standout feature is its 2256 x 1504 panel. It’s one of the best Chromebook screens I’ve ever used. Colors really pop, details are crisp, and it gets plenty bright. Though the screen is glossy, I rarely saw glare, and what I did see didn’t hinder my work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2IL7D"&gt;But my favorite aspect of this display (and of this Chromebook as a whole) is the 3:2 aspect ratio. You get noticeably more vertical space than you would from a standard 16:9 display of a similar size. Less scrolling, less zooming out, more room for all your tabs and apps. I’m a fan of 3:2, and I’ve been happy to see more laptop models taking it up over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 open on a table angled to the right. The screen displays a blue background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZPGPEbVmpPQ9y9acEBBZGEtcTWU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539425/mchin_20190815_4597_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screeeeeeeeen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ej4rpl"&gt;Another strength (which Acer has strengthened with this model) is the port selection. This is the first Chromebook to support Thunderbolt 4 — many premium Chromebooks don’t even support older Thunderbolt standards. There are not one, but two USB-C Thunderbolt 4 ports on the left side of the Spin. This makes the Spin 713 one of the most affordable machines in the world to include Thunderbolt 4. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pj9KqG"&gt;The USB-C ports also support USB 3.2 Gen 1, DisplayPort, and 5V charging. Elsewhere, you get an HDMI port and a microSD reader, in addition to a headphone jack and a USB-A 3.2 Gen 1. The Spin also supports Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 in tent mode, angled slightly to the left. The screen displays a grid of Android apps on a blue background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NKTBfTv9x3z97actsr6fcw_l9pI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539432/mchin_20190815_4597_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flip it around in tent or tablet mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The right side of the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, half open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n148ToMC64Cdahf_qAoWwuPQ3i4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539429/mchin_20190815_4597_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;USB-A, microSD on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 half open seen from the left side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VqeBowf_w4ShwO3xZtZ4yfWmZww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539428/mchin_20190815_4597_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Two USB-C, an HDMI, and an audio jack on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WT2cqj"&gt;The fingerprint reader also helps put the Spin 713 above premium competitors; the lack of biometric authentication was one of our very few knocks against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;last model&lt;/a&gt;. The sensor lives on the deck, beneath the arrow keys. It’s the same color as the Spin’s finish and is nicely camouflaged. (While our review unit had a fingerprint reader, that unit is not available for purchase as of this writing, and does not have a finalized price. Acer says it’s coming “soon”. Currently, you can only purchase Spin 713 units without a fingerprint reader, but I’ll update this article when that changes.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="pUqFQa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10516021"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P9Fh6u"&gt;The Spin’s keyboard and touchpad are also quite good. The keyboard is comfortable and backlit, though I wish the keys didn’t feel quite so plasticky. The touchpad is smooth, accurate, and quite large.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nR0Pbl"&gt;Like its predecessor, this Spin 713 has two main drawbacks. The first is that its audio is thin, and I heard a bit of distortion at maximum volume. The second is that the Spin’s aesthetic is utilitarian. The finish is somewhat drab, and the screen bezels are chunky. I wouldn’t call it ugly, but it’s something that would fit in on a school laptop cart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zv7Fo6"&gt;That said, the Spin is also fairly sturdy, with an aluminum chassis, and feels better made than many plasticky devices you’ll find at this price point. The 360 hinge is easy to flip around, and I only saw a tiny bit of screen wobble while I was typing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 open on a table seen from the back, angled to the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jUlNw1Z4uLk7bo8DZzVng0FPszc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539435/mchin_20190815_4597_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tiny bit of screen wobble, but I’ve seen much worse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 open seen from the front. The screen dispalys a blue gradient." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1sG7NaRy6OP-4keVOTxJQ2YnRg8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539424/mchin_20190815_4597_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here it is flipped around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="m78SAc"&gt;Performance is the other area where the new Spin 713 is supposed to have gotten major upgrade. My review model is $699.99 for a Core i5, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. This is the primary configuration that Acer will be selling to start, but more will be coming in August with pricing to be announced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTXKWE"&gt;The Spin is the first Chromebook to be certified through Intel’s Evo program, which is meant to recognize the best portable Intel laptops on the market. The Spin did everything I needed it to, including editing big batches of photos and running multiple demanding apps at a time on top of Zoom calls and Spotify streams, quite fast and without any performance issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCul6z"&gt;That was also true of last year’s Spin 713. What’s new this year is that I’m hearing the fans. Last year’s model was very quiet, but the fans were almost constantly spinning in this model. The noise wasn’t always annoying, but it was often audible. This makes me anxious about the Spin 713’s ability to cool a Core i7, so even if Acer sells a Core i7 model later this year, I’d recommend that most people stick with a Core i5 model unless you know you need an i7. (The Core i5’s performance here is going to be enough for 90 percent of people.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 keyboard deck seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iIw31_xsHSOOhxm36KdS26bgk4w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539434/mchin_20190815_4597_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I didn’t feel much heat in the keyboard, so the fans were doing their job.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RUmKAy"&gt;What’s also gotten a bit worse is battery life: I averaged seven hours and 29 minutes of consistent work with the screen at 50 percent brightness, running some trials with a bunch of Android apps and some trials just in Chrome. That’s about an hour worse than what I averaged on the previous model, though both results are respectable for this price. The battery took 55 minutes to juice from zero to 60 percent with light Chrome use, which is a bit slower than last year’s model (but close). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2M6rdI"&gt;The Spin 713 runs Chrome OS, as all Chromebooks do. It supports all Android apps via Google Play. Everything ran smoothly on this system, in both clamshell and tablet modes. Many Chrome OS apps have improved since I used them on last year’s 713. Slack, for example, was crashing all over the place last year, and is technically usable now. That said, I still generally find that most of my preferred services (Messenger, Slack, Reddit, Instagram, the like) are equivalent or better experiences in browser form. I do like being able to offload distractions like Spotify and Twitter into their own apps so I don’t have them mixed in with my Chrome tabs, but that’s about as far as my typical use of Android apps on a Chromebook goes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The right palm rest of the Acer Chromebook Spin 713 seen from above, angled to the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uCEEfDcuPBYdqsyygiJbL8euOLo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539431/mchin_20190815_4597_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You could totally miss the fingerprint reader.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The fingerprint on the Chromebook Spin 713 seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T0Zoir_fGe62UULibEolF_NxKZ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22539430/mchin_20190815_4597_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;But it’s there!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="uKvCh0"&gt;As was the case with its predecessor, the Spin 713 isn’t a perfect Chromebook. It’s also not cheap as far as Chromebooks go. But it offered unbeatable value last year, and its value has gotten even better. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="t0LT9K"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10516029"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SGwDNu"&gt;To illustrate just how much this device is offering for its $699 price, look to the premium &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;. To buy a Pixelbook Go with an 8th Gen Core i5 (which is now an old chip), 8GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage (half of what you get in this Spin configuration), you’d be paying &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/pixelbook_go?hl=en-US"&gt;$849&lt;/a&gt;. The Pixelbook does have some advantages over the Spin, of course: you’re getting better build quality, a lighter chassis, and slightly better audio. But the Pixelbook has no biometric authentication, it has very few ports and doesn’t support Thunderbolt 4, it’s 16:9, and it’s not a convertible. It’s miles behind in almost every other way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="MWJtoI"&gt;In other words, if you don’t mind a laptop-cart look, the Chromebook Spin 713 is an incredible value. The more power-hungry processor has changed the calculus slightly, but so have the new features. And ultimately, the Spin still comes out on top. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLL2ec"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photography by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fnTLel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, June 14th 5:38PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Acer confirmed after the original publication of this review that the Chromebook Spin 713 that’s currently available to purchase does not have a fingerprint scanner on it, even though our review sample does. A model with a fingerprint scanner is expected to come later this year, but the company has not finalized a price or release date. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
