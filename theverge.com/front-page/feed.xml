    <title>What actually makes something ‘flushable’? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HqGKpg06JkXzlkWDF25ql31rQxE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69280223/Thumb_TEXTLESS.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZRA3rh"&gt;Go to any drugstore or supermarket, and it’s easy to find wipes and other supplies labeled “flushable.” It’s &lt;em&gt;totally fine&lt;/em&gt; to flush those wipes down the toilet, the packaging claims. No problem at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgz0QO"&gt;But according to sewage plants and wastewater experts, those so-called “flushable” products are actually a &lt;em&gt;big&lt;/em&gt; problem. They might be flushable enough to snake through the toilet’s plumbing, but they don’t disintegrate before they reach the various channels, tanks, and propellers at sewage plants. Instead, they clump up on everything they hit — clogging up the system and, in some cases, even breaking heavy pieces of machinery. Employees have to regularly hand-chisel wipe-boulders out of the innards of the sewage plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VllWkY"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;Science video team went to see the damage wipes can do — and got up close and personal with the bits of fabric that cost cities millions and millions of dollars each year to manage. Watch our latest video to see what we discovered.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony announces new black and red DualSense controllers for the PS5 you still can’t buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T92jRH8v9wnNJndil-gkXYfa1GY=/19x0:1984x1310/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69280077/Screen_Shot_2021_05_13_at_9.08.52_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q0Gm3o"&gt;Sony has announced its first new colors for PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller: a “cosmic red” model that features a two-tone red and black design, and an all-black “midnight black” version that brings to mind the classic PS2, PS3, and PS4 controller designs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4pro8v"&gt;Until now, Sony has only offered the DualSense controller in a black-and-white color scheme to match the PS5 (which features a similar contrasting theme), so the new color options are certainly welcome ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuayIH"&gt;The midnight black option is particularly notable: the primarily white DualSense was a big departure for Sony’s designs, which have largely trended toward black and gray consoles and controllers by default for the entire life span of the PlayStation brand. The new black option (technically still a two-tone design, with two different shades of black) is closer to those other controllers, though. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nyv-k_W9-w4niSizPXuGu2b8gbY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22511515/51177281140_630303a64d_h.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WF51c1Q0LtRGxTDr516roOre7qc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22511516/51176194136_6b76edb34d_h.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2f5Jzx"&gt;Right now, Sony has only announced new colors for the controller, although the PlayStation 5 console does feature removable face plates — so it’s possible that the company could introduce matching plates for the PS5 sometime in the future. Enterprising companies like Dbrand have already started to fill that gap, though, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279685/matte-black-ps5-faceplates-on-sale-dbrand-sue-us-sony"&gt;with their own third-party options&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tbHGJt"&gt;The two new color schemes should be available to purchase sometime next month (Sony says that dates will be dependent on individual retailers). Pricing hasn’t been announced yet, but for reference, the standard DualSense controller costs $69.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ds6R1G"&gt;Of course, all that assumes that you can find a PS5 in the first place — something that Sony admits might be difficult to do &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428322/sony-ps5-supply-constraints-2022-hiroki-totoki"&gt;until 2022&lt;/a&gt; at the earliest. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Three cheers for Scabby the Rat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/590KRkiHDiDorQrxNi-KWeVdLp0=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69280061/VRG_ILLO_4556_Scabby_the_rat_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by William Joel | Photo by Juana Arias for the Washington Post&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The giant inflatable rodent that became the face of America’s labor movement&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="WW32Jq"&gt;The 12-foot rat loomed over the entrance to the RV trade show in Elkhart, Indiana, the “RV capital of the world.” It stood 12 feet high, its beady red eyes and snarling fangs alerting attendees that at least one company wasn’t playing nice with union organizers. Depending on who you asked, the gigantic inflatable rodent was either a menace or a rallying cry. But to its owners — members of the International Union of Operating Engineers (IUOE) Local 150 — it was merely Scabby, a beloved symbol of the labor movement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xYYbRC"&gt;Since the late ‘80s, unions have been using Scabby to shame business owners who won’t negotiate a fair contract with workers. “From the very beginning, you could be picketing in front of a business, have workers out there in tents in the winter, and a barrel full of wood, and a fire to keep warm. You wouldn’t get as much attention from the owners as you did when you had Scabby, because it’s an attack on their brand,” says Jim Sweeney, president of IUOE Local 150. Scabby embarrassed business owners, drawing unwanted attention from passersby. And embarrassment turned out to be a powerful force for union organizers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="SpaTZb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“When it’s 90 degrees out and you put on a heavy, woolen Scabby suit, it could become very rancid inside there”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UUcGrx"&gt;Sweeney helped create the character in 1988 as a way to reclaim worker power from the infamously anti-labor Reagan administration. The first version was a furry costume worn by union organizers. “We quickly found out that when it’s 90 degrees out and you put on a heavy, woolen Scabby suit, it could become very rancid inside there,” Sweeney says. Next, the union created a midsize blow-up rat that stood on top of a car (the “rat patrol’’). The car was fun — a statement! — but still, they wanted something &lt;em&gt;bigger&lt;/em&gt;. Finally, they commissioned Big Sky Balloons to create a massive inflatable Scabby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0RqzMc"&gt;Today, in labor hubs like Chicago and New York City, the rat is a familiar symbol of worker power. Its size ranges from six to 25 feet tall, costing anywhere from $2,000 to $10,000. Yet even the small Scabby is hard to ignore. The rat has red, dark-rimmed eyes, yellowing buck teeth, and sharp fangs, with claws stretched out in front. Big Sky also offers a corporate “fat cat” balloon, as well as a “greedy pig,” although those are less widely seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3cyxEs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Scabby has come under threat of extermination in recent years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D5ANtK"&gt;As an emblem of worker power, Scabby has been enormously successful, pissing off business owners and spreading awareness about its cause. Perhaps for that reason, Scabby has come under threat of extermination in recent years, particularly during the Trump administration. Peter Robb, the former general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), tried to ban Scabby’s usage in some situations, citing a lawsuit about the rat’s presence at the RV trade show in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gsaIQt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/25-CC-228342"&gt;According to a brief submitted by the NLRB’s general counsel&lt;/a&gt;, the IUOE placed Scabby at the entrance to the show, alongside two banners, one of which called out a company named Lippert Components for harboring rat contractors (someone who refuses to work with unionized workers or treats employees poorly). “The inflatable rat was particularly menacing and scary, standing twelve feet tall with red eyes and sharp fangs and claws,” the brief alleges — a description that likely delighted union organizers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAWFsX"&gt;Robb tried to say that Scabby’s presence at the show was “so intimidating” it could “coerce third parties that have nothing to do with the spat, such as the RV company’s contractors,” &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/biden-labor-appointee-frees-scabby-the-rat-from-legal-peril_n_6022e83dc5b6c56a89a4fa6a"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;HuffPost&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Such coercion would constitute an illegal secondary boycott. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SS3879"&gt;Luckily for Scabby, Joe Biden took office and promptly fired Robb, replacing him with acting General Counsel Peter Sung Ohr. In February, Ohr filed a motion to withdraw the earlier complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3uBOz2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It doesn’t represent what’s going on in Alabama right now.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iFfphh"&gt;The move indicated that Scabby’s future was — for the moment — secure. But Erik Loomis, a labor history professor at the University of Rhode Island, says he’s not sure the rat is as relevant for the current worker-led movement as it once was. “It doesn’t represent what’s going on in Alabama right now,” he says. “It doesn’t represent organizing at Google. It doesn’t represent the gig worker economy. It really represents an older version of the American labor movement.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="43eUeW"&gt;That’s partly because Scabby is a product of the building trades, where the rat has long been associated with “scabs,” or people who cross a picket line during a strike to continue working. Newer organizers, particularly in tech, might not know that history, Loomis says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBbo6J"&gt;Sweeney believes Scabby could still have a place in tech unions, noting they are all fighting for the same cause. “It doesn’t matter if I’m a traditional older union, or if I’m a new tech union, we’re doing the same thing,” he says. “We’re all trying to lift workers’ wages, we’re trying to lift workers’ conditions and dignity up. That’s what we’re about.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="KyaTGy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10493160"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="scJWM1"&gt;The comments come just weeks after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;crushing defeat for workers at an Amazon warehouse&lt;/a&gt; in Bessemer, Alabama. On April 9th, the NLRB announced that workers had voted 1,798 to 738 against unionization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcwC7U"&gt;Organizers in Bessemer said the union was about more than just wages. “It is a matter of morality, of just who will make money off their labors,” &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/22320009/amazon-bessemer-union-rwdsu-alabama"&gt;wrote Kim Kelly in &lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s a question of good and evil, about what is righteous, and just, and fair. For these workers and the organizers who have traveled from across the South to support their unionization effort, this is their David and Goliath story. What they want is dignity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ym0z2U"&gt;(According to the Dead Sea Scrolls, Goliath stood at “four cubits and a span,” about six feet and nine inches, or more than five feet shorter than an average Scabby.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Yw8OY4"&gt;Whether or not Scabby has a place in Bessemer, Loomis says he doesn’t expect the rat to go away anytime soon. That’s partly because of how fervently people like Peter Robb hate it. “It does show just how much that silly inflatable rat infuriates those building owners and contractors,” Loomis says. “If anything, Robb’s attack on it made people defend it even more.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMfNye"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s foldable Surface Duo is now the cost of a normal phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yszXUvKkJWwgafZ9kyrGUO0NfGc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69280034/vpavic_4176_20200905_0137.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CEh4N7"&gt;If you’ve been curious about checking out the Microsoft Surface Duo foldable Android phone but didn’t want to pay its original $1,399 price — first off, I get you. The good news is that you no longer have to pay such a high cost to get one. Wellbots is selling the &lt;a href="https://shrsl.com/2yvje"&gt;unlocked Surface Duo with 128GB of storage that works on Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile for just $690&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfPrbc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers can score this deal by using the offer code &lt;strong&gt;THEVERGEDUO&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout. Residents outside of California and New York won’t be charged tax on this purchase. If you want to double the storage, you can get the 256GB Surface Duo for $790.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecCxvl"&gt;This phone released in September 2020 to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt;less-than-stellar reception from Dieter Bohn&lt;/a&gt;. In his review, he praised the battery life, the great design of the hardware, and of course, the delight in running two apps at once. The high price was a big roadblock, but even though the price is lower today, you’ll likely find that its camera isn’t competitive with other similarly priced flagship Android phones. Still, you might be able to overlook its flaws because it’s a unique device that’s now in fire sale territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mjOtyU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10497909"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EQB62Z"&gt;Before I move on, I wanted to mention that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buydig.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMSUSQ00001%2FMicrosoft-Surface-Duo-128GB-Unlocked-GSM-PC-Tablet-Glacier-USQ-00001&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F13%2F22433893%2Fmicrosoft-surface-duo-hori-split-pad-pro-nintendo-switch-anker-sale-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BuyDig is selling the Surface Duo for $699&lt;/a&gt; and the purchase includes a set of LG Tone wireless earbuds. However, this version of the phone works only on GSM carriers like AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EgOdHTDwPxaEpafuvgfOvx46DFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19210687/DSCF7116.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnCPro"&gt;Hori’s Split Pad Pro controller is a great alternative for people who find the Nintendo Switch’s Joy-Con uncomfortable to use. Normally $50, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08FJ82W64?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the midnight blue color is $40.50&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon, which is a good price. Hori’s Joy-Con replacements can turn your Switch into a more ergonomic device that should make it easier to endure long &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter: Rise&lt;/em&gt; sessions. These don’t contain a battery, HD rumble motors, or motion sensors. To that end, they can’t be used when they aren’t attached to the Switch, so keep that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8Vv53I"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10382060"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k9CKcZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740439499960799198#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s Soundcore Liberty Air 2 wireless earbuds in white are $50&lt;/a&gt; (normally $80) today at Best Buy. Anker claims up to seven hours of battery on a single charge, and up to 28 hours of total playback from the battery inside of its included Qi wireless charging case that can also recharge via USB-C. I can’t attest to the sound quality for these, but the silicone ear tips should ensure a relatively comfortable fit that blocks out some outside noise.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple needs to show iOS allows competition... while justifying locking it down</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DCRM2h3Ieo_PTWpFPdxciLGaDYQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69279970/acastro_190319_1777_apple_services_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yhoevp"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial will deliver a verdict on whether Apple is suppressing competition. But if you were watching Wednesday’s testimony, you could easily end up &lt;em&gt;more &lt;/em&gt;confused about what its App Store actually allows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2kXz0"&gt;Apple says iOS users benefit from a locked-down, curated platform. It rejects “stores within stores” like the Epic Games Store, which could allegedly expose users to harmful and unvetted software. It’s also, however, fighting Epic Games’ claims that there’s no meaningful competition on its platform. So this morning, an Apple attorney grilled one of Epic’s witnesses about a slew of iOS-hosted gaming apps. The move might have helped rebut Epic’s complaints, but it also highlighted just how arbitrary Apple’s policies can seem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vO3Piu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“GameClub is a direct competitor to Apple Arcade, and GameClub is available in the App Store today”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vncLBS"&gt;Apple attorney Karen Dunn was questioning Susan Athey, an economist testifying on behalf of Epic. Athey criticized Apple yesterday for not allowing more “middleware,” or third-party services like alternate app stores. Dunn countered with several options that might fit that bill. The list included Valve’s Steam Mobile and Steam Link apps; Microsoft’s Xbox iOS app; Sony’s PlayStation app; and a mobile gaming subscription service named GameClub. “GameClub is a direct competitor to Apple Arcade, and GameClub is available in the App Store today,” Dunn said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HQKjDz"&gt;Apple is right to call these apps gaming services, but as testimony continued, it wasn’t clear they make good App Store alternatives. Steam Mobile lets players manage games for Windows, Mac, and Linux — but not iPhones or iPads. The Steam Link, Xbox, and PlayStation apps all let you play a catalog of games on iOS — but only if you’ve got a PC or console to stream them from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQZzOe"&gt;GameClub &lt;em&gt;is &lt;/em&gt;a cross-platform mobile gaming service. But right after Apple mentioned the app, a GameClub executive posted (and then deleted) a tweet calling that comparison “absurd beyond measure,” thanks to restrictions on how GameClub can operate. Athey testified that Apple rejected GameClub over 100 times, and that Apple only lets GameClub feature games to which it has an “exclusive license.” When &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;emailed GameClub business development VP Eli Hodapp, noting that Apple had described it as a successful iOS game-bundling service, Hodapp replied with “Are you serious?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o53r5T"&gt;The past week has demonstrated a bunch of extremely fine lines between what Apple considers good and bad. The iOS Xbox app allows console-based remote play, for instance. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421570/epic-apple-trial-iphone-xbox-console-specific-general-purpose-pc-testimony-day-3"&gt;as Microsoft’s Lori Wright testified&lt;/a&gt;, Apple and Xbox failed to strike a deal for xCloud, which lets players stream games without an Xbox. Wright even accidentally got an &lt;em&gt;approved&lt;/em&gt; streaming app called Shadow &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421290/microsoft-apple-xcloud-ios-shadow-cloud-gaming-removal-app-store"&gt;kicked off the store&lt;/a&gt;, until Apple decided Shadow offered a “full Windows 10 PC, rather than a library of games.” From the outside, that looks more like a semantic dodge than a decision based on privacy, security, and quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEe2uH"&gt;Apple hammered Epic for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425759/epic-apple-trial-app-store-itch-io-offensive-sexualized-unspeakable-games-day-5"&gt;offering access to Itch.io&lt;/a&gt;, a storefront featuring adult content. But Steam has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/6/17435244/valve-steam-game-release-new-policy"&gt;nearly anything-goes policy&lt;/a&gt; on porn, and Steam Mobile and Link put those games a few taps away on iOS. Conversely, an App Store executive testified that Roblox user-built “experiences” were fine because they couldn’t sneak new, malicious code onto iPhones. But it’s said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357771/apple-cloud-gaming-microsoft-xcloud-google-stadia-ios-app-store-guidelines-violations"&gt;cloud gaming services threaten&lt;/a&gt; the iPhone’s “safe and trusted” model, despite being essentially just streaming video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rK5MJP"&gt;Being confusing or inconsistent doesn’t make Apple’s App Store illegal. Epic needs to demonstrate that Apple’s ecosystem counts as a monopoly, and moreover, that it’s hurting users by producing higher prices or subpar service. But part of Apple’s defense is that it’s a fair, consistent steward putting users’ best interests first. As the trial goes on, it’s sometimes hard to tell what it thinks those interests are.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Quibi’s grounded content will be reborn on Roku starting May 20th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VDIRnAnPduB5FBthTMAtNfOrt7M=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69279854/TRC_Roku_Originals.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roku&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t6suLp"&gt;The Roku Channel is getting its first batch of Quibi shows on May 20th, Roku has announced. There’ll be 30 so-called “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395533/roku-originals-quibi-content-tv"&gt;Roku Originals&lt;/a&gt;” available to stream initially, but Roku says it eventually plans to release all 75 of Quibi’s titles on its service. They’ll be available to watch free of charge in the US, Canada, and UK, with ads inserted in between individual short-form episodes. Roku announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220426/quibi-roku-channel-acquisition-content"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt; that it would be exclusively licensing Quibi’s library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gvxpVy"&gt;Included in this first batch of shows are the seventh season of &lt;em&gt;Reno 911!&lt;/em&gt;, the cooking documentary &lt;em&gt;Shape of Pasta&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Chrissy’s Court &lt;/em&gt;(starring Chrissy Teigen)&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and Kevin Hart’s &lt;em&gt;Die Hart&lt;/em&gt;. In the US, The Roku Channel is available on iOS, Android, select Samsung TVs, Amazon Fire TV devices, and the web, in addition to Roku’s own hardware. Meanwhile in the UK, it’s available on Sky Q and Now TV devices, as well as Roku devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Nsb832"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Quibi’s library lives on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="urHJkQ"&gt;Some of these shows have big names attached to them, but that didn’t stop Quibi itself from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/21/21527197/quibi-streaming-service-mobile-shutting-down-end-katzenberg"&gt;shutting down&lt;/a&gt; after just six months of operation. Despite this failure, Roku argues that it’s in a much better position to make a success of this content than Quibi was. For starters, its Roku Channel already reaches tens of millions of viewers, and they won’t have to pay anything extra to watch Quibi’s content. Roku also says Quibi’s short-form nature (each episode lasts 10 to 15 minutes) provides natural breaks for advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwWco1"&gt;Other than inserting ads, Roku says it hasn’t made any major tweaks to Quibi’s content. Of course, watching on your living room TV means there isn’t the option to view the shows in portrait like there was with the Quibi app, but Roku argues that the content was filmed in high enough quality that you shouldn’t be able to tell that they were originally made with phone screens in mind. All of the content will stream at 1080p resolution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLmzQs"&gt;Roku announced it would be exclusively licensing Quibi’s library of content in January, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285819/roku-original-content-job-listing-plan-original-shows-movies"&gt;job listing the following month&lt;/a&gt; suggests Roku has plans to develop its own in-house content. The Roku Channel currently hosts over 250,000 movies and TV episodes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDX9iE"&gt;Here’s the full list of 30 Quibi titles that will be available to stream on May 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="chpS5b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;#FreeRayshawn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="cLp4kW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;About Face&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bURNFl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bad Ideas with Adam Devine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BtY00V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barkitechture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="r1lyTq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big Rad Wolf&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WUEWvi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blackballed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ekCF51"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Centerpiece&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JzGIYF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chrissy’s Court&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4fhIlC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cup of Joe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vH25Zx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Die Hart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3kZOEO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dishmantled&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ERoN2B"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dummy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="43nieu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fight Like a Girl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gfCG3x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flipped&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5b2IRU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fugitive&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hIKdnB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gayme Show&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="z6HK6q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iron Sharpens Iron&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Rx6yMo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last Looks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fmrFXT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let’s Roll with Tony Greenhand&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="F7u7ar"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most Dangerous Game&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FbbDCl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Murder House Flip&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eKSKVe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Murder Unboxed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sHgZba"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nightgowns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wAGBQp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prodigy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LupDLh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Punk’d&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yv7386"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reno 911!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9wQagh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Royalties&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="N2O5c7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shape of Pasta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TQgbJB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thanks a Million&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1RDLGK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;You Ain’t Got These&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="5PDQOp"&gt;These shows will be available exclusively on The Roku Channel. In the case of &lt;em&gt;Reno 911!&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;previous seasons are available to watch elsewhere, but the formerly Quibi-exclusive season 7 is now exclusive to Roku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R5feQ8"&gt;To coincide with the release of the shows, Roku is discounting several of its players. In the US, the Streaming Stick Plus will be discounted by $10, the Streambar and Roku Ultra will be discounted by $30, and the Roku Express will be discounted by $5. The deals will be active between May 16th and 29th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s how E3’s all-virtual event will work this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LN86UVaOmF3r4rA7vqg1UVQlCnE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69279862/acastro_190531_1777_e3_lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aHK30X"&gt;The world’s biggest gaming showcase, E3, is going all-virtual for the first time in its history, with organizers revealing today how they plan to keep enthusiasts interested without the sights and sounds of the show floor. The virtual E3 will run from June 12th to June 15th. The showcase will include an online portal with access to virtual exhibitor booths with video content and articles, live streams, and social elements like forums, customizable user profiles, leaderboards, and “lounges.” Registration is free and opens later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USCtUu"&gt;This will be the second year in a row that E3 has not taken place in person in Los Angeles due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Last year, the show’s cancellation was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21163570/e3-canceled-coronavirus-outbreak-xbox-nintendo"&gt;announced in March&lt;/a&gt;, and the show’s organizers, the Entertainment Software Association (ESA), did not present an official online version of the event. In its place, a collection of digital events emerged, collectively called the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21254666/gaming-events-summer-game-fest-2020-e3-gamescom-digital-announcements"&gt;Summer Game Fest&lt;/a&gt;. This year, however, the ESA is coordinating a centralized virtual E3 event, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22363385/summer-game-fest-returns-back-june-geoff-keighley"&gt;the Summer Game Fest&lt;/a&gt; is also returning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qlg7nR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;E3 broadcasts will still be available via Twitch and YouTube&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pBLDKz"&gt;Along with its virtual show floor, the E3 app and portal will host video streams with interactive elements like viewer polls and featured tweets. Broadcasts will include press conferences, industry panels, and game showcases. In addition to the official app and portal, streams will also be available via the official E3 &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/e3"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/e3"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/E3"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/E3Expo/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Enh9eK"&gt;As well as the public show, there’ll also be a “media access week” running from June 7th in which the ESA says media will be able to use the online portal and app to connect directly with E3 exhibitors. Today’s press release doesn’t detail exactly who these exhibitors are, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22368617/e3-2021-virtual-event-digital-microsoft-nintendo"&gt;last month the ESA announced&lt;/a&gt; that E3’s lineup would include Nintendo, Xbox, Capcom, Ubisoft, Take-Two Interactive, and Warner Bros. Games. Sony and EA were absent from the list. The PlayStation manufacturer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/15/18097441/sony-playstation-skipping-e3-2019-keynote-booth"&gt;skipped E3 2019&lt;/a&gt; and announced it would &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/13/21060433/sony-playstation-e3-2020-ps5-event"&gt;not be attending E3 2020&lt;/a&gt; prior to its cancellation. Meanwhile, EA will host its own EA Play Live event &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/electronicarts/status/1392148869459415040"&gt;the following month in July&lt;/a&gt;. Despite being on the ESA’s original list, Konami later announced &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Konami/status/1388266921498394624"&gt;in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; that it would not be participating at this year’s E3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAsR3h"&gt;E3 has evolved a lot over its history. Although certain aspects like the big publisher press conferences have been publicly viewable for years, until recently, the in-person show itself was an industry and media-only affair. It was only in 2017 that the ESA &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/8/14548376/e3-2017-open-ticket-sales-public-february-13"&gt;officially opened its doors to the public&lt;/a&gt; with tickets priced at $250. This year’s format is dropping the high price of attending in person, though it’s unclear how much of the magic of the show floor can be recreated in virtual booths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szq6Aw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 13th, 9:18AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to note Konami’s tweet confirming it will not be presenting at this year’s E3.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s new travel mouse does wireless charging</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_zrLvqpxT-hGBgOYe6idd7msUXc=/105x0:3255x2100/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69279859/Untitled.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y9yydQ"&gt;Lenovo is starting a new line of accessories, called Lenovo Go: a lineup of chargers, mice and keyboards, and audio products designed for the new world of hybrid workers who’ll be both commuting to the office and working from home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIDPCY"&gt;The company is starting small with two products so far. There’s Lenovo Go Wireless Multi-Device Mouse, a travel mouse whose main claim to fame (other than portability) is support for wireless Qi charging (in addition to USB-C). There’s also the Lenovo Go USB-C Laptop Power Bank, which offers 20,000mAh of charging capacity at up to 65W, with the ability to charge up to three devices at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NVRVKr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Coming in June&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="02AsiD"&gt;Neither device is groundbreaking, but it’s the hybrid commuting focus that makes them interesting. Lenovo is specifically designing the devices so that workers will be able to easily switch them between multiple computers, while still being small enough to just toss in a bag and easily take home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wujnh6"&gt;The new Go products are also just the first in what will eventually be a full product lineup. Lenovo has plans for “a range of wired and wireless charging solutions,” more mice and keyboards, and “audio solutions” to help improve meetings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tgnd3M"&gt;Lenovo Go Wireless Multi-Device Mouse is set to cost $59.99, while the Lenovo Go USB-C Laptop Power Bank will cost $89.99. Both devices will be available in June. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Echo Buds review: very hard to beat for the price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Amazon’s second-gen earbuds are improved in almost every way&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="IIrTaz"&gt;Amazon’s new second-generation Echo Buds are the company’s second crack at true wireless earbuds. They’re smaller, lighter, and more comfortable than before, and now have more effective noise cancellation. The first time around, Amazon borrowed some of Bose’s tech to help the original Echo Buds block outside noise, but version two was built completely in-house. Hands-free Alexa voice commands still get top billing, but the most compelling thing about the Echo Buds is still their aggressive price — and the solid mix of features you get in exchange.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DF9zyO"&gt;The Echo Buds cost $99.99 or $119.99 (with wireless charging case) for a limited time, after which the prices will rise to $119 and $139.99, respectively. Not only is Amazon undercutting premium noise-canceling buds from Apple, Bose, Sony, and others, but it’s also seemingly trying to obliterate mid-range options like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323748/anker-liberty-air-2-pro-review-wireless-headphone-price"&gt;Anker Liberty Air 2 Pros&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hw85uJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10496801"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GEQAOP"&gt;The revamped Echo Buds are 20 percent smaller in footprint and have a shortened nozzle, so they protrude from the ears a bit less. They ditch the glossy outer touchpad for a matte design (though the side facing your ear is glossy) The Amazon “smile” logo is present on both earbuds, but it’s not as obnoxious as I assumed it’d be. It’s matte and printed onto the buds instead of being embossed or given a different texture to stand out, so the logo doesn’t really call attention. Still, I’d have preferred it not to be there at all. The charging case is far more understated; there, the smile logo is on the underside — where most people are never even going to see it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-5DEFoox1t7pCF6P1Km4dnpbATs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22509553/cwelch_20210510_4582_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s blatant logo is unfortunate, but doesn’t call much attention.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fAU4pU"&gt;That case has also been downsized and is roughly 40 percent smaller than the last gen, but still carries enough juice to provide the earbuds with two full recharges. The Echo Buds last for five hours with ANC enabled, which is extremely par for the course in 2021. This stretches to 6.5 hours if you disable noise canceling and hands-free Alexa. Oh, and the case does charging LEDs right: you get separate indicators for the case’s charge and both earbuds also have their own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bJeTroHqDDbkIoviexBzi7iTvPk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22509554/cwelch_20210510_4582_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon includes a plethora of ear tips and wing tips to help you get a perfect fit.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MQ5ovl"&gt;Amazon has included everything but the kitchen sink to help guarantee a good seal and snug fit. There are four sizes of silicone tips in the box — S, M, L, XL — and three different pairs of optional wing tips. The ear tips are color coded, which makes it much easier to tell the different sizes apart without having to squint at them. The wing tips might prove useful if you’re going to use the Echo Buds for intense workouts, but they weren’t necessary for everyday use or outdoor runs in my ears; the reduced size of the earbuds was enough to keep them locked in place for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpKoZk"&gt;The new Echo Buds now feature a vented design to cut down on ear pressure, similar to Apple’s AirPods Pro and recent Samsung Galaxy Buds models. But the flipside of this change means if you turn off ANC in the Alexa app (or with a voice command), you’re going to hear a fair mix of ambient noise. If you want to hear &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt;, Amazon gets credit for its passthrough mode, which nearly matches the AirPods Pro and Bose in how natural sound it sounds. If you crank it up all the way, it almost feels like superpower hearing — but there’s a very noticeable hiss at max passthrough. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/86p6yyac8OC6IyLGrK12U84e0GM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22509557/cwelch_20210510_4582_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It has battery indicators for the case and each individual earbud.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1NFn3H"&gt;Amazon claims that the second-gen Echo Buds cancel out “twice as much noise” as the original pair, and the improvements are most concentrated in lower sound frequencies — exactly what you’d want for flights or bothersome hums around the house or office. But remember that the original Echo Buds utilized Bose’s noise &lt;em&gt;reduction&lt;/em&gt; technology, which isn’t the same as full-blown active noise cancellation. (Even at the time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20884367/bose-says-upcoming-earbuds-better-than-amazon-echo-buds"&gt;Bose said it could do better&lt;/a&gt;.) So while Amazon is advertising significant gains over the prior model, you won’t hear any claims that it’s outperforming earbuds from Apple, Bose, Jabra, or other companies. Those are different goalposts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cKT4Qe"&gt;And the Echo Buds objectively aren’t as effective as the AirPods Pro or Bose QuietComfort Earbuds at turning down the volume knob on the outside world. You might assume that it’s because of the vented design — but the AirPods Pro have that design trait too — so it’s really just that Amazon’s proprietary noise cancellation tech doesn’t yet measure up to the best out there. Occasionally when holding the Echo Buds in my hands, I’d hear a high-pitched whine or squeal coming out of them. This has happened with other earbuds, and Amazon tells me it’s due to an ANC-related feedback loop. Amusingly, I’m also told there’s a “squeal detection algorithm” that’s meant to suppress this. The noise is never really a bother when they’re in your ears, thankfully, but it does pop up from time to time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Echo Buds are 20 percent smaller than Amazon’s first-gen earbuds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lwzpw9"&gt;Passable ANC aside, the Echo Buds do sound good. They handily beat out the AirPods Pro at bass, which is becoming a regular occurrence at this point. Amazon says the 5.7mm drivers are “optimized for increased fidelity in bass and treble,” and they make for easy listening when you’re playing spoken word content like podcasts, audiobooks, or watching videos. All of this proves out as true when using them. The bass has ample kick and the treble is well contained and never gets earsplitting. Tracks like Lil Nas X’s “Montero (Call Me By Your Name)” or Dua Lipa’s “Don’t Start Now” are perfect demonstration of what the Echo Buds are good at. I get the impression that Amazon has tuned these with modern hits in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="uDcvwX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10497377"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0Fh5AR"&gt;But they do lack a layer of depth and texture that you’ll find in the higher price tiers of true wireless earbuds. Acoustic-heavy tunes aren’t as warm as they could be, and tracks like Phoebe Bridgers’ “Graceland Too” don’t have as wide of a soundstage.  The powerful bottom end can make up for that somewhat on songs like “Chinatown” by Bleachers, where the bassline never gets lost to the synths, vocals, and guitars. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pGUyR-mSF8QQhfV-RT8NTwyXV1A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22509558/cwelch_20210510_4582_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The earbuds have a vented design to reduce ear pressure.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S8nbeG"&gt;So even before you get to the Alexa part of the equation, the Echo Buds establish themselves as worthy contenders at a hard-to-resist price. They also offer IPX4 water and sweat resistance, and voice call quality has improved some over the first-gen buds. Audio automatically pauses when either bud is removed, and each side can be used independently. Like most earbuds (save for those from Jabra), the Echo Buds lack multipoint Bluetooth pairing. Both AAC and SBC codecs are supported. Connection stability has been rock solid in my review period so far with only the rarest blip or dropout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HkwJP5"&gt;But how &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; Amazon’s voice assistant fare? Alexa can aptly handle music requests (“play my Release Radar on Spotify”), weather checks, smart home commands, and other activities that are normally smooth sailing on Echo speakers. Amazon says “later this year” the Echo Buds will get the same VIP Filter as its Echo Frames, which lets you pick which notifications you want to hear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oirmnp"&gt;But on the whole, Alexa noticeably lags behind Siri and Google Assistant at more on-the-go requests. If you ask for directions, Alexa responds that you must tap a notification on your iPhone for those directions to actually open up in Apple Maps. It’s not a huge inconvenience, and some of this — like SMS messaging being limited to Android — boils down to platform restrictions, but there are often middle steps that don’t exist if you’re making the same ask of Siri or Google Assistant. (You also must grant the Alexa app full-time location access for directions to work.) It’s nice that I can ask these earbuds where the nearest COVID-19 vaccine site is or inquire about the status of a given subway line, but these are the kind of things that I’m &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; going to use my phone for. Getting people to change that default behavior is no small hurdle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cHSGEh"&gt;There were also bugs where I didn’t expect them. When I would say, “Alexa, turn on noise canceling,” it would often respond “sorry, what device?” Apparently “noise cancellation” is the term you’ve got to use, but it seems obvious that both should get you there. This was never an issue with voice commands asking to enable or switch off passthrough mode, which worked every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RdXzA"&gt;Amazon says it has built in a number of privacy-minded features to limit how often the microphones are listening for the “Alexa” wake word. At least one of the earbuds needs to actually be &lt;em&gt;in your ear &lt;/em&gt;for the mics to function — they’re automatically muted when both are removed — and there must be an active Bluetooth connection to your phone. You can also manually mute the mics with the Alexa app or by customizing a long-press to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6voFH2V5kXaXelOKyX8XqqefNac=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22509563/cwelch_20210511_4582_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Buds package together a lot of good for less.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hk3Pjj"&gt;Though Amazon promotes hands-free Alexa as a flagship feature of the Echo Buds, I think it’ll be a negligible value add for some buyers: the price, comfort, and sound are still enough to make these earbuds quite enticing. You’ve also got the choice of using your phone’s native assistant instead of Alexa, which is another option for the long-press command on the outside of a bud. So at least Amazon isn’t forcing anything on you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="qHqnTR"&gt;If you don’t have an inherent resistance towards Amazon products (and some people certainly do), the 2021 Echo Buds strike a balance of features that’s downright impressive at their selling price. They’re a considerable upgrade from the first-gen earbuds in comfort with improved noise cancellation to boot — even if it’s not close to best in class. You can do better if you’re willing to spend upwards of $50 to $70 more. If you don’t want to go that high, the Echo Buds won’t disappoint. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ZTE’s S21 competitor arrives in June for $749</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="anuhJR"&gt;ZTE announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22384596/zte-axon-30-ultra-5g-specs-launch-us"&gt;Axon 30 Ultra alongside two other devices&lt;/a&gt; last month, and today reveals that the Ultra will go on sale June 4th starting at $749 / €749. Preorders begin &lt;a href="https://ztedevices.com/"&gt;directly through ZTE’s website&lt;/a&gt; on May 27th and include a free pair of ZTE’s Livebuds TWS earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSwaoC"&gt;While ZTE has tried some more adventurous things in its other devices that have missed the mark — an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/17/16667508/zte-axon-m-dual-screen-smartphone-review"&gt;early attempt at a dual-screen phone&lt;/a&gt; and the world’s first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;under-display selfie camera&lt;/a&gt; for starters — the company is playing it straight with the Axon 30 Ultra. The phone is outfitted with cameras aplenty and high-end features, including a top-shelf Snapdragon 888 processor and a large 144Hz fast refresh rate display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAKyR5"&gt;The Axon 30 Ultra’s sub-$800 price tag positions it to undercut the $800 Samsung S21 and $1000 S21 Plus by a little or a lot, depending on which model you’re looking at and how deeply it’s discounted. Buyers in the US should be aware, though — the Axon 30 Ultra will only work on AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile, not Verizon, and its 5G connectivity is limited to one band (B41) on T-Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
