    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ks9gl5"&gt;We are seven days away from the actual Black Friday, but if &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22783359/black-friday-2021-news-tips-deals-retailers-cyber-monday"&gt;you have been paying any mind to our ongoing coverage&lt;/a&gt; for this shopping season, you know there are excellent deals happening every dang day. We have all kinds of excellent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;, including some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22784126/walmart-black-friday-2021-tech-cyber-monday-deals"&gt;retailer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22788031/google-black-friday-2021-deals-cyber-monday"&gt;brand-specific&lt;/a&gt; roundups, and there’s still a whole lot more to come. For now, let’s take a quick peek at some select deals that just popped up today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMbYqI"&gt;First off, Amazon’s latest version of its acclaimed Kindle Paperwhite — released just last month — is $45 off for the Kids version at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P52R2PL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf18gKjIOaL" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This is a killer deal on the new Paperwhite, complete with its better screen that adjusts color temperature, wireless charging, and USB-C port. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHLWa0"&gt;Since it is the kids version, it has no ads and comes bundled with a protective cover. There is no stipulation that you must buy this for a child, so don’t feel any shame in taking advantage of this yourself. It’s the tech deal equivalent of using your kid to get to the front of a busy line (reminder: &lt;em&gt;Verge Deals &lt;/em&gt;does not condone taking parenting advice from &lt;em&gt;Verge Deals.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22745670/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2021-review-usb-c-signature-edition-display-e-reader-books" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review of the new Kindle Paperwhite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="qlJBGZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Win a mystery bag from The Verge jam-packed with free stuff","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22771977/mystery-bag-sweepstakes-gear-tech-entry-rules-black-friday-2021-holidays"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="TZF3rj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10765369"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gDrkGg"&gt;If you have too much shame or prefer an even more budget-friendly e-reader, the most affordable Kindle from 2019 is $40 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07978J597?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf18gKjIOaL" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; — just $50 for the ad-supported version or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FPX819Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$70 without ads&lt;/a&gt;. Kindle prices don’t get any cheaper than this — reaching near-stocking stuffer territory — and though it’s a slightly older model, it still offers that glare-free e-ink screen experience that you only have to remember to charge every few weeks. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fMiDIQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dgB1Pk"&gt;Sticking to the Amazon front for a moment, the retail giant is offering discounts on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/deal/14c15d26?ref=dlx_early_gd_dcl_img_6_14c15d26_dt_sl7_e6" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;several Echo Show devices&lt;/a&gt;. One of the most notable is the 2021 model Echo Show 5, which is perfect as a bedside display for smart alarms or easy connection to a Ring Doorbell live feed. The compact smart display is normally $85 but is currently discounted to just $45 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Show-5-2nd-Gen-2021-release/dp/B08J8FFJ8H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf18nGDjQxI" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pGiDWC"&gt;Amazon also has its Kids Edition of the Echo Show 5 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-5-2nd-Gen-Kids/dp/B08LMSC4WZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted to $50 today&lt;/a&gt;. It comes with a year of Kids Plus subscription for customizing its function to better suit your child’s age. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review of both models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rtzq0r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10609475"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="59Ht7x"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10500490"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jT1A6W"&gt;There are great deals on OnePlus phones across its entry-level, premium, and flagship options. The Nord N200 5G was already a great value proposition, but now you can get it for just $200 ($40 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Android-Smartphone-Charging/dp/B07XWGWPH5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf17RDdFPd3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a whole lot of smartphone chops for two Benjamins. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547482/oneplus-nord-n200-5g-review-screen-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oKsvh3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10874784"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v0nnCf"&gt;Stepping up to the more premium option, the OnePlus 9 is now just $600 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf17Og6sSZa" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Smartphone-Hasselblad-Wireless/dp/B08Y73NTXY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. That’s a discount of $130, bringing the Snapdragon 888-equipped smartphone onto more competitive footing with the Pixel 6. The new Pixels might have bested OnePlus in our latest guide on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163811/best-phone" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The Best Phone to Buy Right Now&lt;/a&gt;, but this sale price makes a OnePlus 9 more worthy of consideration. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mjzJAY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10454529"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ikK3JA"&gt;Finally, this biggest OnePlus sale is reserved for its biggest phone. The ultra-flagship OnePlus 9 Pro is currently $269 off at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf17R8tlJZX" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/OnePlus-Unlocked-Smartphone-Hasselblad-Wireless/dp/B07XM7WVS8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. This undercuts the hard-to-get Pixel 6 Pro by $100, and you get some of the fastest wired charging around. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22788960/pixel-6-pro-charging-speeds-30w-21w-23w-slow-charge-battery-life" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;That’s a bit of a pain point right now for the newest Pixels&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="63UPKo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10424103"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sy1QrI"&gt;In the world of tablets and accessories, Brydge makes all kinds of helpful add-ons. Just today, Brydge has extended a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.brydge.com%2Fpages%2Fsales-and-promotions&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F19%2F22791072%2Famazon-kindle-paperwhite-kids-echo-show-oneplus-9-pro-nord-brydge-ipad-macbook-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;20 percent discount on most of its tablet keyboards and MacBook vertical docks&lt;/a&gt;, and many of these deals can be found at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Brydge/page/654BA356-5862-4B3F-9DEA-43E0EC1FDBD0?ref_=ast_bln" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf2bwHHJj8s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wY4B4o"&gt;Some key highlights from the Brydge line include the 10.2 Max Plus and Vertical Dock for the 13-inch MacBook Air. The Brydge 10.2 Max Plus is a keyboard, trackpad, and protective case for base-model iPads. It is currently $30 off at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf18YRAj1c6" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brydge-Generation-Multi-Touch-MIL-STD-810G-Polycarbonate/dp/B08XWRPVHD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, hitting a new all-time low.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XIv6ra"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685165"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hr00GB"&gt;Brydge’s Vertical Docking Station for recent MacBook Air laptops is $40 off at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brydge-Vertical-Compatible-2020-2018-Thunderbolt/dp/B08DG87N7Z?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf19tWh0zU4" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, allowing you to better optimize the real estate on your desk for $130 instead of the usual $170.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QkQWgh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10874896"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a0tlWJ"&gt;Lastly, have you played &lt;em&gt;Deathloop &lt;/em&gt;yet? No? Well, now it’s just &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergedailydeal111921&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fproducts%2Fdeathloop---playstation-5%2F303537.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$25 at GameStop&lt;/a&gt; for a brand-new physical copy on PS5, so the excuses are getting few and far between. We didn’t think the hot pick for many critics’ game-of-the-year was going to get cheaper than the recently discounted price of $40, but here we are with a new all-time low that is hard to pass up. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22671207/deathloop-review-ps5-pc" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pSlLmg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10835147"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="dxOk8N"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="M0FoKB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YG8WVM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite’s campaign co-op isn’t coming until May 2022 at the earliest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ej_gZduFff3GmIdO1b9uN_Wuf-A=/88x0:1033x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70166381/haloinfinitegameplay_sm_acb7e503fbf64354996593a4d969d56e.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Halo Infinite’s&lt;em&gt; campaign.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: 343 Industries&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z4z65p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite’s&lt;/em&gt; co-op campaign and Forge mode, which won’t be in the game when it officially releases on December 8th, are going to launch even later than previously expected. In &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-11-19-dont-expect-halo-infinite-campaign-co-op-until-may-at-the-earliest"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; head of creative Joseph Staten reiterated that campaign co-op would launch with season 2, but since season 1 was extended by three months to May 2022 &lt;a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/welcome-to-the-halo-infinite-mp-beta"&gt;this week&lt;/a&gt;, that means the second season is at least half a year away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sTeIOE"&gt;Forge is still set to launch with season 3, according to Staten, but we don’t know when that might arrive. And those timelines are still only goals; things may change if other priorities come up, Staten says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJV4pf"&gt;Here’s Staten own words on the matter, from &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;’s interview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZLb1AR"&gt;So our goal still remains what I said before, which is to ship campaign co-op with Season 2 and Forge with Season 3. But those remain goals. Those remain targets. And we can’t commit to any hard dates right now, because as we’re seeing with this multiplayer beta, other things might move up in the priority stack for us. If it turns out that our progression system just isn’t working the way that we intended, if we need to move some of these bigger rocks that I talked about sooner then we as a team will make those decisions and will clearly communicate to our fans why we’re why we’re doing certain things.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="qu6kMv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s co-op campaign is “playable now,” Staten says, but the development team wants to take the extra time to make sure it’s stable and works well. The current single-player-only campaign, which itself was delayed, already sounds &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22789035/halo-infinite-campaign-preview"&gt;pretty darn good&lt;/a&gt;, so I’m hoping that the extra time for co-op will be worth the wait — even it means that I can’t run through Zeta Halo with a friend on December 8th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla accused of ‘rampant sexual harassment’ in new worker lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZQgQtT7CWbAzRt_QuIiwnNFpBYM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70166335/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tesla is being sued for sexual harassment | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mDbqpD"&gt;A worker at Tesla’s factory in Fremont, California, is accusing the automaker of creating a hostile work environment where sexual harassment was “rampant.” As first reported by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, Jessica Barraza, who was hired as a production associate in 2018, said in a lawsuit filed this week that she was subjected to constant harassment at the factory, including catcalling and inappropriate physical touching. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYTehz"&gt;“Nearly every day for three years, my female coworkers and I were objectified, threatened, touched, and propositioned on the factory floor,” Barraza said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I wanted to come to work, do my job, and support my family without having to endure constant sexual harassment. I felt degraded, humiliated and traumatized.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5KIuHh"&gt;The complaint filed in California Superior Court alleges that supervisors and managers at the Fremont plant not only were aware of a “pervasive culture of sexual harassment” that included sexist language and physical groping but participated in the ongoing abusive behavior. Barraza reported the issues to Tesla’s human resources department, which she says failed to protect her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EU64uM"&gt;The Fremont plant is where Tesla makes its Model S, Model 3, Model X, and Model Y electric vehicles. In October, the company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710279/tesla-racism-fremont-plant-137-million-judgement-owen-diaz"&gt;ordered to pay $137 million&lt;/a&gt; to a former contractor at the Fremont plant who alleged he was subjected to racial harassment as part of a hostile work environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nv0XP1"&gt;According to Barraza’s complaint, while walking to and from her workstation over the course of a workday, she heard comments from men remarking on her “coke bottle” figure and making comments about her body, including “fat ass” and “onion booty.” Male coworkers would “brush up against Ms. Barraza’s back-side (including with their groins) or unnecessarily touch her under the pretext of working together in close quarters,” the complaint alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Edfxzz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Tesla’s factory floor more resembles a crude, archaic construction site or frat house than a cutting-edge company in the heart of the progressive San Francisco Bay Area”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2sQSNF"&gt;In September, Barraza began having panic attacks. She is currently on a doctor-ordered medical leave from her job and is being treated for post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ur5iUB"&gt;“Tesla’s factory floor more resembles a crude, archaic construction site or frat house than a cutting-edge company in the heart of the progressive San Francisco Bay Area,” the lawsuit states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yr0y0e"&gt;Lawsuits against Tesla are relatively rare in part because, as Barraza’s lawsuit notes, the company requires employees to sign arbitration agreements as a condition of employment, meaning the workers waive their right to a jury or court trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ng4OGB"&gt;But the Fremont factory has been identified in at least one other lawsuit as a “predator zone” of harassment. In 2017, now-former Tesla engineer AJ Vandermeyden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/28/14764536/tesla-engineer-allege-sexism-harassment-lawsuit"&gt;sued Tesla&lt;/a&gt; for “unwanted and pervasive harassment,” alleging that she and other female employees were denied promotions and paid less than their male colleagues and faced retaliation when they reached out to human resources with their concerns. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/1/15724520/tesla-fires-female-engineer-claims-pervasive-harassment"&gt;Vandermeyden was fired by Tesla&lt;/a&gt; a few months after taking her claims public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Rv1XP"&gt;Barraza’s lawsuit describes harassment, both verbal and physical, of other female employees as well. She told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; in &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/11/19/tesla-sexual-harassment/"&gt;an interview&lt;/a&gt; that the culture of harassment came straight from the top, citing a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1453954994546229253?s=20"&gt;tweet by CEO Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt; joking about a school he wanted to start, which would have a crude acronym. Musk himself is not named in the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7o8bjs"&gt;“That doesn’t set a good example for the factory — it almost gives it like an … ‘he’s tweeting about it, it has to be okay,’ ” Barraza told the&lt;em&gt; Post.&lt;/em&gt; “It’s not fair to myself, to my family, to other women who are working there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FOhMsC"&gt;Tesla did not respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Friday. The company dissolved its press office and rarely responds to media requests. Barraza is seeking compensation, including lost back pay, and an injunction to end harassment at the Fremont plant. Her attorneys also plan to file a claim under the California Private Attorneys General Act on behalf of Barraza and other women who allege they were harassed at the factory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOhKmC"&gt;“Tesla is responsible for the systemic sexual harassment occurring in its factory,” Barraza’s attorney, David A. Lowe, said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We are bringing this case to put a stop to the harassment against Ms. Barraza and her colleagues.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Smart Thermostat review: a $60 stunner</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The budget thermostat Nest should have made&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="pKc8wM"&gt;Since the Nest Learning Thermostat launched in 2011, no other smart thermostat has emulated its core function — learning your schedule and adapting to it automatically, so you don’t have to lift a finger. This feature has made the Nest one of the best smart thermostats (lots of) money can buy for years. But just a decade on, Amazon has finally done it. The online shopping giant’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Smart-Thermostat/dp/B08J4C8871?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$60 Amazon Smart Thermostat&lt;/a&gt; can intelligently determine if you’re home, away, or sleeping and automatically adjust your climate to keep you comfortable and potentially save you money. And you don’t have to program anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="px6wKx"&gt;Amazon worked with Resideo (owner of the historic thermostat brand Honeywell Home) to develop the thermostat. Its internals are very similar to the Honeywell T9 and T5 smart thermostats, and it’s compatible with most 24 volt HVAC systems (you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Smart-Thermostat/dp/B08J4C8871/ref=sr_1_4?keywords=smart+thermostat&amp;amp;qid=1637326592&amp;amp;s=hi&amp;amp;sr=1-4&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check compatibility here&lt;/a&gt;). Together, Amazon and Resideo seem to have finally cracked the smart thermostat conundrum, and the Amazon Smart Thermostat’s learning feature — called Hunches — is very good. No, it isn’t quite as good as Nest’s, but it also doesn’t cost $250. So, tradeoffs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nue7FD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10875005"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HtN1I8"&gt;Hunches — which are part of Amazon’s broader Alexa smart home platform — are AI-driven decisions that use data from your Alexa smart home to decide what to do with your temperature. It follows, unsurprisingly, that the more Echo smart speakers and displays you have in your home, the better it will be. According to Amazon, Hunches also uses “select other smart home devices like lights, locks, and sensors” to determine if you are home or away, as well as geolocation of yours and your household members’ smartphones (everyone has to have the Alexa app installed and location settings turned on for the thermostat). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0YTyB"&gt;However, unlike with the similar Nest experience, you don’t have control over which devices make those decisions; you don’t even know which ones make the decisions. This led to some confusion in my testing, including that Alexa now thinks I get up at 4:31AM every morning, I assume because my daughter sat up in bed at that time and has an Echo Show as her bedside clock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSQjnr"&gt;For the next three days, it turned on the heat a little too early, and I had to go into the thermostat settings in the app to tell Alexa its Hunch was wrong. After three times telling it that, no, we do not wake up at 4:31AM, it reverted to our regular wake-up time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-sjS4Nicw4w-eSg0vp726Jxi29U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019741/jtuohy_211116_4885_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The controls on the Smart Thermostat are three touch points on the bottom. LED icons show you the ambient temperature by default, then the current set point when you tap on one of the arrows.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Foqcf2"&gt;It’s hard to quibble much at this price, however, because at least it’s trying to be smart. Outside of Nest and Ecobee, few thermostats are actually smart. Most are just controlled remotely — either by an app, voice, or geolocation (where it adjusts based on whether your smartphone is at home). This is all very handy, but it’s not intelligent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3oHVU"&gt;Case in point, the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21725036/google-nest-thermostat-2020-review"&gt;Nest Thermostat&lt;/a&gt; has no advanced AI features of which to speak. While it can do useful energy-saving or comfort-increasing tasks such as preheat or cool the home or use the fan to circulate air to more efficiently use air conditioning, it doesn’t have any learning features and its smarts are reliant on Google’s geofenced home / away modes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNGDdE"&gt;If you don’t like the idea of Amazon controlling your climate willy-nilly, the Smart Thermostat has a standard scheduling option. With either set up, you can also use Alexa’s Routines to have your thermostat do specific things based on time of day, when a smart home device tells it to (such as a compatible temperature or motion sensor), or with your voice. These functions are available to any smart thermostat that works with Alexa, but you will not find one as inexpensive as this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tlv1hKJQNQukGCEHtt0PV4lZhfk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019731/jtuohy_211115_4885_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amazon Smart Thermostat is a simple white box that snaps on to a base, which you wire into your existing thermostat wiring. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SijpUPNp6MoMfHuKB0q4MtdXKQE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019733/jtuohy_211115_4885_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It comes with a faceplate to help cover up any holes in the wall from removing your existing thermostat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Thnrgy"&gt;The closest competitor price-wise — the Wyze Smart Thermostat — is $80, and the Honeywell T5 and T9, whose hardware the Amazon thermostat shares, start at $120. Most other smart thermostats are over $100, including the Emerson Sensi, the Lux Kono, and then Ecobee’s and Nest’s start at $180 and $130, respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fyte3e"&gt;Of course, almost all those thermostats work with multiple platforms. The Amazon thermostat only works with Alexa. And while the coming smart home standard Matter — which promises interoperability between ecosystems — may change that, Amazon has not confirmed that this device will be upgraded to support Matter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdjFQN"&gt;While this thermostat is inexpensive, it doesn’t look cheap, unlike the Wyze Smart Thermostat, which has a plasticky feel and an odd, oblong design. The simple, clean design of the Amazon Smart Thermostat will fit in with most homes, and because it doesn’t have an LCD screen, it doesn’t scream “high tech” like others in this space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tqU6Qi"&gt;Instead, the all-white plastic body has a capacitive touch surface that illuminates LEDs to show you the touch points, system mode, and set temperature. There is also a small green tree that appears when you set the temperature to ones Amazon thinks are energy-saving — 68 degrees or below for heating and 75 degrees or above for cooling in my location. They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery; I have to wonder how Nest and its iconic green leaf feels about this. At least Amazon didn’t copy Nest and make you pay an extra $15 for a faceplate to cover up any wall warts left after installation; you get one included (and a screwdriver!). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="i3fzd1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The simple, clean design of the Amazon Smart Thermostat will fit in with most homes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i8FXYN"&gt;Despite the minimalist look, there are enough controls on the device for easy, everyday use — you can switch modes from heat, cool, fan, and auto, as well as adjust the temperature up and down and turn the system off. Only the bottom of the device is touch-capacitive, and there are three small markers to show where to touch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UZsYt"&gt;Most of the setup and programming of the thermostat requires the Alexa app. And, as you’d expect from an Amazon device, it’s designed to be controlled with your voice. This makes it surprising that the Alexa voice assistant isn’t built in as it is in some of Ecobee’s models. Instead, you need to have a compatible Alexa device for voice control. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_LtOPvE80jG3jALjBcjIwElY4QQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019735/jtuohy_211115_4885_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Physical installation of the Smart Thermostat is identical to that of Honeywell’s T9 or T5 and requires shutting off the power and wiring the base.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="a7ZgMx"&gt;Integration with Alexa is straightforward and doesn't require a skill or account linking. Setup and installation of the thermostat is similarly simple. You will want to check if your heating and / or cooling system is compatible first, however. And if you don’t have a C-wire, you will need to opt for the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09F5M7ZJT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$75 version&lt;/a&gt; that comes with a C-wire adapter and plan for a much more involved installation. (C-wire is short for common wire and supplies power to your thermostat. Most connected thermostats need a C-wire to connect to Wi-Fi, which is a big power drain.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O6RpV8lPgtXL48kpW7TuL71apy8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23027512/1C240497_D38F_4D22_8F07_0B21AC3D1CD5.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Alexa app offers a good interface for controlling the thermostat, it just takes a bit of digging to find it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1pE2PA"&gt;Everything you need to install the thermostat comes in the box, including a screwdriver and handy labels for identifying the thermostat wires. The Alexa app guided me through installation very well, making it clear which wires should go where, connecting the thermostat to my Wi-Fi, and testing that everything was working correctly. If you are uncomfortable with wiring or aren’t familiar with how your heating and cooling system works, you should get professional help. Messing up your HVAC system will be a costly mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2Dxb8"&gt;Using the Alexa Smart Thermostat was a smooth experience. The Hunches worked well (other than my 4:30AM blip), turning my heating down between 11PM and 11:30PM every night and back on at 6AM in the morning. Switching to away when the house was empty during the day was less reliable, and in my week of testing, I wasn’t able to get a firm read on how long it takes to adjust to an empty home — this is a key component of any energy savings this device will get you, so I’ll update this review once I’ve had more time to evaluate the feature. However, you do have the option of telling Alexa, by saying “Alexa, I’m leaving” as you walk out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYZXdZ"&gt;Controlling the thermostat with voice using an Echo speaker or display was smooth — and with the latter, an interactive screen pops up for further control if needed. You can control the mode with voice, too, switching to heating or cooling, and even ask Alexa to change the temperature when no one is home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="rvCPbP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10875137"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3BRL4z"&gt;But the app was a more frustrating experience. It takes four or five taps to get into the thermostat screen, although eventually I was able to add the thermostat to the new Favorites section in Alexa’s devices page, which speeds things up a tad. Once on the correct screen, the controls mimic those of the physical device, plus there’s a humidity reading (the thermostat has a humidity sensor in it, a temperature sensor, and an ambient light sensor for adjusting the brightness of the LEDs). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUMrsx"&gt;The one other area I ran into issues with was using the thermostat in a two-zoned home. As with all thermostats, you need one for each zone in a multi-zoned system&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and they control the climate independently.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;But&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the Alexa app wouldn’t let me set the home, away, and sleep temperatures separately; whatever I set for my upstairs zone also applied to my downstairs zone. That’s not ideal if you like to sleep at 66 degrees but want your living room and kitchen to drop to 62 at night to save energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="4crZWU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Multi-zone support needs some work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EzlNni"&gt;Switching the upstairs thermostat to a schedule and keeping the downstairs on Hunches did allow me to have different set points, but that’s not an ideal solution. This is a problem in the Alexa software, as with every other thermostat I have tested in this two-zone system, each thermostat controls each zone entirely independently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w93VPY"&gt;The other drawback is that there are no temperature sensors designed specifically for the Alexa Smart Thermostat. It’s possible to set Alexa Routines to use with the temperature sensors built into some Echo speakers or with compatible third-party motion or temperature sensors like those from Centralite and Aqara, plus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761003/amazon-smart-air-quality-monitor-price-release-date-features-routines"&gt;Amazon’s new Smart Air Quality Monitor will work with Routines&lt;/a&gt;. But that integration isn’t as seamless or as easy to use as thermostats with native temperature sensors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nfsg2D968iwUDAINfSfwodY0a-0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019737/jtuohy_211115_4885_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;While there are basic controls on the device, the Alexa app on a compatible smartphone is required to set up and control the thermostat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EpowwF"&gt;The Nest Learning Thermostat, the Ecobee thermostats, and the Honeywell T9 Thermostat all work very well with their own external sensors, but these thermostats cost $100 to $150 more than Amazon’s. You also don’t get useful extra features such as the time and weather displayed on this cheaper thermostat or integration with platforms or voice assistants other than Alexa. Still, if those features aren’t important to you, then you really can’t go wrong with this device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ohct2i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard to not be impressed with this thermostat&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aVJNM3"&gt;Based on my testing, it’s hard not to be impressed with the Amazon Smart Thermostat, and not just because it’s cheap. I have tested almost every smart thermostat released since the Nest Learning Thermostat launched a decade ago, and this is easily one of the best. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Lh8bxj"&gt;I would still choose a Nest Learning Thermostat for my home because I love the look and feel of it, and I have more control over how it manages my home’s climate (plus it works with both Google and Alexa). However, I thoroughly recommend the Amazon Smart Thermostat over the new Google Nest Thermostat, which is a dumbed-down version of the original (something of a theme with Nest devices these days). Honestly, the Amazon Smart Thermostat is the budget thermostat Google Nest should have made.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Stadia is celebrating its second birthday with hardware for free or cheap</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EK1McQBseM0To-it2YIAF1nXjTc=/0x0:1475x983/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70166213/stadia.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R6UhvW"&gt;On November 19th, 2019, Google launched its Stadia cloud gaming service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970297/google-stadia-review-gaming-streaming-cloud-price-specs-features-chrome-pixel"&gt;as a work in progress&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s arguably still one today. But one thing that’s consistently improved is the price of entry, and Google’s bringing it down even further to celebrate Stadia’s second birthday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRftKk"&gt;You should now be able to purchase &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/stadia_premiere_edition?hl=en-US"&gt;a Stadia Premiere Edition hardware kit&lt;/a&gt; with the Chromecast Ultra and Stadia Controller for just $22.22 or €22.22 in fourteen countries including the US and UK “while supplies last.” In the US, you’ll also be able to get one for free when you purchase any game in the Stadia store until November 29th. Google says it’s launching a wide variety of deals on games there today, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="mP1nd4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google has given away a lot of hardware already&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zpoenb"&gt;It’s not unusual for Google to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710308/google-free-stadia-hardware-game-purchase-details"&gt;practically give away Stadia hardware&lt;/a&gt;, mind you, and the Chromecast Ultra isn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/31/22603498/google-stadia-controller-chromecast-play-watch-bundle"&gt;the company’s latest and greatest Stadia kit&lt;/a&gt;, but these still feel like the best deals yet. Previous get-free-hardware-with-your-game bundles required you to pay for a full-price $59.99 game. Besides, you can do more with a Chromecast than play games, and even Google’s most basic Chromecast &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Google-GA00439-US-Chromecast-3rd-Generation/dp/B015UKRNGS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;still costs $20 on sale&lt;/a&gt;. For $22 or free with a moderately priced game, the Ultra is a pretty good deal, even if it doesn’t come with a TV remote like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control"&gt;the newest model&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also the only Chromecast with a built-in ethernet port (in its power adapter).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l7JOPj"&gt;Google says it now has more than 200 games in the Stadia store and has offered nearly half of them at one point or another in its paid Stadia Pro subscription over the past year. If you started subscribing to Pro in November 2020, and made sure to claim every game on offer, you’d likely have paid a little more than $100 for access to 91 different games. Google estimates it would have cost $2,000 to purchase that same game library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umetVG"&gt;It’s not clear how long or how well Google will continue to support Stadia, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260994/google-stadia-platform-white-label-option"&gt;now that its ambitions have lessened&lt;/a&gt;. Both Microsoft and Nvidia have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22714067/xbox-cloud-gaming-custom-xbox-series-x-hardware-upgrade"&gt;recently&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750246/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-3080-google-stadia-cloud-gaming"&gt;upgraded&lt;/a&gt; the hardware powering their cloud gaming services, but Google hasn’t issued any kind of signal that it might follow suit, and most game publishers don’t seem very committed to the platform. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303496/google-stadia-struggle-wired-bloomberg-reports-studios"&gt;Google reportedly paid tens of millions of dollars per port&lt;/a&gt; in the early days, not exactly a sustainable strategy.)  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xeIvmz"&gt;The company doesn’t have an updated roadmap for Stadia today, but it does say there’s more to come: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cB5lqt"&gt;What’s next for Stadia? Well, we’re eager to continue working on bringing the best games and new features to our community of players so that we can help build a bright future for cloud gaming. That means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tW4Ce6"&gt;Continuing feature experiments with the goal of making it easier for players to get into games and try Stadia for themselves. We’re still learning from input provided by our community and appreciate all the constructive feedback!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVgP8h"&gt;Expanding all categories of games content - not just more games overall, but new types of games that we’ve heard players ask for, including genres like online action games, open world titles, plus free games, trials and demos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPoils"&gt;Bringing Stadia to more devices and making it easier to access, purchase, and play games by yourself or with friends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Visualizations show the extensive cloud of debris Russia’s anti-satellite test created</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J8XYnUFt_Nf08kKDqgFtSaZHNuc=/364x0:3811x2298/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70166182/Screen_Shot_2021_11_19_at_10.35.00_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A screengrab of a visualization, created by Hugh Lewis&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n2Kwpv"&gt;Satellite trackers have been working overtime to figure out just how much dangerous debris Russia created when it destroyed one of its own satellites early Monday — and the picture they’ve painted looks bleak. Multiple visual simulations of Russia’s anti-satellite, or ASAT, test show a widespread cloud of debris that will likely menace other objects in orbit for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2rXzu"&gt;Early this week, Russia launched a missile that destroyed the country’s Kosmos 1408 satellite, a large spacecraft that orbited the Earth roughly 300 miles up. The breakup of the satellite created at least 1,500 pieces of trackable fragments, according to the US State Department, as well as thousands of smaller pieces that cannot be tracked. All of those pieces are still in low Earth orbit, moving at thousands of miles an hour and posing a threat to any objects that might cross their path. Initially, that even included the International Space Station, with crew members on board forced to take shelter in their spacecrafts as the debris cloud from the satellite passed by the ISS a couple of times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uQ7Ria"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The fragments appear like a dotted snake in orbit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OoM8tP"&gt;It’s going to take weeks or even months to fully understand just how bad the situation is, but early visualizations of the ASAT test created by satellite trackers show an extensive trail of space debris left in the wake of the breakup. The fragments appear like a dotted snake in orbit, stretching out and moving in roughly the same direction that Kosmos 1408 used to move around Earth. And there’s one thing the visualizers agree on: this snake of debris isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. “There will be some potential collision risk to most satellites in [low Earth orbit] from the fragmentation of Cosmos 1408 over the next few years to decades,” LeoLabs, a private space tracking company in the US, &lt;a href="https://leolabs-space.medium.com/analysis-of-the-cosmos-1408-breakup-71b32de5641f"&gt;wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8HjxxD"&gt;Two visualizations created by the &lt;a href="https://www.eusst.eu/newsroom/eu-sst-confirms-fragmentation-cosmos-1408/"&gt;European Union’s Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) network&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.agi.com/"&gt;space software company AGI&lt;/a&gt; reveal what likely happened in the first moment of impact when Russia’s missile intercepted Kosmos 1408. They both show how the debris cloud grew instantly and spread throughout space. AGI’s simulation also shows just how close the cloud comes to intersecting with the International Space Station, validating NASA’s concerns and the agency’s decision to have the astronauts shelter in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pZslax"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Update: this video represents a simulation of the initial dispersion of the fragments resulting from the reported &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ASAT?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ASAT&lt;/a&gt; test. The event has increased the collision risk of spacecraft in the LEO regime registered to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EUSST?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#EUSST&lt;/a&gt;, hence impacting the safety of EU &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/space?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#space&lt;/a&gt; infrastructure. &lt;a href="https://t.co/iA3zRKNqr1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iA3zRKNqr1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— EUSST (@EU_SST) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EU_SST/status/1461312176967368706?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="9kdaZZ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/646668430?h=29044d076e&amp;amp;app_id=122963&amp;amp;byline=0&amp;amp;badge=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;title=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LzsLre"&gt;Another visualization created by Hugh Lewis, a professor of engineering at the University of Southampton specializing in space debris, shows just how widely the debris from Kosmos 1408 has spread out in space. Lewis explains that when Russia’s missile hit the satellite, each of the fragments that were created got a little kick, sending them to higher and lower altitudes. Each piece is moving at a different speed depending on the height of its orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTwS9b"&gt;“Even though they start all together, what’s happening is that the ones in the bigger orbits take longer to go around the Earth, and the ones in the smaller orbits take less time to go around the Earth,” Lewis tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “So the ones that are lower seem to move ahead of the ones that are in the higher orbits. And that’s what stretches it out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wlKD6V"&gt;Lewis says that the cloud will continue to morph over time. The debris fragments in the lower orbits will fall to Earth and out of orbit more quickly, while the ones in higher orbits will stay in space much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dfnwQv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Final visualisation for the moment: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cosmos1408?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Cosmos1408&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SpaceDebris?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SpaceDebris&lt;/a&gt; cloud passing over the Atlantic. Quality is not great but should give you an impression of what it would be like to pass near the cloud (YouTube version: &lt;a href="https://t.co/0xoljxmiEU"&gt;https://t.co/0xoljxmiEU&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://t.co/9s0looT6IW"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9s0looT6IW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Hugh Lewis (@ProfHughLewis) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ProfHughLewis/status/1461269683034853379?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8PNEgI"&gt;For now, Lewis’ visualization relies on simulations based on where we think these pieces of debris might be, given the size of Kosmos 1408 and the physics of a missile striking a satellite. However, the visualization will become more realistic as real-world data from the test trickles in. US Space Command is responsible for tracking objects in space, but it has yet to make any of the tracks from the ASAT test available to the public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="caJYpw"&gt;Our best hope for tracking this material comes from a mixture of different sensors — from ground-based radar stations to optical telescopes. However, it’s probably going to be some time before even the most sophisticated trackers know where everything is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oiQ2Ug"&gt;Meanwhile, LeoLabs wrote in a blog post that it has already calculated the paths for close to 300 fragments from the test, likely the biggest pieces from the breakup. The company notes that the objects in lower orbits should re-enter the Earth’s atmosphere and burn up with the next five years. However, the higher orbiting fragments could stay in orbit for decades. And as all of these satellites pieces decay in orbit over time, they will continue to pose a risk for the space station and other satellites. All it takes is just one collision with a fast-moving piece of debris to potentially knock out a functioning satellite. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkFHsH"&gt;“This is not going to be a short-lived problem,” says Lewis. “It’s going to be affecting space operations for at least this decade and the next one.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best early Black Friday deals on Apple devices</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dvAANe"&gt;Ironically, if you’re looking for a great Apple deal this Black Friday season, you shouldn’t shop at Apple. That’s because Apple doesn’t typically offer discounts on its new products in-store or on its website, at least outside of the occasional educational discount. Don’t fear, however, as there are plenty of reliable third-party retailers like Amazon, B&amp;amp;H Photo, and Best Buy that do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwzsMr"&gt;Even better, these retailers have already started discounting some of the most popular Apple products ahead of Black Friday, dropping prices on everything from the latest MacBook Pro to the Apple Watch Series 7.  Below, we’ve rounded up the best deals we’ve found by category, and we’ll continue to update this piece as more deals are published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nunE44"&gt;Also, if you’re looking to save even more, make sure to check out our detailed guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;best early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt;, where we’re highlighting the best deals across all brands.&lt;/p&gt;

The stylus is compatible with the latest entry-level iPad and a range of earlier models, and it differs from the second-gen model in that you need to plug it into your iPad’s Lightning port in order to charge.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;p id="2g6QKI"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSqILT"&gt;We’ve got a well-rounded episode of &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast &lt;/em&gt;today with everything from policy to space to consumer tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b9RmQE"&gt;In the first segment, Nilay and Dieter bring in &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; policy reporter Makena Kelly to talk about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783684/biden-infrastructure-bill-bipartisan-broadband-ev-electrical-grid-climate"&gt;President Biden’s $1 trillion infrastructure package&lt;/a&gt; and what it can do to improve broadband access in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="huCavM"&gt;In segment two, &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; senior science reporter Loren Grush joins the show to explain why &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22782946/russia-asat-test-satellite-international-space-station-debris"&gt;Russia destroyed one of their own satellites with a ground-based missile&lt;/a&gt; and how it’s causing concern in the space community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avvsQr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;Managing editor Alex Cranz stops by in segment three to chat about Apple announcing that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787144/apple-home-repair-iphone-mac-parts-tools-instructions"&gt;will start selling manuals and tools&lt;/a&gt; for repairing certain iPhone and Mac products at home. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6UI9c9"&gt;What can $50 get you these days? Turns out, quite a lot; you just need to know where to look. We’ve already rounded up all the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22523255"&gt;best early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; for getting your shopping done early at retailers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22548186"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22547475"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22548167"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. But if you’re on a tight budget or looking for some gifts that won’t break the bank, you’ve come to the right place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xD2Wp"&gt;Amazon’s latest streaming stick is a solid alternative to both Roku and Chromecast devices. The Fire TV Stick 4K Max is currently enjoying a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/fire-tv-stick-4k-max-with-alexa-voice-remote/dp/B08MQZXN1X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$20 discount at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the final price down to just $35. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22715206/amazon-fire-tv-stick-4k-max-review"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;, Chris Welch stated that “the improvements are minor but worth the extra cash.” Armed with an extensive library of viewing apps, the Fire TV stick remains a great way to expand your viewing options, with a bare minimum of setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BPBTws"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10869342"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QJZjPC"&gt;The latest Roku Streaming Stick 4K, which just launched in September, is selling at Amazon at a record low. Normally $50, the retailer is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09BKCDXZC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering the streaming device for just $29&lt;/a&gt;. The 2021 model is faster than its predecessor, comes with improved Wi-Fi performance, and supports Dolby Vision and HDR10 Plus. Roku’s players also now support AirPlay 2, which means you can use your iPhone, iPad, or Mac to easily cast content to the device. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22727963/roku-streaming-stick-4k-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xLcpyI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10828277"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bgdY8y"&gt;Google’s accessible Roku alternative features support for Dolby Atmos and Dolby Vision and is currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoo%5B%E2%80%A6%5D12%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestBlackFridayTechDeals111921"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf1JKx5U7SD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $40, a savings of $10 off the regular list price. The Chromecast with Google TV provides access to all of your favorite streaming services and has a built-in voice assistant to help you find your favorite shows. You can even cast media from your phone through the Chromecast app.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21495609/google-chromecast-2020-review-streaming-remote-control" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dVDwIf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10872711"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wxld6d"&gt;Google’s lozenge-shaped Nest Mini is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfTkAfStZ60" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $25 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, half off the original price tag. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20921173/google-nest-mini-echo-dot-assistant-smart-speaker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;In his review&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;staffer Cameron Faulkner called the smart speaker a great sounding upgrade over the last-gen Home Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WzZPoM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10868995"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vmamb9"&gt;The Lenovo Smart Clock 2 incorporates a touchscreen display into a form factor that would be right at home on your bedside table. Normally $90, you can currently grab the Google Assistant-powered device, along with a free Lenovo SmartBlub, &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSmart-Clock-Gen-2-Grey-Color-Smart-Bulb%2F507060083&amp;amp;subid1=VergeWalmartBFDeals111721" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $40 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22714538/lenovo-smart-clock-2-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w909bt"&gt;If you’re looking for a solid gaming mouse, the latest iteration of the Razer Viper is &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Frazer-viper-8-khz-ambidextrous-wired-optical-gaming-mouse-8000-hz-polling-rate%2F-%2FA-82718043&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEarlyBlackFriday111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Target for $50&lt;/a&gt;, its lowest price to date. The latest model retains the same lightweight and ambidextrous chassis that made the original so good but ups the ante with a 20K DPI sensor and a polling rate of 8000Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rZIfOT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10859951"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WubLQA"&gt;If you’re in need of a few more buttons on your mouse, the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Frazer-basilisk-x-hyperspeed-gaming-mouse%2F-%2FA-79899587%3Fclkid%3D8f237b25N38d111eca5f31be93c0cebf1%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBlackFridayTargetDeals111621" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wireless Basilisk X Hyperspeed has also been discounted at Target&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to just $37. This is the lowest price we’ve seen for this high-performance gaming mouse and is an excellent value whether you’re a gamer or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b7XwsW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10869102"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9yP2xo"&gt;These mini speakers from Creative are an awesome solution for beefing up your desktop audio without sacrificing space. Each speaker on the Creative Pebble 2.0 measures just 4.4 inches in diameter and can be powered by a standard USB-A port. Creative also has newer versions of the Pebble that use a single USB-C cable and feature Bluetooth connectivity, as well as a larger version that comes packaged with a modestly sized subwoofer. Regardless of which model you choose, however, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0791H74NT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;they all fall below the $50 mark at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aSqoYm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10873852"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hes6jr"&gt;If you’re looking for something a little less professional, Walmart is still selling a &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FFUJIFILM-Instax-Mini-7-Purple-Bundle%2F570561725&amp;amp;subid1=VergeWalmartBFDeals111721" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fujifilm Instax Mini 7 Plus bundle&lt;/a&gt; for just $48, the first discount we’ve seen on the kit. In addition to the instant camera, the bundle includes a 10-pack of Instax film, an assortment of picture frames, and pins for hanging your prints.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="baaZ5a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10873747"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WcyT0e"&gt;Abode is currently selling the Abode Cam 2 &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoabode.com%2Fproduct%2Fabode-cam-2&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22789905%2Fblack-friday-2021-tech-deals-under-50-cyber-monday" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $25&lt;/a&gt;. An overall solid security camera, you’ll have a hard time finding a camera with the same features for less. The Abode Cam 2 can be mounted indoors or out, is motion-activated, and can record in low-light conditions. While the camera can operate independently, you’ll have to subscribe to Abode’s online service to unlock the more advanced features, such as a clip history, video timeline, and the ability to cache up to 10 days of footage.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alphabet is putting its prototype robots to work cleaning up around Google’s offices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/urPYEqRFboI7VO3PEfNhExHalqg=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70165715/google_everyday_robot.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nlNxPC"&gt;What does Google’s parent company Alphabet want with robots? Well, it would like them to clean up around the office, for a start. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHGyJX"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://x.company/blog/posts/everyday-robots"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that its Everyday Robots Project — a team within its experimental X labs dedicated to creating “a general-purpose learning robot” — has moved some of its prototype machines out of the lab and into Google’s Bay Area campuses to carry out some light custodial tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="864Ve0"&gt;“We are now operating a fleet of more than 100 robot prototypes that are autonomously performing a range of useful tasks around our offices,” said Everyday Robot’s chief robot officer Hans Peter Brøndmo in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20976710/alphabet-x-google-everyday-robot-project-robots-learn-sort-trash"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “The same robot that sorts trash can now be equipped with a squeegee to wipe tables and use the same gripper that grasps cups can learn to open doors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q7aqz6"&gt;These robots in question are essentially arms on wheels, with a multipurpose gripper on the end of a flexible arm attached to a central tower. There’s a “head” on top of the tower with cameras and sensors for machine vision and what looks like a spinning lidar unit on the side, presumably for navigation.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of Alphabet’s Everyday Robot machines cleans the crumbs off a cafe table. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B76S40"&gt;As Brøndmo indicates, these bots were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20976710/alphabet-x-google-everyday-robot-project-robots-learn-sort-trash"&gt;first seen sorting out recycling&lt;/a&gt; when Alphabet debuted the Everyday Robot team in 2019. The big promise that’s being made by the company (as well as by many other startups and rivals) is that machine learning will finally enable robots to operate in “unstructured” environments like homes and offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruVToD"&gt;Right now, we’re very good at building machines that can carry out repetitive jobs in a factory, but we’re stumped when trying to get them to replicate simple tasks like cleaning up a kitchen or folding laundry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MwaGWy"&gt;Think about it: you may have seen robots from Boston Dynamics &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628663/boston-dynamics-atlas-video-parkour-flips-falls-program"&gt;performing backflips&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22752389/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-dog-dancing-rolling-stones-start-me-up"&gt;dancing to The Rolling Stones&lt;/a&gt;, but have you ever seen one take out the trash? It’s because getting a machine to manipulate never-before-seen objects in a novel setting (something humans do every day) is extremely difficult. This is the problem Alphabet wants to solve. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unit 033 makes a bid for freedom. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tOSEj0"&gt;Is it going to? Well, maybe one day — if company execs feel it’s worth burning through millions of dollars in research to achieve this goal. Certainly, though, humans are going to be cheaper and more efficient than robots for these jobs in the foreseeable future. The update today from Everyday Robot is neat, but it’s far from a leap forward. You can see from the GIFs that Alphabet shared of its robots that they’re still slow and awkward, carrying out tasks inexpertly and at a glacial pace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c5CFZh"&gt;However, it’s still definitely &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; that the robots are being tested “in the wild” rather than in the lab. Compare Alphabet’s machines to Samsung’s Bot Handy, for example; a similar-looking tower-and-arm bot that the company showed off at CES last year, apparently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224649/samsung-bot-handy-care-robots-ces-2021"&gt;pouring wine and loading a dishwasher&lt;/a&gt;. At least, Bot Handy &lt;em&gt;looks&lt;/em&gt; like it’s performing these jobs, but really it was only carrying out a prearranged demo. Who knows how capable, if at all, this robot is in the real world? At least Alphabet is finding this out for itself. &lt;/p&gt;
