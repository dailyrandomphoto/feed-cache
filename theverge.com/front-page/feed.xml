    <title>Studios still need movie theaters, and they’re making the deals to prove it</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mzKKDA"&gt;During the course of the pandemic, the future of movie theaters looked grim. Cinema owners teetered on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248335/amc-bankruptcy-debt-movies-delay-streaming"&gt;edge of bankruptcy&lt;/a&gt; amid ongoing closures and lockdown orders, and streaming services introduced new release models that made clawing back theatrical exclusivity even harder for already struggling exhibitors. Theaters appeared to be facing an existential crisis, close to being snuffed out by a world that no longer needed them for distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7MEAeX"&gt;But as cinemas have begun to reopen their doors and feature films finally make their silver screen debuts following prolonged delays, the story has started to change. In recent months, a number of studio owners have struck deals with exhibitors — including Regal parent &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/cineworld-regal-warner-bros-deal-theatrical-windows-us-cinemas-reopening-1234719255/amp/?__twitter_impression=true"&gt;Cineworld&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/cinemark-theater-deals-vod-studios-1234968717/"&gt;Cinemark&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618697/amc-warner-brothers-theater-window-45-days-movies-streaming-battle-hbo-max"&gt;AMC&lt;/a&gt; — to lock in exclusive theatrical releases. It’s a sign that even studios attached to major streaming services believe they still need theaters to make a major release a success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uXQuLK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s no secret that AMC was not at all happy” about films going straight to HBO Max&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9xaOny"&gt;During an earnings call this week, AMC boss Adam Aron formally announced that the company had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618697/amc-warner-brothers-theater-window-45-days-movies-streaming-battle-hbo-max"&gt;reached an agreement&lt;/a&gt; with Warner Bros. to release films exclusively in cinemas for 45 days beginning in 2022 — a shift away from WarnerMedia’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;hybrid release model&lt;/a&gt; that saw all 2021 Warner Bros. films premiere in theaters and on HBO Max on the same day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sTTLuF"&gt;“It’s no secret that AMC was not at all happy when Warner decided in December to take movies to the home on HBO Max simultaneously with theatrical release,” Aron said. “Therefore, it’s especially gratifying that Warner is yet again embracing an exclusive theatrical window. And for us at AMC, it’s especially pleasing to be working so harmoniously with Warner Bros. once again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SeCbjj"&gt;The deal patches up a &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/amc-is-pissed-1845804062"&gt;very public falling out&lt;/a&gt; between theater chains and studios last year that followed contentious announcements about streaming-exclusive releases for films that were intended to debut in theaters alone. The issue became so heated that at one point last year AMC said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240637/amc-theaters-universal-trolls-world-tour-disney-warnermedia-digital-streaming"&gt;ban Universal films&lt;/a&gt; from its theaters. Months later, they struck a deal for much &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345713/amc-universal-movies-theaters-digital-rentals-pvod-streaming-agreement"&gt;narrower theatrical releases&lt;/a&gt;, and Aron this week said the two companies had the “best working relationship that we’ve had together in many years.” As for other moviemakers, Aron said that the theater chain was in discussion with every major studio about exclusive releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="B0b7xP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are hearing considerable support in Hollywood.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ja3jUo"&gt;“We are hearing considerable support in Hollywood that an exclusive theatrical window is an important way to build big and successful movie franchises,” Aron said. “Clearly, though, this whole subject is quite topical. It’s very much a work in progress.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94Lb7P"&gt;AMC has plenty of incentive to paint a copacetic picture of its post-pandemic future on a call with its shareholders, and theatrical exclusivity windows of 45, 31, or as little as 17 days — all of which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345713/amc-universal-movies-theaters-digital-rentals-pvod-streaming-agreement"&gt;theaters have agreed to&lt;/a&gt; in this new pandemic-era environment — are a far cry from the 90-day windows that cinemas typically enjoyed pre-COVID. But negotiations for exclusive exhibition rights certainly indicate studios need these windows to help their films succeed, at least where big-budget releases like &lt;em&gt;F9&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Place Part II&lt;/em&gt;, or the forthcoming James Bond film&lt;em&gt; No Time To Die&lt;/em&gt; are concerned, said Shawn Robbins, a chief analyst at Boxoffice Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tdb4M7"&gt;“These are the types of films that Hollywood has relied on for decades, and they are the money makers,” Robbins told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; by phone. “So from that perspective, having a film exclusively in theaters serves as a launching pad for that revenue stream for the studio while also serving, from the audience perspective, as a communal way to see these movies in a way that really isn’t duplicated in the home.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wv7JgU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Every business has to evolve and adapt to the times.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8t66kZ"&gt;Still, and perhaps most importantly, the pandemic has so transformed the traditional movie release structure that theaters will need to get creative with their long-term post-pandemic strategies for surviving a devastating blow to their business. AMC has indicated it is already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617594/amc-bitcoin-memestock-apple-google-pay"&gt;considering new avenues&lt;/a&gt; for revenue, perhaps by showing sporting events or tapping into the gaming community (though how that would even begin to look is anyone’s guess at this stage). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FM0Fpz"&gt;“Every business has to evolve and adapt to the times, and theaters have done it several times over the past century. This is just kind of the first big example of it happening in at least a generation or more,” Robbins said. “We’ve seen expansions and dine-in theaters, bars, premium screens like IMAX and several chains have their own proprietary formats — Regal has RPX and then there’s the Dolby Cinema. I think these types of enhanced viewing experiences are the way of the future for theaters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F43D4p"&gt;Moving forward, theaters may have to rely on these enhanced experiences and things like subscription and loyalty services to boost their business. Ticket bundling or dynamic ticket pricing based on the demand for a movie could also benefit both theaters and paying audiences who may not want to pay the same price to see smaller titles as they do for major releases, Robbins said. In the future, studios will also have to coalesce around a more standardized release model, though that could potentially take several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWXp9S"&gt;At the end of the day, though, studios have shown they need theaters just as much as cinemas need their films. “I think the fact that Warner Bros. has been very vocal,” Robbins said, “and now several times committed to going back to exclusive windows starting next year, really underlines where the future of this is going.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Craig Federighi says Apple’s child safety scanning will have ‘multiple levels of auditability’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Epic-Apple Trial Hangs Over Some 50,000 Games On App Store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MzJYUURQ9UFgjUd0TWsSS-N-4HU=/0x0:3999x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69721417/1232992663.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tPKT38"&gt;Apple executive Craig Federighi says iCloud Photos’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22613225/apple-csam-scanning-messages-child-safety-features-privacy-controversy-explained"&gt;plans to scan for child sexual abuse material&lt;/a&gt; (or CSAM) will include “multiple levels of auditability.” In &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/apple-executive-defends-tools-to-fight-child-porn-acknowledges-privacy-backlash-11628859600"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Federighi — Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering — offered new details about its controversial child safety measures. That includes a claim that the iPad and iPhone’s device-level scanning will help security experts verify that Apple is using the system responsibly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZeals"&gt;Like many companies with cloud storage services, Apple will check iCloud Photos images against a list from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), looking for exact matches with known CSAM pictures. But unlike many services, it will run searches on the device, not fully remotely. “Imagine someone was scanning images in the cloud. Well, who knows what’s being scanned for?” Federighi said, referring to remote scans. “In our case, the database is shipped on device. People can see, and it’s a single image across all countries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1DjUrf"&gt;Federighi elaborated slightly on how this might give people confidence Apple isn’t greatly expanding the database to include material besides illegal CSAM, particularly in countries with restrictive censorship policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vMPNRl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re making sure that you don’t have to trust any one entity, or even any one country”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B5anlI"&gt;“We ship the same software in China with the same database we ship in America, as we ship in Europe. If someone were to come to Apple [with a request to scan for data beyond CSAM], Apple would say no. But let’s say you aren’t confident. You don’t want to just rely on Apple saying no. You want to be sure that Apple couldn’t get away with it if we said yes,” he told the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;. “There are multiple levels of auditability, and so we’re making sure that you don’t have to trust any one entity, or even any one country, as far as what images are part of this process.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7s92c"&gt;Apple has previously said that it’s only rolling out the system in the United States and that it will &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/08/06/apple-says-any-expansion-of-csam-detection-outside-of-the-us-will-occur-on-a-per-country-basis/"&gt;consider launching in other countries&lt;/a&gt; on a case-by-case basis. The company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Apple will ship the hash database of known CSAM on the operating system in all countries, but it will only be used for scanning in the US. The &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; further clarifies that there will be an independent auditor who can verify the images involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7QNze"&gt;Federighi also offered more detail on when the scanning system will notify an Apple moderator of potential illegal content. Apple has said before that a single match won’t trigger a red flag — a measure intended to prevent false positives. Instead, the system generates “safety vouchers” for each match and alerts Apple if the number hits a certain threshold. Apple has declined to publicize the exact threshold, saying this could let abusers evade detection. But Federighi says it’s “on the order of 30 known child pornographic images.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFkTE8"&gt;Some security experts have offered cautious praise of Apple’s system and acknowledged the importance of finding CSAM online. But many have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617554/apple-csam-child-safety-features-jen-king-riana-pfefferkorn-interview-decoder"&gt;criticized Apple’s abrupt rollout&lt;/a&gt; and a lack of clarity on how the system worked. In his interview with the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;, Federighi acknowledged the confusion. “It’s really clear a lot of messages got jumbled pretty badly in terms of how things were understood,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook shut down German research on Instagram algorithm, researchers say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hTxCWUkkds8TsSvBS8NwCs9AYUE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69721373/wjoel_180319_2394_facebook_006.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2cIU7e"&gt;Researchers at AlgorithmWatch say they were forced to abandon their research project monitoring the Instagram algorithm after legal threats from Facebook. The Berlin-based project went public with the conflict in a post &lt;a href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/instagram-research-shut-down-by-facebook/"&gt;published Friday morning&lt;/a&gt;, citing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609020/facebook-bans-academic-researchers-ad-transparency-misinformation-nyu-ad-observatory-plug-in"&gt;the platform’s recent ban of the NYU Ad Observatory&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLeorF"&gt;“There are probably more cases of bullying that we do not know about,” the post reads. “We hope that by coming forward, more organizations will speak up about their experiences.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oCCI6t"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the company cannot be trusted”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d2ZbFa"&gt;Launched in March 2020, AlgorithmWatch provided a browser plug-in that would allow users to collect data from their Instagram feeds, providing insight into how the platform prioritizes pictures and videos. The project published findings regularly, showing that the algorithm &lt;a href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/instagram-algorithm-nudity/"&gt;encouraged photos that showed bare skin&lt;/a&gt; and that &lt;a href="https://algorithmwatch.org/en/instagram-algorithm-politicians/"&gt;photos showing faces are ranked higher than screenshots of text&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook disputed the methodology but did not otherwise take action against AlgorithmWatch for the first year of the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5j4R1"&gt;In May, researchers say Facebook asked to meet with the project leaders and accused them of violating the platform’s terms of service. Another objection was that the project &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17172548/gdpr-compliance-requirements-privacy-notice"&gt;violated the GDPR&lt;/a&gt;, since it collected data from users who had not consented to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZaZKp"&gt;“We only collected data related to content that Facebook displayed to the volunteers who installed the add-on,” the researchers say in their defense. “In other words, users of the plug-in where only accessing their own feed, and sharing it with us for research purposes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QAg0z4"&gt;Still, the researchers ultimately chose to shut down the project, believing they would face legal action from the company if it continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxPzfQ"&gt;Reached for comment, a Facebook representative confirmed the meeting, but denied threatening to sue the project, saying the company was open to find privacy-preserving ways to continue the research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBqzDs"&gt;“We had concerns with their practices, which is why we contacted them multiple times so they could come into compliance with our terms and continue their research, as we routinely do with other research groups when we identify similar concerns,” the representative said. “We intend to keep working with independent researchers, but in ways that don’t put people’s data or privacy at risk.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="St1H3e"&gt;The social nature of the Facebook platforms makes it difficult to isolate any single user: even when a user opts in, their feed is necessarily made out of other people’s content, who likely have not consented to participate in the research. Facebook has been particularly sensitive about research projects since the Cambridge Analytica scandal, which saw academic research data ultimately used for commercial and political manipulation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4tNli"&gt;Still, the broader pattern is a troubling one. The algorithms that manage news feeds on Facebook and Instagram are immensely powerful but poorly understood, and Facebook’s policies make it difficult to study them objectively. The NYU Ad Observatory, which tracked political advertising on the platform, saw its researchers banned earlier this month amid accusations of data scraping. In November, the company &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/11/once-again-facebook-using-privacy-sword-kill-independent-innovation"&gt;made similar legal threats&lt;/a&gt; against a browser called Friendly, which let users reorder their feeds chronologically. CrowdTangle, another popular tool for Facebook research, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/11/13594338/facebook-acquires-crowdtangle"&gt;acquired by the company in 2016&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpjNWE"&gt;Facebook has some mechanisms for researchers to collect data directly from the company, including the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;amp;ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;media_type=all"&gt;Ad Library&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/29/18522473/facebook-election-influence-meddling-research-data-democracy"&gt;its Social Science One partnerships&lt;/a&gt;. But AlgorithmWatch says the oppositional nature of their research makes the data inherently untrustworthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="evBrPu"&gt;“Researchers cannot rely on data provided by Facebook because the company cannot be trusted,” researchers say. “There is no reason to believe that Facebook would provide usable data, were researchers to replace their independently collected data with the company’s.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSSPEF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12:09PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;statement from Facebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: Samsung’s new foldables and Apple addresses iCloud scanning concerns</title>

    <title>Razer’s latest keyboard accessories offer an easy way to spruce up your mech  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UEbTk7VniqC_Don12B6I3gJHgCw=/0x0:5946x3964/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69721084/PBT_Keycap___Coiled_Cable_066___R1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s PBT keycaps can now be bought with a matching USB cable.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LVClQP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fshop%2Fkeyboards%2Fgaming-keyboards-accessories&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer&lt;/a&gt; is expanding its range of mechanical keyboard accessories with new keycaps, cables, and wrist rests which offer a convenient way to change the look and feel of your keyboard. The accessories start at $20 for the new wrist rests, ranging up to $50 for a customization kit that includes both colorful keycaps and a matching USB cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XzTSJB"&gt;If you’ve spent any time on forums like the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mechanicalKeyboards"&gt;Mechanical Keyboards subreddit&lt;/a&gt;, then you’ll be no stranger to the fantastically colorful keycaps people like to customize their keyboards with. But beyond fast-growing enthusiast stores like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrop.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22623320%2Frazer-pbt-keycaps-coiled-cable-wrist-rest-abs-caps-mechanical-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Drop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.pcgamingrace.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22623320%2Frazer-pbt-keycaps-coiled-cable-wrist-rest-abs-caps-mechanical-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Glorious PC Gaming Race&lt;/a&gt;, many of the best caps out there come from limited runs from smaller manufacturers, or with lengthy wait times. Razer’s designs might be more basic, but it’s a major manufacturer which sells through retailers around the world, which makes its products very easy to get hold of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vcvpw9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10699935"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TwdOO3"&gt;First up are new $50 customization sets. These include the same 120 keycaps made of durable PBT plastic that Razer has previously sold as a set for $30, with the addition of a new coiled USB-C to USB-A cable. They’re available in black, white, green, and pink, and feature durable double-shot legends that also let your keyboard’s backlighting shine through. They support both US and UK keyboard layouts, but &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/if-you-want-to-customize-your-mechanical-keyboard-raze-1847460283"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that they don’t support some less common layouts like the 65-percent Blackwidow V3 Mini.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmXiJm"&gt;Next up are the $35 Phantom Keycap sets, which are available in black and white. The unique thing here is that the bottom half of the keycap is translucent, which should pair well with backlit keyboards. They’re made of less premium ABS plastic (which tends to develop a shine over time), but come with 128 keycaps in the set, meaning better support for keyboards with less standard layouts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HgZYjv64Z9oJRIGpR9dIJb7j5Nk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22780546/Ergonomic_Wrist_Rests_TKL_and_Mini_063___R1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wrist rests for all the family. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fUICyM"&gt;Finally there are Razer’s new $20 wrist rests for compact tenkeyless and mini keyboards. They’re meant to offer more comfort compared to the rests that come with many of Razer’s keyboards, with a memory foam interior that should be a little easier on the wrists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G9Sbix"&gt;Razer’s new kits are available on Razer.com now, and the company says they’re coming to more retailers from September 11th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb updating policy to end forced arbitration for sexual harassment cases for guests, hosts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logo Illustrations In Athens" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WVtfSRRUfowcg7_qiNm9iF2sjq8=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69720911/1232713305.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Airbnb is updating its arbitration policy | Photo by Nikolas Kokovlis/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="avS6gU"&gt;Airbnb said Friday it will change its terms of service so that its arbitration provisions “will no longer apply to sexual assault or sexual harassment claims” by its hosts (the people who rent out their homes on the platform) and guests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1AeqO"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/supporting-and-empowering-survivors/"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that “incidents of sexual assault are extremely rare on Airbnb,” and that the upcoming changes would “codify a practice we have already had in place.” Airbnb has not “asked a court fo force any of the very few cases involving sexual assault or sexual harassment claims by hosts or guests into arbitration” since January of 2019, and will continue to not enforce arbitration in such cases until the TOS are updated sometime in the fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j1u0GK"&gt;“We believe that survivors should be able to bring claims in whatever forum is best for them,” the statement reads. “We encourage our industry peers within the travel and hospitality space to consider taking similar steps for their respective communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QeFV7G"&gt;The company said the policy is specific to sexual assault and sexual harassment; the statement does not mention other forms of harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q0BINs"&gt;Airbnb’s Trust and Safety team was highlighted in a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-06-15/airbnb-spends-millions-making-nightmares-at-live-anywhere-rentals-go-away?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;June report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg,&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; which described how the company handles incidents that involve law enforcement, noting that the company’s business model “rests on the idea that strangers can trust one another.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yjRoht"&gt;The arbitration policy, once official, will resemble Airbnb’s policy for employees; the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/12/18089398/ebay-airbnb-end-forced-arbitration-clauses-sexual-harassment-discrimination-google-protest-backlash"&gt;said in 2018 that it wouldn’t require arbitration&lt;/a&gt; for sexual harassment cases involving employees.  This came around the same time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/9/18079462/facebook-forced-arbitration-end-sexual-harassment-dating-policy-update"&gt;other tech platforms&lt;/a&gt; — including eBay, Facebook, Microsoft, and Uber— modified their policies to do away with forced arbitration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYK7ap"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix isn’t the savior Nollywood needs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B9YruALJ-BwDo4fYnjo18nZWN8M=/843x0:5319x2984/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69720874/Lionheart_Photo_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lionheart.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The streaming giant meets one of the world’s biggest film industries&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="6OMgUw"&gt;In 2016, a team of young, scrappy Nigerian filmmakers made &lt;em&gt;Ojukokoro&lt;/em&gt; (Yoruba for “greed”), a twisty crime thriller. They were convinced their little film was going to change Nollywood for the better. The chaotic Nigerian film industry, conveniently known as Nollywood — second only to India’s Bollywood in terms of volume of output — is famous for micro budget, melodramatic movies released direct to video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tswyzK"&gt;Adopting the dark humor, cinematic stylized violence, and multiple points of view associated with the work of elite directors like Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie, &lt;em&gt;Ojukokoro&lt;/em&gt; premiered to strong word of mouth buzz at Nigeria’s premier film festival but bombed at the box office the next year. It wasn’t till 2021 that the film would find its biggest and most appreciative audience: Netflix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATSbqc"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Ojukokoro&lt;/em&gt; went to cinemas in March 2017, then a couple of streaming platforms including Amazon Prime before arriving [on] Netflix in April 2021. What if I told you that the organic conversation generated this year alone has been more than all other platforms combined? And this is a film with a Yoruba title, so it is probably Nigerians that are watching,” producer Olufemi Ogunsanwo says of his film’s five-year journey to success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5gPs3a"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ojukokoro&lt;/em&gt; is emblematic of the impact that the world’s biggest streaming company has had on Nollywood. Netflix can assure a global audience for films that may have not stood a chance anywhere else. But as industry players have discovered, this visibility by itself is not nearly enough. Not when it comes with its own batch of problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="My1doc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nollywood films have routinely played well on the platform&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YQ0PAF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ojukokoro&lt;/em&gt; peaked at number two on the Netflix Nigeria top 10 chart, but because Netflix does not share viewing data, it’s hard to know just how popular it really was. Nollywood films have routinely played well on the platform, though, as Netflix has listed titles like &lt;em&gt;Òlòtūré&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Citation&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Delivery Boy&lt;/em&gt; as some of the most viewed Nollywood content of 2020, not just in Nigeria, but in overseas territories as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePu9bD"&gt;Netflix’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394425/netflix-subscriber-growth-stalls-2021"&gt;global active subscriber base of 208 million members&lt;/a&gt; is a dream for filmmakers in search of a ready-made audience. The streaming giant has been licensing Nollywood content since 2015, but this relationship deepened significantly with the service’s focus on expansion in global markets. The Netflix Nigeria launch was marked by a high-profile event in Lagos with chief content officer Ted Sarandos fêting&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;local talent just before COVID-19 hit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6GsMMq"&gt;A subsequent glossy campaign, titled “Made by Africans, Watched by the World” with Nigerian creatives prominently highlighted, made it clear that Netflix wants to stay in business by establishing relationships with some of the industry’s biggest names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="dY8j3L"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/anbu9Y_r7ro?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Mbj3f"&gt;Still, Netflix embarked on a content licensing spree spearheaded by Ben Amadasun, the Nigerian-born director of African originals and acquisitions. “We are grateful that our business model allows us to work differently with local creators and continue to invest in their work, so we’ve been able to deliver exciting Nigerian stories in spite of the many challenges faced in 2020,” Amadasun told me via email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ymDdw8"&gt;For independent Nollywood filmmakers, the Netflix relationship is a lifeline to an industry badly in need of structural uplift, having hit something of a plateau with both video and theatrical, its two primary distribution models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="IUhPZt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is, I think, the first time the industry is having true global distribution.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YXifOG"&gt;Led by Netflix, streaming has provided filmmakers with additional sources of income and wider profit margins than theaters were offering. For licensing content to Netflix, for example, independent producers and studios get about 80 percent of the fees with the rest going to the aggregators who serve as middleman brokers. For theatricals, exhibitors and distributors cut into profits significantly, leaving the producer with roughly 35 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xrJWsZ"&gt;“The benefits of having a player with the global reach of Netflix means your work can reach 200 countries and millions of viewers. This is, I think, the first time the industry is having true global distribution. Also, Netflix money is not bad money so this is added income,” Baba Agba, national secretary of the Association of Movie Producers, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lx1vZ3"&gt;Apart from Nigeria’s sizable population — both at home and in the diaspora — Netflix can tap into the cultural zeitgeist as Nollywood films continue to cross over into global territories via &lt;a href="https://www.popbuzz.com/internet/viral/osita-iheme-pawpaw-meme-nollywood/"&gt;memes&lt;/a&gt;, gifs, and viral videos on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RjGkmV"&gt;There are obvious benefits to the arrangement. But industry insiders have had cause to worry about a total Netflix domination. At the heart of Netflix’s operations, especially in the wake of COVID-19 theater shutdowns, is the financial muscle to snatch up the biggest and most prominent filmmakers — most of whom could usually be trusted to guarantee a big payday at the local box office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TEQPy"&gt;Nollywood’s biggest star, Genevieve Nnaji, went straight to Netflix with her directorial debut &lt;em&gt;Lionheart&lt;/em&gt; in 2018. EbonyLife Films, the studio behind some of Nollywood’s biggest box office hits, pivoted to Netflix when cinemas were locked down. Apart from the trafficking drama &lt;em&gt;Òlòtūré&lt;/em&gt; released as a Nigerian original last year, EbonyLife Films — led by the mogul Mo Abudu — has signed on to produce a slate of other content including an adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Death and the&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;King’s Horseman&lt;/em&gt;, the revered play by Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka. Ditto big-name directors like Kunle Afolayan (&lt;em&gt;Citation&lt;/em&gt;) and Kemi Adetiba (&lt;em&gt;King of Boys: The Return of the King&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="F6PYM6"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2UnCt9cKwS0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MFqtPi"&gt;While Agba certainly sees how a Netflix show of strength can affect theaters, he has little sympathy for the latter model. He believes that it’s one that became too powerful for its own good and missed several chances to build new audiences. In the scramble for profits, theater exhibitors and distributors began to gatekeep the kinds of films they gave priority showtimes. Certain filmmakers were given priority, certain kinds of projects — think lavish displays of the lives of the wealthy 1 percent — were easily greenlit and positioned as blockbuster hopefuls. This led to an environment that shut many filmmakers out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vghcrv"&gt;“What the theatrical operators get now is what they deserve, to be honest,” Agba says. “The business was not viable for most producers. Instead of helping, the theatrical guys focused efforts on certain films and productions and sabotaged others. If they were developing or encouraging a fresh pool of talent, then there would be bankable talent to replace the ones that are being courted by Netflix.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8bjbOe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The business was not viable for most producers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c0JzTL"&gt;Making this particularly worrisome is the fact that Nollywood has never really been a theatrical-based medium. The Nigerian film industry is essentially a product of the unwieldy melding of the video and television formats. The economic collapse of the ‘80s put a halt to the theatrical format that enjoyed its heyday in the ‘70s. Nollywood started as a locally resourced way of filling this gap for cinematic content. This movement was powered by video, the technology of the time. &lt;em&gt;Living in Bondage&lt;/em&gt;, the 1992 Igbo language film that pioneered this new wave, was a huge crossover hit and inspired a cascade of production activity across the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9bXa1"&gt;The return to democracy in 1999 ushered in an economic boom that encouraged the return of theaters. As a result, filmmakers began to upskill to produce content that could be serviced to the big screen. Melodrama and over-the-top stories gave way to more intentional filmmaking that came closer to the refinement of Hollywood movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E6qlHz"&gt;This development began to attract people who studied film in schools, home and abroad, and were influenced by European, Asian, and Hollywood-style filmmaking. The progress was gradual but tangible. Bankable stars were minted, box office records were created by films such as &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wedding Party&lt;/em&gt;, and Nigerian films were accepted in international film festivals from Berlin to Sundance and Toronto. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BmKIn2"&gt;Having a film on Netflix has become the new status symbol among filmmakers. Bragging rights are great, but there are also fears that succumbing to streaming’s smaller screen specifications could erase the small gains of the past decade in terms of building a budding cinema culture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vuYnvZ"&gt;Moses Babatope, managing director of FilmOne Entertainment, the country’s trendiest distribution operation — it also serves as the major bulk aggregator that licenses content to Netflix — does not see it as a zero-sum game. “There have been some worries about production quality of Nollywood films dropping, but rather than blame it on the ingress of streaming platforms, I will focus more on the level of investments made in production,” he says. “How much production budget are these filmmakers working with? I don’t believe any passionate filmmaker will willingly drop standards if there is finance to work with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMjq6Q"&gt;The sum of Netflix’s engagement in Nollywood — and elsewhere — can be broadly divided into licensing and originals. Licensing content is a tool for audience building and engagement, and this is reflected in Netflix’s strategy so far. Quantity trumps quality, and while the bulk of the films on the platform may well be described as mirroring the broad tastes of the Nigerian audience — the same theatrical distributors aggregate content for Netflix — they do not tell the complete story. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="vcHzQb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yy6zTDiHLhY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lz2Zcg"&gt;There are the comedies, the melodramas, and the feel-good fare that routinely score at the box office sure enough. But more striking is what is not represented on the platform. Some of the most critically lauded Nigerian films of recent years are conspicuously absent. Terrorist drama &lt;em&gt;The Milkmaid,&lt;/em&gt; which was the country’s first submission to the Oscars foreign language competition, has not been licensed; neither has the festival hit &lt;em&gt;Eyimofe&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(This is my Desire)&lt;/em&gt;, which was recently added to the Criterion Collection. Even the stylish genre thriller, &lt;em&gt;La&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Femme&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Anjola&lt;/em&gt; starring Rita Dominic, one of Nollywood’s most enduring stars, is absent. Films like these have production costs and efforts that are above the industry average and the filmmakers naturally expect to be valued appropriately.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01ITIi"&gt;For Hollywood and other territories, Netflix can simultaneously pursue commercial fare and prestige pictures for awards season. But for Nollywood, it all seems one dimensional, almost as if Nigerians are only interested in a certain kind of content. Babatope explains FilmOne’s role in this. “We don’t impose content on Netflix. They purchase based on an understanding of demand on their platform which to a good extent, could be informed by performance at the box office.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="28nhgO"&gt;Amadasun offers a clearer portrait. “We commission and acquire content based on human intuition and judgement. Like any studio or network, we have to evaluate the balance between how many people watch a show and how much it costs to acquire that show. Ultimately, there’s not any one particular factor.” With specialty options for distributing prestige content limited, filmmakers have little incentive to continue to make them, as neither theaters nor Netflix seem to want them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5xKVB2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you think the content is good enough to be shown in worldwide markets, maybe pay worldwide rates.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mUPYZE"&gt;Netflix offers compensation which it claims is reflective of market rates. This comes down to average licensing fees of between $10,000 to $90,000, with most deals landing near the middle range according to off-the-record conversations with producers. In comparison, Netflix plans to spend $500 million on films and series produced in South Korea this year alone, the same amount the company announced it would be spending making and licensing content in the United Kingdom in 2019. At the heart of this disparity lies a critical discussion about how Black art is valued in mainstream spaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yUmiwR"&gt;Producers are grateful for the funds but do not entirely agree with Netflix’s valuation. Walter Taylaur, who has had two of his films licensed on the platform, argues, “Their explanation would make better sense if the films were being shown in Nigeria alone. But if you think the content is good enough to be shown in worldwide markets, maybe pay worldwide rates.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSqY3c"&gt;Original film commissions could represent the most impactful avenue for development and industry engagement as the dividends trickle down to below the line players. Netflix-commissioned budgets tend to be a lot higher than standard industry rates and the stringent technical requirements enable quality assurance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knaEbn"&gt;But while South Africa has had success with multiple original series like the teen drama &lt;em&gt;Blood &amp;amp; Water &lt;/em&gt;and dance spectacle &lt;em&gt;Jiva!&lt;/em&gt;, Nollywood has yet to deliver a single commissioned original property despite several announcements. At least two previously commissioned series have stalled, prompting fears of a talent capacity challenge. The first Netflix-commissioned Nigerian original on the horizon is the hotly anticipated sequel to the 2018 gangster drama &lt;em&gt;King of Boys&lt;/em&gt; which arrives August 27th, but as a seven-part series instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ct9nF7"&gt;Without going into specifics of each situation, Amadasun offers the obvious answer. “The last year has been a difficult one for the industry to say the least. As you can imagine, COVID — which hit the world just on the back of our announcement about our intention to invest in Nigerian stories — has had a huge impact on the industry. Not just in Nigeria but around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ygKK8h"&gt;All four of the Netflix Nigerian original films so far, from &lt;em&gt;Lionheart&lt;/em&gt; to the Nollywood-Bollywood mashup &lt;em&gt;Namaste&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wahala&lt;/em&gt;, were licensed exclusively as such with zero or minimum Netflix involvement in production stages. All save for &lt;em&gt;Lionheart&lt;/em&gt; garnered tepid reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="WvXBJR"&gt;The excitement initially generated by Netflix’s entry into Nollywood has now been replaced by a cooler realization that Netflix isn’t some kind of savior, and the industry needs much more than money and eyeballs to thrive. For a long time, Nollywood — like Nigeria itself — has relied on dysfunction. And while this madcap energy has delivered some success, the streaming era has highlighted the large gaps in the available distribution models. Gumption and resourcefulness are no substitute for working, durable structures.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy A42 5G review: stuck in the middle</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A midrange phone with a big screen, huge battery, and all kinds of 5G connectivity&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Wk9ckH"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A42 5G is a thoroughly decent midrange phone that doesn’t really need to exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYZIbn"&gt;Taking it at face value, it’s fairly priced at $400 with a big 6.6-inch OLED screen, generous 5,000mAh battery, and a healthy support policy that will see it receiving security updates through the next few years. That’s a pretty good deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G08byP"&gt;In the context of Samsung’s Galaxy A lineup, it’s situated between the Galaxy A52 5G and the A32 5G, two very good options in their own price brackets. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;$499 A52 5G&lt;/a&gt; offers a few more high-end bells and whistles than the A42 5G, like a fast refresh screen and an IP67 waterproof rating. At $279, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/12/22529760/samsung-galaxy-a32-5g-review-price-screen-specs"&gt;the more basic A32 5G&lt;/a&gt; includes an LCD rather than OLED.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5ZGoAx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10695334"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x0BQxc"&gt;But if you’re shopping for a new device with Verizon, you won’t see either the A52 5G or the A32 5G on the retailer’s shelves (digital or otherwise). Instead, you’ll only find the A42 5G, thanks to one feature it has and the others don’t: mmWave 5G support. Until recently, this was a feature reserved for premium phones, and the A42 5G is one of the least expensive devices that can connect with the network. Verizon in particular has been pushing this super-fast flavor of 5G hard over the past couple of years. Despite its efforts, mmWave is still scarce and highly range-limited, but the carrier is still heavily biasing its stock toward devices that support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRDgF6"&gt;That’s why the A42 5G exists, at least in the US, but I’m not convinced that’s a good enough reason for anyone besides Verizon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L9JiJoZsAjtaPj1oGPEMZAPbtnE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766364/ajohnson_210804_4696_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy A42 5G’s glossy, plastic back features a gradient pattern.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uClYAU"&gt;Samsung A42 5G screen, battery, and performance&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="MvQd48"&gt;The Galaxy A42 5G offers a big 6.6-inch 720p OLED screen. That’s not a lot of resolution stretched across a fairly big panel, and it shows — if you look closely at images you’ll see some pixelation. The screen gets bright enough for indoor use, but I had a hard time seeing it outside even with brightness maxed out. The OLED panel shows nice contrast compared to an LCD (i.e., what you’ll get in a less expensive model like the A32 5G), but otherwise the display is a little underwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5h1TCr"&gt;The A42 5G offers an in-display fingerprint sensor for biometric unlocking and it’s one of the better ones I’ve come across in this budget-to-midrange class — it’s responsive and only occasionally fussy. Budget phones often have sensors that are less precise and require additional scans more frequently, and that is a real pain considering how many times we unlock our devices every day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z8BnPi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The screen gets bright enough for indoor use, but I had a hard time seeing it outside&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xacy1I"&gt;Battery life is excellent thanks to a large 5,000mAh cell — most days I only drained it to 70 percent by bedtime, but even a day with heavy use that included a Zoom call on cellular data only brought it down around 50 percent. A power user would definitely get a full day and a little extra from it, and with moderate use it can easily be stretched to two days on a charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcXOlT"&gt;Overall performance from the A42 5G’s Snapdragon 750 processor and 4GB of RAM (there’s a healthy 128GB of storage, too, and it’s expandable via MicroSD) is good for day-to-day tasks. The only slowness I noticed was a little bit of lag starting the camera app, and slight delays using more processing-intensive camera features like portrait mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="1VuWye"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Samsung has guaranteed two additional OS upgrades and four years of security support&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sfJI3i"&gt;The US version of the A42 5G ships with Android 11. Beyond that, Samsung has guaranteed two additional OS upgrades and four years of security support. In terms of device longevity, that puts it ahead of a lot of the midrange Android competition, which often only sees a couple of years of security support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCUOuO"&gt;Samsung’s current implementation of Android is a little more cluttered than we prefer, and activating it on Verizon’s network means you’ll end up with even more pre-downloaded apps on top of that. It’s a lot. There’s some sort of game featuring a cartoon bear on the phone I’ve been using for the past few weeks, and I do not care for it but I haven’t been able to summon the energy to uninstall it either. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d2zXRM1cK2ypkrBKxhXMfqgCU94=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766365/ajohnson_210804_4696_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A42 5G’s rear camera array is headlined by a 48-megapixel f/1.8 standard wide.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XiXEPl"&gt;Samsung A42 5G camera&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="t8CC3A"&gt;The A42 5G includes a 48-megapixel f/1.8 main rear camera, accompanied by an 8-megapixel f/2.2 ultrawide, and 2-megapixel depth sensor, which is all par for the midrange class. There’s also a 13-megapixel selfie camera around front. A version of the phone sold in the UK and Europe included a 5-megapixel macro and a slightly higher-res 5-megapixel depth sensor, but we’re not missing out on anything important by not having those cameras on the US version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZWgmyz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10696319"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0oTt15"&gt;In good light outdoors, the Galaxy A42 5G takes vibrant, detailed photos. Like other Samsung devices before it, the A42 produces colors that lean toward oversaturated, which can be distracting if a more natural look is your thing. Portrait mode photos are convincing enough, and the camera can sometimes struggle deciding on white balance and exposure in mixed lighting situations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dft8Ej"&gt;Photos in very low light show a lot of smeared detail thanks to noise reduction, but outside of the Pixel phones in this price bracket, that’s not something we’d expect a midrange device to excel at. All told, the A42 5G’s photo capabilities are on par with its class. Spending a bit more on the A52 5G will get you a stabilized main camera that will get more sharp shots in dim lighting and slightly better low-light performance in general, but in the $400 range the A42 measures up well against most of its peers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dy92tpG9UhCaE0Hl3mo_tRvIlgM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766363/ajohnson_210804_4696_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A42 5G’s unique selling point — mmWave 5G support — is of limited value for most people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yE4FDO"&gt;The Galaxy A42 5G is a fine phone for $400, and if you’re committed to buying from Verizon, it’s one of the better options at that price. But if you’re able to buy an unlocked phone or you aren’t on Verizon, then there are other options, including in Samsung’s own midrange lineup, that are well worth your consideration. Unless you live in an area with good mmWave coverage and spend a lot of your time outside where the signal can actually be reached, the A42 5G’s unique feature is of limited value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xjDO3T"&gt;If you’d like to save a little money, the A32 5G is a viable alternative for $280. You’ll get the same security support longevity as the A42 5G along with similar photo capabilities, a huge battery, and 5G support that’s ready for upcoming improvements to Verizon’s and AT&amp;amp;T’s networks. Its processor is a little less robust and the LCD isn’t as nice to look at as the A42 5G’s OLED, but if these things aren’t priorities then you might as well save a little and go for the less expensive device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="cgUeJD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;don’t get too excited about mmWave&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yezL84"&gt;If you think you’ll want a little more than the A42 5G has to offer, then the $500 A52 5G is a good step-up option with a bit of a better camera, a great high refresh rate screen, and the added peace of mind of IP-rated waterproofing. If you can find a Pixel 4A 5G in stock anywhere, that would be another good alternative at $500 with a better camera, faster processor, and cleaner software. It offers a smaller 6.2-inch screen, though, and again, you’ll have a hard time finding one new at this point since its successor, the Pixel 5A, will likely be arriving &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569798/google-pixel-5a-fcc-listing-leak-features-specs"&gt;in the near future&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="P6mHSC"&gt;If none of the above suits you, then the A42 5G really isn’t a bad choice. Its healthy support policy, decent overall performance, and robust battery life make it one of the best options from Verizon for around $400. Just don’t get too excited about mmWave.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xJPIOV"&gt;If you’re a gamer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22530941/xbox-game-pass-e3-2021-bethesda-yakuza"&gt;Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best deals in town. Microsoft’s popular subscription service — which touted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250795/xbox-game-pass-subscribers-growth-microsoft"&gt;more than 18 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year — has been dubbed the “Netflix of video games,” namely because it provides access to more than a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fxbox-game-pass%2Fgames%3FranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3DTnL5HPStwNw%26ranSiteID%3DTnL5HPStwNw-NG1EGejqTZh7KDYouebdEQ%26epi%3DTnL5HPStwNw-NG1EGejqTZh7KDYouebdEQ%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAID2200057_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__0thgbaanw9kfqhhygvquhus6yn2xr3dfzggxj29e00%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%2528TnL5HPStwNw-NG1EGejqTZh7KDYouebdEQ%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_0thgbaanw9kfqhhygvquhus6yn2xr3dfzggxj29e00&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F8%2F13%2F22622197%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscription-samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-apple-watch-series-6-deal" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hundred Xbox titles&lt;/a&gt; for a flat, monthly fee. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate takes things a step further, combining Xbox Game Pass with Xbox Live Gold, giving subscribers access to exclusive deals, online multiplayer, EA Play titles, and Microsoft’s cloud gaming service, xCloud, which is now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554267/microsoft-xcloud-game-streaming-xbox-pass-ios-iphone-ipad-pc"&gt;widely available on iOS and PC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQE5WR"&gt;Typically, a three-month subscription to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate runs $45. And while &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate%2Fcfq7ttc0khs0%3Factivetab%3Dpivot%253aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft’s ongoing promotion&lt;/a&gt; will knock the price down to $1 for new subscribers, it’s not available for returning players.

&lt;p id="MdR7AP"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 isn’t a direct sequel to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; — and it’s better off for it. The midrange Chromebook hits all the right marks, while retaining an affordable price tag that becomes even more appealing when you factor in its &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-13-3-qled-touch-screen-intel-core-i3-8gb-memory-128gb-emmc-fiesta-red%2F6448525.p%3FskuId%3D6448525&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;current sale price at Best Buy: $600&lt;/a&gt;. For the money, you get a functional laptop with a gorgeous QLED display, all-day battery life, and a bright, eye-catching finish that’s sure to turn heads no matter where you go (it’s also available in a “mercury gray”). It’s one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; you can buy, and it comes with 8GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a Core i3 processor, which should be enough for everyday use. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Not only does the Series 6 boast a wealth of health features and an always-on display, but it comes with built-in sleep tracking and a strong ecosystem of third-party complications, a hallmark no other smartwatch manufacturer has yet to replicate. The watch’s deep integration with the iPhone only bolsters the wearable’s appeal alongside watchOS 7, a mobile operating system built to handle all the basic features we’ve come to expect in a smartwatch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The unsettling uncertainty of a breakthrough case  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="AUSTRALIA-HEALTH-VIRUS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kIdxAZ9OIFjTaYCLq1yHwWiX9ZE=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69720253/1234629004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by SAEED KHAN/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fve79z"&gt;Last weekend, a close friend texted me with the jarring news that her COVID-19 test had come back positive. She was vaccinated and had been since April. She got her first shot just a few days before I got mine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0IVhnl"&gt;Before I got that text, I’d been reminding my friends and family that some people who get vaccinated are going to get COVID-19 anyway. Vaccines aren’t perfect. I cautioned that when cases are surging, like they are right now in New York City, the raw number of vaccinated people who get sick is going to go up. Unvaccinated people still face even higher risks of catching the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4G9J2"&gt;I know all of that. I think about those facts and statistics every day when I’m reading studies and checking transmission levels around the country. But even armed with that knowledge, I still spent a solid day and a half suddenly convinced that I was no better off than I was before getting vaccinated. I’m still struggling to work my way out of that spiral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KjVS50"&gt;It’s unsettling to be mired in uncertainty again after over a year adjusting to a relationship with the coronavirus. After spending the month of June reveling in vaccinated freedom, the whiplash back to fear is jarring. Eve Sneider &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-delta-variant-has-warped-our-risk-perception/"&gt;wrote in &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;this week that the delta variant, which is driving the United State’s fourth wave, has upended our risk perception. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xVlpH5"&gt;“Choices that had become refreshingly simple and thoughtless early this summer, like entering a grocery store or a bar without a mask, are again more like skydives—relacquered with a layer of viral risk,” she wrote. “Once again I was asking: How much freedom is too much?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Zwc4Zr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;My friend’s COVID-19 case was a sudden reminder of how much delta changed the game&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fTsaFa"&gt;My friend’s COVID-19 case was a sudden reminder of how much delta changed the game. The fast-spreading variant is driving surges around the US, turning back the clock to mirror the worst outbreaks in the early days of the pandemic in Louisiana and Florida. Places with high vaccination rates are struggling, too, as the virus finds the remaining pockets of the unimmunized in those areas. Everywhere, uncertainty about the safety of daily activities is piling back up. The vaccines are holding fast against hospitalizations and deaths from COVID-19, but they may not be quite as good at staving off symptomatic disease or infection with the virus. Breakthrough infections are still probably uncommon, but they may be less rare than they would have been under previous variants — there isn’t good data yet to say for sure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h96p1Q"&gt;When vaccine development started in spring of 2020, experts aimed their expectations low. Something that was 50 percent effective would have been good enough for the Food and Drug Administration. Instead, we ended up with vaccines that clinical trials said were 95 percent effective against symptomatic COVID-19 — a dream outcome people hardly even knew to hope for. The giddy promise of that high, high number buoyed my hopes through June. Delta knocked them back to Earth. Now, I’m confronted with that yawning gap between 95 and 100, which delta stretched even wider. Emotionally, even if not statistically, it feels big enough to steer a cruise ship through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VEUVD5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;my fall plans                  the delta variant &lt;a href="https://t.co/gEB8z892gq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gEB8z892gq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— kari   (@kvrivnne) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kvrivnne/status/1425877238315163651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iRJQUH"&gt;After a few days of what felt like a bad cold, my friend was physically fine. Mentally, she had a harder time, and so did I. It’s hard to reconcile the discord between public health trends and individual health. Despite the breakthroughs, despite delta, the vaccines are working, even if they’re not a solution &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/08/delta-has-changed-pandemic-endgame/619726/"&gt;on their own&lt;/a&gt;. Rates of COVID-19 are &lt;a href="https://www.sandiegocounty.gov/content/dam/sdc/hhsa/programs/phs/Epidemiology/COVID-19%20Watch.pdf"&gt;far lower&lt;/a&gt; among vaccinated people than they are for unvaccinated people in cities reporting that data. States with higher vaccination rates &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/highly-vaccinated-states-keep-worst-covid-19-outcomes-in-check-as-delta-spreads-wsj-analysis-shows-11628328602"&gt;aren’t seeing&lt;/a&gt; as much of a surge in hospitalization. They’re working for most of the vaccinated people who get COVID-19, too — it just doesn’t always feel that way. It’s hard to process the big-picture safety when you or someone you know is curled up in bed, sick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VuM9SL"&gt;Slipping back into caution after a brief spell of optimism and hope is hard. I’ve spent the week dragging myself back from the edge, again and again, reminding myself that the shots are still working. Public Health England &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sajidjavid/status/1425826341056925696"&gt;said this week&lt;/a&gt; that, so far, vaccines prevented 23 million COVID-19 infections and 84,600 deaths in England. I’m holding fast to the reminders like that one: even though delta makes the virus more frightening, the vaccines are still here, and they’re still keeping people alive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGjF2X"&gt;Here’s what else happened this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="u3vy4u"&gt;Research&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eGaynO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/11/health/vaccine-pregnant-cdc.html"&gt;The C.D.C. endorses Covid vaccinations during pregnancy.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Safety data shows there is no increased risk of miscarriage for pregnant people who receive a COVID-19 vaccine. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says they should get the vaccine. (Roni Caryn Rabin / &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

Kids are at a lower risk for severe outcomes, but when more kids get sick, more get seriously ill. (Katherine Wu / &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8vLD2N"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/dissecting-the-unusual-biology-of-the-sars-cov-2-delta-variant-69068"&gt;Dissecting the Unusual Biology of the SARS-CoV-2 Delta Variant&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Delta is the fastest-spreading version of the coronavirus. Scientists are trying to understand why. It might be able to replicate more quickly, or fuse more easily with cells, but there aren’t conclusive answers yet. (Katarina Zimmer / &lt;em&gt;The Scientist&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cTTWAK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619963/third-dose-covid-vaccine-transplant-nih-study"&gt;Kidney transplant patients will test a COVID-19 booster shot in new trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;The National Institutes of Health is checking to see if a third dose of a COVID-19 vaccine helps kidney transplant patients mount a more effective immune response. (Nicole Wetsman / &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="odMcn4"&gt;Development &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="buNfY8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-vaccine-us-military-requirement-pentagon-3975940c732352f72e41f6e34a3a2669?utm_medium=AP&amp;amp;utm_source=Twitter&amp;amp;utm_campaign=SocialFlow"&gt;Pentagon to require COVID vaccine for all troops by Sept. 15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Members of the military will have to get a COVID-19 vaccine. The deadline could come sooner if the Food and Drug Administration fully approves the shot. (Lolita Baldor / &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCIBRb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/08/10/covid-intranasal-vaccines/"&gt;A snort or a jab? Scientists debate potential benefits of intranasal Covid-19 vaccines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Vaccines sprayed into the nose might be able to protect the nasal passages more effectively than shots in arms. But it’s unclear if gene-based vaccines could be reformulated to be administered through that route. (Helen Branswell / &lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQAK6q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationalgeographic.com%2Fscience%2Farticle%2Fthe-world-needs-more-vaccines-faster-a-tiny-tube-could-make-all-the-difference&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22622344%2Fbreakthrough-covid-delta-uncertainty-vaccines" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The world needs more vaccines, faster. A tiny tube could make all the difference.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Right now, vaccines are made in large vats, which can be inefficient. A team of scientists thinks making them in a continuously running tube might be a better solution. (Roxanne Khamsi / &lt;em&gt;National Geographic&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="grbPRu"&gt;Perspectives &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="zfi8dV"&gt;My deescalation research was all for naught. Nineteen of the 20 people who shuffled up the stairs at the dive bar had their vaccine proof ready for inspection during the first hour I observed Adams and Powers. No one made a fuss, not even the one patron who fumbled for documentation for 10 minutes before giving up and leaving. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JnA8gE"&gt;— &lt;em&gt;Washington City Paper&lt;/em&gt;’s Laura Hayes was expecting the worst on the first night a bar was requiring &lt;a href="https://washingtoncitypaper.com/article/527554/i-watched-the-door-at-a-d-c-bar-the-first-night-it-required-proof-of-vaccination/"&gt;proof of COVID-19 vaccination&lt;/a&gt;. But it went off without a hitch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IOqaIp"&gt;More than numbers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4tzoD2"&gt;To the people who have received the 4.5 billion vaccine doses distributed so far — thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdsoGE"&gt;To the more than 205,202,233 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbHqHe"&gt;To the families and friends of the more than 4,330,899 people who have died worldwide — 618,840 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYEI4E"&gt;Stay safe, everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZuaey"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
