    <title>Netflix is making a 3D animated Sonic the Hedgehog TV show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GWs6cWZN1wMUs5NEzTbuhaKneWg=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68492540/netflix_sonic.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: NX on Netflix (&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1337079639508967425" target="_blank"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XycOQf"&gt;Netflix is making a 3D animated &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; TV show, the company announced in a (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1337079639508967425"&gt;since-deleted&lt;/a&gt;) tweet from its NX Twitter account. The series, set to debut in 2022, will be based on the character from the long-running Sega games, although there are no specific details yet as to what the show will entail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3y3VF2"&gt;The series is being produced in partnership with Sega, along with &lt;a href="https://www.wildbrain.com/"&gt;WildBrain&lt;/a&gt; (a production company behind numerous popular children’s TV shows) and Man of Action Entertainment (best known for &lt;em&gt;Ben 10 &lt;/em&gt;and Disney’s&lt;em&gt; Big Hero 6 &lt;/em&gt;TV series&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pR8vkw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Gotta go fast&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gRBpl4"&gt;While there’s not much information about the series itself, Netflix’s teaser image shows a silhouette of the modern 3D Sonic design (as opposed to the chubbier and stubbier “classic Sonic” that’s featured in games like &lt;em&gt;Sonic Mania&lt;/em&gt;.) Assuming that teaser image is representative of the show, it also appears to be ditching the more recent character designs from the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Boom_(TV_series)"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sonic Boom&lt;/em&gt; spin-off games and TV show&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5L0guz"&gt;The new Sonic series would mark the latest video game-based TV show for Netflix, which also has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536079/netflix-assassins-creed-live-action-series"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348468/netflix-splinter-cell-animated-series-adaptation-witcher-castlevania-john-wick"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Splinter Cell&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403849/netflix-resident-evil-tv-series-original-live-action-announcement"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;series in the works. The streamer also already offers several seasons of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/7/15938192/netflix-castlevania-review-animated-video-game-adaptation"&gt;animated &lt;em&gt;Castlevania&lt;/em&gt; show&lt;/a&gt; (albeit one that targets a more mature audience than the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; show.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile introduces its first 5G hotspot and a 100GB standalone plan for $50 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Inseego 5G MiFi M2000" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eii8RH05Dwh2GCU0S5eWBi21LWY=/0x1:1832x1222/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68492516/Moretti_generic_top_006.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;T-Mobile will start selling the Inseego 5G MiFi M2000 today. | Image: Inseego&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i3nfzJ"&gt;T-Mobile might look as thought it’s late to the game by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2F5g-just-got-better&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22167745%2Ftmobile-5g-hotspot-100gb-standalone-plan#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;unveiling its first 5G hotspot today&lt;/a&gt;, along with a variety of 5G standalone hotspot plans. After all, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/18/20699111/verizon-5g-mifi-m1000-hotspot-650-expensive-data"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/9/18303494/att-5g-service-19-cities-verizon-samsung-s10-exclusivity-tmobile-hot-spot"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; have offered 5G hotspots for a while now (although they began with significantly limited coverage). But T-Mobile’s particular blend of wide 5G coverage and better-than-LTE speeds means the device should be more accessible to more people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JaXk2X"&gt;Plus, the carrier’s standalone 5G hotspot plan is priced to compete, starting at $30 for 10GB and $40 for 30GB, and topping out at 100GB for $50. In comparison, AT&amp;amp;T’s standalone hotspot plans start at $60 per month for 15GB; Verizon’s offerings start at $80 for 15GB of 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rgcgrj"&gt;T-Mobile’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Ftablet%2Finseego-5g-mifi-m2000&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22167745%2Ftmobile-5g-hotspot-100gb-standalone-plan#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Inseego 5G MiFi M2000&lt;/a&gt; hotspot is available now through T-Mobile and costs $336 to purchase outright. For now, the carrier is offering to knock that down to $168 if you add a new line and spread the payment across 24 months. The M2000 has more than 24 hours of battery life and is capable of connecting up to 30 devices at once, according to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1UE9h"&gt;A reminder: 5G comes in several flavors, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21284203/5g-need-to-know-health-safety-radiowave-spectrum-verizon-att-tmobile-cellular-data"&gt;not all are created equal&lt;/a&gt;. T-Mobile has taken a multi-layered approach with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538604/t-mobile-5g-network-midband-coverage-expanded-cities"&gt;aggressive expansion schedule&lt;/a&gt;, working to grow overall coverage quickly as well as bolstering its midband offerings, thanks to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202726/tmobile-sprint-acquisition-ceo-finished-john-legere-steps-down"&gt;acquisition of Sprint’s network&lt;/a&gt; last spring. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple discontinues Music Memos app with one final update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PNYN4m9slp1e2j8Zj49JFyKaW8U=/222x0:2418x1464/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68492493/Screen_Shot_2020_12_10_at_2.26.53_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h5INn4"&gt;In 2016, Apple launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/20/10797250/apple-music-memo-app-announced-iphone-ipad-free"&gt;a new iPhone app called Music Memos&lt;/a&gt;. It was meant to expand on the built-in Voice Memos app’s ease of use while adding some features for musicians. You could record something with an acoustic guitar or piano in uncompressed audio, and Music Memos would detect the chords you played and could also add in drum and bass backing tracks that kept with your tempo. You could name those tracks and give them star ratings, or tag certain parts of a recording like the bridge or chorus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0LQUK"&gt;But considering how infrequently Apple updated Music Memos after its release, it’s fair to assume that the app never took off like the company might’ve hoped. It was an awkward middle child between the wonderfully simple Voice Memos and more capable GarageBand. And today, as noted by &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/10/apple-music-memos-voice-memos-integration/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Apple has confirmed that Music Memos won’t be getting any further updates. The one released today, version 1.0.7 — we never even made it to 1.1, folks — allows users to export their Music Memos recordings to Voice Memos. You can still export tracks to GarageBand just like before, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gvmWZx"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple Music Memos makes mobile recording easy|6279" data-volume-uuid="774e98a08" data-volume-id="6279" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-681" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Let’s all take a trip back in time and rewatch our 2016 video about Music Memos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dyiE5Y"&gt;You’ll now see a “Recording is moving to Voice Memos” prompt when you open Music Memos. Tapping “export” will send all of your stuff over to Voice Memos in a folder labeled Music Memos. You can also just tap “OK” to dismiss the export reminder for another week. If you create new recordings with Music Memos after exporting, just remember to copy those over as well. &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211824"&gt;Here’s an FAQ&lt;/a&gt; on the transition process. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0lq9KL"&gt;Apple says that Music Memos will be unavailable to download after March 1st, 2021 for new users; if you’ve already installed it previously, it’ll remain available in your App Store library. But it won’t be getting any further development — not that it had received much attention in years anyway. Apple made a few bare minimum updates to the app in the past, adding support for new iPhone display resolutions and so on, but that’s pretty much it. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fmusic-memos%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F10%2F22168102%2Fapple-music-memos-app-discontinued-export#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Here’s the website for the app&lt;/a&gt;, but it might not be around for much longer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ubisoft will give you $10 to play its free battle royale</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XAdXNuH6E_-R_hYyB_Kg75_FErE=/875x0:5951x3384/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68492381/hyper_scape_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ubisoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FauyR9"&gt;Ubisoft is &lt;a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4XXLnxKNoAiRLMwbsa7TA5/play-hyper-scape-now-and-get-a-coupon-for-the-ubisoft-store?isSso=true&amp;amp;refreshStatus=noLoginData"&gt;willing to give you a $10 coupon&lt;/a&gt; if you play &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21309355/ubisoft-hyper-scape-battle-royale-launch-announced-pc"&gt;its battle royale game&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hyper Scape &lt;/em&gt;on PC anytime between now and December 17th at 11AM ET. It’s a great deal if you’ve been eyeing some of Ubisoft’s new games like &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Immortals Fenyx Rising&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pl2COR"&gt;The real kicker is that because &lt;em&gt;Hyper Scape&lt;/em&gt; is free to play, Ubisoft is basically giving players free money (albeit, money you can only spend on Ubisoft games).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the offer page in Ubisoft’s Connect program" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/30a2u0fpyIJdZJmGvb4lnHe_KZ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22160501/Screen_Shot_2020_12_10_at_10.42.42.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ubisoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ubisoft’s Connect has more information in the store page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M0idB3"&gt;There are just a few catches: you have to use the coupon by January 31st 2021, the game you buy has to cost at least $14.99, and the code can’t be applied to future preorders. Apart from that, there’s not a whole lot else to it. You play &lt;em&gt;Hyper Scape&lt;/em&gt; (it doesn’t matter if you’ve played it before), click a button saying that you’ve played it, and get a coupon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NWC9R"&gt;The offer is open to customers in the US and Canada (Canadians get a $14 CAD coupon to go toward a game that’s at least $20.99 CAD). If you live in either of those countries and are looking to buy a Ubisoft game soon, you might as well give it a shot!&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How governors are fighting for clean energy jobs </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3utOM5AfaIxsdQszzunB4InxZdI=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68492330/1152711973.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Colorado Gov. Jared Polis speaking about his renewable energy roadmap at a community solar garden in Arvada, Colorado, in 2019.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Joe Amon / MediaNews Group / The Denver Post / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0pufJF"&gt;A coalition of 25 governors today renewed calls for a green recovery to the economic downturn caused by COVID-19. They also called on Congress to pass a stimulus package that bolsters clean energy job growth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Uu15Rk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is a crisis”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MTdaiz"&gt;It’s an investment that’s also needed to tackle the severe effects climate change is already having on states. “This is a crisis, and that’s why we really made it a goal from the very start to lead the way in renewable energy,” Colorado Gov. Jared Polis tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cE8Pl3"&gt;The governors, including Polis, are part of the US Climate Alliance, formed in 2017 as a response to President Donald Trump’s decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement. They pledged to keep states on track to meet the goals of the agreement, even as federal efforts dissipated. Those climate ambitions led to the creation of 133,100 jobs in clean energy in their states between 2016 and 2019, a &lt;a href="https://www.usclimatealliance.org/jobsreport"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; released by the alliance today shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXIcgf"&gt;But the pandemic wiped out those job gains. Renewable energy and energy efficiency projects languished amid stay-at-home orders throughout the year. More than 301,000 people working in clean energy lost their jobs in the first half of 2020, according to the Climate Alliance report. The pain wasn’t limited to states that joined the alliance. Across the US, the solar workforce dropped to its lowest numbers since 2014, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AEnwLJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The need for swift, bipartisan congressional action&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YAXhkx"&gt;“These massive job losses underscore the need for swift, bipartisan Congressional action on a stimulus package that will help address the immediate needs of states and get these Americans back to work, while ensuring climate commitments are met,” the alliance wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.usclimatealliance.org/publications/2020/12/10/us-climate-alliance-states-outpace-nation-in-clean-energy-job-creation-while-pushing-to-achieve-goals-of-paris-agreement"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; today. They’ve called on Congress to pass a stimulus package that includes $500 billion for states and territories, plus additional flexible spending for efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OXbwC"&gt;While states are struggling to get the pandemic under control, climate change is still posing threats to their residents. That makes climate change and clean energy a priority in Colorado, says Polis. Last year, he unveiled a roadmap to get the state’s electricity generation to come completely from renewables by 2040. Colorado suffered the three &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21537195/colorado-wildfires-beetle-infestations-forests-east-troublesome"&gt;biggest wildfires&lt;/a&gt; in its history this year, another sign that climate change is making fire seasons more devastating than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mty0fK"&gt;Out of all the members of the alliance, Colorado saw one of the biggest growths in clean energy jobs between 2016 and 2019 — 13.9 percent. “Colorado’s double digit clean energy job growth is a testament to the economic benefit of leading on bold climate action and pollution reduction,” Polis says. “This sector will be a critical driver in the stabilization and growth of our economy moving forward.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="905Mu4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Biden expects to create 10 million new jobs in clean energy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VXpvza"&gt;Polis and others have a lot of faith in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21243011/clean-energy-renewables-coronavirus-recession-stimulus-unemployment"&gt;clean energy as a job maker&lt;/a&gt;, because it already has a good track record across the US. Wind turbine service technician is still the &lt;a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/fastest-growing.htm"&gt;fastest growing&lt;/a&gt; occupation in the US, while solar panel system installer is the third fastest. Prior to the pandemic, both occupations were expected to grow by 57 and 63 percent, respectively, through 2028, according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBdKjy"&gt;President-elect Joe Biden has pledged to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/3/21548147/united-states-paris-agreement-climate-change-presidential-election"&gt;recommit the US to the Paris climate agreement&lt;/a&gt; and has laid out a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324575/joe-biden-jobs-climate-change-plan-energy-elections"&gt;sweeping plan&lt;/a&gt; to decarbonize the US economy. That includes transitioning the power sector to 100 percent carbon pollution-free energy by 2035. To keep those promises, he’ll need a lot of boots on the ground to modernize power grids and build up the country’s renewable energy capacity. Biden expects to create &lt;a href="https://joebiden.com/climate-labor-fact-sheet/"&gt;10 million new jobs&lt;/a&gt; in clean energy, more than tripling the number of American workers currently employed in the sector. Biden will still need help from Congress, though, to pass legislation that will help him meet all his climate and jobs goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbzpUh"&gt;Polis is hopeful that Colorado and other states will no longer be on their own when it comes to remaking energy infrastructure. “It’ll be great to have a partner in our federal government rather than an adversary,” Polis says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now add tweets to your snaps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B0pNjIRRZYqM2q4oBx9KDOxnypY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68491764/acastro_170726_1777_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="13RGce"&gt;Twitter is making it even easier to spread your tweets far and wide to every social media platform imaginable. Starting today on iOS (support is coming “soon” for Android), you’ll be able to add tweets into a snap as a sticker. Before, if you wanted to share a tweet on Snapchat, you would have to take a screenshot of it and share that, without having access to any of Snapchat’s camera or editing features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JVS3Rs"&gt;If you want to share a tweet to Snapchat, press the share button on a public tweet (private tweets aren’t supported, for obvious reasons) and select the Snapchat icon from the share carousel. You can then create a snap as usual, except you’ll have your selected tweet as a sticker that you can manipulate. You can then share the snap as you would any other — sending it to people, or adding it to your story, and whoever sees it can go to the tweet by swiping up. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Shows the process of sharing a tweet to Snapchat" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LosgzVI-mjpOf4uia5YI6a3QiM8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158880/JN9n1a0kXdN4WiHcn1HmXwjLGtQj9ym64p9Ee3Fe8PqM1khSpD4thVG9HhoqF4qx1hI_Am5Avqq1pSpNNXoFFHvcIw5OS1r9gol9REwmrtiIwa4CgkUDYwaIF5SHRQPjc9rE_ppC.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The process of adding a tweet to a snap.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S2Qran"&gt;I have to say, the example snap looks way better than the (often crunchy) screenshots of tweets do, and it’s nice that it’s a format that lets you easily find the source. If you’ve abandoned Snapchat for Instagram Stories, don’t worry: Twitter also says that a small group of iOS users will be able to test sharing tweets to Instagram Stories soon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image of a tweet that has been embedded into an Instagram story" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iufAMqocrBgKzSDoTgweuRgYKX8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158926/xF6OtSQCTyfV0kcCl671ctkWapXjNOUfKWmpU_k7IUbuAz5pm9FNLCSh40zILd_rS1HoyS05nwCfwPweq23Tw4PZRqgPUMCfXtP_FoMGk62mzEeSi8RHJsCVnJBCtjESyAQL9zGy.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Graphic: Twitter&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soon, Twitter will be testing sharing to Instagram Stories as well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Wq9xZk"&gt;This is a feature built for social media apps as they are today: places to repost tweets. As I’m writing this, two out of the top 10 posts on Reddit are tweets. Instagram is filled with pages that post screenshots of tweets, and Facebook, I’m told, is mostly people posting tweets (Twitter, of course, is full of old Tumblr posts). Now, Snapchat can also be Twitter, and Instagram Stories’ time is coming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YgGOER"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber asks governors to give drivers early access to COVID-19 vaccines</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Uber logo against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uHVzCFT9K25KigFPb9R8LkWWImg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68491286/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LC6xMC"&gt;Uber sent letters today to every US governor asking that their drivers and delivery people be classified as essential workers and given prioritized access to COVID-19 vaccines. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has recommended the first batch of vaccines go to health care workers and residents of long-term care facilities, with essential workers — including those in transportation — following in a second phase. But it’s up to each state to decide the specifics of their vaccine distribution plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuRDkp"&gt;“After nine months on the frontlines keeping their communities running, we are asking governors in all 50 states to prioritize drivers and delivery people for early vaccine access,” said Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8lvnKu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If classified as essential, Uber drivers would be part of the planned second phase for vaccination&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vgcSFn"&gt;Uber made &lt;a href="https://beta.regulations.gov/comment/CDC-2020-0121-0238"&gt;a similar appeal&lt;/a&gt; to the CDC earlier this week, saying in a letter that early access to a COVID-19 vaccine “would help drivers and delivery people continue to play their essential role while also reducing the risk that they may inadvertently contract, or possibly transmit, the virus.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzpOXN"&gt;In the letter to state governors, Khosrowshahi argues that Uber can use their services “to remove transportation barriers faced by individuals who will need to travel to their vaccination appointments.” Both letters point to the use of Uber by health care workers, restaurants, and people relying on delivery to stay at home during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y531DG"&gt;While Uber is asking for its workers to be considered essential, the company has long been criticized for repeatedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;fighting to classify those same drivers as contractors rather than employees&lt;/a&gt;. Uber has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/11/20861362/uber-ab5-tony-west-drivers-core-ride-share-business-california"&gt;gone so far as to say&lt;/a&gt; that “drivers’ work is outside the usual course of Uber’s business.” Part of its business or not, more drivers and delivery people could continue working through the pandemic with early access to vaccination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCg5ki"&gt;The FDA advisory committee is meeting on Thursday to discuss emergency authorization of the Pfizer / BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine, and it will be doing the same next week for the Moderna vaccine. States have already begun their preparations for vaccine distribution, but with limited supply, there &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21779433/covid-vaccine-priority-health-care-workers-long-term-care"&gt;may not be enough doses&lt;/a&gt; available to vaccinate all health care workers by the end of the year. As more doses become available in 2021, it will take careful consideration from state officials to determine which populations of people should be prioritized.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google, Dell, and Intel form new computing group for transforming cloud and IT tools</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DfZulGtp9BkTNFT9pDGuuuTIJdM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68491191/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xq284Z"&gt;Google, Dell, Intel and a handful of other major tech companies in the IT and cloud computing industries have banded together to tackle joint problems around security, remote work, and other enterprise issues that have only become more important during the coronavirus pandemic. The consortium these companies have formed is called the Modern Computing Alliance, and its founding members also include Box, Cirtrix, Imprivata, Okta, RingCentral, Slack, VMWare, and Zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gN5Q3G"&gt;The Modern Computing Alliance will initially be focused on four areas: performance; security and identity; remote work, productivity, and collaboration; and health care. The goal is to pool knowledge and resources toward solving shared problems around how companies perform work in the cloud and the tools they use to do so. The alliance will focus on developing new standards and interoperable technologies that can be used by any company that relies on one of the partners’ platforms or products. In particular, Google is engaged in the effort with its Chrome browser and Chrome OS teams, as well as the division responsible for Google Workplace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3n8NTB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The needs that our users are expecting and the way that compute is changing really require a new way of working.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9T823Z"&gt;“Today, we’re excited to announce Google’s membership in the Modern Computing Alliance — to address the biggest IT challenges facing companies today with integration from silicon to cloud,” says John Solomon, Google’s vice president of Chrome OS. “Working with a group of forward-thinking industry leaders, we’re aligning standards and technologies to provide companies with the choice of high-performance, cloud-first computing solutions from the vendor of their choice who provide modern solutions for the modern era of business.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AwjZLi"&gt;The Modern Computing Alliance predates the coronavirus pandemic; Solomon tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;discussions first began at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas last year. But in March, as the reality of COVID-19 set in and companies everywhere began transitioning to remote work, the group decided it needed to expand its scope and bring in even more partners, like Slack and Zoom, that were witnessing massive shifts in how corporate work was being performed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgd3x6"&gt;“The needs that our users are expecting and the way that compute is changing really require a new way of working,” Solomon tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s not the most natural thing to say, ‘Let’s form a consortium.’ But this isn’t an ordinary time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3AfVg"&gt;Looking ahead, the group aims to bring in as many IT professionals as it can to help build a council of experts that can identify problems and figure out ways to solve them. The group also intends to have some concrete action plans to share in the first half of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ekxjko"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gmail will now let you edit Office documents directly from email attachments</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VPx4apCBs66iuWpD3VYIqKplZb8=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68491182/newgmaillogo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="29ZSGA"&gt;Google is making it even easier to work with Microsoft Office files, with the company now allowing users to directly edit attached Office files in Gmail, much like it already allows with Google Docs or Sheets files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HeNgZD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21503649/google-workspace-g-suite-gmail-chat-meet-docs"&gt;Google Workspace&lt;/a&gt; (the recently rebranded G Suite, which encompasses Google Docs, Sheets, Slides, Meet, and Calendar) has offered compatibility with &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/drive/answer/9276408"&gt;Office files from Word, PowerPoint, and Excel&lt;/a&gt; for some time. But previously, documents had to be imported into Google Drive in order to edit or modify them — while emailed attachments were only able to be viewed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q89HS6"&gt;The new workflow, however, streamlines that process considerably. Now, you can directly open and edit an Office file using the Google Docs editor just by clicking on it — just like you would a native Google Doc. But the new editing function doesn’t convert Office files into Google Docs, instead preserving the original file format. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQhfe6"&gt;Gmail will allow users to respond to the original email and include the now-updated file (still in an Office file format) without first requiring that they download and then re-attach the updated file. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P0BqdR"&gt;Google is also working to help ensure that Office files work more smoothly in Google Docs, with the company launching a new &lt;a href="https://gsuite.google.com/marketplace/app/macro_converter/383201976440"&gt;Macro Converter add-on&lt;/a&gt; for Google Workspace that’s designed to help users and organizations import their macros from Excel to Sheets more easily.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4H4Yez"&gt;Similarly, Google is working on adding better document orientation and image support to Google Docs, allowing for documents with both horizontally and vertically oriented pages, along with images placed behind text and watermarks (although the new image features won’t be available until next year.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BhGVEc71Yk8B4Lsy5K-rxnX5jpA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22159737/Watermarks_MPO_combined.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U4bn19"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction December 10th, 1:30pm:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Google’s suite of products is called Google Workspace, not Google Workplace. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Geoff Keighley, gaming’s inescapable hypeman, on ‘the most expensive’ Game Awards yet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Esf2pWgMc9M83k4Stuk5N0783yo=/0x0:4095x2730/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68491069/1193629349.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="InrPkO"&gt;Geoff Keighley doesn’t get enough sleep. It’s December, which means he’s averaging four or five hours on a good night. “One of the toughest things about [the Game Awards] is that I’m hosting it, and I’m also producing it,” he says. Sure, he’d probably be a better host with more rest, but there’s an added benefit to knowing the whole thing front to back. He could do this in his — ah, never mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xIikw"&gt;This year, the 20-hour days leading up to the annual Game Awards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22163974/2020-game-awards-how-to-watch-time-date-premieres"&gt;on December 10th&lt;/a&gt; look a little different. Seating charts for an event of hundreds used to keep him up late, but now, group gatherings are a quaint concept. COVID-19 safety precautions have made the whole process a little stranger. “It’s obviously an evolving situation so we’re kind of staying on top of it — especially [in] Los Angeles now with some of the stay at home orders,” the Game Awards creator says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lad4Vj"&gt;Keighley has long played the role of the game industry’s rich uncle, a benevolent force with deep pockets and a genuine interest in giving the medium a bigger platform. He’s been endlessly interviewed and profiled for his work on creating the industry’s biggest awards show — a self-funded venture created from the ashes of the infamous Spike Video Game Awards, now pulling in more than &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/2019-game-awards-shatters-prior-years-record-hits-452-million-live-streams-1263419"&gt;45 million streams&lt;/a&gt;, as of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHDK9y"&gt;In the absence of events like E3, after an utterly exhausting year, the Game Awards  — already online anyway, outside of a small industry presence in LA — remain largely unchanged. There will be celebrity cameos and musical performances. There will be exclusive game reveals. It is all in service of the same &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/7/18131058/game-awards-2018-geoff-keighly-creaotr-streaming-tga-hydrobot"&gt;saccharine view&lt;/a&gt; of a complicated industry demonstrated in past years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="tQvciL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Oh, here’s Geoff doing another stream.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Tk7ipa"&gt;Gone is the red carpet and studio audience this year. Most appearances will take place over video calls. It’s not much different from the rest of life in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hNAVdD"&gt;“Game Awards is kind of perfectly suited for the world we’re in now,” Keighley says. “In 2014, it was a crazy idea to do this streamed-only award show. And now everyone’s announcing a streaming service, and every movie’s going to streaming… We were kind of ahead of the curve in that way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05hpUw"&gt;That’s been a trend for Keighley this year in particular. He’d already made the choice to skip E3 back in early February, now an antiquated notion 10 months into COVID, when all major events for the year have been canceled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JpfsMa"&gt;“I was just like, oh, I guess I’m not really going to do anything for the year,” he says. He went to Europe for a few weeks of vacation and made plans to visit Valve in Bellevue, Washington, for &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1361700/HalfLife_Alyx__Final_Hours/"&gt;a project&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;. By his return in March, COVID had begun to take root — particularly in Washington, where the US had its first confirmed case. He canceled his trip and opted for virtual interviews with Valve. He hasn’t left LA since, and conducts business over Zoom calls from a white-walled den with little in the way of decoration. Next door is the spare room he streams from, the now-familiar backdrop to events like the four-month long Summer Game Fest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ygklc"&gt;“Summer Game Fest grew out of, honestly, all the game companies coming to me,” Keighley says. E3 wasn’t happening, but developers still wanted to do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;. Could he help them pull together an event? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1SP2p"&gt;“Normally I do E3 and I’m done,” he says, referring to himself as “the guy who does one big thing and then disappears.” This year, he’s been a larger presence than ever: “Oh, here’s Geoff doing another stream.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2hk18k"&gt;His presence is one driven both by professional obligation and personal determination. “The first year of Game Awards, what petrified me was this sense that we’re not going to have an award show for our industry this year if we don’t do the Spike thing,” he says. “I was like, no, I have to create something.” The same goes for this summer and the vacuum of events created by that whole bothersome pandemic. “This is the year that new consoles are coming out... That’s huge. We can’t just kind of let that fall by the wayside.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="9uGupJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;My view tonight! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheGameAwards?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TheGameAwards&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/jX4sGjTPTl"&gt;pic.twitter.com/jX4sGjTPTl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1337051032145321984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="35zBJU"&gt;Despite the added pressure of COVID, the Game Awards this year will still be extended across three cities, albeit with more virtual components and safety precautions than anyone expected. “People are like, oh, you’re doing a virtual show, it’s gonna be super cheap this year,” he says of feedback he’s gotten. “No, actually it’s the most expensive Game Awards we’ve ever done ...  It’s actually extraordinarily challenging, mentally and emotionally, to do it, but also just financially to just be able to deliver something.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HcHPXR"&gt;Unlike earlier 2020 events — the originally-in-March GDC, or even E3 in June — the Game Awards has had the benefit of time. “Initially I was like, oh, it’s good Game Awards isn’t until December, so we’ll be through all this and it’ll be back to normal then,” says Keighley. By May, the reality of COVID had set in. Keighley and his team knew there would be no in-person event this year and opted to not “be under the false pretenses that it’s all going to be fine.” Weeks ahead of the event, they’ve settled on three or four possible scenarios, he says, that they’ll be able to quickly pivot to depending on how things change. “Worst case, there’ll be a satellite truck at my house,” says Keighley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VE6SvE"&gt;He knows that most people just want to see game announcements, but they’ve still built a set. “We wanted to still have some spectacle to it. I think this industry deserves it, honestly... We’re going to do a full-on live show.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fKTfzR"&gt;Keighley has been isolating at home for the last few weeks. He hasn’t been to the set yet, and will arrive tonight, when the awards stream live. “You know where to find me if you need me.”&lt;/p&gt;
