    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F6f4sw"&gt;The Oculus Quest 2 standalone VR headset has been tough to find throughout the pandemic. Several retailers now have it back in stock, but only at Newegg can you snag one and get a complimentary gift card with your purchase. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Foculus-quest-2%2Fp%2FN82E16826910017" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The headset with 64GB of storage &lt;/a&gt;costs $299 and includes a $10 Newegg gift card, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Foculus-quest-2%2Fp%2FN82E16826910018" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;while the 256GB model is $399&lt;/a&gt; and comes with a $20 gift card. If you’ve considered getting a headset, you might as well buy it from a place that’ll give you a freebie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KeYdx1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10318379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DvLPQT"&gt;In addition to the headset, Newegg is including gift cards with other accessories made for the Oculus Quest 2. The zip-up carrying case for the headset &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Foculus-301-00369-01-case%2Fp%2FN82E16826910021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $50 and includes a $5 gift card&lt;/a&gt;. The Elite strap that dramatically improves the Quest 2’s fit and comfort &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Foculus-301-00375-01-strap%2Fp%2FN82E16826910020" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is also $50&lt;/a&gt; and comes with a $5 gift card. As a Quest 2 owner myself, I highly recommend both accessories. Once you get your kit, you can follow &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218827/oculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to"&gt;my how-to on streaming VR games like &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt; to your headset wirelessly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JP0w32"&gt;Razer’s first compact 60 percent gaming keyboard, the Huntsman Mini, is $100 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BFF4C7J/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733306396839425140" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which is $20 off its usual price. Both are offering the black-colored model with clicky optical switches. Unfortunately, this deal doesn’t apply to the Razer’s mercury white colorway. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21318516/razer-huntsman-mini-60-percent-keyboard-mechanical-clicky-linear-price-release-date"&gt;You can read more about the keyboard’s features right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A5FKf0"&gt;In case you’re hunting for a feature-packed 1440p gaming monitor that doesn’t cost a fortune, Acer’s XV272U is $300 at Amazon and B&amp;amp;H Photo. I wrote about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/2/16/22286158/acers-nitro-xv272u-gaming-monitor-g-sync-1440p-qhd-amazon-deal-sale"&gt;this deal last week&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s not new, but it’s worth telling you about again in case your search for PC components is still ongoing. This model has a 27-inch QHD IPS panel with G-Sync compatibility and a 144Hz refresh rate, so it ticks a lot of boxes for the price.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Fitness Plus review: easy mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zedaUNEveL5HlhwlWJ0stnBYtAI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873680/vpavic_210217_4444_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A starter pack for exercise&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Kv1B8z"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus has been out for a couple of months now, and a few of us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; have been spending that time running it (and ourselves) through its paces. The $9.99-a-month service offers a decent array of exercise videos with an added bonus: integration with the sensors on an Apple Watch. In fact, an Apple Watch is &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; to use the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="muA3mz"&gt;Since everybody’s exercise routine is a little different, we wanted to get a variety of perspectives on the service. What’s become clear from all of our testing is that Apple has successfully achieved what we think it set out to do: create an exercise service that is accessible to a broad range of people. There are lots of different ways an exercise service like this could get tripped up, but for the most part, Fitness Plus stays on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPrnZG"&gt;Whether you like the direction that track goes or if it’s long enough to keep your attention for years to come is another matter. It will take more time for Apple to expand its array of options in the service, but it has already added one new kind of exercise — celebrity walk-and-listens — which could bode well for those hoping for future updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="crjyLA"&gt;But as we always say, never pay for something now in the hopes that it’ll be better in the future. So here’s what we think of Fitness Plus after two months of using the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BEBYgzXliQUd7ySaIQvscooBXQE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327713/vpavic_4444_20210224_0074.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8SoygW"&gt;The basics of Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="eXAL46"&gt;Fitness Plus’ main selling point is it’s easy to jump into — so long as your own oodles of Apple devices. The app requires an Apple Watch to access the classes, and then you’ll need an iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV to stream the workouts. (Critically, there’s no way to stream from a Mac, which makes no sense and required me to stream from my tiny iPhone display.) But because the app connects to the Watch, your rings show up in the corner of the screen throughout a workout. It serves as a reminder of how hard you’ve worked and how far you have to go to meet your goals for the day. Some people might find this motivational. I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mO7MNU"&gt;As for equipment, the app offers a variety of cardio workouts, such as cycling, treadmill classes, and rowing, which require special equipment. But it also offers classes like Time to Walk, which Becca will dive into below, and dance classes that require no equipment at all. Most of the strength classes would like you to use dumbbells (which can be hard to find in stock currently), but you could get away with your bodyweight if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="WhZueZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s a diverse group of instructors and class formats&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PDGNdjC3auqbnBnx8FaTqXqVvjA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327683/vpavic_210224_4444_0025.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hSn92D"&gt;There’s no way to filter classes by equipment requirements or even area of focus, so expect to spend time in the app reading descriptions and watching previews to discern whether a class is for you. This is a pain and a hurdle that shouldn’t exist. Filters by workout type and equipment should be table stakes for any fitness app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnUvSY"&gt;What Apple lacks in filters, though, it slightly makes up for with a diverse group of instructors and class formats. The instructors vary in age, background, and body type, which I immediately noticed and appreciated. (I would still like to see a fitness app incorporate all body types and not just what we typically think of as “fit.”) The strength classes also offer three different sets of instructions: one for the prescribed exercise, another to make it more advanced, and a third to modify for injuries or anyone who needs to take it easy. This is the type of setup you’d see in classic fitness tapes, but I don’t find as much in on-demand classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6yLCH"&gt;This setup contrasts Apple’s biggest competitor in the space, Peloton, which doesn’t offer modifications during its workouts. As someone who has regularly worked out through Peloton’s classes, this was a nice change and one I’d like to see Peloton take as a cue from Apple. —&lt;em&gt;Ashley Carman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wGvrl-fzgg2VUqF0zDUWpqzqs-4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327714/vpavic_4444_20210224_0076.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C5YXaV"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus versus Peloton&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="zDxmB7"&gt;Apple and Peloton are similar when it comes to premise and the primary user experience. You can select workouts with different lengths, different playlists, and different instructors in various categories like cycling, treadmill, strength, and yoga, as well as dedicated cooldowns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2w8qO"&gt;I would say the primary reason to use Apple’s program is its seamless integration with the company’s hardware ecosystem. When I start up a workout on my iPad, the workout shows up on my Watch as well, and my Watch’s metrics appear on the iPad’s screen. It’s great to be able to watch my heart rate and rings in real time on the same screen as my workout without having to manually connect anything. You can even launch Fitness Plus playlists in Apple Music if you take a liking to them. (You can sync an Apple Watch with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22238974/peloton-bike-plus-review-price-features"&gt;Peloton’s Bike Plus&lt;/a&gt;, but its on-screen metrics are limited to cycling workouts.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3MlMy"&gt;I also like that when you start a hill in Apple’s cardio workouts, a clock appears counting down to the end of the interval. I watch that clock religiously during the steepest climbs. It’s easier to survive them when I know exactly how long I have left to endure without having to count in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="xl0YGK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Most of the Fitness Plus workouts I tried are around the same level of difficulty &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5fpHK66YG-WhX9nMiZv3WDajC_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327712/vpavic_4444_20210224_0073.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hRsrac"&gt;Another unique feature of Apple Fitness Plus is — and I apologize for not having a better term here — the &lt;em&gt;vibes&lt;/em&gt;. Peloton instructors approach their rides with a wide range of attitudes and personalities. And while this is also true of Apple’s instructors to some extent, all of them (at least, the cycling and treadmill folks) have vibrantly positive personas. They’re enthusiastic, they’re full of energy, and they’re so excited to be running or biking with you that it’s infectious. It’s hard not to be excited in turn. There was an emphasis on overall wellness — reaching goals, eliminating stress, that sort of thing. I don’t feel like Apple’s instructors are just trying to get me through a workout; I feel like they’re trying to make me a better person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFEi1g"&gt;But the biggest difference between Apple and Peloton’s libraries is that Apple’s is newer — and that means it just doesn’t have as much &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; yet. Peloton has a wider variety of music. I’ve done everything from Bon Jovi rides to yacht-music bike rides, where Apple’s playlists are largely more general (“Everything Rock,” “Latest Hits,” “Latin Grooves,” etc.). And as someone who likes longer endurance workouts, I was disappointed that Apple’s cycling and treadmill workouts are capped at 45 minutes. With Peloton, you can ride for up to 90. Peloton also offers a number of live classes where you can interact with fellow riders, while all of Apple’s workouts are pre-recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hBdTQ"&gt;Another area where Peloton’s ahead is in specific workout hardware integration. Obviously, Apple doesn’t sell a spin bike (yet), and that means the instructors have to be more general about intensity. While Peloton instructors give a specific range (“30 to 50”), Apple instructors speak more generally (“Moderate intensity,” “add a little bit more here,” etc.). This meant I was always kind of guessing where my resistance was supposed to be during Apple’s rides (and I don’t really trust myself to arrive at a legitimately “hard” resistance when asked to find that for myself). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Vt8Lj"&gt;Apple instructors can be more specific with treadmill workouts since metrics like speed and incline are universal. Still, I wish Apple could display the current incline or resistance on the iPad screen like Peloton does. There were times when my teacher instructed everyone to change their resistance while I was zoned out or checking my phone or something, and I ended up doing a portion of the workout at the wrong intensity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wY9Gef"&gt;But I think the biggest thing to consider when choosing between Peloton and Apple Fitness Plus is the difficulty. Most of the Fitness Plus workouts I tried are around the same level: a nice challenge for folks like me who work out a few times a week and aren’t super in shape. Peloton caters to a wider variety of abilities, sorted on a scale of 1–10, and you can sort classes by intensity while browsing. If you’re serious about athletic training (and cycling, in particular), Peloton will have more to offer. —&lt;em&gt;Monica Chin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bq3KfwCbGIwu7N_qDYXFPX6DOpg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327715/vpavic_4444_20210224_0079.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PdiGjj"&gt;Time to Walk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nPrX7P"&gt;Working out in one space has always been a struggle for me. I get really bored and uninterested when I’m not actively going somewhere or physically achieving something. I usually exercise by doing loops in a park on my bike, going on a run, or slacklining between trees. So Apple Fitness Plus’ at-home workouts were never of interest to me — until a few weeks ago when Apple rolled out the Time to Walk feature. That is something I, in theory, could get behind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BNeLV"&gt;Time to Walk pairs inspirational monologues, music, and photos from famous musicians, athletes, and actors with the Apple Watch’s exercise tracking feature to create a more engaging way to take a walk. I take a walk almost every day and use that time to tune in to a new album or one of my favorite podcasts, so Time to Walk slotted into my routine quite nicely. It’s exactly the level of effortlessness I need in workout tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="d7VKxz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Time to Walk slotted into my routine quite nicely&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pQbdnxFksQHqA4gJYX4UXJLVK7Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327738/IMG_8514EA04A825_1.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G365Gy"&gt;There are only a couple of differences between Time to Walk and a more traditional podcast. Most notably, your Watch will buzz about twice an episode, and a photo will show up on the screen that relates to what the host is talking about. It’s cool but not groundbreaking. Secondly, the hosts are either also on a walk or talking about what walking means to them. I appreciated this a bit more. Ruby Bridges’ episode has a slow, calm pace, and you can hear as she strolls through Audubon Park in New Orleans. There are many loud birds and cars driving by in the distance. While Draymond Green’s heavier foot on a gravel path in Malibu is accompanied by the sounds of distant waves. Apple really nailed the soundstage of these walks, and it creates a pleasing experience that actually makes you feel as if you are walking next to someone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sg6kLj"&gt;My only issue with Time to Walk and Apple Fitness Plus at large is the need to live in the Apple ecosystem. You absolutely need an iPhone and Apple Watch to use Fitness Plus, and even outside of that, when you use the Time to Walk feature, your headphones have to be paired to the Apple Watch. If a call comes in on your iPhone and you’re not using Apple or Beats headphones that can switch over automatically, you will have to manually reconnect your headphones to your phone to take the call on them, then manually reconnect your headphones to the Watch to resume the Time to Walk episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwJMJA"&gt;For someone who doesn’t use AirPods, this is very annoying. Outside of the usual Apple ecosystem walls, Time to Walk is my favorite feature of Apple Fitness Plus. Every Monday, when a new episode with a new mystery celeb comes out, I look forward to my nightly walk. Unfortunately, this is the only feature I loved within Apple Fitness Plus, and a walking podcast is not worth $9.99 a month for me. —&lt;em&gt;Becca Farsace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KoJWOTEYvmq9cxlZ5VxwDqOZcxo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327711/vpavic_4444_20210224_0068.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SXXQz9"&gt;If there’s a single message to take away from this review, it’s this: Apple Fitness Plus is great for beginners but may not offer the depth you’re looking for if you’re advanced in any specific sport. It’s accessible to anybody who is able to buy into Apple’s whole ecosystem, though. And for me, a person who has struggled to exercise regularly for my entire life, it’s better than a gym membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5rvh08"&gt;There is enough variety for me to feel like I won’t have to put videos on repeat, but I’m only using it a couple of times a week right now. My main complaint has nothing to do with the exercise content but instead with the vibe of Apple’s videos. I’m not asking for disaffected ’90s MTV VJs, but the peppy and relentlessly positive chatter is a lot for a Gen-Xer like me. And the vaguely-but-not-actually spiritualistic “mindfulness” that you can’t avoid in the cooldowns also grates. None of this is new to anybody who has used services like this, but for me, it’s a lot. I cringe when a trainer ends a video by trying to get me excited to “close those rings” on the Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bcBQ2L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Great for beginners, but maybe not deep enough if you already have an exercise routine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kCTRk0"&gt;Still, the best thing I can say about Apple Fitness Plus is, slowly but surely, it is helping me build a habit of actual exercise. There are plenty of days that I end up going outside for a bike ride or a walk instead of turning on an Apple video, but I think doing a couple Fitness Plus videos a week has made it more likely I’ll do that non-Fitness Plus exercise, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XxZ3wX"&gt;And while the Apple Watch integration occasionally feels motivational, for the most part, it feels unnecessary. Fitness Plus is not a reason to go out and buy an Apple Watch, but it might be a good reason to keep using the one you’ve already got. As with many of Apple’s new services, it’s less about drawing people in than it is about keeping people from leaving. I’ll probably keep using Fitness Plus simply because it’s part of the big Apple One bundle I got so my family could &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21439083/apple-one-music-icloud-tv-plus-arcade-bundle-price-explained-deal-subscription-service"&gt;have an amount of iCloud storage that didn’t feel punitive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xV2646"&gt;If you’re not an Apple One subscriber, is Fitness Plus worth $9.99 / month on its own? If you’re already in an exercise routine, I’m not sure that Fitness Plus is going to offer you something better. For me, it’s literally better than nothing. —&lt;em&gt;Dieter Bohn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Paramount Plus is proof we’ve hit peak streaming </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9oa2gSlPB8_M4FvvusT5D77g344=/612x0:6282x3780/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873563/Kamp_Koral_SpongeBob_s_Under_Years.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MoQ4bC"&gt;Something my mom said about the recent streaming landscape stuck with me while watching a three-hour event &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299615/paramount-plus-launch-date-price-cbs-all-access-shows-movies"&gt;for Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wlOt8P"&gt;“I’m sometimes searching on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, [and] HBO when I’m bored, and I often am, and I still can’t figure out what I want to watch,” she said. “Maybe too much choice isn’t always good!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v6fR4K"&gt;Companies like ViacomCBS, Disney, Apple, Amazon, NBCUniversal, WarnerMedia, and even Fox would say otherwise. They’re in the midst of pivoting to a streaming-first or streaming-focused strategy, figuring out their way into the world with individual platforms — many of which come with a plus sign at the end. More, the plus sign signals; more, more, more. Paramount Plus is just the latest, and arguably the last, big entry in the space. Has it finally hit the point where there’s too much choice? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A8piHO"&gt;During its event, ViacomCBS executives announced more than 50 new projects, a combination of shows, documentaries, films, and specials &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299973/frasier-reboot-paramount-plus-streaming-kelsey-grammer"&gt;for Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt;. The titles hail from Nickelodeon, MTV, BET, Showtime, Comedy Central, and others, and all are supposed to get people excited enough to sign up. Over the next four years, ViacomCBS is increasing its spending on streaming to $5 billion and hoping to bring in 65 to 75 million subscribers around the world. The service launches on March 4th for $9.99 a month. A cheaper, ad-supported option will be available in June for $4.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kVN3L5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Realistically, most of these streaming platforms don’t need to exist&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9myQnA"&gt;Executives are hopeful that Paramount Plus has the potential to become a major revenue source. The &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; for Paramount Plus to reach incredible heights, the &lt;em&gt;potential &lt;/em&gt;for it to generate a meaningful profit for ViacomCBS, is everything. There’s a glaring problem with &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; equations, with trying to evaluate just how much someone will want to switch over from Netflix or Disney Plus to Paramount Plus — what if the opposite happens and the &lt;em&gt;potential &lt;/em&gt;to lose out actually happens instead? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JrX3DY"&gt;Realistically, most of these streaming platforms don’t need to exist. To go one step further, a few seem to exist solely to appease internal pressures and demands in the middle of a rapidly accelerating and changing entertainment industry. Companies feel like they have to own the content, and distribution paths, in order to keep their heads above water. In order for a streaming service to really work, it needs to accomplish a few things, but it all boils down to one core idea: it has to fulfill a need. Or, a streaming service has to be a nonnegotiable purchase. People feel like they can’t sacrifice not having it. Two primary examples are Netflix and Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yN4DTI"&gt;Netflix, benefitting by being first and adapting extraordinarily fast when needed, has made it nearly impossible to leave. For $14 a month, there’s a new highly talked-about movie or TV show every week, and a large library to keep people watching. Netflix executives have hedged their licensing bets to keep shows they don’t own but people &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;want to watch. This prevents them from canceling. Those they can’t keep are likely easy to replicate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVl7wX"&gt;Think of Netflix’s reality and unscripted TV plan, which bears similarities to MTV, Bravo, and Discovery. Like &lt;em&gt;Real Housewives &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Vanderpump Rules&lt;/em&gt;? Netflix has &lt;em&gt;Bling Empire&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Selling Sunset&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Real Lives of Bollywood Wives&lt;/em&gt;. As co-CEO Ted Sarandos said on a recent earnings call, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328481/netflix-franchise-movies-tv-shows-reality-tv-reed-hastings-ted-sarandos"&gt;Netflix wants to be&lt;/a&gt; the place “where [people] come to us for their favorite show.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5cB0pa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s a good chance Paramount Plus could work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AYM2Oj"&gt;On the flip side, there’s Disney Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278874/disney-plus-94-9-million-subscribers-q1-2021-earnings"&gt;closing in on 100 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; within 14 months of its initial launch. (To put this in perspective, by 2024, ViacomCBS expects to have 65-75 million subscribers across its streaming platforms globally; in the same time frame, Disney is estimating between 300 and 350 million for its services.) Disney’s entire strategy is laid out in every single advertisement: it’s Disney, it’s Pixar, it’s Marvel, it’s &lt;em&gt;Star Wars,&lt;/em&gt; it’s National Geographic. This is Disney and Disney is this, and it’s only on Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFYZHB"&gt;Brand identity is everything. People know they have to sign up for Disney Plus to watch Marvel movies or shows, while Marvel and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; stay on top of the conversation through weekly releases of highly anticipated shows that dominate conversation. Paramount Plus has brand power, but it’s not as instantly recognizable. During the event, certain shows were highlighted as reasons to get Paramount Plus. A new &lt;em&gt;iCarly,&lt;/em&gt; new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297512/avatar-last-airbender-korra-studios-paramount-plus-streaming-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Legend of Korra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, new &lt;em&gt;Criminal Minds&lt;/em&gt;. All these shows are available to stream on Netflix, where they’ve found a big audience, but it’s unclear how many people associate those series with ViacomCBS or how many people will sign up for Paramount Plus to watch those same series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k56bAU"&gt;Launching a streaming service may solve an issue for a company, but asking customers to sign up for another platform and pay for another app — especially when they’re used to having things on Netflix — isn’t consumer friendly. Some folks may begrudgingly say, “Fine, I’ll sign up for Paramount Plus for &lt;em&gt;Criminal Minds&lt;/em&gt;,” but unless there’s a weekly reason to justify that purchase, and leave people feeling excited about it, the process feels like a chore. Other people may decide they can live without &lt;em&gt;Criminal Minds &lt;/em&gt;— perhaps make a one-time purchase on iTunes or Amazon — and stick to the medley of streaming services they already use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="unWkIf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The biggest problem Paramount Plus will face is answering &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; someone needs it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3vDSKo"&gt;There’s a very good chance Paramount Plus could work. It has one of the biggest libraries of all the streaming services. There’s a live aspect to it combining sports and news. Movies like &lt;em&gt;Mission: Impossible 7 &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Place 2 &lt;/em&gt;will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299995/mission-impossible-7-quiet-place-2-paramount-plus-45-days-after-theaters"&gt;debut on Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt; just 45 days after they’re in theaters. Keep throwing things at the wall, and eventually one of the new shows will likely become something people want to watch and therefore finally sign up for Paramount Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="chRvUn"&gt;At the same time, in an era of way, way too much TV, where things get lost on Netflix and Hulu all the time, moving things to Paramount Plus isn’t going to help. &lt;em&gt;Emily in Paris &lt;/em&gt;is a Paramount show that was sold to Netflix. On Netflix, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498727/emily-in-paris-review-darren-star-netflix"&gt;found an audience&lt;/a&gt;, but would it have found the same audience on Paramount Plus, where there’s 10 percent of the audience base? Things often pop on Netflix simply because they’re on Netflix. It’s easier for 200 million subscribers to turn something into a cultural hit than 19 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtkvGq"&gt;The biggest problem Paramount Plus will face is answering &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; someone needs it. HBO Max and Peacock are facing similar hurdles. Netflix has proven why people need it, and so has Disney Plus. People could argue that customers didn’t &lt;em&gt;need &lt;/em&gt;a Disney Plus, but the company offered new series and old favorites on a platform designed around child safety, with no chance of a kid stumbling upon an R-rated movie. That fulfills a need for parents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrvmNb"&gt;Paramount Plus may contain an impressive library and may be home to some of the biggest TV networks and studios in the world, but it doesn’t fix a problem, it creates one. Shows and movies used to be on Netflix, a ubiquitous streaming service. Now they’re not. Not everyone has to be a distributor &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;a content producer. Over time, we’ll start to see companies realize that more and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ozkxnB"&gt;Last night, I went to bed watching &lt;em&gt;iCarly &lt;/em&gt;on Netflix, a show I loved as a kid but forgot about over time. If, and when, it eventually leaves Netflix, I’m not going to seek it out somewhere else. I’ll just find something else on Netflix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPfjsj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUe6eW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VvOAmt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgMAUC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcYgEI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKww2R"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKlR5w"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ffoIV8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OslVCR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sun probe surprises NASA with incredible photo of Venus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NEqWWbbig5vrb1sNAKQ6I2oz5Sk=/0x215:880x802/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873502/wispr_venus_image__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A photo of the nightside of Venus taken by the Wide-field Imager on Parker Solar Probe. | NASA/Johns Hopkins APL/Naval Research Laboratory/Guillermo Stenborg and Brendan Gallagher&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LTOSXB"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20993406/nasa-parker-solar-probe-sun-wind-magnetic-field"&gt;Parker Solar Probe, NASA’s closest eye on the Sun&lt;/a&gt;, was whizzing by Venus last summer for a gravity assist when it snapped a striking new image of the planet’s mysterious nightside, revealing a surprisingly clear view of the Venusian surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHciRz"&gt;The spacecraft, launched in 2018, is in the midst of its seven-year journey to study the Sun from 4 million miles away, the closest any human-made object has gone before. To do this, Parker Solar Probe needs to use the gravity of Venus to help tighten its orbit around the Sun through a series of seven flybys, nudging itself closer to the star with each pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYrf7H"&gt;Those scenic passes are valuable opportunities to catch intriguing shots of Venus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYOOW5"&gt;The image taken by Parker Solar Probe’s Wide-field Imager (WISPR) came during its third Venus flyby in July 2020, and scientists were shocked. They expected WISPR to capture Venus’ thick, carbon dioxide-rich clouds that usually obstruct views of the surface. But instead, the camera was able see through the clouds and reveal the dark-tinted shape of Aphrodite Terra, an elevated area of Venus near its equator that scientists say is about 85°F cooler than its surroundings. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E5Q6YnazMTOIvfvp5BozaSbR1Mk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326870/wispr_venus_annotated.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;NASA / Johns Hopkins APL / Naval Research Laboratory / Guillermo Stenborg and Brendan Gallagher&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An up-close shot of the nightside of Venus taken by the Parker Solar Probe, with key features annotated by NASA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qcZRZJ"&gt;“WISPR effectively captured the thermal emission of the Venusian surface,” Brian Wood, an astrophysicist and WISPR scientist at the US Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/parker-solar-probe-offers-a-stunning-view-of-venus/"&gt;NASA statement&lt;/a&gt;. Wood noted the image was similar to &lt;a href="https://www.planetary.org/articles/0116-a-new-look-at-venus-with-akatsuki"&gt;those taken by a Japanese Venus probe&lt;/a&gt; currently analyzing Venus that can capture light at near-infrared wavelengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0Gp6r"&gt;The revelation could mean one of two things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpQ5A3"&gt;WISPR might’ve shown off an unexpected capability for sensing infrared light, which, if true, could unlock a new potential for scientists to study dust circling the Sun. “This surprising observation sent the WISPR team back to the lab to measure the instrument’s sensitivity to infrared light,” Michael Buckley, communications manager at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, wrote in a NASA blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wJbLb"&gt;But if that’s not the case, then the appearance of Aphrodite Terra could mean WISPR discovered a previously unknown opening in the thick Venusian clouds, a “window” revealing portions of the planet’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzIKSd"&gt;To find out, mission teams scheduled more nightside shots of Venus in its latest flyby last weekend. They plan to release more images and an analysis by late April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDQiBI"&gt;WISPR’s image revealed other fascinating traits of Venus. It detected a glowing rim in the planet’s upper atmosphere that scientists suspect could be “nightglow.” Exclusive to Venus’ nightside, the faint luminescence might be caused by a clash of oxygen and nitrogen atoms that come from the side of the planet exposed to the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tOgKBK"&gt;Scientists are still studying the exact cause of the wispy streaks of light darting across the image’s frame, the NASA post said. They could be charged particles called &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/7/16/17690740/cosmic-rays-universe-theory-science"&gt;cosmic rays&lt;/a&gt;, tiny grains of space dust reflecting sunlight or “particles of material expelled from the spacecraft’s structures after impact with those dust grains.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coinbase reveals $1.2 billion revenue in plans to go public</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ih_0EjBWKos7gvmIJyLtjPoHPkI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873439/acastro_181126_1777_bitcoin_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aR84Ui"&gt;Coinbase has &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/59347/coinbase-big-profit-for-2020-ahead-of-milestone-ipo-direct-listing"&gt;publicly filed&lt;/a&gt; paperwork to list its stock on the NASDAQ exchange, a huge step forward in the first major public offering for a cryptocurrency company. &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000162828021003168/coinbaseglobalincs-1.htm#i86a9d9b35e45447ea6eb369e5dcf1e6a_1197"&gt;Coinbase’s S-1&lt;/a&gt; was published on Thursday morning, after being confidentially submitted to the SEC in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUxdzX"&gt;In an attached letter to investors, founder Brian Armstrong presented cryptocurrency as an equalizing force in financial markets — and Coinbase as the company at the forefront of that change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="obvCre"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If the world economy ran on a common set of standards... the world would be a more fair and free place”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QjaIvD"&gt;“The current financial system is rife with high fees, unequal access, and barriers to innovation,” the letter reads. “If the world economy ran on a common set of standards that could not be manipulated by any company or country, the world would be a more fair and free place, and human progress would accelerate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGMNe8"&gt;The filing lays out the company’s finances in unprecedented detail, including a surprisingly profitable 2020 driven by a huge spike in the price of bitcoin. Coinbase brought in $1.2 billion in revenue over the course of the year for a profit of $322 million, the first time the company has turned an annual profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9EW8M"&gt;Coinbase boasted 43 million verified users as of the end of 2020, with 2.8 million users making transactions each month and a total of $90 billion of assets held in trust. All told, the company has handled transactions worth $456 billion over its life span as a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHrEF3"&gt;Still, the skyrocketing price of bitcoin also has its drawbacks. The filing acknowledges that the volatility of cryptocurrency prices will be a significant risk for Coinbase going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UDffQ"&gt;“All of our sources of revenue are dependent on crypto assets and the broader cryptoeconomy,” the filing reads. “There is no assurance that any supported crypto asset will maintain its value or that there will be meaningful levels of trading activities. In the event that the price of crypto assets or the demand for trading crypto assets decline, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZeiK8"&gt;Much of Coinbase’s success has been due to its ongoing focus on complying with financial regulations concerning cryptocurrency. Coinbase was one of the first exchanges to embrace conventional know-your-customer finance rules, despite reluctance from the libertarian corners of the cryptocurrency world. As those regulations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195834/cryptocurrency-fincen-regulations-private-wallets"&gt;continue to tighten&lt;/a&gt;, many of Coinbase’s competitors have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/29/16060344/btce-bitcoin-exchange-takedown-mt-gox-theft-law-enforcement"&gt;prosecuted for money laundering&lt;/a&gt;, and the company continues to invest heavily in legal compliance. Kathryn Haun, a former prosecutor who led &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/1/9240989/shaun-bridges-silk-road-guilty-carl-mark-force-dread-pirate-roberts"&gt;the Silk Road task force corruption case&lt;/a&gt;, now sits on Coinbase’s board of directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FdaZC"&gt;In a nod to the historic nature of the filing, elusive Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto is listed on the S-1 as an interested party alongside lawyers and investors involved in the deal. As a result, a copy of the filing has been sent to Nakamoto’s bitcoin wallet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>India sets stricter rules for social media giants</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vwgwrZfUbZLbrAbHbYSMR1KgLJs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873325/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4PK6KR"&gt;India has announced new regulations for social networks and other web services in the country, particularly “significant social media” companies with large user bases, like Facebook and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UowV5d"&gt;India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) &lt;a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=1700749"&gt;announced the rules&lt;/a&gt; earlier today. &lt;a href="https://static.pib.gov.in/WriteReadData/specificdocs/documents/2021/feb/doc202122521.pdf"&gt;They require social media companies&lt;/a&gt; to establish a “grievance redressal mechanism” for users, including official “grievance officers” who acknowledge complaints within 24 hours and resolve them within 15 days. Services must also remove nudity and sexually explicit content within 24 hours of a user flagging it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sr9Ojb"&gt;“Significant social media intermediaries” face additional responsibilities. These companies must appoint India-based officials that work with law enforcement and publish a monthly report on their moderation activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ATXRbE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Guidelines for Social Media Platforms &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A Grievance redressal mechanism should be developed and there should be a Grievance Redressal Officer &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Should be registered within 24 hours and disposed in 15 days: Union Minister &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rsprasad?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@rsprasad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ResponsibleFreedom?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ResponsibleFreedom&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OTTGuideline?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#OTTGuideline&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/8A0DQycQqe"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8A0DQycQqe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— PIB India (@PIB_India) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PIB_India/status/1364882870876078092?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U0pfFF"&gt;“Significant” messaging-focused services must also be ready to identify the “first originator” of a message — a regulation likely aimed at Facebook’s highly popular WhatsApp service. Indian regulators have &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/01/21/india-likely-to-force-facebook-whatsapp-to-identify-the-originator-of-messages/"&gt;previously asked WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt; to identify the sources of anonymous rumors that have sparked violence, but WhatsApp has argued this would compromise its end-to-end encryption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="atree3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Messaging services would have to identify the “first originator” of a message&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oqte4K"&gt;The framework also indicates that MEITY can regulate digital media services, including video streaming platforms, and require digital news services to follow the official “norms of journalistic conduct” observed by traditional media outlets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3Lq8g"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-whatsapp-and-twitter-face-new-rules-in-india-11614250424?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;As reported by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, MEITY head Ravi Shankar Prasad said the rules were meant to make social media companies “more responsible and more accountable” for content on their platforms. American social media companies have struggled to navigate problems with violence, hate speech, and political conflict in India. Facebook’s local policy chief Ankhi Das &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536149/ankhi-das-facebook-india-resigned-quit-bjp-hindu-muslim-conflict"&gt;resigned last year&lt;/a&gt; under pressure from activists, and earlier this month, Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276479/twitter-free-speech-india-protests-government-block-orders"&gt;clashed with MEITY&lt;/a&gt; over an order to block activists who criticized India’s government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NmkFzX"&gt;India has tightened its overall regulation of foreign web companies over the past year. In June 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/world/asia/tik-tok-banned-india-china.html"&gt;it banned TikTok&lt;/a&gt; and other Chinese social apps, citing a threat to “national sovereignty.” TikTok reduced its staff in India last month, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262940/tiktok-leaves-india-ban-app-china-government-security-privacy"&gt;move characterized as&lt;/a&gt; “essentially withdrawing” from the country.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Music is now available on Google TV and Android TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tEm_Rx2NX7y3F1DiST03L85LKY8=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873307/amazon_music_android_tv.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pei3Ud"&gt;Amazon Music is finally coming to Google’s set-top box operating systems, with a new app rolling out for Google TV (currently just available on the latest Chromecast) and Android TV starting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOyfjS"&gt;The app will function similarly to Amazon Music on other devices. Subscribers to Amazon Music Unlimited (which costs $7.99 per month for Prime members or $9.99 per month) will be able to access the full music library, similar to Spotify or Apple Music. Regular Prime Members will get access to a curated list of songs and playlists, while users without any subscriptions will get access to Amazon Music’s ad-supported options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wF0zw4"&gt;It’s by no means the first music app on Google’s hardware — in addition to Google’s own offerings, services like Spotify and Tidal also have apps there — but it’s a useful option for anyone subscribing to Amazon’s service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIhMgy"&gt;The rollout of Amazon Music on Google’s smart TV hardware is particularly notable given that Amazon and Google had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16738748/google-amazon-feud-youtube-pulled-off-fire-tv-echo-show-nest-devices"&gt;previously spent years&lt;/a&gt;, back in 2017 and 2018, feuding over content services for their products. That fight resulted in things like Amazon pulling Prime Video from Google devices and Google pulling YouTube from Amazon hardware. The two companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20686773/youtube-fire-tv-prime-video-chromecast-amazon-google-launch-today-available"&gt;had mostly made up by 2019&lt;/a&gt;, though, when YouTube and Prime Video apps returned to Amazon and Google’s hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bu6DFa"&gt;Still, the fact that Google is willing to tolerate a direct competition like Amazon Music (which faces squarely up against YouTube Music) is a good sign that the companies have turned over a new leaf. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwOb7k"&gt;The new Amazon Music app is available today in the US, UK, Canada, Brazil, Mexico, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, India, Japan, and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Framework Laptop is an upgradable, customizable 13-inch notebook coming this spring</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Framework Laptop angled slightly to the right, seen from above. The screen displays mountains and a valley. On either side are a number of modules." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ZsuGqqQPDJ2pGwpxehX2CQXD-0=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873261/studio_image_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Framework&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fTYY5u"&gt;A San Francisco-based startup called &lt;a href="https://frame.work/"&gt;Framework&lt;/a&gt; has just launched an ambitious project: a thin, lightweight productivity laptop that it claims can be “upgraded, customized, and repaired in ways that no other notebook can.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W5g2L1"&gt;Framework founder Nirav Patel told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company aims to address his long-standing frustrations with consumer technology companies. Patel was one of the original Oculus employees and has worked for Apple as well. During that time, he says he “saw an industry that felt incredibly broken across the board.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cyx41p"&gt;“As a consumer electronics company, your business model effectively depends on churning out constant tons of hardware and pushing it into channels, and into market, and into consumers’ hands, and then sort of dropping it and letting it exist out there,” Patel explains. “It encourages waste and inefficiency, and ultimately environmental damage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7vfwb"&gt;To that end, Patel sees the Framework Laptop as more than a product — he sees it as an ecosystem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MdVfGc"&gt;The Framework comes with a 13.5-inch 2256 x 1504 screen, a 1080p 60fps webcam, a 57Wh battery, and a 2.87-pound aluminum chassis. Inside, you’ll get 11th Gen Intel processors, up to 64GB of DDR4 memory, and “4TB or more” of Gen4 NVMe storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HzOWjz"&gt;As is the case with all kinds of consumer laptops, buyers can swap out and upgrade various internal parts of the Framework, including the RAM, battery, and storage. The company is trying to bring three additional benefits to the table. The first is that you can also customize and upgrade external components of the chassis, including the keyboard, screen, bezels (which are magnetically attached), and ports (via an expansion card system). If you’re someone who hates dongles and docks, you can select four ports from an assortment that includes the usual suspects (USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, DisplayPort, microSD, etc). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Kh1In"&gt;The second is that Framework will be selling its own modules in a centralized online marketplace, which is also open to third-party sellers and resellers. The idea is that if your screen cracks or you feel like changing your bezels, you can hop onto Framework’s site to find replacements that are custom-made for your laptop rather than having to search around. Framework’s components are printed with QR codes that, when scanned, will bring you straight to a purchase page for their upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkPQlE"&gt;The third is that in addition to a pre-built Framework system, you can purchase a “DIY” kit of your selected parts, which you can then use to assemble the laptop yourself. The DIY Edition provides some operating system flexibility: you can install “your preferred Linux distribution” on it or your pick of Windows 10 Home or Windows 10 Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user disassembles a Framework Laptop." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WC53_XOuvk6Qm97MKZpxl0U9e58=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327064/lifestyle_image_12.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Framework&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="743HPU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I saw an industry that felt incredibly broken across the board.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VlHBeM"&gt;It’s a cogent plan, to be sure. But Framework won’t be able to achieve its upgradable, sustainable future just by announcing an ecosystem — it has to actually create an ecosystem that will last. And whether Framework will continue to manufacture modules for this specific laptop model far into the future, or whether third-party partners will pick up the slack, is certainly a question mark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b6wMQC"&gt;If you’re any kind of PC enthusiast, you probably know that Framework is far from the first company to try a scheme like this. Intel has given modular computers a shot in the past, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/28/18643379/intel-nuc-compute-element-announcement-modular-upgrade-kiosk-laptop"&gt;to little result&lt;/a&gt; — its Compute Card was a commercial failure, and its modular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21051879/intel-pc-nuc-9-extreme-ghost-canyon-element-hands-on-teardown-ces-2020"&gt;Ghost Canyon NUC&lt;/a&gt; (which had hardware partners on board at launch) still has yet to receive any new components. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256845/alienware-area-51m-r1-r2-specs-upgradable-parts-gpu-dgff-limited"&gt;Alienware’s original Area-51m&lt;/a&gt; also never received its promised future-proof upgradable parts. Phone makers have tried modular devices as well: Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12775922/google-project-ara-modular-phone-suspended-confirm"&gt;Project Ara&lt;/a&gt; smartphone, composed of Lego-style bricks that users could rearrange and swap in and out, didn’t go anywhere. The reality is that hardware is hard to build and modular hardware is even more challenging. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Framework Laptop closed, seen from above. On both sides are various modules." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8NDC2V5K1M7ZOzbpEdUuZhIv4vs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327217/studio_image_02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Framework&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sR9zxA"&gt;Patel, for his part, believes those OEMs weren’t committed enough. “Other companies, they put it out there, and someone internally decided, ‘Eh, we’re going to focus on something else this year,’ and shut down the project,” says Patel. “This is not something we’re dabbling in. It’s not a side project for us that someone thought was interesting. This is the core of our company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kxzEg7"&gt;“We are releasing new modules, and upgrades, and accessories, and so on to drive the health of the ecosystem, and we’re going to continue doing that for as long as customers want us to,” Patel adds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbQfdE"&gt;Framework will be taking preorders this spring, and the device is expected to ship this summer. Pricing hasn’t yet been announced, though Patel says it will be “comparable to other well-reviewed notebooks.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zack Snyder’s Army of the Dead is a big Vegas heist movie coming to Netflix — with zombies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iz0nKUDsP0gPnmg8bswY-QaHqv4=/0x20:3000x2020/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873204/AOTD_081519_20780R5_20__20CC_20__20V2_f.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;CLAY ENOS/NETFLIX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8HIzxL"&gt;Netflix’s next big-budget action movie is almost here: &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; from director Zack Snyder sees a squad of mercenaries battling their way into Las Vegas to pull off a massive heist. The catch is it’s set after a zombie apocalypse has ravaged the city, so instead of the usual Vegas barriers of casino security and mob bosses, the crew will have to fight through hordes of the ravenous undead to try to get the score of a lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ENAji"&gt;The first trailer for &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t show off much, but we do know that Dave Bautista (&lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;) will be leading the the show. Snyder, of course, is no stranger to big action films and zombie movies, in particular, having directed the 2004 remake of &lt;em&gt;Dawn of the Dead &lt;/em&gt;(as well as his long list of superhero blockbusters like &lt;em&gt;Man of Steel&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sRpzjFXze5XZTqw2ixBHIl2HA4w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328060/AOTD_081519_20780R5_20__20CC_20__20V2_f.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Clay Enos / Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OyMmy2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt;, however, is a particularly notable film for Snyder, given that it’s just the second wholly original story for the director — and his first in over a decade since 2011’s &lt;em&gt;Sucker Punch&lt;/em&gt; was released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHBcYf"&gt;Netflix is also betting big on &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; kicking off a new franchise for the streaming site: in addition to the main film from Snyder, the company also is producing &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead: The Prequel&lt;/em&gt;, a German-American co-production directed and starring Matthias Schweighöfer (who’ll also appear in Snyder’s film.) There’s also an anime-style TV series planned, &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead: Lost Vegas&lt;/em&gt;, which will see several of the characters from the main film reprise their roles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfXafK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; will debut on Netflix on May 21st.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Listen to Post Malone cover Hootie &amp; the Blowfish for Pokémon’s 25th anniversary</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GVQY8CH5_FkpyldUdIlTkSaTYS4=/0x51:960x691/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873199/Post_Malone_x_Pokemon_Publicity_Photo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1eL7JI"&gt;On Saturday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278179/post-malone-pokemon-concert-25th-anniversary"&gt;Post Malone will hold a virtual concert&lt;/a&gt; to celebrate &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297819/pokemon-25th-anniversary-nintendo-game-boy-pikachu"&gt;the 25th anniversary of the &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; franchise&lt;/a&gt;. If that combination wasn’t strange enough, today, he revealed one of the songs he’ll be performing: a cover of Hootie &amp;amp; the Blowfish’s mid-’90s hit “Only Wanna Be With You.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zi8rVr"&gt;I’m not entirely sure how much crossover there is between Post, Hootie, and &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; fans, but the song is definitely a real thing. You can listen to the cover in the video above, and The Pokémon Company says “the song will be included as part of Post’s headlining appearance” at the virtual concert, which will be airing on February 27th at 7PM ET. You can watch the live stream on both Twitch and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOXpBQ"&gt;Elsewhere, it also looks like we may be getting some big news from the franchise. On February 26th at 10AM ET, The Pokémon Company will host an event on its &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/pokemon"&gt;YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;, which promises “approximately 20 minutes of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; news.”&lt;/p&gt;
