    <title>Netflix testing a timer feature on Android devices that stops streaming after set period</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qc-okPZkxtQnZ01kWKZcBpFV2r4=/0x2:3600x2402/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68740484/BRIDGERTON_102_Unit_02026R.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;LIAM DANIEL/NETFLIX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UDkb88"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/netflix"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; is launching a global test today on Android devices that will allow subscribers to set a timer for their viewing period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YOB8Bp"&gt;The new feature lets people choose between four timer settings: 15 minutes, 30 minutes, 45 minutes, or end of whatever people are watching. After the episode or film ends, the Netflix app will stop. This should, in theory, help conserve battery life on Android devices while also ensuring that episodes don’t continue to auto-play. (Fall asleep to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252580/bridgerton-netflix-82-million-households-biggest-show-ever-caveats"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bridgerton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;without worrying about where you left off!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BX3K7G"&gt;Although the test is limited to Android devices right now, Netflix will explore bringing it to other devices, including TV sets and desktops, depending on how widely the product is adapted and if subscribers seem to like it, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fQr1k66GgI-A8AJGE9TRwuqiMVA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268248/Netflix_Timer__1_.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FoO5R0"&gt;To use the feature, follow the below directions: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="8YaPLZ"&gt;Choose and play your favorite TV show or movie on your mobile device.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5h4RkT"&gt;In the upper right corner, subscribers will see a clock icon that is labeled Timer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7UX880"&gt;Tap on Timer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Vuxa81"&gt;Select 15, 30, 45 minutes, or “Finish Show.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="9ORHkH"&gt;As of right now, the feature is only available on adult profiles. Although it seems like a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163863/netflix-family-profile-kids-activity-report-data-movies-tv-shows-individual"&gt;perfect feature for kids&lt;/a&gt;, especially where screentime is concerned, the company is trying to make the feature more applicable for account profiles designed for children. Instead of simply tapping a clock icon and setting the timer, it needs to be a little more difficult because kids tend to tap on screens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PcYVH5"&gt;I personally like to think of it as a sleep tool. If you’re someone like me, who falls asleep watching Netflix or Disney Plus or whatever it may be on their phone, having it turn off when an episode ends is a pretty good feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vj77Nw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can watch the Snyder Cut while snacking on a $130 Justice League-themed meal kit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4fblMsLljXRnXfpg8nayqjyIiuk=/0x2:4096x2733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68740292/EsqigqvXYAE3PQu.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/Wldathome/status/1354073688606470144" target="_blank"&gt;Wonderland / Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8AES2e"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League&lt;/em&gt; — known to fans as the mythical “Snyder Cut” — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255990/justice-league-snyder-cut-hbo-max-release-date"&gt;hits HBO Max on March 18th&lt;/a&gt;, and Warner Bros. is celebrating the at-home blockbuster relaunch in a unique way: with customized, themed $130 Snyder Cut meal boxes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pm4UVk"&gt;Described as “a first-of-its-kind, immersive, at-home dining experience” for customers in the US and the UK, Warner Bros. is teaming up with Wonderland Restaurants (a self-described “creative &amp;amp; innovation studio for the food and beverage industry”) to create the kits. Wonderland Restaurants is also currently working on &lt;a href="https://parkrowlondon.co.uk/"&gt;Park Row&lt;/a&gt;, an upcoming high-end DC Comics-themed restaurant in London that was &lt;a href="https://london.eater.com/2019/2/21/18234407/park-row-new-comic-book-restaurant-london-batman-dc-universe-wonderland-fat-duck-alinea"&gt;announced in early 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1uXco"&gt;The meal kits are designed to resemble the film’s &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacGuffin"&gt;MacGuffin&lt;/a&gt;-y Mother Boxes and cost $130 for a kit for two or $260 for four (shipping and taxes not included). Inside will be a variety of Justice League-adjacent food: the “Ocean Trench” appetizer for Aquaman, consisting of “Icelandic cod and chips with trench dressing” and the “Big Belly Burger” for the Flash, alluding to the &lt;a href="https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Big_Belly_Burger"&gt;fictional DC universe burger joint&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2xXCa"&gt;Other menu items that have yet to be revealed include the Superman and cornfield-inspired “Resurrection,” the Wonder Woman-themed “Ancient Themysciran Fire,” and the more mundane “Snack and Extras.” Also included are &lt;a href="https://arkhamcity.fandom.com/wiki/Koul-Brau_Breweries"&gt;Koul-Brau beers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Jitters"&gt;Jitters cold brew&lt;/a&gt;, which both also allude to in-universe DC brands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZM4fXK"&gt;Like any meal kit, some of the items in the Mother Box will be preprepared; others, like the hamburger and fish courses, will need to be cooked at home. Vegetarian options are also available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZD4ieb"&gt;Wonderland says that the Snyder Cut box is intended to just be the start of its immersive boxed meal partnership with Warner Bros., with the company promising that “further boxed dining experiences are planned for 2021 featuring more of the most popular and beloved Warner Bros. franchises.” Given the studio’s plans to release all of its theatrical films day-and-date on HBO Max, it’s possible that the Wonderland could be planning future boxes to tie into those titles much like it is for the Snyder Cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAHFVc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tweaking COVID-19 vaccines will keep them effective against new variants  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="INDIA-HEALTH-VIRUS-SERUM-VACCINE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YajFUa66W0HzQufitoc4M2B5VbE=/4x0:4659x3103/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68739955/1230726557.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by PUNIT PARANJPE/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i0PG7i"&gt;Since the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, experts have cautioned that the first batch of vaccines created against the virus might not be the last. Like all viruses, this one &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/04/16/opinion/coronavirus-mutations-vaccine-covid.html"&gt;would mutate&lt;/a&gt;, and eventually, those mutations could make the virus different enough that a different vaccine would be needed to combat it. Only two months into the vaccination campaign, researchers are preparing for that inevitability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57k2pR"&gt;There’s early evidence from South Africa that both the &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/28/novavax-says-its-covid-19-vaccine-is-90-effective-but-far-less-so-against-one-variant/"&gt;Novavax&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255968/johnson-and-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-single-shot-coronavirus"&gt;Johnson and Johnson&lt;/a&gt; vaccine candidates are not as effective against a variant form of the virus first identified in the country, called B.1.351. The shots still offer some defense and still protect against hospitalization and death. Preliminary research indicates that the COVID-19 vaccines already authorized in the United States, made by Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech, will also still block this variant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94C77m"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/28/south-carolina-first-cases-of-south-africa-variant/"&gt;first known&lt;/a&gt; cases of infection with this strain were reported in the US this week. And even though its vaccine does appear to be partially effective against the variant, pharmaceutical company Moderna announced this week that it’s starting work on another version of its COVID-19 vaccine. It’ll be more specifically targeted at B.1.351. It’s a good move based on what researchers know so far, says Dylan Morris, who studies viral evolution at the University of California, Los Angeles. “I’d say that it’s prudent, rather than an emergency,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zg382T"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Many assumed Covid mutations would partially escape vaccines. In vitro evidence already suggested that. What we now see is that the vaccines may still afford measurable, albeit reduced protection. We now need regulatory process to allow efficient updating to reflect new variants.&lt;/p&gt;— Scott Gottlieb, MD (@ScottGottliebMD) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1355148509037682691?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tKMl1n"&gt;Blood drawn from people vaccinated with the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine had antibodies that blocked the B.1.351 virus, new research showed. However, it took around &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/25/moderna-vaccine-less-effective-variant/"&gt;six times more&lt;/a&gt; of them to block this strain than the predominant form of the virus that the vaccine was designed against. Pfizer and BioNTech’s COVID-19 vaccine &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-works-against-mutations-found-in-u-k-south-africa-variants-lab-study-finds-11611802559?mod=e2tw"&gt;also produces antibodies&lt;/a&gt; that block viruses with mutations found on the B.1.351, although it takes slightly more of them as well, preliminary research showed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sYxG44"&gt;Both the authorized vaccines produce sky-high levels of antibodies to begin with, so there’s some room for a slight drop-off in potency. That high starting point means there’s more of a cushion against changes in the virus, Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/21/dr-fauci-says-covid-vaccines-appear-to-be-less-effective-against-some-new-strains.html"&gt;said in a press briefing&lt;/a&gt; last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3Khpt"&gt;One of the reasons that Moderna might still want to update their vaccine is to maintain those impressive levels of antibodies, says Stephen Goldstein, who studies evolutionary virology at the University of Utah. An additional shot designed to target the new variant could theoretically boost the body’s antibody response, even against a more formidable foe. “We’re in good shape for at least like the next few months with these new variants, but we would maybe like to get back up to those really, really high levels of neutralizing antibodies that is the standout feature of these vaccines,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="FolUk8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;scientists still don’t know what antibody levels someone needs to generate in order to be protected from COVID-19&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u53K9E"&gt;Part of the uncertainty comes because scientists still don’t know what antibody levels someone needs to generate in order to be protected from COVID-19. “We can’t just do an experiment in a lab and say that it’s time to update the vaccine,” Goldstein says. “There’s a little bit of guesswork involved.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1eKgW"&gt;There are a few different ways for researchers to take some of the guesswork out of the equation. &lt;a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/84288/WHO_IVB_13.01_eng.pdf"&gt;Scientists could &lt;/a&gt;measure the antibody levels of people who were vaccinated but still got sick with COVID-19, and identify the cutoff where the vaccine wasn’t protective. They &lt;a href="https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/84288/WHO_IVB_13.01_eng.pdf"&gt;could&lt;/a&gt; also compare the efficacy of a new vaccine that generates a high antibody response with an older version of that vaccine with lower potency. Animal models may work, too. In December, a team looked into the relationship between protection and antibody numbers &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fs41586-020-03041-6&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F29%2F22255198%2Fcovid-vaccine-variant-update-mutation-south-africa-moderna#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in monkeys&lt;/a&gt;, finding that relatively low levels blocked the virus. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A researcher in California checks if a coronavirus sample is one of the concerning variants.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="v2rkbx"&gt;“People are working to measure this, and try to get a better picture of what the things that are easy for us to measure — like antibodies — tell us about the thing we’re most interested in, which is how well can you be protected against disease,” Morris says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T3d0PW"&gt;Scientists already have that information about more well-known viruses, &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3859764/"&gt;like influenza&lt;/a&gt;. Researchers and regulators know what levels of antibodies the flu vaccine needs to generate in order to provide enough protection against the flu. They don’t need to run a full-blown clinical trial to test how effective a new flu shot is — instead, the Food and Drug Administration will approve new flu vaccines based on the &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4947948/"&gt;antibody response&lt;/a&gt; they generate in a trial in a small group of people. Once a flu vaccine meets that threshold and is approved, that company &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4947948/"&gt;can modify it&lt;/a&gt; against each new seasonal flu strain without having to collect new clinical data. Ideally, researchers will eventually be able to do something similar for COVID-19 vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mCBbZ"&gt;It could be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dvergano/status/1354486593642496000"&gt;a few months&lt;/a&gt; before we have a good grasp on the amount of immune response that corresponds with protection from COVID-19. When they do, the FDA &lt;a href="https://pink.pharmaintelligence.informa.com/PS143669/COVID-Mutants-Vaccine-Changes-Likely-To-Need-Immunogenicity-Studies-Not-Big-Efficacy-Trials"&gt;might sign off&lt;/a&gt; on updated or booster vaccines based on data showing that a new version can push the body to generate that level of immune response, rather than ask that companies go through clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LcnNHR"&gt;“FDA has already given thought to developing a potential pathway, should changes need to be made to authorized COVID-19 vaccines or other products based on information on emerging variants,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrWoodcockFDA/status/1353857674526543872"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="opgIBr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;FDA has already given thought to developing a potential pathway, should changes need to be made to authorized COVID-19 vaccines or other products based on information on emerging variants.  We are committed to having a public and transparent process around our path forward.&lt;/p&gt;— Dr. Janet Woodcock (@DrWoodcockFDA) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DrWoodcockFDA/status/1353857674526543872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 26, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EOV7ro"&gt;The decision to push out any booster shots and adjusted vaccines should also take into account how much of a new form of the virus is circulating in a given area, Goldstein says. Right now, there are only two confirmed cases of people in the United States infected with the B.1.351 virus strain, though there could be others that haven’t been identified. “It’s still quite rare outside of South Africa, so we don’t want to be vaccinating people in the US against the strain that’s not present in the US,” Goldstein says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f4XnUy"&gt;Eventually, it might become more widespread, and it might make sense to give people that additional protection. That’s why it’s encouraging that Moderna is preparing the boosters now. “We want to be prepared in case that virus becomes more prevalent,” Goldstein says. Other strains of the coronavirus that are more able to evade existing vaccines could also emerge in the future. “I think that it will be really good to get the technological and regulatory side of things lined up ahead of time, for if and when we need to roll out a vaccine update,” Morris says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gygqjU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>University will stop using controversial remote-testing software following student outcry</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The new challenges facing college athletes on campus including legal and ethical questions about COVID-19 guidelines" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xWZMPSERHdYLobfzgJMQumYpxHM=/0x66:2000x1399/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68737762/1223311899.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Students head to class at the University of Illinois in Urbana-Champaign. | E. Jason Wambsgans/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UEgGHl"&gt;The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign &lt;a href="https://emails.illinois.edu/newsletter/1970177238.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it will discontinue its use of remote-proctoring software Proctorio after its summer 2021 term. The decision follows almost a year of outcry over the service, both on UIUC’s campus and around the US, citing concerns with privacy, discrimination, and accessibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JGBLzk"&gt;Proctorio is one of the most prominent software platforms that colleges and universities use to watch for cheating on remote tests. It uses what its website describes as “machine learning and advanced facial detection technologies” to record students through their webcams while they work on their exams and monitor the position of their heads. The software flags “suspicious signs” to professors, who can review its recordings. The platform also enables professors to track the websites students visit during their exams, and bar them from functions like copy / pasting and printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KB23V"&gt;Though Proctorio and similar services have been around for years, their use exploded in early 2020 when COVID-19 drove schools around the US to move a bulk of their instruction online. So, too, has scrutiny towards their practices. Students and instructors at universities around the country have &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/students-are-pushing-back-against-proctoring-surveillance-apps"&gt;spoken out&lt;/a&gt; against the widespread use of the software, claiming that it causes unnecessary anxiety, violates privacy, and has the potential to discriminate against marginalized students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWTjeK"&gt;In an email to instructors, ADA coordinator Allison Kushner and Vice Provost Kevin Pitts wrote that professors who continue to use Proctorio through the summer 2021 term are “expected to accommodate students that raise accessibility issues,” and that the campus is “investigating longer-term remote proctoring options.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="TRO48O"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The service “was never considered to be a long-term campus proctoring solution.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GLEdHm"&gt;Proctorio has been controversial on UIUC’s campus since the service was introduced &lt;a href="https://dailyillini.com/news/2020/04/17/proctorio-concerns/"&gt;last spring&lt;/a&gt;, and concerned students only grew more vocal through the fall 2020 semester. (Due to COVID-19, the school now operates with a hybrid of online and in-person instruction.) Over 1,000 people signed a &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/uiuc-stop-proctoring-exams-through-proctorio-proctoru?redirect=false"&gt;petition&lt;/a&gt; calling on the university to stop using the service. “Proctorio is not only inefficient, it is also unsafe and a complete violation of a student’s privacy,” reads the petition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xWp9y"&gt;UIUC is one of &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/09/students-are-pushing-back-against-proctoring-surveillance-apps"&gt;many campuses&lt;/a&gt; where remote proctoring has faced backlash. A &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/miami-university-end-proctorio-use-at-miami-university"&gt;Miami University petition&lt;/a&gt;, which gathered over 500 signatures, declared that “Proctorio’s design invades student rights, is inherently ableist and discriminatory, and is inconsistent with peer reviewed research.” Over 3,500 signatories have called on the &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/university-of-regina-administration-call-on-the-university-of-regina-to-remove-proctortrack?redirect=false"&gt;University of Regina&lt;/a&gt; to end its use of ProctorTrack, another automated proctoring service. A 1,200-signature petition urges the &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/university-of-central-florida-ask-ucf-to-stop-using-honor-lock-which-is-a-severe-invasion-of-privacy"&gt;University of Central Florida&lt;/a&gt; to dump Honorlock, another similar software, declaring that “students should not be forced to sign away their privacy and rights in order to take a test.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5cVtd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526792/proctorio-online-test-proctoring-lawsuit-universities-students-coronavirus"&gt;Professors and staff&lt;/a&gt; have criticized the service as well. The Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166023/epic-proctorio-examity-privacy-online-testing-school-lawsuit-proctoring"&gt;filed a complaint&lt;/a&gt; against Proctorio (alongside four other test-proctoring services), claiming that the services’ collection of personal information amounts to “unfair and deceptive trade practices.” Even US senators have gotten involved; a coalition including Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA), and Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ) sent an &lt;a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/newsroom/press/release/blumenthal-leads-call-for-virtual-exam-software-companies-to-improve-equity-accessibility-and-privacy-for-students-amid-troubling-reports"&gt;open letter&lt;/a&gt; to Proctorio and two similar services in December citing a number of concerns about their business practices. “Students have run head on into the shortcomings of these technologies—shortcomings that fall heavily on vulnerable communities and perpetuate discriminatory biases,” wrote the senators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GDJ1qj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Proctorio is not only inefficient, it is also unsafe and a complete violation of a student’s privacy”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QSdsqZ"&gt;The complaints largely revolve around security and privacy — Proctorio’s recordings give instructors and the service access to some of test-takers’ browsing data, and a glimpse of their private homes in some cases. (Proctorio stated in its &lt;a href="https://epic.org/privacy/dccppa/online-test-proctoring/Proctorio-senate-response-010721.pdf"&gt;response&lt;/a&gt; to the Senators’ letter that “test-taker data is secured and processed through multiple layers of encryption” and that Proctorio retains its recordings “for the minimum amount of time required by either our customer or by applicable law.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OP15AB"&gt;Accessibility is another common concern. Students have reported not having access to a webcam at home, or enough bandwidth to accommodate the service; one test-taker told &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21526792/proctorio-online-test-proctoring-lawsuit-universities-students-coronavirus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that she had to take her first chemistry test in a Starbucks parking lot last semester. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rEzh4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/style/testing-schools-proctorio.html"&gt;Students have also reported&lt;/a&gt; that services like Proctorio have difficulty identifying test-takers with darker skin tones, and may disproportionately flag students with certain disabilities. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215727/examsoft-online-exams-testing-facial-recognition-report"&gt;Research has found&lt;/a&gt; that even the best facial-recognition algorithms make more errors in identifying Black faces than they do identifying white ones. Proctorio stated in its response that “We believe all of these cases were due to issues relating to lighting, webcam position, or webcam quality, not race.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="xv21w0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Instructors utilizing Proctorio should inform students that they are aware of the challenges that Proctorio presents”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sBBJj4"&gt;“We take these concerns seriously,” reads UIUC’s email, citing student complaints related to “accessibility, privacy, data security and equity” as factors in its decision. It recommends that students for whom Proctorio presents a barrier to test-taking “make alternative arrangements” as the program is phased out, and indicates that accessibility will be considered in the selection of the next remote-proctoring solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vG4j4n"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, UIUC Associate Chancellor Robin Kaler said “ We had secured a short-duration license for Proctorio usage in March 2020 under an emergency procurement action permitted by the State of Illinois in direct response to COVID. We sent a message notifying instructors that they will not have it as a tool beyond the duration of the short-term procurement. We are investigating remote proctoring tools for longer term usage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1A8G9C"&gt;We’ve reached out to Proctorio for comment, and will update this story if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JDzTtu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 10:27AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added UIUC statement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The ‘Snyder Cut’ of Justice League is coming to HBO Max on March 18th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/24z3zEtRSO9NmEaYZcR1XGah6-I=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68739550/unnamed.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PPJvXN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League&lt;/em&gt; (aka “The Snyder Cut”) will hit &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeSubscriberGoal012721&amp;amp;source=Verge"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; on March 18th, the director &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZackSnyder/status/1355152770408476677?s=20"&gt;announced on Twitter today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k4kcQr"&gt;The original theatrical release of &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt; debuted in November 2017 and, ahead of its release, endured a difficult production. Most notably, director Joss Whedon stepped in to finish the film during post-production after Snyder stepped away from the project for &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/zack-snyder-steps-down-justice-league-deal-family-tragedy-1006455?utm_source=twitter"&gt;personal reasons&lt;/a&gt;. After &lt;em&gt;Justice League&lt;/em&gt; was released, fans criticized Whedon’s contributions to the film, which included a lighter tone. Fans started an internet campaign for Warner Bros. to &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/10/16873696/justice-league-zack-snyder-directors-cut-conspiracy-theory"&gt;“Release the Snyder Cut”&lt;/a&gt; in the years since. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lvhb7N"&gt;Warner Bros. previously announced in May that the long-rumored extended cut was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21263044/justice-league-snyder-cut-warnermedia-hbo-max-zack-ben-affleck-henry-cavill-gal-gaot-streaming"&gt;getting an official release&lt;/a&gt; but as an exclusive on WarnerMedia’s new streaming service, HBO Max. With a firm release date for &lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League &lt;/em&gt;finally set, the film is launching at a competitive time for superhero media as it will release one day before the debut of Marvel Studios’ newest miniseries, &lt;a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/exclusive-first-look-falcon-winter-soldier-disney-plus-march-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which will stream exclusively on &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/977661/9358?sharedid=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POMyoa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zack Snyder’s Justice League&lt;/em&gt; isn’t the only new film arriving on HBO Max this year. In December, Warner Bros. announced that every single one of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;films in 2021 would release simultaneously&lt;/a&gt; on HBO Max the same day they premiered in movie theaters. AT&amp;amp;T now credits the decision for helping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252069/hbo-max-subscribers-wonder-woman-1984-att-earnings"&gt;boost HBO Max subscriber numbers&lt;/a&gt; in its latest earnings report. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Johnson and Johnson says single-shot COVID-19 vaccine is 66 percent effective </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="HEALTH-VIRUS-US-JOHNSON &amp;amp;amp; JOHNSON" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A0N7JaM4AcwJw0j2gFTN7fU1d28=/0x0:5497x3665/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68739492/1229653990.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by JUSTIN TALLIS/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4xMBQC"&gt;A single shot of the Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccine can prevent 85 percent of severe cases of the disease, the company &lt;a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-single-shot-janssen-covid-19-vaccine-candidate-met-primary-endpoints-in-interim-analysis-of-its-phase-3-ensemble-trial"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, it is 66 percent effective against both moderate and severe cases of disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQFwzA"&gt;“We’re 85 perfect effective at preventing severe disease, which we define as disease that makes you feel particularly sick at home, or may go to the hospital, or worse,” Mathai Mammen, global head of research and development at Johnson and Johnson, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/29/health/johnson-coronavirus-vaccine-results/index.html"&gt;told CNN&lt;/a&gt;. The company plans to file for emergency authorization next week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cT0gi0"&gt;The efficacy is lower than that of the two COVID-19 vaccines already authorized for use in the United States, which prevent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569345/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-efficacy-announcement"&gt;about 95&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573072/pfizer-vaccine-effective-authorization-fda-safe"&gt;percent&lt;/a&gt; of symptomatic cases of COVID-19. Those vaccines each require two doses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="95YptH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T8KDdx"&gt;Johnson and Johnson ran its trial in the United States, Latin America, and South Africa. In the United States, the vaccine was 72 percent effective against moderate and severe COVID-19. But in South Africa, where a variant form of the coronavirus is widely circulating, the vaccine was 57 percent effective. Experts have been concerned that the variant, called B.1.351, is different enough from the original virus that vaccines created against the original might not work as well against it. This week, the pharmaceutical company Novavax also announced that its vaccine was &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/28/novavax-says-its-covid-19-vaccine-is-90-effective-but-far-less-so-against-one-variant/"&gt;less effective&lt;/a&gt; against B.1.351 than against other forms of the virus. The first cases of the variant in the US were identified this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7i5IKl"&gt;Still, the data from the Johnson and Johnson trial meets early benchmarks that the Food and Drug Administration set for a COVID-19 vaccine — the agency said last June that it would sign off on vaccines as long as they were at least &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/139638/download"&gt;50 percent effective&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZdeaU"&gt;The Johnson and Johnson vaccine is made by inserting the gene from a snippet of the coronavirus into a harmless, weakened form of an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21266897/coronavirus-vaccine-development-strategies-pros-cons"&gt;adenovirus&lt;/a&gt;, which usually causes symptoms like pink eye or diarrhea. Then, the body produces copies of that virus snippet, and develops antibodies against it. It’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21266897/coronavirus-vaccine-development-strategies-pros-cons"&gt;different strategy&lt;/a&gt; than used by Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna, which insert the genetic snippet &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/health/pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine.html"&gt;into an oily bubble instead&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVhVgH"&gt;Even though the vaccine does not appear to work as well as the Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna vaccines, experts say it could still be useful in the fight against COVID-19, particularly while supplies of the more effective vaccines are still limited. The Johnson and Johnson vaccine offers less of a logistical challenge than the other two, which have to be stored at ultra-cold temperatures and require two shots. This vaccine only takes one shot and can be stored in regular refrigerators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wnCk7"&gt;Paul Offit, a vaccine expert at the University of Pennsylvania, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/29/health/johnson-coronavirus-vaccine-results/index.html"&gt;told CNN&lt;/a&gt; that he would take a Johnson and Johnson vaccine if it was available before he could get access to either the Pfizer / BioNTech or Moderna shot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVAbWV"&gt;The company is also testing a two-shot regime of it’s vaccine, which might bump up its efficacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t11J6q"&gt;Johnson and Johnson received funding to develop its vaccine from the US as part of &lt;a href="https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/08/05/hhs-dod-collaborate-with-johnson-and-johnson-to-produce-millions-of-covid-19-investigational-vaccine-doses.html"&gt;Operation Warp Speed&lt;/a&gt; and has an agreement to deliver &lt;a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-announces-agreement-with-u-s-government-for-100-million-doses-of-investigational-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;100 million doses&lt;/a&gt;. The company could ship about &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/j-j-covid-vaccine-supply-to-start-at-2-million-doses-gao-says?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;2 million doses&lt;/a&gt; as soon as it secures authorization from the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9NCCZp"&gt;Over &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;26 million doses&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in the US so far. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Now is the best time to play the Yakuza series (on Xbox)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/meO6rQTwzHa3Sw8Xgr6vHelli64=/110x0:1291x787/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68739394/apps_1.46310.14037151017640712.b7408538_4c5c_44fa_98d0_4a876ebf3064.e4d2a38e_d900_4ace_9bcd_7a2dd5f8b739.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JMRXJH"&gt;For almost a decade and a half, the &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; franchise was all but exclusive to Sony’s PlayStation consoles. Other than a Japan-only Wii U remaster of the first two games, every single mainline entry or spinoff was released solely on the PlayStation 2, PSP, PS3, or PS4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFIjT0"&gt;Then Microsoft came along. Along with &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; has slowly become a flagship Japanese series for Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass service. It all started under a year ago with the addition of &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 0&lt;/em&gt;, and as of this week you can play almost every mainline &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; game on Game Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCAFxk"&gt;Couple this with the fact that the next-gen version of &lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like A Dragon&lt;/em&gt; is still exclusive to Xbox Series consoles, with a PS5 version not set to arrive until March, and the improbable conclusion is clear: Xbox — including the PC branch of the ecosystem — is now the easiest and best way to get into the series.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ODsMdudxzPLlw0m_ZyaT153z4Xg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22267736/apps_1.46310.14037151017640712.b7408538_4c5c_44fa_98d0_4a876ebf3064.e4d2a38e_d900_4ace_9bcd_7a2dd5f8b739.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Gix0dm"&gt;What’s changed this week is the addition of three new mainline &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; games. Remastered versions of &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 3&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;5&lt;/em&gt; are all now on Game Pass for Xbox and PC after getting a bundled PS4 release in 2019. (You can also buy the trio for $39.99.) These games originally all came out on the PS3, meaning they wouldn’t otherwise have been playable on modern systems through backwards compatibility. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kfyfU9"&gt;These aren’t particularly impressive ports on a technical level. Like most other &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; games on the Xbox, they run at 1080p and 60fps with little apparent benefit for the more powerful Xbox consoles. But honestly, given the aging source material, that’s perfectly fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aY2SqB"&gt;What matters is that you’ll be able to play almost the entire mainline &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; series for the price of a Game Pass subscription. And I definitely think you should do that, because this series is incredibly good. There’s really nothing like the way &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; blends brutal violence, goofy comedy, and incredible pathos in the context of a crime drama action RPG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HrmvyF"&gt;Without spoiling anything, here’s how I’d recommend getting into it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Xvv0Az"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Start with &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza 0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Normally you’d want to play the first game in a series before tackling its prequel, but &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; is different. &lt;em&gt;0&lt;/em&gt; is set decades before &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt;, in bubble-era ‘80s Japan, and it’s widely considered to be one of the best in the series. It’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/19/14323874/yakuza-0-ps4-review"&gt;perfect place to start&lt;/a&gt;, and it’ll tell you all you need to know about the background for what’s to come. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AXzESW"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Next, play &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza Kiwami&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. This is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/29/16220662/yakuza-kiwami-ps4-review"&gt;a full-on remake of the original &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which was released for the PS2 in 2005. &lt;em&gt;Kiwami&lt;/em&gt; came out shortly after &lt;em&gt;0&lt;/em&gt; and is technically very similar, with a bunch of narrative callbacks to the prequel, which is why it makes sense to play &lt;em&gt;0&lt;/em&gt; first. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TgnNGd"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Up next, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza Kiwami 2&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Like &lt;em&gt;Kiwami&lt;/em&gt;, this is a remake of a PS2 game, 2006’s &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 2&lt;/em&gt;. But it moves to the PS4-era Dragon Engine, first seen in &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 6&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s a much bigger and more accomplished game than &lt;em&gt;Kiwami&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XY1oEg"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Now play &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. At this point I’m guessing you’re pretty into the series, so the prospect of three straight-up PS3 remasters won’t seem intimidating at all. I think &lt;em&gt;4&lt;/em&gt; is the best of these three games, but you’re going to want to get through all of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YlLWln"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Wait for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza 6: The Song of Life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; to come to Game Pass&lt;/strong&gt;. That won’t be too long a wait — it’s happening on March 25th. Or you could just play it on a PS4 before then. But make sure you do play it, either way, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/16/17242280/yakuza-6-song-of-life-review-ps4"&gt;because it’s wonderful&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kBEaFl"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Now it’s time for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;. Otherwise known as &lt;em&gt;Yakuza 7 &lt;/em&gt;in Japan, I actually think you could start with this one too if you really just wanted to play the newest game. It’s very different to the others, with an all-new cast and turn-based battle system, and right now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21558093/yakuza-like-a-dragon-review-xbox-series-x"&gt;it’s best on the Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;. But you will get a little more out of it if you’ve played the other games in the series, so I’d hold off if you can. It’s also not on Game Pass — you’ll have to buy it separately. And as a final warning, it’s two or three times longer than most of the other games. (But worth it!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="GmXlEC"&gt;You may also want to play &lt;em&gt;Judgment&lt;/em&gt;, which is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18744110/judgment-game-review-ps4-yakuza"&gt;pretty good spinoff&lt;/a&gt; set in the &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; Cinematic Universe, but it’s not important to the overall story and is still only on PS4. I’d slot it in after &lt;em&gt;6&lt;/em&gt; if you have the chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZPoIf"&gt;The other &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; spinoffs aren’t really worth worrying about. There’s &lt;em&gt;Kenzan&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ishin&lt;/em&gt;, two separate samurai-era games that were never localized into English. That was also the case for the PSP-exclusive &lt;em&gt;Kurohyo&lt;/em&gt; and its sequel. And while &lt;em&gt;Dead Souls&lt;/em&gt;, a PS3 zombie shooter set on the streets of Tokyo, did make it out in the West, you’re better off pretending it never happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8GN6F"&gt;I’ve been playing the &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; series from day one on the PS2, but back then I never imagined it’d get so expansive or accessible. I’d recommend these games to anyone, and the barrier to entry is so low now for anyone with an Xbox or a PC and a lot of spare time on their hands. If you haven’t gotten into the series yet, it might be the single best reason to subscribe to Game Pass.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Robinhood restricts crypto trading as Dogecoin soars 300 percent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dogecoin logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sc0PJ9qPkQa5b64rWsFPQnqx2OM=/21x0:539x345/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68739310/Dogecoin_logo.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4tTtSv"&gt;Robinhood has started restricting trading in cryptocurrencies this morning, just as the price of joke cryptocurrency Dogecoin has soared more than 300 percent in 24 hours. &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/29/robinhood-restricts-crypto-trading-as-bitcoin-dogecoin-surge.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Robinhood users started noticing instant deposits for cryptocurrencies were no longer working on Friday morning, and the company has confirmed it has put restrictions in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RFvEex"&gt;“Due to extraordinary market conditions, we’ve temporarily turned off Instant buying power for crypto,” says a Robinhood spokesperson in a statement to CNBC. “Customers can still use settled funds to buy crypto. We’ll keep monitoring market conditions and communicating with our customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K0a1PJ-0zwLYBLw_09VUqQtfaQg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22267815/RlMpjva.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dogecoin price on Friday morning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2q5Rcl"&gt;Dogecoin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/29/5665470/dogecoin-has-its-day-the-unlikely-success-of-a-joke-cryptocurrency"&gt;came to life in 2013&lt;/a&gt; off the back of a Twitter joke — a play on bitcoin and &lt;a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/31/5248762/doge-meme-rescue-dog-wow"&gt;the doge meme&lt;/a&gt;. Its price started soaring yesterday, and Dogecoin currently stands at a more than &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/price/dogecoin"&gt;$7 billion market cap&lt;/a&gt; thanks to a huge volume of transactions over the past 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SojMbQ"&gt;The market activity and restrictions over the past 24 hours have now made Dogecoin a popular meme among the r/WallStreetBets investors. Dogecoin has been consistently spammed in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22253892/discord-wallstreetbets-server-virtual-trade-floor-reddit"&gt;WallStreetBets Discord server&lt;/a&gt; over the past couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TlRaU"&gt;Bitcoin is also on the move, up nearly 20 percent over the past 24 hours. Tesla CEO Elon Musk also changed his Twitter profile to include #bitcoin and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1355068728128516101"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; “in retrospect, it was inevitable.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pgCwEKSp556jgViV-DbCf4Hf-qo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22267812/T8rYdhy.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Elon Musk’s Twitter profile now mentions bitcoin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VUnOgO"&gt;Robinhood’s latest crypto restrictions come less than a day after the company moved to restrict its users from buying or trading any of the popular &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;Reddit r/WallStreetBets stocks&lt;/a&gt;, including GameStop ($GME), AMC ($AMC), BlackBerry ($BB), Bed Bath &amp;amp; Beyond ($BBBY), Nokia ($NOK), and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GhN74y"&gt;It’s a move that has been met with widespread criticism, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store"&gt;Google was forced to salvage Robinhood’s one-star rating&lt;/a&gt; on the Google Play Store by deleting nearly 100,000 negative reviews after unhappy users review-bombed the app. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255031/robinhood-gamestop-stop-purchases-reddit-wsb-stock-market"&gt;Robinhood says &lt;/a&gt;it will now allow “limited buys” of stocks like GameStop starting Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
