    <title>TCL’s budget 20S and 20SE phones beat expectations</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Big phones with small price tags&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="QTp9Ss"&gt;If the TCL 20S and 20SE phones were on &lt;em&gt;The Price Is Right&lt;/em&gt;, you would probably guess much higher prices than their retail ones. With the 20S retailing for $250 and the 20SE going for $190, these sub-$300 4G phones are the real deal. They check all the boxes for what you’d want in a smartphone: they have big and bright screens, large 5,000mAh batteries, 128GB of internal storage, and “good enough” cameras. You even get a free clear silicone case inside each box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqCcrM"&gt;TCL certainly knows a thing or two about manufacturing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22616941/tcl-6-5-series-google-tv-price-specs"&gt;budget 4K Smart TVs&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/29/21493125/tcl-alto-soundbar-9-plus-8i-6-plus-3-bluetooth-airplay-google-assistant-dolby-atmos-surround-sound"&gt;affordable soundbars&lt;/a&gt;, and many other gadgets. Heck, it was already quietly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21120107/tcl-blackberry-ends-phone-global-rights-date-2020"&gt;producing phones for the likes of BlackBerry, Alcatel, and Palm&lt;/a&gt; before starting its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21049747/tcl-10-pro-10l-5g-phones-brand-folding-prototype-ces-2020"&gt;eponymous line in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Now it’s taking those skills building other accessibly priced gadgets to its phone line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="da4rRU"&gt;Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22560849/tcl-20-pro-5g-review-screen-battery-price-specs"&gt;the fancier TCL 20S Pro&lt;/a&gt;, neither the 20S nor the 20SE has the latest and greatest processor, nor do they support 5G networking — those aren’t unsurprising omissions at these price points. But given TCL’s history, it’s no wonder the real stars of the TCL 20S and 20SE are their brilliant displays — though they each use different panels. Both phones look and feel more luxurious than they are because of their solid build quality, as well as attention to the details users really actually care about: long-lasting battery life, strong performance, ample storage, as well as ingenious design. Who says good things can’t come in budget-friendly packages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div id="AjyYRY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10805445"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="wvub5R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10805028"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8TsFX1"&gt;The $190 20SE has a 6.82-inch display, which, at 720 pixels wide, is too low-resolution for a screen this large (720 x 1640 pixels; aspect ratio 20.5:9). I tried watching the 4K Dune trailer on YouTube, and it looked too dim and fuzzy at 720p for me to enjoy the video. Nevertheless, this display offers vibrant colors even at 50 percent brightness, whether or not you turn on the NXTVISION display optimization software (I did not see much difference either way). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qu6nF"&gt;The higher-priced 20S has a brighter yet slightly smaller 6.67-inch screen, with a higher-resolution FHD+ LCD display than the 20SE (1080 x 2400 pixels with 20:9 aspect ratio). When I watched the same Dune trailer at 1080p on the 20S, I could actually see sharper lines and more details this time around. Both displays look bright enough outdoors that I can read text if I boost the screen to 100 percent brightness. I also appreciate how unobtrusive the pinhole front camera is on the 20S compared to the 20SE’s tear-drop design, the latter of which actually cuts into the top of the display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I6H0ZSg1qQQL_QOlehzk-1_D9ow=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911279/gsin_190125_4797_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the TCL 20S and 20SE have relatively bright displays with vibrant colors, thanks to TCL’s television know-how.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ORMeyW"&gt;Of the two models, the 20S is slightly more manageable to use. But it’s still a big enough phone that I need two hands to use it safely. It can be a bit of a reach for my fingers to navigate different parts of the screen and hold it in the same hand, so I need my other hand to balance the device. At 0.23 inches (5.84mm) taller and 0.25oz (7.1g) heavier, the 20SE is physically bigger than the 20S, but its technical components are not in the same weight class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bhqb2d"&gt;With a price that is $60 less than the 20S, TCL had to find savings in the $190 20SE anywhere it could. For one thing, the 20SE uses the lower-tier Qualcomm Snapdragon 460 chipset, whose slower processing speed can’t make up ground with 4GB of RAM. The 20S, on the other hand, is powered by the faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 665 processor and is also supported by 4GB of RAM. The difference between the two isn’t very noticeable in basic texting and social media doomscrolling, but I would occasionally have to open an app or webpage twice on the 20SE because it wouldn’t load the first time around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y23HLKFT4D2eX5y-WPCxRJk6IUc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911281/gsin_190125_4797_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The TCL 20SE’s 13-megapixel front camera and tear-drop design cuts into its display, but you don’t notice it after awhile.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DaAVol"&gt;To see what these devices are capable of, I played a couple rounds of Pokemon Unite to see how they’d fare. Both TCL phones took about as long to load the game, whereas the OnePlus 9 Pro (with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 chip) loaded the same round in about half the time. Since the 20SE has a lesser quality display and processor, I was not surprised that my Pikachu moved with a bit of lag. It was only slightly more responsive on the 20S, however. The 20SE’s dual speakers are also louder and buzzier than the 20S speakers, which sounded quieter but produced a more nuanced sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTbqi4"&gt;Despite their differences, both devices offer plenty of internal storage at 128GB and give you the option to expand that storage via microSD. The 20S’ microSD slot accepts up to a 1TB card, while the 20SE only supports up to a 256GB card. Both phones run Android 11 out of the box, with a TCL skin called TCL UI. Since the 20S will get one major OS update (TCL won’t commit to the same for the 20SE) and both phones will get two years of security updates, you’ll have ample room to install these upgrades and stash your content for the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CTtJ7csyZMadmbrhuKLkxFMI55E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911285/gsin_190126_4797_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The TCL 20S’ integrated fingerprint sensor in the power button was a delight to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hbu5lC"&gt;The fingerprint sensors on the 20S and 20SE deserve a special mention as they’re quick to recognize my fingerprint and unlock the phones. I especially love the fingerprint sensor that is built into the 20S’ power button, located on the right side of the phone. With just one touch, you not only wake up your phone but also unlock it in an elegant and intuitive way. The 20SE has a more traditional round fingerprint sensor on the back of the device that works just as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6Zl0Q"&gt;Facial recognition on the 20SE can be rather useless. It either doesn’t recognize my face or asks me to touch an icon on the lock screen so that I can unlock the phone with my face, which entirely defeats the purpose of using a hands-free method to unlock. (Thankfully, you can disable this “feature.”) Facial recognition simply worked more consistently on the 20S than on the 20SE. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvglcj"&gt;Both phones include a 3.5mm audio jack on top, volume rocker on the right side, non-customizable Google Assistant button on the left, plus a USB-C port and a pair of bottom-firing dual speakers. The 20S has an understated back that looks curved from various angles, but the layer of “micron-sized prismatic crystals’’ actually makes the back cover really fingerprint-resistant. The 20SE’s back cover is the complete opposite: it’s a fingerprint disaster zone, thanks to its shiny, nano-photoetched back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KfWDPMO5nGAdmxi2MR5kDvnP_1w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911288/gsin_190126_4797_0016.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both TCL 20S and 20SE include a free clear silicone case inside each box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U2FSO2"&gt;With a 5,000mAH battery inside both phones, it was a challenge to use up that much power on deadline without doing anything out of the ordinary. My normal phone diet includes: checking my two email accounts, texting on WhatsApp and Google Hangouts, tweeting on Twitter, visiting my usual slate of websites like Reddit, as well as listening to a podcast or two. Due to the pandemic, I was home during my testing but tried to use a mix of Wi-Fi and 4G service to mimic real-world use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40nTeP"&gt;I actually got results that are close to TCL’s claims. I used the 20S for about 31 hours on one charge (TCL suggested 36 hours on 3G/4G) and took around 2.5 hours to fully charge the device, which is hardly a “fast charge” as claimed by TCL’s product sheet. Similarly, the 20SE lasted around 32 hours on one charge, compared to TCL’s estimate of 31 hours of use on 4G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a33xGW"&gt;Don’t get too excited about the cameras on the 20S or the 20SE, though: they can take great snaps in natural light, but I wouldn’t hang these photos on my wall. Both phones have a quad-camera setup, but each model uses different sensors. While the 20S has a 64-megapixel main and a 15-megapixel front camera, and the 20SE has a 48-megapixel main and 13-megapixel front camera, these numbers don’t really say anything about the quality of their photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZeUT9L"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10802883"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NDsaah"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample photos from the TCL 20S&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zTOxVs"&gt;I snapped a bunch of wide-angle and main camera shots (of the same area) using both phones. The ones from the 20S look more balanced with plenty of details, compared to the ones from the 20SE, where the water fountain area looks more over-exposed, especially at 4x cropped zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVI7ry"&gt;There’s a noticeable difference in color between the photos captured with the main cameras and the ultrawide angle cameras on both phones (8-megapixel on the 20S; 5-megapixel on the 20SE). There is also a problem with the Super Macro mode on both phones’ 2-megapixel macro cameras. Photos of the fuchsia flower look pixelated and flat, while the colors from the indoor photos of the blue hydrangea look way over-saturated in the yellow channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5newt"&gt;Based on the price point of these phones, I was surprised when any of the night shots came out somewhat presentable (I know they’re in varying degrees of blurriness). To be fair, even the photos from my Pixel 5 weren’t perfect. Both the 20S and 20SE struggled to focus with so many different light sources in the dark, and each photo required many awkward seconds to process. The 20S produced the sharper photo, while the 20SE’s photos look much less detailed, especially if you look at the lights from the office towers in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nn5y2T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10802941"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9fTXeF"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sample photos from the TCL 20SE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDTYKb"&gt;At first glance, both front-facing cameras captured decent selfies. But I have to give the edge to the 20S’ 16-megapixel camera for the more realistic colors and brighter photos. The selfie from the 20SE’s 13-megapixel front cam just looked more over-exposed: my sunglasses looked frosted, and my skin looked unnaturally pale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DzmjQQKUh-mGOy2MMqKXfwEeRWs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22911280/gsin_190125_4797_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both TCL 20S and 20SE feel solid in-hand, with nice details like nano-photoetching and fingerprint-resistant crystal coating.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TNF7iu"&gt;I can’t really think of a higher quality budget phone in the $250 range that can beat the TCL 20S. It’s got all the hallmarks of a more expensive device but with a more affordable price tag. Its vibrant 6.67-inch 1080p display doesn’t look out of place next to other flagship phones, and it feels luxurious with that fingerprint-proofed layer of “micron-sized prismatic crystals’’ on its back cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="z0mh1i"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’ll be hard-pressed to find a better phone for $250 than the 20S&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YvGFC9"&gt;Sure, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;$250 Moto G Power (2021)&lt;/a&gt; has an equally large battery and a slightly newer processor. In exchange, you get a meager 64GB of internal storage, which is a far cry from the 128GB plus microSD card slot that is offered by the 20S. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;$269 OnePlus Nord 10&lt;/a&gt; (global GSM unlocked version) is also an option. It uses a newer Snapdragon chip that is 5G-compatible but still runs Android 10 when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;Android 12&lt;/a&gt; is ready to drop. If you don’t care about having a 5G-ready phone right now, then the TCL 20S makes more sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1gQL3S"&gt;If you’re looking for an unlocked phone that is compatible with Verizon and most 4G GSM networks like AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile, I don’t think you can go wrong with this unlocked TCL 20S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Us9CdG"&gt;If your budget is strictly sub-$200 and won’t be using Verizon as your carrier, then TCL 20SE is a smart choice. While the $180 OnePlus Nord N100 might save you $10, you’ll lose half the amount of internal storage for minimal savings (from 128GB on the TCL 20SE to 64GB on the N100) — that’s a terrible trade-off. You’ll be happier with a big bright screen, ample storage and battery life, as well as the ability to choose any GSM network (including AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile). If you don’t mind spending an extra $60, though, the 20S is worth the upgrade — your future self will thank you.   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea’s latest Sonos lamp speaker is still an acquired taste</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Better looks, easier bulbs, still niche&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="TNsk1S"&gt;The first table &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726409/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-table-lamp-bookshelf-speaker-review-sound"&gt;lamp speaker from Ikea and Sonos&lt;/a&gt; was a little… strange. With its bulbous, mushroom-esque lampshade, fabric-covered speaker, and a plate beneath it all, the original Symfonisk lamp wasn’t exactly a universal fit for home decor. But the concept of a lamp that also doubles as a capable speaker was in itself a good idea — so the companies are back with their second try at it. The new Symfonisk has a more traditional design, fixes the original’s frustratingly limited bulb compatibility, and has a revamped speaker architecture that does a better job spreading sound throughout a room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PTlzgT"&gt;Ikea is now selling the base/speaker and lampshade separately; the former costs $140, and you can pick between a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fsymfonisk-speaker-lamp-w-wi-fi-glass-shade-white-s79478292%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22724889%2Fikea-sonos-symfonisk-speaker-lamp-2021-review-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;glass&lt;/a&gt; ($39) or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fsymfonisk-speaker-lamp-w-wi-fi-textile-shade-black-s99478291%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22724889%2Fikea-sonos-symfonisk-speaker-lamp-2021-review-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;textile&lt;/a&gt; ($29) shade. The glass shade — I reviewed the black one — is now open-ended and has a secondary, opaque glass cylinder running up the middle, which encircles the bulb. It’s still not going to be everyone’s taste, but the overall style is a bit more conservative and less likely to stand out for the wrong reasons. That said, if you despised how the original looked, I doubt you’ll reverse course after seeing the new model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TTmwCk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10805729"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jjFxAB"&gt;The lamp base has ditched the bottom saucer plate, which was where the controls were located on the older model. It’s noticeably shorter as a result and looks quite similar to Apple’s original HomePod. Ikea also moved away from the looks-like-a-dimmer-but-isn’t knob for turning the lamp on or off. Instead, there’s now a small circular button on the lower front area of the base for powering the light. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pRNFXOLSVSjMzZUYpYf8bXauanc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924391/IMG_0027.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Instead of a knob, the new lamp has a simpler power button for the lightbulb.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EE1Qsy"&gt;One downside of this change is that while the old knob could be left to “on,” this simpler button doesn’t preserve the bulb’s state in the event it gets unplugged or if you lose power. That can get annoying if you’re using smart bulbs since you’ll have to walk over to the lamp and toggle the bulb power back on to control them remotely again. Around back are the usual Sonos controls for volume and play / pause. The volume buttons are easy to operate by feel since one is concave, and the other is convex. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vsmyd6CQVAiWva3oO9ozSAFvCVM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924389/IMG_0026.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lamp’s controls are around back and easy to use by feel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gAoCWY"&gt;The 2019 Symfonisk lamp only supported lightbulbs with an E12 base, which came with a double whammy of being harder to find and outputting lackluster brightness for a table lamp. With the new model, Ikea has switched to the much more common E26 / E27 base. The company includes one of its own LED bulbs in the box, but you’ve got plenty of choices for smart bulbs from Philips Hue, LIFX, and others that will screw into the lamp if you want a dash of color or more flexible ways of controlling the light remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Pt4Ei"&gt;Setting up the lamp speaker is a short process in the Sonos app: plug in the detachable, braided power cord, and it’s automatically detected and added to your whole-home audio system a few moments later. For the final step, you hold your phone near the device to finish linking it to your Sonos account through NFC. After that, the Symfonisk lamp acts like any other Sonos speaker you’ve got. You can group them together to get the same song playing throughout your living space or just have the lamp do its own thing. Like other modern Sonos speakers, the lamp supports Apple’s AirPlay 2, so it’s easy to play audio on it from an iPhone, iPad, or Mac. If you buy two of the lamp speakers, they can be used as a stereo pair or serve as rear surrounds for one of Sonos’ soundbars. Assuming the design is to your taste, it’s a more subtle solution for surrounds than putting speakers on stands or wall-mounting them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1i5SEr643BkU7-hBXDcBMEt1f5o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924407/DSCF5823.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ikea is selling two different styles of lampshades for the Symfonisk lamp.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tx9FQM"&gt;None of the Symfonisk products so far have come with built-in microphones, and that remains true with the second-gen lamp. To add voice controls to your Sonos system, you’ll either need one of the company’s voice-enabled speakers or to set up &lt;a href="https://support.sonos.com/s/article/3439?language=en_US"&gt;Amazon Alexa&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://support.sonos.com/s/article/3486?language=en_US"&gt;Google Assistant&lt;/a&gt; if you already own a compatible device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Zt61rf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10805665"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sGQfWI"&gt;Ikea and Sonos say the second-generation Symfonisk lamp has a totally redesigned acoustic architecture. The most significant addition is a waveguide that’s meant to better disperse and spread the speaker’s sound around a room. (There’s a similar waveguide in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573890/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-picture-frame-speaker-review"&gt;picture frame speaker&lt;/a&gt;.) This means you won’t have to worry about a narrow “sweet spot” when finding a spot for the lamp; it should sound consistent regardless of where you place it in a room. But the re-engineered guts have changed the overall sound enough that the Symfonisk doesn’t sound as close to a Sonos One as the original did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ToNfUZ"&gt;For its size, there’s a very satisfying level of bass, and vocals come through with good clarity. But other parts of the mix can sound less detailed compared to most Sonos speakers, and some instrumentation falls deeper into the background than I’d like. Listening to Kacey Musgraves’ new album &lt;em&gt;Star-Crossed&lt;/em&gt;, this speaker noticeably lacked some brightness and definition on her vocals and acoustic guitars on a song like “Hookup Scene.” There are EQ adjustments for treble and bass in the Sonos app, and you can also run TruePlay (if you have an iOS device) to further optimize the sound. But there’s always a slight muddiness to the speaker, though it’s not as present or obvious depending on what you’re listening to. That’s the tradeoff you’re making for the wider sound dispersion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdOZbQ"&gt;If you’re looking for a decent speaker for a bedroom or office — and you &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; want it to double as a lamp — the new Symfonisk makes good on that hybrid functionality. But to me, the $99 bookshelf speaker remains the best value and most practical device in the Symfonisk lineup, especially when you put two of them together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="9eK7NH"&gt;When it comes to the wall art speaker or the lamp, they are less versatile. You’re either looking for this very specific dual-purpose thing, or you’re probably not interested at all. If you are interested, the second-generation Symfonisk lamp fixes a lot of what Ikea got wrong the first time. It looks (slightly) more conventional, supports an easier-to-source bulb, and gets a wider audio spread out of the drivers inside. The notion of cloaking technology inside other, more inviting household appliances will definitely be a big plus for some. But if you’re already set on lamps and okay with displaying speakers that don’t hide their true purpose, you can do better for the money.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Every PC can now run Crysis</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7QkETamfJA3x2XZCNokTrsf7YOE=/256x0:1792x1024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69993375/GFN_Thursday_Crysis_Remastered.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ifk895"&gt;But can it run &lt;em&gt;Crysis&lt;/em&gt;? The answer is now yes, no matter what PC you own. Nvidia is bringing &lt;em&gt;Crysis Remastered &lt;/em&gt;to its GeForce Now streaming service this week, alongside &lt;em&gt;Crysis Remastered Trilogy&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Crysis 2 Remastered&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Crysis 3 Remastered.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksHKsU"&gt;The remastered version of &lt;em&gt;Crysis&lt;/em&gt; includes ray tracing and DLSS support, which can both be enabled by Founders or Priority members of Nvidia’s GeForce Now service. &lt;em&gt;Crysis Remastered&lt;/em&gt; will be available from Steam and Epic Games Store on GeForce Now today, with the full &lt;em&gt;Crysis Remastered Trilogy&lt;/em&gt; available at launch tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qzz0sM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Most PCs on the market today can stream ‘Crysis’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a1QeeE"&gt;The vast majority of PCs on the market today, and even some of the budget gaming PCs that existed in 2007, can run &lt;em&gt;Crysis&lt;/em&gt; by streaming it from GeForce Now. Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce-now%2Fsystem-reqs%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F14%2F22725953%2Fcrysis-remastered-nvidia-geforce-now-available-streaming" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;system requirements&lt;/a&gt; include a dual-core 64-bit CPU (2GHz or faster) running Windows 7 or newer, 4GB of RAM, a GPU that supports DirectX 11 or newer, and at least a 15Mbps internet connection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CCQ8N"&gt;The original &lt;em&gt;Crysis&lt;/em&gt;, released in 2007, had a reputation for having high system requirements, and struggled to run on many PCs at the time of its release. “But can it run &lt;em&gt;Crysis&lt;/em&gt;?” became part of internet culture, a long-running meme about PC hardware requirements. Several games have come close to the notoriety of &lt;em&gt;Crysis&lt;/em&gt;, including the release of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite multiplayer feels like an exciting return to form</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8P4sBf8cMbUm-V_UperlQ3ghj8w=/0x0:1782x1188/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69993314/halo_infinite_mp.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;We couldn’t get enough&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TQ39AU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; arrives on December 8th, 2021, after over a year of delay, but the game seems truly worth the wait. &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt; was supposed to launch alongside the Xbox Series X in November 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363769/halo-infinite-delay-launch-2021-release-date-xbox-series-x"&gt;but got pushed back&lt;/a&gt; after an underwhelming initial reveal that &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/23/21336060/halo-infinite-graphics-xbox-series-x-microsoft-one-windows-fan-reaction-memes"&gt;made the game into a meme&lt;/a&gt;. As of late 2021, it appears Microsoft may have turned things around big time. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665435/halo-infinite-multiplayer-preview-september-24th"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer preview&lt;/a&gt; has gotten rave reviews and we’ve enjoyed it so much, we can’t wait to play more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWhCQU"&gt;Here’s what &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Tom Warren and Sean Hollister loved, hated, and what we’re hoping to see when the full game comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dMlxgW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom Warren&lt;/strong&gt;: My favorite part of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer is the new grappleshot. It’s game-changing for &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;, both in terms of moving around maps and also the ability to grab objects. I’ve been using it mainly to parkour around as if I’m playing &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt;, but once you master its uses beyond mobility, you can quickly grab the power weapons or repel yourself back onto a ledge if you just got hit by a repulsor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uh5Cly"&gt;Some of the most entertaining clips I’ve seen throughout the beta have been by people grappling back onto ledges, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mintblitz/status/1445744553412030464?s=21"&gt;grabbing vehicles out of the sky&lt;/a&gt;, or just generally using the mobility of the grappleshot to get some truly impressive plays. It really feels like a mix of &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt; and Pathfinder’s grapple hook from &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="4Y7fvm"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pYqNCjG1vPw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QNLwPl"&gt;You need to find the grappleshot and pick it up before you can actually use it to grab things or move around quickly, and there’s a small cooldown and limited amount of uses so it doesn’t feel too overpowered. You can configure the training mode with unlimited grappleshot, and I almost want a dedicated mode where everyone has it equipped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02Aq3E"&gt;If you haven’t managed to play &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; beta yet, it’s one of the tools you’ll want to master early on for multiplayer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPGfwq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean Hollister: &lt;/strong&gt;I’m a sucker for a great grappling hook, and I’ll echo Tom here: I’d love a mode where I could use it nonstop to grapple into, onto, and around everything. I’ve seen some amazing plays with the repulsor, too — like a single Spartan bouncing away a fully loaded Warthog like it was a two-ton tennis ball, securing a CTF victory for their team — but more often it seems like a way to boop people into bottomless pits. I prefer pulling myself &lt;em&gt;out&lt;/em&gt; of those pits with the grappling hook, and it’s exhilarating to do things like intentionally throw myself under a bridge, swing underneath, and pop up behind foes on the opposite side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="G0YrgU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is possibly the best use of the repulsor I've seen in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HaloInfinite?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#HaloInfinite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;November cannot come soon enough.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Via: &lt;a href="https://t.co/2yLSp6FhQ4"&gt;https://t.co/2yLSp6FhQ4&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/DIhklRpw1Y"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DIhklRpw1Y&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Looter Universe (@LooterUniverse) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LooterUniverse/status/1444983093496975364?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B9CB65"&gt;But my favorite part of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;is simple: the gunplay. From the booming audio to the tremendous amount of damage they can put out against a shielded, armored soldier, every weapon feels incredibly powerful, every fight leaves me on the edge of my seat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="InvQZ1"&gt;Stray projectiles and covering fire are deadly enough, I &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt; the pressure to put my head down, let my shield regenerate, or try another angle of attack entirely instead of poking out from cover again and again. I’m constantly calculating the risk / reward of a devastating melee attack or a grenade toss, because they’re just as satisfying as they’ve always been in classic &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; games, as are the classic headshot-friendly pistol and spray-and-pray assault rifle you get by default in most matches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4HqRzA"&gt;With a few obvious exceptions like the rocket launcher, sniper rifle, and giant spike thrower (which have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/godsewa/status/1443232801231417346"&gt;counters of their own&lt;/a&gt;), the weapons feel balanced enough that I never felt penalized for picking a different one just for fun variety. It’s the most fun I’ve had with &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; in years, after the most recent games tried to get a bit too tricky. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kTGrLucpuf2Yks1-20j7TjTM3HI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925717/HaloInfinite_2021_10_03_21_02_12_131.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A grappling hook doesn’t keep you from getting shot out of the sky.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w85j3d"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom: &lt;/strong&gt;I also love the movement in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. Mobility is always a key aspect of first-person shooters, and &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;really encourages it with smooth sprinting, sliding, and vaulting. &lt;em&gt;Halo 5&lt;/em&gt; really took movement mechanics to the extreme, with mechanics like the thrust slide that could boost your movement and allow you to outsmart opponents. &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s movement changes are a lot more refined, very subtle, and have a clear skill gap to pull off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dSd4w"&gt;YouTuber Shyway demonstrated this really well, with &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/rKBzaSqHMeE"&gt;a 17-second clip&lt;/a&gt; showing off curb slides in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;. While the comments are full of people saying &lt;em&gt;Titanfall &lt;/em&gt;movement is better (and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGWRAbSKXEI"&gt;he addresses that, too&lt;/a&gt;), these curb slides are actually a big change to a &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; game that doesn’t have easy-to-use thrust slides and lots of movement mechanics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="nd2lNH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rKBzaSqHMeE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1KpgaF"&gt;I’ve also seen people demonstrate the mobility in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; really well on Twitter, and slide jumping is a fun mechanic, especially when you combine it with things like the grappleshot. I’m used to playing &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;, which has a big focus on movement and mobility, so &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t feel slow in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mki0Fn"&gt;Once people start to master the curb slides, we’ll see some wild clips go viral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c26nj0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean: &lt;/strong&gt;Frankly, I’m hoping there aren’t too many mobility tricks like the curb slide, and that they don’t dominate the game. Skill ceilings can make a lot of shooting games inaccessible to those who don’t play for a living, and so far I’ve been impressed that most skirmishes&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;I’ve had in &lt;em&gt;Infinite&lt;/em&gt; felt like fair fights — losses where I’d have won if I’d played my cards right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEWoVr"&gt;We don’t know what the meta will be like quite yet, of course, since we were playing against foes with a similar lack of experience. We also don’t necessarily have a good handle on the maps: the test flights dropped us into a bare handful of small and / or extremely symmetrical levels, and I wonder if I’ll enjoy larger ones as much. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nu4mX"&gt;Not that any of those things will factor into my purchase decision: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349236/halo-infinite-multiplayer-free-to-play-120fps-rumors"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;multiplayer will be free to play&lt;/a&gt;, a super exciting move that should hopefully ensure it’ll be easy to find a match at my skill level for years to come. Microsoft will be making its multiplayer money entirely off cosmetic items, it seems!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3ZPn3O3cDbtbeap2dQKIukioe6M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925721/HaloInfinite_2021_10_03_21_02_25_237.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“I call shotgun. HEY, wait for me!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6wAfjH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tom:  &lt;/strong&gt;I don’t like the battle pass system, though. There are credits which appear to be available to purchase for real money, too. You can use credits to level up the battle pass and unlock rewards like consumables (double XP), armor, and other items. You can also level up the battle pass by completing challenges, but you don’t earn XP through regular play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAQCHk"&gt;I’m fine with the challenges existing, but I feel like there should be a way to earn XP based on the amount of time you’re playing the game. If you can truly buy credits from the store that let you level up the battle pass, then that’s veering too close to pay to win for me even if all you’re getting is cosmetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PprZlF"&gt;The battle pass system is the only part of &lt;em&gt;Infinite &lt;/em&gt;that I’ve felt confused and irritated by.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h2YRxdLJMkWq3xrD5NnOe4zGt7I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925723/HaloInfinite_2021_10_02_14_56_13_996.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;We had high hopes &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410863/microsoft-halo-infinite-pc-32-9-ultrawide-lan" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;for Microsoft’s 32:9 monitor support&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. It looks neat on an ultrawide &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Odyssey G9&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, but I’m afraid the edges are pretty distorted.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8q7ZWP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sean: &lt;/strong&gt;I do wonder how Microsoft will keep it engaging enough to keep paying players paying. I took a look at the different armor variants and colors, but there are only so many ways you can skin a set of armor, and Halo’s guns don’t have the mountains of attachments or variants you’d find in a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty,&lt;/em&gt; nor the unique heroes of an &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; to keep people buying and costuming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13Z63W"&gt;I’m fine just ignoring the paid extras, like I do in all free-to-play games. But here’s something I’d genuinely pay for: a mode that makes the vehicles bouncy and indestructible, like they were in the original 2001 &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;Combat Evolved&lt;/em&gt;. Want a good time? Get everyone on an OG &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; server to put their guns away and start Warthog jousting instead, then watch as the game’s bonkers physics system launches those vehicles spiraling into the sky. No shooting allowed: you’ve got to knock your foes out of their futuristic Humvees and run them over to win. It becomes a big floaty bullfight, or — with enough players — a piranha feeding frenzy. &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; made vehicles destructible in &lt;em&gt;Halo 2&lt;/em&gt;, and that was that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="SgpIBh"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C5d7AiVMoEM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VI1QfL"&gt;Either way, if &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; stays as fun as it was in these test flights, I’ll be playing a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of it. The bite-sized matches go by so quickly it’s hard to resist — it’s easy to fit one or two into my busy dad schedule, perhaps during my lunch break. Tom, you in?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGxnml"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is researching AI systems that see, hear, and remember everything you do</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4eypKf"&gt;Facebook is pouring a lot of time and money into augmented reality, including building its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662809/facebook-ray-ban-stories-camera-smart-glasses-hands-on"&gt;AR glasses&lt;/a&gt; with Ray-Ban. Right now, these gadgets can only record and share imagery, but what does the company think such devices will be used for in the future? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIsPiW"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/teaching-ai-to-view-the-world-through-your-eyes/"&gt;new research project&lt;/a&gt; led by Facebook’s AI team suggests the scope of the company’s ambitions. It imagines AI systems that are constantly analyzing peoples’ lives using first-person video; recording what they see, do, and hear in order to help them with everyday tasks. Facebook’s researchers have outlined a series of skills it wants these systems to develop, including “episodic memory” (answering questions like “where did I leave my keys?”) and “audio-visual diarization” (remembering who said what when). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="f0ceBz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“there’s possibilities down the road that we’d be leveraging this kind of research”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q4mkv6"&gt;Right now, the tasks outlined above cannot be achieved reliably by any AI system, and Facebook stresses that this is a research project rather than a commercial development. However, it’s clear that the company sees functionality like these as the future of AR computing. “Definitely, thinking about augmented reality and what we’d like to be able to do with it, there’s possibilities down the road that we’d be leveraging this kind of research,” Facebook AI research scientist Kristen Grauman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLJK2b"&gt;Such ambitions have huge privacy implications. Privacy experts are already worried about how Facebook’s AR glasses allow wearers to covertly record members of the public. Such concerns will only be exacerbated if future versions of the hardware not only record footage, but analyze and transcribe it, turning wearers into walking surveillance machines.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ym00sPuEzaBp64U9vobYfRLkK6Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22834538/alopez_210907_4736_0006.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s first pair of commercial AR glasses can only record and share videos and pictures — not analyze it. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BeEj6O"&gt;The name of Facebook’s research project is Ego4D, which refers to the analysis of first-person, or “egocentric,” video. It consists of two major components: an open dataset of egocentric video and a series of benchmarks that Facebook thinks AI systems should be able to tackle in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d6Dk2I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook helped collect 3,205 hours of first-person footage from around the world&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WP4EAI"&gt;The dataset is the biggest of its kind ever created, and Facebook partnered with 13 universities around the world to collect the data. In total, some 3,205 hours of footage were recorded by 855 participants living in nine different countries. The universities, rather than Facebook, were responsible for collecting the data. Participants, some of whom were paid, wore GoPro cameras and AR glasses to record video of unscripted activity. This ranges from construction work to baking to playing with pets and socializing with friends. All footage was de-identified by the universities, which included blurring the faces of bystanders and removing any personally identifiable information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rhnACJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/taC2ZKl9IsE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R3vQo7"&gt;Grauman says the dataset is the “first of its kind in both scale and diversity.” The nearest comparable project, she says, contains &lt;a href="https://epic-kitchens.github.io/2021"&gt;100 hours of first-person footage&lt;/a&gt; shot entirely in kitchens. “We’ve open up the eyes of these AI systems to more than just kitchens in the UK and Sicily, but [to footage from] Saudi Arabia, Tokyo, Los Angeles, and Colombia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZeuXO"&gt;The second component of Ego4D is a series of benchmarks, or tasks, that Facebook wants researchers around the world to try and solve using AI systems trained on its dataset. The company describes these as: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ILjgln"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Episodic memory&lt;/strong&gt;: What happened when (e.g., “Where did I leave my keys?”)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rcuKUw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forecasting&lt;/strong&gt;: What am I likely to do next (e.g., “Wait, you’ve already added salt to this recipe”)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Od5NVZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hand and object manipulation&lt;/strong&gt;: What am I doing (e.g., “Teach me how to play the drums”)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GD62EB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audio-visual diarization&lt;/strong&gt;: Who said what when (e.g., “What was the main topic during class?”)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UiQKqm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Social interaction&lt;/strong&gt;: Who is interacting with whom (e.g., “Help me better hear the person talking to me at this noisy restaurant”)?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="6EZF4d"&gt;Right now, AI systems would find tackling any of these problems incredibly difficult, but creating datasets and benchmarks are tried-and-tested methods to spur development in the field of AI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWtMKu"&gt;Indeed, the creation of one particular dataset and an associated annual competition, known as ImageNet, is often &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1034972/the-data-that-changed-the-direction-of-ai-research-and-possibly-the-world/"&gt;credited with kickstarting&lt;/a&gt; the recent AI boom. The ImagetNet datasets consists of pictures of a huge variety of objects which researchers trained AI systems to identify. In 2012, the winning entry in the competition used a particular method of deep learning to blast past rivals, inaugurating the current era of research. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rm70bMbN2Xsj93qJO-YwBMe2M6Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925967/Before_After_Detectron_ModelFINAL.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook’s Ego4D dataset should help spur research into AI systems that can analyze first-person data. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2y2cTx"&gt;Facebook is hoping its Ego4D project will have similar effects for the world of augmented reality. The company says systems trained on Ego4D might one day not only be used in wearable cameras but also home assistant robots, which also rely on first-person cameras to navigate the world around them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUCiCp"&gt;“The project has the chance to really catalyze work in this field in a way that hasn’t really been possible yet,” says Grauman. “To move our field from the ability to analyze piles of photos and videos that were human-taken with a very special purpose, to this fluid, ongoing first-person visual stream that AR systems, robots, need to understand in the context of ongoing activity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nLHqJr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook’s development of AI surveillance systems will worry many&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lRizDW"&gt;Although the tasks that Facebook outlines certainly seem practical, the company’s interest in this area will worry many. Facebook’s record on privacy is abysmal, spanning &lt;a href="https://guild.co/blog/complete-list-timeline-of-facebook-scandals/"&gt;data leaks&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-49099364"&gt;$5 billion fines&lt;/a&gt; from the FTC. It’s also &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;been&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/03/11/1020600/facebook-responsible-ai-misinformation/"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-algorithm-change-zuckerberg-11631654215?mod=article_inline"&gt;repeatedly&lt;/a&gt; that the company values growth and engagement above users’ well-being in many domains. With this in mind, it’s worrying that benchmarks in this Ego4D project do not include prominent privacy safeguards. For example, the “audio-visual diarization” task (transcribing what different people say) never mentions removing data about people who don’t want to be recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9oY0k"&gt;When asked about these issues, a spokesperson for Facebook told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that it expected that privacy safeguards would be introduced further down the line. “We expect that to the extent companies use this dataset and benchmark to develop commercial applications, they will develop safeguards for such applications,” said the spokesperson. “For example, before AR glasses can enhance someone’s voice, there could be a protocol in place that they follow to ask someone else’s glasses for permission, or they could limit the range of the device so it can only pick up sounds from the people with whom I am already having a conversation or who are in my immediate vicinity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iB5TNC"&gt;For now, such safeguards are only hypothetical.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Modular Framework laptop gets a marketplace for all those modules  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVOYwcxFfarr76rbKKEFGhmQ1NU=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69992827/b1b74084_9272_45c1_93a4_d8c4895c697c_Blog21019___Marketplace_Launch___img01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gbl4DB"&gt;Framework, makers of the modular 13.5-inch Framework laptop that’s designed to be easily repaired and upgraded, has launched a dedicated marketplace filled with replacement parts and upgrades for its portable computer. Writing in a &lt;a href="https://frame.work/blog/announcing-the-framework-marketplace"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the company said the marketplace is currently focused on replacement parts and expansion cards, but that it hopes to add more customization modules like additional language keyboards later this year, as well as third-party and community developed modules in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x59BzA"&gt;It’s an important step for the modular laptop, which has been shipping for a little over two months. After all, the laptop’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F51614%2Fframework-laptop-teardown-10-10-but-is-it-perfect&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F14%2F22725935%2Fframework-laptop-modular-marketplace-launches-spare-parts-upgrades-expansions" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10/10 &lt;em&gt;iFixit&lt;/em&gt; score for repairability&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t matter much if you can’t get a spare part when a component fails. And who cares if a laptop is upgradeable if there aren’t any interesting modules that are actually available to upgrade it with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UQdbqG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Framework Marketplace is now live for ordering replacement parts and upgrades!  This is the foundation of a exciting ecosystem roadmap expanding the customization, upgrade, and repair of incredible products: &lt;a href="https://t.co/26ApysPerf"&gt;https://t.co/26ApysPerf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/iKe8TTSVfk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iKe8TTSVfk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Framework (@FrameworkPuter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FrameworkPuter/status/1447976504097341441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8yfvTu"&gt;The marketplace already includes a range of expansion cards for the laptop, which are designed to slot into its four modular compartments to add everything from extra storage to features like MicroSD card slots or more USB ports. There’s also user upgradeable RAM and storage for sale. But the store is clearly a work in progress, and lists a host of other items like replacement CPU-equipped mainboards, keyboards, and spare parts like batteries and displays as “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKPzoD"&gt;Framework has made a solid start at making sure its laptops can be easily repaired when they break, but it’ll be a while longer before we know if it’s truly delivered on its promise of a laptop that can be upgraded over time. It’s a promise that’s been made many times over the years. Just last year, Dells’ attempt at an upgradeable laptop with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18294631/alienware-area-51m-review-gaming-laptop-specs-price-features"&gt;Alienware Area-51m&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256845/alienware-area-51m-r1-r2-specs-upgradable-parts-gpu-dgff-limited"&gt;unravelled just one model later&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Up3HrW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AV2umY3R0vw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yQfHTh"&gt;There have been similar high profile attempts to bring modular designs to smartphones. But over the years, attempts from companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14172070/lg-next-flagship-g6-smartphone-friends-modules-ces-2017"&gt;LG&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/2/12775922/google-project-ara-modular-phone-suspended-confirm"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.benefitofthedoud.com/post/moto-mods-are-not-dead-but-they-re-not-not-dead#:~:text=Moto%20mods%20led%20to%20us,world's%20first%205G%20mobile%20device.&amp;amp;text=For%20fans%20of%20moto%20z,phone%2C%20you%20can%20buy%20them."&gt;Motorola&lt;/a&gt; have failed to make much of an impact. Sustainable smartphone manufacturer Fairphone has seen more success, and recently announced its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22716194/fairphone-4-review"&gt;Fairphone 4&lt;/a&gt; smartphone. But Fairphone’s focus has always been more on easy repairs for longevity, rather than offering upgraded components over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RE6zBj"&gt;If you’re interested in picking up a Framework laptop for yourself, the prices start at $999 for an assembled model with an Intel i5-1135G7 CPU, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. There’s also a model with a more affordable $749 starting price if you’re happy to do some assembly, or more expensive pre-assembled versions with faster Intel i7 CPUs, and more RAM and storage. All versions come with a 13.5-inch 3:2 2256 x 1504 display, a 1080p webcam, and 55Wh battery. As of this writing, Framework’s website says new orders are due to ship next month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple extends AirPods Pro repair program for crackling or ANC issues</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fd4XpFdUwrRRGx7eXmiuL17ewU8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69992754/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The AirPods Pro, first released in 2019.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DRcibj"&gt;Apple has quietly extended a repair program for the AirPods Pro that offers free repairs or replacements for earbuds that have issues with noise cancellation or static. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/airpods/comments/q7kov9/psa_apple_silently_extended_the_airpods_pro/"&gt;Reddit users&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/13/apple-extends-airpods-pro-repair-program/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) were first to spot the change to Apple’s &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/airpods-pro-service-program-sound-issues"&gt;support page for the repair program&lt;/a&gt;, which now notes that the program covers affected AirPods Pro for three years after their first retail sale, rather than two. The page appears to have been updated at the beginning of October. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdzcWg"&gt;The support program was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21542846/apple-airpods-pro-repair-recall-program-noise-cancellation-static"&gt;originally introduced in October 2020&lt;/a&gt;, one year after the original &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936454/apple-airpods-pro-new-release-date-price-noise-cancellation-design-immersive-sound"&gt;release of the AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. It meant that Apple’s repair program was introduced at the exact point that the warranty on launch units was set to expire. With the extension of the repair program to three years, AirPods Pro bought at launch should now be covered right up until October 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvyRXC"&gt;As a reminder, Apple says it will fix the following issues with the AirPods Pro: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="r8TjET"&gt;Crackling or static sounds that increase in loud environments, with exercise or while talking on the phone&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Dz2WK"&gt;Active Noise Cancellation not working as expected, such as a loss of bass sound, or an increase in background sounds, such as street or airplane noise&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Md31O7"&gt;If you’re experiencing any of these issues, you now have a whole extra year to get off your butt and get a free fix as part of the repair program, which, in our experience, often means Apple giving you an on-the-spot replacement pair to take home. To do so, Apple says you should contact its support team or an Apple Authorized Service Provider, or else make an appointment at an Apple Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpNvqt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPKFnB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Ncase M1, a crowdfunded marvel of a PC case, has been discontinued </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UO_tk4l57IGzLCf6A-ur3RXKGXE=/345x0:2595x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69991816/ncase_m1_render_coke.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The final product wound up being remarkably faithful to this early render.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ncase&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="13kMCd"&gt;In 2012, fed up with the sorry state of small-form-factor (SFF) computer cases, &lt;a href="https://hardforum.com/threads/ncase-m1-a-crowdfunded-mini-itx-case-updates-in-first-post.1717132/"&gt;two users on the HardOCP community forum&lt;/a&gt; decided to create their own. Wahaha360 and Necere came up with the $200+ &lt;a href="https://ncases.com/products/m1"&gt;Ncase M1&lt;/a&gt;, a 12.7-liter marvel designed to put every cubic centimeter of that space to good use. Amazingly, they managed to attract the attention of renowned PC manufacturer Lian-Li to manufacture small batches of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.indiegogo.com%2Fprojects%2Fncase-m1-prototype-a-mini-itx-case%23%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F13%2F22725010%2Fncase-m1-pc-case-sff-small-form-factor-discontinued" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;their crowdfunded case&lt;/a&gt; out of high-quality aluminum, and the result was greeted with rave reviews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="813Ekz"&gt;Nine years later, though, &lt;a href="https://ncases.com/blogs/news/farewell-m1-classic"&gt;Ncase has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’s discontinuing the M1 for good. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WfSlj5hXU64HNDiwCp8oZLNGn6w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924630/ncase_m1_classic.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Mikqhf"&gt;It’s a weird situation. Yesterday, the company posted that it had discontinued the M1 entirely — but overnight, the post was updated to read that it’s just the current “classic” design that’s gone for good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ivGj5J"&gt;Ncase tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that’s because there’s a successor on the way. “I can say that what we are working on will follow the formula the M1 pioneered, updated and modernized to better reflect the current hardware market,” Ncase says, adding:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="VDSOTk"&gt;Video cards, especially, have on average grown significantly larger over the past couple of years - a fact that has hurt the M1’s compatibility, which had previously been very good for its size. The M1 was already highly space-optimized, so accommodating such larger cards was not possible within the current design footprint. Hence the need for a more thorough redesign from the ground up, which also allows us the opportunity to explore alternate manufacturing methods, updates to the visual design, and additional features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="NSEmgG"&gt;That makes some sense: This isn’t a product that’s particularly out of date or where demand has suddenly dried up. While there are many worthy imitators like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BF8YMXC/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Cooler Master NR200&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lian-Li-TU-150WX-Aluminum-Mini-ITX/dp/B07X8Z5V53?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lian-Li’s own TU-150&lt;/a&gt; — with a neat integrated carry handle, too — the Ncase M1 is &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; widely regarded as one of the best cases on the market. Would-be buyers were eagerly awaiting another batch, which was tentatively slated for November.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZQDCBs"&gt;But it is true that some of the oversized coolers on the most recent generation of graphics cards keeps many of them from fitting well in the M1. (Still, you can easily stuff a RTX 3080 Ti Founder’s Edition in there if you’ve got enough airflow and a potent power supply. I certainly did!)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/06WqXo_Ew5BSdo1hD9st8HSFmMY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925218/M1_v2_04_1500x750.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Praise the M1’s pop-off panels, a staple of Lian-Li cases. You can even fit a slim-line optical drive or SSD under the front shield.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RhMzmT"&gt;It’s worth noting that Ncase’s founders do work on other PC cases as well. For example: The 14.7-liter &lt;a href="https://ssupd.com/products/meshlicious"&gt;SSUPD Meshlicious&lt;/a&gt;, a mass-market case that SFF specialist YouTuber Optimum Tech &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKpNt1o6l_Y"&gt;called “the 2021 ITX case to beat”&lt;/a&gt;, is also a Wahaha360 product made by Lian-Li. (So is the 9.5-liter FormD T1, another case that &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FormD/comments/pp72se/t1_v20_official_updated_from_v15/"&gt;gets produced in small batches&lt;/a&gt;.) Ncase also collaborated on &lt;a href="https://hardforum.com/threads/mach-one-a-chimera-x-ncase-collaboration.1961617/"&gt;a design called the Mach One&lt;/a&gt;, too — and if you told me that its &lt;a href="https://hardforum.com/threads/the-next-ncase-project-a-steam-machine-style-case-indeterminate.1831382/"&gt;LRPC concept&lt;/a&gt; inspired Microsoft’s Xbox One S, below, I wouldn’t bat an eye.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="sCt3xF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10806172"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WIIzQ2"&gt;It feels premature to pour one out for the best computer case I’ve ever owned, one that I plan to keep using for years and one that’ll likely make a cameo appearance in even more &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; reviews than the ones you &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21590961/samsung-odyssey-g9-review-ultrawide-monitor-price-specs"&gt;might’ve&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"&gt;already&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22300659/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-review"&gt;clocked&lt;/a&gt;. But even if we might be getting an Ncase M2 someday, I don’t mind pressing F for the legacy this brand built. Ncase helped change the face of SFF cases, and whether you’re buying your next one from them or someone else, our desks are better for it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/odqyy9siji6kdolmAGT3_YnoMdo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925234/1826930.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To think the comparatively gigantic BitFenix Prodigy (right) was considered a groundbreaking Mini-ITX case in 2012. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Adam Neumann is back, and he just got HBO Max to cave to his demands</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/37bipwg-vk1xAyc0A_-vhaFvEfo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69991770/acastro_191111_1777_wework_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eE2lpK"&gt;Months after HBO Max original docuseries &lt;em&gt;Generation Hustle&lt;/em&gt; debuted on the service, a team representing WeWork co-founder Adam Neumann says the streamer has changed some language in an episode that mapped the startup’s rise and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21029499/decade-fails-flops-tech-science-culture-apple-google-data-kickstarter-2010-2019"&gt;spectacular demise&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="in8KWH"&gt;In a press release sent to a staffer at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; earlier this week, defamation attorney &lt;a href="https://clarelocke.com/professionals/thomas-a-clare-p-c/"&gt;Thomas A. Clare&lt;/a&gt; — who now represents the known &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21011740/nicholas-braun-cousin-greg-succession-wework-adam-neumann-casting-announcement"&gt;tequila enthusiast&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20872777/we-work-adam-neumann-tequila-weed-ipo-eternal-life"&gt;reported aspiring immortal&lt;/a&gt; — announced that HBO Max had altered parts of a &lt;em&gt;Generation Hustle &lt;/em&gt;episode, titled “Cult of WeWork,” as well as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hbomax.com%2Fseries%2Furn%3Ahbo%3Aseries%3AGYFuzsAQIP73CUAEAAAAd&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F13%2F22725397%2Fhbo-max-edits-cult-of-wework-adam-neumann-generation-hustle" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its description&lt;/a&gt; on the HBO Max site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="takyHq"&gt;Previously, the show’s description said it combined “true-crime capers with fresh, glossy stories of charismatic fakes” and “colorful imposters,” according to a version of the site archived on &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210428091004/https://www.hbomax.com/series/urn:hbo:series:GYFuzsAQIP73CUAEAAAAd"&gt;Wayback Machine&lt;/a&gt;. Both the characterization of the series as “true crime” and the aforementioned description of its subjects have since been removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B8Nadx"&gt;The service also changed language in the end cards shown in the episode by specifying that while Neumann is being investigated, “no criminal or regulatory charges have been filed.” The episode also now includes language that WeWork is &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/wework-ipo-coworking-spac-deal-stock-market-public-listing-2021-9"&gt;preparing to go public&lt;/a&gt;. While the language in the cards and the show’s and description have been updated, a spokesperson for the HBO Max told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that no alterations had been made to the episode itself. &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/10/adam-neumann-scam-wework-hbo-generation-hustle-changes-ipo-1234854081/"&gt;earlier reported&lt;/a&gt; on the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cisZLp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We hope these responsible steps ... put an end to the mischaracterizations of Adam’s successful role in creating a transformational business.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1X7oFI"&gt;“HBO did the right thing here by promptly retracting these false implications about Adam and the history of WeWork, and we applaud the network for taking these responsible steps,” Clare, Neumann’s attorney, said in a statement. “The media has repeatedly gotten the story of Adam wrong, and we hope these responsible steps by a reputable outlet will help put an end to the mischaracterizations of Adam’s successful role in creating a transformational business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v4eYDA"&gt;An HBO Max spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Clare’s conflation of the changes with HBO — rather than HBO Max — was incorrect. The company had no further comment to share on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wu2itF"&gt;When asked by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; why the edits were announced nearly six months after the show’s premiere in April, a spokesperson for Neumann’s team said that the changes were made “in the last few days.” Neumann retained his defamation counsel on January 14th of 2021, according to the spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>EA is removing ex-Raiders coach Jon Gruden from Madden after email scandal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Chicago Bears v Las Vegas Raiders" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EfzB-ElZy9ejw0Jqp8dUjEQUWKo=/0x35:3289x2228/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69991721/1346134192.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s9NcaW"&gt;Electronic Arts is removing former Las Vegas Raiders coach Jon Gruden from &lt;em&gt;Madden NFL 22 &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jon-gruden-email-demaurice-smith-11633721045?mod=e2tw"&gt;following&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/11/sports/football/what-did-jon-gruden-say.html?"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that he had used racist, homophobic, and misogynistic language in emails. Gruden resigned as the Raiders’ coach soon after the emails came to light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SmetFl"&gt;“EA Sports is committed to taking action in maintaining a culture of inclusion and equity,” EA said on in a statement posted to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EAMaddenNFL/status/1448393205297332232"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Madden&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;NFL&lt;/em&gt; Twitter account&lt;/a&gt;. “Due to the circumstances of Jon Gruden’s resignation, we are taking steps to remove him from &lt;em&gt;Madden NFL 22&lt;/em&gt;. We will replace him with a generic likeness via a title update in the coming weeks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="flvuCL"&gt;This isn’t the first time EA has made changes to its hit football series in response to real-world events. In 2020, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/17/21328954/ea-madden-nfl-21-washington-redskins-name-logo-removal"&gt;changed all references to the Washington Redskins&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Madden NFL 21&lt;/em&gt; after the franchise announced it would be dropping the brand. Former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez was removed &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/7/8/4505076/ea-to-remove-aaron-hernandez-ncaa-football-14-madden-nfl-25"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;NCAA Football 14&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Madden NFL 25&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;after being convicted of first-degree murder in 2013. And former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/9/9/6126945/ray-rice-suspended-domestic-violence-nfl-madden"&gt;was pulled from &lt;em&gt;Madden NFL 15&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; after a video surfaced of him hitting his wife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b5MSbe"&gt;Gruden’s emails were included among 650,000 that were reviewed as part of an NFL investigation into workplace misconduct at Washington Football Team.  &lt;/p&gt;
