    <title>Samsung’s profits rose in 2020 despite the pandemic</title>

  &lt;p id="5fyUHE"&gt;Samsung Electronics has &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fy-2020-results"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; its fourth-quarter earnings, confirming that the company made more money in 2020 than the year before despite the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating profit was up to 35.99 trillion won ($32.1 billion) off 236.81 trillion won ($211.5 billion) in revenue, increases of 29.6 percent and 2.78 percent respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEz8rU"&gt;Samsung says its fourth-quarter results were helped by its “company-wide efforts to ensure a stable supply of products and services globally” in the pandemic environment. Quarterly profit was up 26.4 percent year-on-year, largely driven by the display and memory businesses, though the latter was down quarter to quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ANV36K"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy S21 review: nice for the price","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="1gqgzi"&gt;Samsung’s display business had its highest ever quarterly earnings, which the company mainly attributes to high demand from major smartphone manufacturers. (Samsung doesn’t spell it out, but this was the quarter that Apple outfitted its entire new iPhone 12 lineup with OLED panels.) Samsung also reduced its losses from larger displays like TVs and monitors, and calls out a greater demand for contactless services as a contributing factor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qb3f1d"&gt;Samsung expects mobile profit to increase this quarter thanks to the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Galaxy S21 series&lt;/a&gt;, and says it plans to expand its lineup of foldable devices. The display division, meanwhile, expects OLED penetration to continue to increase throughout the smartphone market and beyond, with wider applications in laptops, tablets, and cars. The company will also pursue growth with foldable and slidable displays.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s next iOS 14 beta will begin forcing developers to ask for permission to track you</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ck1xmBMqNbXEgXByF6K_VwzAzk4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68732132/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aaqfdv"&gt;Apple’s new privacy feature requiring developers ask  for permission to track iOS users for ad targeting is at last going live in the next iOS 14 beta with a planned full release some time this spring for non-beta users, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="87OaT5"&gt;The announcement coincides with Data Privacy Day, as well as a speech on privacy from Apple CEO Tim Cook later today at the Computers, Privacy and Data Protection conference in Brussels. Apple initially planned for the feature to go live with the launch of iOS 14 last fall, but it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;delayed its implementation to 2021&lt;/a&gt; in September of last year to give developers more time to comply. Today’s announcement narrows the launch window to this spring, but Apple is not commenting further on when exactly we might see it go live for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nd7oq5"&gt;Called App Tracking Transparency, the new opt-in requirement will mark a significant shift in how mobile app developers are able to collect data on iPhone owners and share that data with other firms to aid in advertising. Prior to the change, Apple let iPhone owners dig into their settings to disable this type of tracking. Now, instead of forcing users to be proactive about disabling it, Apple will demand developers ask for permission or risk suspension or removal from the App Store if they don’t comply or try to skirt the rules. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QVqaP8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;App Tracking Transparency will force developers to ask for permission to track iPhone users&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WUxx5P"&gt;The primary way advertisers are able to, say, know when you are shopping for a new hat on one app before serving you ads for that same hat on another app is that a unique identifying code, the so-called Identifier for Advertisers (IDFA), is linked to your device, collected by the first app, and shared with the second. That allows those apps to serve targeted ads and to measure whether the ad actually worked, for instance if you ended up purchasing that hat you saw in an Instagram ad by clicking an ad for the company’s online store in Google Chrome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwxSJD"&gt;Apple’s new opt-in requirement will make it so developers must have express consent from iOS device owners to allow their IDFA to be collected and shared across apps. App makers can still use other information you give them for the purpose of targeting advertising even if you opt not to let the app track you, but that information cannot be shared with another company for the purpose of ad tracking under Apple’s new policy. The sharing with other third-party companies is effectively what Apple refers to when it uses the word “tracking.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QHsXc9"&gt;Apple intends to strictly police any attempt to get around the opt-in requirement. For instance, it says app developers will not be allowed to disable app functionality of any kind if users say no to the opt-in, and that developers will also be barred from charging money or incentivizing users with in-app perks or giveaways to sway their decision one way or the other. Any app that tries to replace the IDFA with another identifying piece of information, like an email address, will be in violation of the opt-in requirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pBsYIk"&gt;Apple says the rules will also apply to its own apps, and the company already lets users disable personalized advertising the company serves within the App Store, Apple News, and the Stocks app using data it collects from your device. (It’s worth noting that ad personalization is not the same as ad tracking, and mobile app companies can still personalize ads so long as they can disclose that with an App Store privacy label.) Apple has no history of sharing the information it collects with other companies, either, and it makes that clear in its ad personalization toggle in the iOS settings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LgmZqk"&gt;This is expected to affect both the companies that run ad networks, like Facebook, and the companies paying for the ads, like the aforementioned unnamed hat seller. That’s precisely why Facebook has come out as arguably the biggest opponent to Apple’s new privacy measures, which include not only this new opt-in requirement but also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174017/apple-app-store-new-privacy-labels-ios-apps-public"&gt;app privacy labels it launched on the App Store last month&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yKojm"&gt;Facebook has positioned itself as a champion of small businesses that risk getting hurt by this privacy change, and small businesses do rely on Facebook’s ad network and its powerful targeting tools to reach customers. Past privacy changes to Apple’s mobile Safari browser did also have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising"&gt;legitimate negative consequences for ad-supported businesses&lt;/a&gt; like news websites. (&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;is an ad-supported news website.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="6AgPuV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook has emerged as arguably the biggest opponent to Apple’s new privacy measures&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jA9whl"&gt;But in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180102/facebook-new-newspaper-ad-apple-ios-14-privacy-prompt"&gt;full-page newspaper ads&lt;/a&gt; and statements to the press, Facebook has gone a step further and cast Apple as a hypocrite trying to exempt itself from the rules it forces on other developers and as greedy for encouraging app business models that rely less on advertising and more on subscriptions, of which Apple would theoretically get a cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nw5Hub"&gt;“Apple has every incentive to use their dominant platform position to interfere with how our apps and other apps work, which they regularly do to preference their own,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on an &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/facebook-ceo-zuckerberg-says-it.html"&gt;earnings call on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. “This impacts the growth of millions of businesses around the world, including with the upcoming iOS 14 changes.” Zuckerberg added that, “Apple may say they’re doing this to help people but the moves clearly track their competitor interests.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYOygv"&gt;Apple has consistently defended its choice as a way to give users more freedom over their privacy and refuted Facebook’s claims it intends to hold its first-party software to different standards. The showdown has emerged as one of the largest and most visible tech company feuds in recent memory, though it’s clear now Facebook has little to no leverage in the situation despite its defensiveness and public posturing. The changes are imminent, and Facebook will be forced to comply as it was with the privacy labels last month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yBm6te"&gt;To further hammer home its privacy philosophy, Apple has created a new online guide it’s calling “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fprivacy%2Fdocs%2FA_Day_in_the_Life_of_Your_Data.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F28%2F22253366%2Fapple-app-tracking-transparency-opt-in-requirement-beta-launch#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A Day in the Life of Your Data”&lt;/a&gt; that breaks down common ad tracking and targeting practices in the mobile app and web industries and presents statistics on the prevalence of these practices. Apple says the average mobile app contains six trackers that share your data with other apps, and that a “large and opaque industry has been amassing increasing amounts of personal data.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6M300o"&gt;“A complex ecosystem of websites, apps, social media companies, data brokers, and ad tech firms track users online and offline, harvesting their personal data. This data is pieced together, shared, aggregated, and monetized, fueling a $227 billion-a-year industry,” the guide reads. “This occurs every day, as people go about their daily lives, often without their knowledge or permission.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTlXLA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Garmin says the Lily is ‘the smartwatch women have been waiting for’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Garmin’s Lily smartwatch on an actual person" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cnxz84el2btm5xvu39Ue_aefspE=/1012x0:2440x952/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68731969/02_pplonmove_ccfe7178_023b_4046_b131_b5b215ba7470.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kg67RX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210127005158/en/Garmin-unveils-Lily-its-smalle%5B%E2%80%A6%5DYOgHlBiZQk2LOzmn6JePCpHPCiYGaEx4DL1Rq8pNwkf3AarimpDzQGuQ=="&gt;Garmin has released a new smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; called the Lily, and its main selling point is that Garmin claims it’s designed by women, for women. The Sport Edition, which is made of aluminum and has a silicone band, costs $199, while the stainless steel Classic Edition is $250 and comes with a leather band. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KBGECy"&gt;Garmin claims it’s “the smartwatch women have been waiting for,” which seems based on its size and design, which is very fashion-forward. However, &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/garmin-lily-review-1193939/"&gt;as reviewer Lily Katz from &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt; in her review of the Lily, the watch may have given up a few important features to achieve those looks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CAsFShxKppLGZEJ8KGanRoC0FWQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264180/01_bigfeatures_8f6bca25_297f_4efd_9f35_2da35205fd8b.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Garmin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;To its credit, the Lily looks very much like a regular watch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HhjvT6"&gt;One of the Lily’s main selling points is that it’s small. It’s circular, with a diameter of 34.5mm, whereas the smaller 40mm Apple Watch SE is a 40mm by 34mm rectangle. Area-wise, that means the Apple Watch takes up 1,360 square millimeters on your wrist, while the Lily only takes 935. By my calculations, that means the Lily will cover 31 percent less of your wrist. It’s Garmin’s smallest smartwatch, and I’d imagine it’d look comically small next to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/8/29/20838081/garmin-fenix-6-solar-price-date"&gt;the company’s rugged Fenix watches&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g2IXcP"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qXv3ruNvlv8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4JsKcy"&gt;The watch is circular, to look more like a “classic” non-smartwatch, and it has a patterned background. The screen is touch-sensitive, but monochromatic, which seems a bit lacking when similarly-priced offerings from Apple, Fitbit, and Samsung all have color screens. That said, it’s probably to help preserve battery life, as Garmin claims it should get up to five days, which is pretty impressive given its size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDxPUi"&gt;If the watch’s band design is important to you, though, you may want to look elsewhere: the Lily’s straps are proprietary, and it doesn’t seem like Garmin is selling any more on its store yet. Additionally, you can’t mix and match bands — the colors are matched to the case. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hy8RfexPt2d3LNQXEKXSXqfPKIM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264175/productfan_1591a957_7cb4_4966_a84d_123ed85cd272.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Garmin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The different watch colors and editions also have different background lens designs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k9WYzM"&gt;Garmin focuses a lot on fitness and wellness tracking with its smartwatches, and the Lily can track steps, workouts, sleep, stress levels, blood oxygen saturation, periods, and pregnancies. Of course, none of those things are unique to this smartwatch — most of Garmin’s other smartwatches feature the fitness tracking, and there are at least two others that feature the period and pregnancy tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLdtdC"&gt;This means you have to decide whether you like the Lily’s looks enough to make some trade-offs. The Lily doesn’t have GPS, offline music, or Garmin Pay built-in like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21451145/garmin-venu-sq-music-edition-smartwatch-gps-spotify-nfc-wearable-blood-oxygen"&gt;Garmin’s own Venu Sq&lt;/a&gt;, which sells for the same price. There are also other $200-ish smartwatches from other brands that are more feature-rich than the Lily, but to some they may not look as nice. A smartwatch could have all the features in the world, but be totally useless if you find it too ugly to wear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x7Ke2n"&gt;There’s also not a lot of competing smartwatches that are as small as the Lily, so buyers concerned with having something take up the bulk of their wrist may also be interested. It’s just worth considering what features you’re willing to give up, and whether you’re willing to deal with some of &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/garmin-lily-review-1193939/"&gt;the other caveats reviewers have found&lt;/a&gt;. The watch is available now &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbuy.garmin.com%2Fen-US%2FUS%2Fp%2F698519%2Fpn%2F010-02384-02&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F27%2F22253056%2Fgarmin-lily-smartwatch-designed-for-women-small#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;from Garmin’s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>r/WallStreetBets went private — and now it’s back with a message</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fm2mk6x45QHtA0YzSyR4-DD0ZYI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68731247/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3ygczh"&gt;The r/WallStreetBets subreddit’s own moderators made it private for a little less than an hour on Wednesday evening, Reddit confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;  — but now, it’s back, with a new post from the moderators themselves that doesn’t quite explain why it vanished in the first place. The subreddit has seen a significant increase in attention in recent days following the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;meteoric rise in GameStop’s stock&lt;/a&gt; driven in part by traders on the forum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUYnY9"&gt;“We have grown to the kind of size we only dreamed of in the time it takes to get a bad nights sleep,” reads &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6j4r9/where_do_we_go_from_here_and_who_is_going_to_step/"&gt;a new post from the mods&lt;/a&gt;, one which you can read in its entirety at the bottom of this post in case it disappears. “We’ve got so many comments and submissions that we can’t possibly even read them all, let alone act on them as moderators,” the post continues, addressing how the community &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253251/discord-bans-the-r-wallstreetbets-server"&gt;has also been banned from Discord&lt;/a&gt; and how they believe Reddit’s tools are insufficient to moderate bad behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hu8DFI"&gt;The post also points to a Twitter account, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wsbmod"&gt;@wsbmod&lt;/a&gt;, which is intended to be the official voice of the moderator team in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tJr0dS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How r/WallStreetBets gamed the stock of GameStop ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="KMoVs9"&gt;During the time the subreddit was private, there were a few different messages shown to visitors. When I checked the subreddit at 7:06PM ET, I saw this message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ayzF1m"&gt;We are experiencing technical difficulties based on unprecedented scale as a result of the newfound interest in WSB. We are unable to ensure Reddit’s content policy and the WSB rules are enforceable without a technology platform that can support automation of this enforcement. WSB will be back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/53chGWnjtZM6iC4kB-x7304S_LE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264496/Screen_Shot_2021_01_27_at_4.07.09_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L3pwBm"&gt;Before that, the page showed this message: “WallStreetBets is under in tents load and is only for approved submitters. In the meantime, please enjoy some spaghetti,” followed by a link to a NSFW video of a man putting spaghetti all over his body.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JZynvoi3RaHJrANIfD9V2l9UpHQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264493/Screen_Shot_2021_01_27_at_4.04.06_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="s4RjHK"&gt;And when the r/WallStreetBets was first made private, the message read, “like 4Chan found a Bloomberg Terminal,” which was the description of the subreddit previous to it being made private.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;p id="08QAtr"&gt;Mysteriously, some people claimed they lost their existing access to r/WallStreetBets when it went private:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4eI0fB"&gt;Earlier on Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253251/discord-bans-the-r-wallstreetbets-server"&gt;Discord banned the r/WallStreetBets server&lt;/a&gt;. The company said that the Discord was banned for “continuing to allow hateful and discriminatory content after repeated warnings.” Many posts on the subreddit contain offensive language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUWjLj"&gt;Here is the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6j4r9/where_do_we_go_from_here_and_who_is_going_to_step/"&gt;full post&lt;/a&gt; from the r/WallStreetBets moderators:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="zgKoG5"&gt;We have grown to the kind of size we only dreamed of in the time it takes to get a bad nights sleep. We’ve got so many comments and submissions that we can’t possibly even read them all, let alone act on them as moderators. We wrote software to do most of the moderation for us but that software isn’t allowed to read the Reddit new feed fast enough and submit responses, and the admins haven’t given us special access despite asking for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h5nRQi"&gt;We’re suffering from success and our Discord was the first casualty. You know as well as I do that if you gather 250k people in one spot someone is going to say something that makes you look bad. That room was golden and the people that run it are awesome. We blocked all bad words with a bot, which should be enough, but apparently if someone can say a bad word with weird unicode icelandic characters and someone can screenshot it you don’t get to hang out with your friends anymore. Discord did us dirty and &lt;strong&gt;I am not impressed with them destroying our community&lt;/strong&gt; instead of stepping in with the wrench we may have needed to fix things, especially after we got over 1,000 server boosts. That is pretty unethical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQnTJH"&gt;To add to this, people are co-opting our name on twitter. I won’t mention their accounts, but lots of handles with “wsb” and “wallstreetbets” in them are pretending to speak for us. They’re saying things that we don’t agree with, driving traffic to derivative communities and shitty pixelated merch stores, and generally making it harder for us to define who we are. There’s also too much political bullshit in a community that was never &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt; political. The only way I want to occupy Wall St is in a suit myself or rent-free in the mind of a blown up short.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8HoB0"&gt;That is why I’m throwing my support behind the Twitter handle in general. We need a way to PUBLICLY reach out to the staff of the infrastructure that is failing us so the world can see that we aren’t doing anything wrong here if they don’t respond. We need to be able to respond directly to a reporter that is lying to the world about our clubhouse. We can’t be expected to meet any expectations when we aren’t given the tools we need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6F0MF1"&gt;That’s not to say I approve of every message or will even be in the loop for all of them, but it’s clear to me we can’t do nothing and we need a megaphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nknVqB"&gt;&lt;a href="http://twitter.com/wsbmod"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;http://twitter.com/wsbmod&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; aka &lt;strong&gt;@wsbmod&lt;/strong&gt; is the only Twitter handle whose statements are directly from some part of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ui1eP2"&gt;We’ll do our best not to pretend to speak for you, but to try to speak with the volume our name now seems to command to get shit done for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="kn4Rfo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 27th, 8:01PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;r/WallStreetBets has reopened, with a message from a moderator, which we have added.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGUwag"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMhN3y"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;The story of r/WallStreetBets&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="FvTBIJ"&gt;Subreddit r/WallStreetBets has been the talk of the Internet this week, as its members have driven GameStop’s stock prices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;from around $20 to over $300&lt;/a&gt;. The community brands itself as “like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal,” and as time has gone on, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251964/amc-stock-price-reddit-wallstreetbets-trading-gamestop"&gt;targeted other unlikely stocks&lt;/a&gt; like AMC, Blackberry, and Tootsie Roll. They’ve also been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253251/discord-bans-the-r-wallstreetbets-server"&gt;banned from Discord for hate speech&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3YeM5"&gt;If you want to read about how the group was able to manipulate the stocks of a massive company like GameStop — and the potential fallout — maybe start &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;with our explainer?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla’s new Model S will apparently play Witcher 3 on a built-in 10 teraflop gaming rig</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/umELrsZKL6bM1rGQ-mmRGGr1dr0=/0x0:1201x801/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68731081/tesla_model_s_witcher_3_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BAwode"&gt;If you can’t find a PS5 or Xbox Series X, how about an $80,000 electric sports car with comparable performance? Tesla just announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252832/tesla-model-s-redesign-plaid-mile-range-interior-refresh"&gt;its refreshed Model S today&lt;/a&gt;, and a new “Plaid” powertrain isn’t its only performance enhancement — the company claims the car can now compete with next-gen gaming consoles, thanks to a 10-teraflop gaming computer that will apparently come with every new model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFSUiR"&gt;Assuming that refers to GPU performance and Tesla isn’t wildly exaggerating, that might indeed be competitive with a PS5 or Xbox Series X, which offer 10.28 teraflops and 12 teraflops of raw GPU power respectively. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21718936/xbox-series-x-ps5-performance-game-comparison"&gt;There’s more to performance than teraflops, though&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zoaRUdHMjos_BSVPCoPHChvV2FE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264387/tesla_model_s_witcher_3_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hnqGQ6"&gt;Now, you might ask: who’s going to put a game in your car that might actually take advantage of a gaming PC? For that, I must ask you to look closely at the images above and below. Behold: CD Projekt’s acclaimed sword-slinging adventure &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/12/8586515/witcher-3-wild-hunt-review-ps4-xbox-one-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;just as Musk foretold: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wc3vE1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Want to play The Witcher game on your Tesla? (you can already watch the show on Tesla Netflix theater)&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1219881215156801537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 22, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ALM8S6"&gt;Here are a number of things we still do not know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="govTzt"&gt;Is &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt; actually coming to Tesla, and when? (We’ve asked CD Projekt.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aLUv3g"&gt;Can you play it on the 17-inch, 2200 x 1300-pixel main display, or only on the 8-inch second row display? Or both?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mMh3WH"&gt;Will you need a new controller? (Tesla says it has “wireless controller compatibility” but that’s all we know.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xYMsbj"&gt;Who’s making the GPU? (We’ve pinged Nvidia and AMD.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RybmF7"&gt;Who is going to sit in their $80,000 sports car and play a 70+ hour game? (fingers crossed for cloud saves)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ktgx6v"&gt;Why not &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk? &lt;/em&gt;(Okay, this one’s a joke.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U2_PNft9jF1DDMgDvFH5m_LKfWY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22264385/tesla_model_s_witcher_3_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nGRD56"&gt;You can see the claims for yourself at Tesla’s Model S website, though they’re a little buried: you have to &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/models/design#overview"&gt;go to the shop&lt;/a&gt;, scroll down to “Interior” and click on “Feature Details.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GY8bFi"&gt;Tesla’s been bringing games to its cars for a while now: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18684297/tesla-arcade-model-3-hands-on-beach-buggy-racing-2-demo-electric-cars"&gt;we tried out Tesla Arcade on a Model 3 back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and both the first level of &lt;em&gt;Cuphead&lt;/em&gt; and a car karaoke mode &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/26/20885822/tesla-software-version-10-now-available-features-netflix-youtube-spotify"&gt;came to the company’s in-car software&lt;/a&gt; later that year. &lt;em&gt;Fallout Shelter &lt;/em&gt;was added to the cars last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord bans the r/WallStreetBets server</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7eIfUrti3enf32l9-XgZmbQ4Eck=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68730932/acastro_200318_1777_discord_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JDsAv0"&gt;Discord has banned the r/WallStreetBets server, the company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Reddit’s WallStreetBets subreddit is the driver of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;an unprecedented rally of GameStop stock,&lt;/a&gt; and has received a great deal of attention in the press as the stock continues to soar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tIgwNu"&gt;Discord says it did not ban the server for financial fraud — rather, it was banned because it continued to allow “hateful and discriminatory content after repeated warnings.” &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;gained access to the server and can confirm the claim that users of the channel were spamming hateful language, including racial slurs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZoNEs"&gt;Here is Discord’s full statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="eBVyJl"&gt;The server has been on our Trust &amp;amp; Safety team’s radar for some time due to occasional content that violates our Community Guidelines, including hate speech, glorifying violence, and spreading misinformation. Over the past few months, we have issued multiple warnings to the server admin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RjRZJQ"&gt;Today, we decided to remove the server and its owner from Discord for continuing to allow hateful and discriminatory content after repeated warnings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UIL02D"&gt;To be clear, we did not ban this server due to financial fraud related to GameStop or other stocks. Discord welcomes a broad variety of personal finance discussions, from investment clubs and day traders to college students and professional financial advisors. We are monitoring this situation and in the event there are allegations of illegal activities, we will cooperate with authorities as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="gO5d2y"&gt;r/WallStreetBets describes itself as “like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal,” and many comments on the subreddit contain offensive language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mjLqVf"&gt;Shortly after Discord banned the server, the moderators &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253339/reddit-wallstreetbets-subreddit-private-gamestop"&gt;made the entire r/WallStreetBets subreddit private as well&lt;/a&gt;, taking it dark for nearly an hour. When it returned, the moderators of the subreddit &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6j4r9/where_do_we_go_from_here_and_who_is_going_to_step/"&gt;had a message about the Discord ban&lt;/a&gt; which you can read below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="3rM9gx"&gt;We’re suffering from success and our Discord was the first casualty. You know as well as I do that if you gather 250k people in one spot someone is going to say something that makes you look bad. That room was golden and the people that run it are awesome. We blocked all bad words with a bot, which should be enough, but apparently if someone can say a bad word with weird unicode icelandic characters and someone can screenshot it you don’t get to hang out with your friends anymore. Discord did us dirty and &lt;strong&gt;I am not impressed with them destroying our community&lt;/strong&gt; instead of stepping in with the wrench we may have needed to fix things, especially after we got over 1,000 server boosts. That is pretty unethical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="idOBMn"&gt;The bold text was present in the original post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9M335U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How r/WallStreetBets gamed the stock of GameStop ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="sDHhp4"&gt;During the time the Discord server was live, it was chaotic, with messages coming in at a rapid rate and many voices talking over each other simultaneously. Check out &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1354532238524874753"&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; from my colleague Tom Warren to get an idea of what was like (note: you may want to turn down your volume before clicking play, as the voices are quite loud):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="INdLRU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;the main Discord call for wallstreetbets is true online chaos    &lt;a href="https://t.co/cq8QOyHj6m"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cq8QOyHj6m&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1354532238524874753?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CGvgiS"&gt;Although the original r/WallStreetBets Discord server was banned, the subreddit now links to what appears to be a new official server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1njV6K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 27th, 9:05PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added that a r/WallStreetBets&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;links to a new Discord.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple says there are now over 1 billion active iPhones</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PzxQHS"&gt;Apple says there are now more than 1 billion active iPhones, an enormous milestone for the company that speaks to the phones’ continued success and longevity. There are now 1.65 billion Apple devices in active use overall, Tim Cook said during Apple’s earnings call this afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laKAjl"&gt;The milestone had been approaching for a while. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/27/12302542/apple-billion-iphones-sold"&gt;sold its billionth iPhone&lt;/a&gt; in 2016, and in January 2019, Apple said that it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/29/18202736/apple-devices-ios-earnings-q1-2019"&gt;hit 900 million active iPhone users&lt;/a&gt;. Apple counts a device as active if it has engaged with an Apple service within the past 90 days, a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The stat would suggest that a substantial number of the iPhones ever sold remain in active use, at least by Apple’s definition. &lt;a href="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/apple-nears-two-billionth-iphone-sale-13-years-after-launch-1.1371339"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BNN Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported last year&lt;/a&gt; that analysts believed Apple would be approaching its 1.9 billionth iPhone sale by the end of 2020, though the company hasn’t announced if it’s passed that milestone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HzIfJ6"&gt;Apple’s announcement came during an enormous quarter for the company, in which it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252663/apple-q1-2021-earnings-iphone-12-mac-sales"&gt;set an all-time revenue record&lt;/a&gt;. iPhones did particularly well during the final quarter of 2020, with sales of $65 billion, another record (though one that was helped by delays pushing iPhone 12 sales fully into the holiday quarter). And the company saw more iPhone “upgraders” than ever before. Cook also said that a record-setting number of FaceTime calls were made on Christmas 2020 — a milestone that was certainly helped along by the pandemic keeping many families and friends apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ECdPrQ"&gt;While sales are up and usage is at an all-time high, Apple has spent the last several years trying to diversify its product line as iPhone unit sales slow. Analysts have estimated a decline in &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1849696/apples-drop-in-iphone-sales-are-part-of-a-global-demand-shock/"&gt;overall phone shipments&lt;/a&gt; and sales in recent years, and &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/heres-an-interesting-chart-iphone-unit-sales-have-been-declining-steadily-for-five-years/"&gt;Apple hasn’t been immune&lt;/a&gt; to the trend. But even if fewer iPhones are being put into people’s hands each year, people are evidently hanging on to them for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q59gy9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 27th, 7:10PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated with details on how Apple measures active devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 bans unauthorized Keanu Reeves sex</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dbFcMSPFO0ngfVR6UJMHEQWNolA=/0x45:1570x1092/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68730736/Screen_Shot_2021_01_27_at_4.46.27_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bt5HZL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; creator CD Projekt Red would kindly like modders to stop making Keanu Reeves into a sex object. Following a fan mod that allowed players to have sex with Reeves’ character, Johnny Silverhand, the developer told &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/cdpr-shuts-down-cyberpunk-mod-that-let-players-have-sex-with-keanu-reeves/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;user-generated content cannot be “harmful towards others” — especially when it comes to mods. “In the case of model swaps, especially those that involve explicit situations, it can be perceived as such by the people who lent us their appearance for the purpose of creating characters in &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077,&lt;/em&gt;” the developer said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4MZP1"&gt;It’s worth noting that Reeves’ character does have an in-game sex scene, though it plays out from his perspective. As Johnny, the player has sex with a blonde woman who inexplicably dumps good liquor onto her white top to a backdrop of guitar riffs, while Johnny bounces her around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxxL28"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-01-26-people-are-modding-cyberpunk-2077-to-have-sex-with-keanu-reeves"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;first reported on the Nexus Mods files that swapped a sex worker “joytoy” character model for Reeves’ Johnny. In the mod, Johnny — who remains clothed — is now the sexualized character seen through the players’ eyes. It also uses the joytoy’s voice acting throughout the brief scene. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QyOAGJ"&gt;It’s typical for players to personalize their experience through mods, and the&lt;em&gt; Cyberpunk &lt;/em&gt;community has been doing so since the game’s release. CD Projekt Red just released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252373/cyberpunk-2077-official-mod-support"&gt;official modding tools&lt;/a&gt;. However, the mod — which has since been &lt;a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/990?tab=description"&gt;hidden&lt;/a&gt; by the creator on Nexus Mods — crosses that boundary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AMUAjw"&gt;“For the characters we’ve invented for the game, we broadly permit you to tweak the game at will and just have fun,” CD Projekt Red told &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt;. “When it comes to models of real people whom we’ve asked to participate in the game, we kindly ask you to refrain from using them in any situation that might be found offensive if you don’t have their explicit permission.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney pulls some movies from Disney Plus Kids profiles because they feature racist stereotypes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gMvvd8u65ArO_Qqmv14YwGuBvoA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68730669/acastro_190411_1777_Disney_Streaming_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8n05bw"&gt;The history of cinema is littered with racist stereotypes. (Call it the long tail of minstrel shows.) As cultural preferences have evolved — which is to say it’s now not cool to be racist — so have our films. In practice, what that means is some stuff just doesn’t hold up, especially when you’re showing it to kids. According to Disney, that includes classics like &lt;em&gt;Peter Pan &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Dumbo. &lt;/em&gt;Disney Plus will now not show those two films and some others to &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/disney-plus/2021/1/27/22252244/disney-plus-removes-peter-pan-dumbo-racist-stereotypes-kids-profiles"&gt;profiles that indicate the viewer is seven years old or younger&lt;/a&gt;. Other blocked movies include &lt;em&gt;Aristocats&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Lady and the Tramp&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Swiss Family Robinson&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Jungle Book.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wgldbm"&gt;It’s a big move, though adult accounts will still be able to access the blocked films. If you do decide to stream those films, there is a warning: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="LOY0lB"&gt;This program includes negative depictions and/or mistreatment of people or cultures. These stereotypes were wrong then and are wrong now. Rather than remove this content, we want to acknowledge its harmful impact, learn from it and spark conversation to create a more inclusive future together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmDwd1"&gt;Disney is committed to creating stories with inspirational and aspirational themes that reflect the rich diversity of the human experience around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OcI1gt"&gt;It’s not unprecedented. In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20963014/disney-plus-racism-cultural-disclaimer-dumbo-song-of-the-south-warner-bros-tom-jerry"&gt;Disney added warning labels back in 2019 for different movies on Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; (though they weren’t as strongly worded). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ls1qCA"&gt;The times, as they say, are a-changing. And if you’re curious, you can read more about Disney’s diversity efforts &lt;a href="https://storiesmatter.thewaltdisneycompany.com/"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;, part of its Stories Matter initiative. &lt;/p&gt;
