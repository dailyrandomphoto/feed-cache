    <title>Federal appeals court temporarily halts new Biden vaccine rule for companies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QSYpdy"&gt;A federal appeals court on Saturday issued a stay against the Biden administration’s vaccine rules for US companies. The new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22757969/biden-covid-vaccine-osha-cms-masking-federal-mandate"&gt;rule announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt; requires workers at businesses with 100 or more employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19, or submit to weekly testing. The rule requires affected companies to provide paid time for employees to get vaccinated, and to ensure any unvaccinated employees wear face masks while at work. The deadline for meeting the provisions is January 4th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhiljM"&gt;Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TXAG/status/1457045504710356999"&gt;petitioned for an emergency stay&lt;/a&gt; of the rule, which was to be enforced by the Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The petition was joined by attorneys general from Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Utah, and several private businesses and advocacy groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvUpzR"&gt;The three-judge panel with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals &lt;a href="https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/unpub/21/21-60845.0.pdf"&gt;said Saturday&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) that it was issuing the stay “because the petitions give cause to believe there are grave statutory and constitutional issues with the mandate.” The court didn’t provide additional detail for why it issued the stay, but the Biden administration now has until 5PM ET on Monday to respond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQIJFu"&gt;Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda said in a statement that the Labor Department was “confident” it has the legal authority to issue the rule, and was prepared to defend it in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TjBATH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Someone stole an entire shipment of EVGA RTX graphics cards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wMEddsflyzWfObLzoVgC8IHoc-k=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105438/twarren_20210601_4611_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="emXcPL"&gt;As if &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22363232/global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-pandemic-consoles-cpus-graphics-cards-cars"&gt;the chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; didn’t make it hard enough to get our hands on graphics cards, criminals are making it a heck of a lot worse. According to &lt;a href="https://forums.evga.com/Notice-of-Stolen-EVGA-GeForce-RTX-30Series-Graphics-Cards-m3490851.aspx"&gt;a forum post by EVGA product manager Jacob Freeman&lt;/a&gt;, thieves made off with a whole truckload of EVGA RTX 30-Series graphics cards. The graphic cards were in transit from San Francisco to EVGA’s southern California distribution center at the time of the theft, and it remains unclear how many cards were affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CIyZgg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If a user does end up acquiring a stolen card, we will address [it] on a case by case basis”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t613zi"&gt;If you think you may have a card that was involved in this theft, you can find out by entering your card’s serial number on &lt;a href="https://www.evga.com/warranty/check.asp"&gt;EVGA’s warranty status page&lt;/a&gt;. You can also check by attempting to register your card on the &lt;a href="https://forums.evga.com/Notice-of-Stolen-EVGA-GeForce-RTX-30Series-Graphics-Cards-m3490851.aspx"&gt;My Products&lt;/a&gt; section of this site — if you can properly register your card, you can rest assured that it wasn’t snatched from the shipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zr7V1k"&gt;The post warns users that it’s illegal to “buy or receive” stolen goods, as well as “conceal, sell, withhold, or aid in concealing selling or withholding” that property. EVGA also says that it “will not register or honor any warranty or upgrade claims“ on stolen cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5rOjC"&gt;Freeman couldn’t give &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; any more details about the truck heist due to an ongoing police investigation, however, he did say in an email that “If a user has a question we urge them to contact us [at] &lt;a href="mailto:stopRTX30theft@evga.com"&gt;stopRTX30theft@evga.com&lt;/a&gt;. If a user does end up acquiring a stolen card, we will address [it] on a case by case basis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N44g9f"&gt;This isn’t the first time that a large shipment of graphics cards has been stolen, and, unfortunately, it’s probably not the last. At the end of 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22164020/thieves-ps5-rtx-3090-out-of-stock-reselling"&gt;about $340,000 worth of GeForce RTX 3090s&lt;/a&gt; were stolen from MSI’s factory in mainland China. Graphics cards have become a prime target for thieves and scalpers — the MSRP for an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 is $1,499 but if scalpers have their way, this can skyrocket to $2,000 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stranger Things 4 will have a summer 2022 release date</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wsXjbNl8B7lcdFbb4eduOtXYTwA=/360x0:1628x845/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105313/eleven_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Eleven is back for Season 4 of Netflix’s Stranger Things series | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1ZQMpp4BdU&amp;amp;ab_channel=StrangerThings" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X07yfR"&gt;Netflix &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/netflix/status/1457045171367989251"&gt;tweeted Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 4 &lt;/em&gt;will premiere in the summer of 2022. While not a precise release date, it’s at least something for fans of Netflix’s flagship supernatural series, who have waited through months of delays and a seemingly endless parade of mysterious teasers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlL6gs"&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/6/22765252/stranger-things-4-teaser-trailer-2022-release-date-netflix"&gt;teaser dropped Saturday&lt;/a&gt; as well, showing Eleven in California, adjusting to her new life and school. She writes in a letter to Mike that everything is great (even though we see her classmates being mean to her), and says she can’t wait for spring break. But of course, our girl can’t have anything nice last for too long; after a fade to black, we get some eerie music under shots of a roller rink and Eleven looking afraid, along with helicopters, explosions, and Joyce recoiling from a creepy looking doll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7O337"&gt;We also got a look at the titles for all nine of the season 4 episodes for the first time. They will be called: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRP63l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hellfire Club, Vecna’s Curse, The Monster and The Superhero, Dear Billy, The Nina Project, The Dive, The Massacre At Hawkins Lab, Papa&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Piggyback&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Amqf3v"&gt;These do not sound like episodes where a lot of good times will be had by our heroine and her crew. And &lt;em&gt;Papa &lt;/em&gt;is what Eleven called Dr. Martin Brenner (Matthew Modine), whose return was signaled in an earlier season 4 &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;amp;v=ILwLN6hV-X8&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;amp;ab_channel=StrangerThings"&gt;teaser&lt;/a&gt; where we heard his voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="atF6yb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;What's in a name?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stranger Things 4 premiering Summer 2022. &lt;a href="https://t.co/leznp8XJbh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/leznp8XJbh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix (@netflix) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1457045171367989251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CMPrqy"&gt;The new announcements come as part of Netflix’s celebration of “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Stranger_Things/status/1456622489971343360"&gt;Stranger Things Day&lt;/a&gt;,” which is meant to “commemorate” the in-universe date of November 6th, 1983 — the day that Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) first disappeared into the dark Upside-Down dimension in the first season of &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things. &lt;/em&gt;(If one was feeling less charitable, one could also attribute it to a cynical and slightly desperate attempt to try and create a cash-in fan holiday for one of its most popular genre shows like May 4th’s “Star Wars Day.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wqyZHw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;November 6, 1983. The day Will Byers disappeared and the world turned upside down. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StrangerThingsDay?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StrangerThingsDay&lt;/a&gt; returns tomorrow   &lt;a href="https://t.co/sRVrGwtvi0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/sRVrGwtvi0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Stranger Things (@Stranger_Things) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Stranger_Things/status/1456622489971343360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uGA3Ip"&gt;It’s been a longer than usual wait for the fourth season after &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 3 — &lt;/em&gt;which was released in July 2019 — due to a months-long delay in production caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which shut down filming on &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 4 &lt;/em&gt;after just two weeks in early 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="to4XIi"&gt;Netflix hasn’t wasted any of that time, though, with a plethora of teasers for the fourth season that it’s been steadily releasing over the past several months, including one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21137590/netflix-stranger-things-4-trailer-character-teaser-missing-return"&gt;teases the return of a fan-favorite character&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422642/stranger-things-4-new-trailer-netflix-eleven"&gt;one that delves into Eleven’s dark past&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22688804/stranger-things-season-4-teaser-trailer-watch-netflix"&gt;and one that sets up a new spooky location, the Creel House&lt;/a&gt; (which presumably will feature in the upcoming fourth season). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfEblT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 6 appears to fall short of expected 30W charging speeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pNfsde9ODBND2xI1T3rhqcMqQww=/162x0:1935x1182/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105137/Google_Pixel_6_Pro__Alt_Angle_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HQ0Ucz"&gt;When Google released the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, it boasted about the devices’ fast-charging capabilities. Plugging a Pixel 6 series device into its &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/usb_c_30w_charger"&gt;$25 30W Fast Charger&lt;/a&gt; — which isn’t even included in the box — is supposed to take full advantage of the phone’s fast charging speed, juicing it up to 50 percent in just 30 minutes. We all can agree that this is an impressive spec, but unfortunately, it may not be totally realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tz4HxR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-6-charging-test-3051231/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; put the Pixel 6’s fast charging speed to the test, and its findings suggest that &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7158570"&gt;Google’s spec sheet&lt;/a&gt; is misleading. After trying out the 30W charger with the Pixel 6, &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; found that the Pixel 6 doesn’t fully harness the power of the charger — instead, it only hits a maximum charging speed of just 22W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R5zDeA"&gt;
&lt;div class="infogram-embed" data-id="_/XhxOon5FbW8f2n44upZj" data-type="interactive" data-title="Google Pixel 6 Pro Fast Charging Test"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;!function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&amp;&amp;window[t].initialized)window[t].process&amp;&amp;window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement("script");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zeJxCm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; notes that the charger took about 111 minutes to fully charge the Pixel 6 Pro’s 5,000mAh battery with its Adaptive Charging and Adaptive Battery settings switched off. Google is right; the device takes about 31 minutes for a 50 percent charge, however, filling up that final 50 percent takes much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6Q6Vy"&gt;The phone’s charging speed appears to dip all the way to 12W at 75 percent, and then 2.5W when the battery gets close to full, taking a whole hour to fill up the final 15 percent. While it’s normal for charging speeds to taper off over time to prevent damage to the battery and stave off high temperatures, dropping down to a mere 2.5W is still unusual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Gqelqf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The charger took a total of 111 minutes to fully charge the Pixel 6 Pro’s 5,000mAh battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MNYf1K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; even compared the charging speeds of the 30W Fast Charger with the 18W Power Delivery unit that Google included with older Pixels. It found that the 30W charger barely offers any improvement in terms of speed, as it takes 121 minutes to charge the Pixel 6 Pro with the 18W charger — only 10 minutes slower than the 30W Fast Charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyEKEy"&gt;This corroborates what we noticed during our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;hands-on Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro review&lt;/a&gt;. We pointed out that while both support fast charging, neither seemed to fuel up that fast. Also in line with &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;’s findings, we noted that Google throttles the charging speed after reaching 80 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcSQMf"&gt;Google doesn’t explicitly say that the Pixel 6 has a charging rate of 30W; it just says that both phones support “up to 50 percent charge in 30 minutes with Google 30W USB-C Charger with USB-PD 3.0 (PPS)” on its spec sheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYAfGD"&gt;But it still doesn’t make sense that Google would promote the Fast Charger if the Pixel 6 can’t take full advantage of it. Not to mention that Google is encouraging users to buy the charger under the guise that it really does provide lightning-fast charging rates — is 10 minutes really worth an extra $25?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84waxz"&gt;Google is also set to release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22732918/google-pixel-stand-23w-wireless-charging"&gt;a second-gen $79 Google Pixel Stand fast wireless charger&lt;/a&gt; sometime in the near future. The &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_stand_2nd_gen"&gt;“superfast wireless charger” is listed as&lt;/a&gt; providing charging speeds of up to 23W “for compatible Pixel phones,” which is closer to the 22W charging rate that the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro tops out at. It remains unclear why Google would give more realistic expectations for the upcoming wireless charger, and not for the 30W Fast Charger. We reached out to Google with a request for comment on the situation and didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack in the Box suing crypto exchange FTX, says it ‘brazenly’ copied its Jack mascot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/azq-zc8UuSV_K7m9z7qUGLR79w0=/184x0:903x479/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105071/jack_mascots.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jack in the Box is suing a crypto exchange it says copied its longtime mascot. Left is Moon Man, right is Jack.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WUuzEN"&gt;Restaurant chain Jack in the Box says it is suing cryptocurrency exchange FTX because it “brazenly and illegally copied or derived its ‘Moon Man’ mascot” from its established Jack mascot, and is doing damage to the Jack in the Box brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="viRPw6"&gt;In a lawsuit filed in federal court in the Northern District of California this week, Jack in the Box claims that FTX’s Moon Man character, aka Lou Nar, “has a spherical white head also affixed to a talking human actor, with blue-dotted eyes, a nose, and a smile,” which is “strikingly similar to Jack. Both change their facial expressions and clothing throughout ads and appearances,” the suit maintains. Moon Man, however, is a “far inferior version” of Jack, the restaurant chain argues, and is  “tarnishing Jack’s reputation to consumers, and/or blurring consumers’ association of FTX’s Moon Man with Jack.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOeH5h"&gt;The company pointed to tweets about ads featuring Moon Man that were aired during a Major League Baseball game:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CQVxmw"&gt;...viewers of that baseball game shared their reactions on Twitter as to who the “big head” might be, with one user posting a picture of Jack, stating that the Moon Man is the “Jack in the Box mascot.” Other members of the public have made statements such as “Oh look, it’s Walmart Jack in the Box!”, “Is it a dirty jack in the box thing?”, and “Jack in the Box’s drugged up cousin”, among others, which all demonstrate that viewers were associating the Moon Man with Jack. One Twitter user even tweeted a public post directly to FTX stating, “Hey, @FTX_Official, your mascot doesn’t look like the moon. He looks like Jack-In-The-Box with skin cancer.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="j2wTln"&gt;Jack in the Box served FTX with a cease-and-desist letter on October 15th, according to the lawsuit, notifying the crypto exchange that it was “infringing on JITB’s intellectual property and diluting its trademarks.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Zjv90"&gt;In response, FTX said it would continue to use Moon Man in advertising, the lawsuit claims, saying that “Jack in the Box has only narrow protection limited to the behatted ping pong-headed clown who exploded out of a box to sell burgers.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6t2uUHzEjwV9e0A_eLl5Lf4NK7s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22991323/jack_moon_man_2.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Moon Man (left) and Jack (right). &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JvFTda"&gt;Jack in the Box says the Jack mascot was first released in 1951, and it’s gone through a few iterations since. At first Jack was a “clown-like spherical head that sat atop drive-thru boxes to ease customers into the then-novel concept of drive-thru restaurants,” according to the suit, then in 1970 it became more clown-like, with green hair and a large rainbow collar added. The company “reimagined” the mascot in 1995, into the current version: a “humorous no-nonsense businessman”  who “appears like a typical adult human male, with the exception of his large, spherical white head, blue dot eyes, nose, and curvy smile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C8blFM"&gt;The suit was first reported by legal news site &lt;a href="https://www.law360.com/securities/articles/1438006/jack-in-the-box-says-crypto-exchange-ripped-off-its-mascot?copied=1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Law360&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Neither Jack in the Box nor FTX replied to requests for comment from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1hzpOQ"&gt;Jack in the Box says FTX has infringed on its copyright and diluted its trademark, and is seeking unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Riot swapped a live show for a massive music video at Worlds 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8KMRUcaWN5Nif_mRpQI_ohGKsOs=/0x2:8033x5357/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70104983/CYW_WorldsOC_Set_015.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w9008O"&gt;Every year, one of the highlights of the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;World Championship is the opening ceremonies. It’s been a regular chance for developer Riot to create a real-world spectacle ahead of the big game. In the past that’s meant everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20959206/league-of-legends-worlds-2019-opening-ceremony-holograms-holonet"&gt;holographic musical performances&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/31/21541871/league-of-legends-world-championship-worlds-2020-opening-ceremony-ar-kda"&gt;an appearance from an augmented reality K-pop group&lt;/a&gt;. In 2021, though, things went in a different direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kV6afJ"&gt;Without an audience in attendance due to COVID-19 restrictions, Riot instead went with a pre-produced series of music videos that featured gigantic real-world sets spliced with moments from the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Arcane &lt;/em&gt;animated series. It may not have been a live performance, but it was still impressive. “This is really what feature films do, what Marvel does,” says Matt Kauth, head of production at London Alley Entertainment, which worked with Riot on the piece.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CyxJhq"&gt;What premiered before Worlds’ championship match was essentially a 13-minute-long short film that combined animation, music videos, and physical sets. It featured a handful of performances from the likes of Imagine Dragons and Bea Miller, interspersed with animated vignettes from &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;, which debuts on Netflix this evening. The idea of mixing live-action and CG isn’t exactly new, but part of what makes the Worlds event work so well is the sprawling real-world sets designed to look like Zaun and Piltover, two iconic cities from &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; (which are featured prominently in the Netflix show).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/54IkKp1SE5jQb4vgTiCY1mQ1kEg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989614/CYW_WorldsOC_BTS_031.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Riot&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5ZFlsQ"&gt;“These are the biggest sets that we’ve ever done, and it’s probably not even close,” says Kauth, whose studio has worked on music videos for the likes of Lil Nas X and The Weeknd. “We shot this whole piece over three days in Los Angeles and three days in Birmingham, UK. It is also the busiest it has ever been in the production landscape right now. Both because we’re coming out of the other side of covid, but also because all of the streaming that’s happening. It’s never been busier, and crews are very hard to come by. The LA shoot, we were literally taking construction members rolling off of TV shows. And adding new crew members every single day in order to meet this time frame.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U9zgMP"&gt;Music videos were always part of the plan. But initially Riot had hoped to incorporate a live element as well. That changed when the company was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22649691/league-of-legends-world-championships-2021-europe"&gt;forced to move the event from Shenzhen, China to Reykjavík, Iceland&lt;/a&gt; due to covid concerns. “We actually always intended for there to be this integration of music videos and more cinematic performances,” says Nick Troop, executive producer of the event for Riot. “Even when Worlds was still situated in Shenzhen, we were going to shoot these videos this way. This was the general plan. And part of the magic of the stadium show was going to be to build this interplay between the live show and the stuff that was pre-recorded, and use that to elevate what was happening in-stadium.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0K8pHF"&gt;The focus on physical sets is a contrast to past Worlds, where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21529317/league-of-legends-world-championship-high-tech-stage-riot-mandalorian"&gt;new technologies like mixed reality were on full display&lt;/a&gt;. Part of the reason for the choice was practical. With a short timeline to finish the production, the physical sets would put less strain on the various VFX teams that worked on it. If the videos had been shot with a green screen, for instance, it would’ve taken much longer to finish because artists would’ve had to design the backdrops virtually from scratch. “Our goal was to make sure that we were capturing as much in-camera as possible, so that when we handed the baton off to the VFX departments, they had enough to work with,” explains Kauth. (Even still, five different studios and 230 people worked on wrapping the post-production effects.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/03XLnCzxuB-LRHthD2kgr4B-J3w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989619/CYW_WorldsOC_BTS_094.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Riot&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WJCOLz"&gt;But the IRL sets were also chosen because Riot thought it would help differentiate the opening ceremonies from the many other virtual performances that have been happening of late, particularly during the pandemic. Plus, it just looked cool. “You can feel when it’s real,” says Troop. “You live in a rendered world for the most part when you interact with &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. Here is one of a handful of opportunities to bring it to life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tigilh"&gt;It’s typical for large-scale movie productions, like those from Marvel, to utilize both large sets and multiple effects studio partners. But Kauth says it’s rare for shorter form projects like this. Not only did it help make the opening ceremonies look impressive, he says, but having so many people working on it also helped make it a more sustainable production where teams were able to largely avoid crunch. “It’s a film and TV approach to hit the deadline and not burn a single company into the ground,” he explains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tr6KvA"&gt;As impressive as the 2021 ceremony was, there is definitely something missing without an in-person audience. It’s hard for the team to know if viewers are into it without the roar of a crowd inside of a stadium. In lieu of that this year, they’ll be looking elsewhere for that initial rush of feedback. “I’ll be curious for sure,” says Troop. “I’ll be keeping an eye on Twitter and Twitch chat.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alienware X17 review: pretty pixels for a pretty penny</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It delivers the 4K future I’ve been waiting for, but it came at a weird time&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p-large-text" id="43sxgT"&gt;Alienware did it. Its latest 17.3-inch X17 gaming laptop can actually deliver an enjoyable 4K gaming experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YjZa3F"&gt;The last time I checked in on how laptops were faring with 4K gaming in 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20976363/razer-blade-pro-17-4k-120hz-display-gaming-laptop-review-specs-features-price"&gt;things weren’t looking so hot&lt;/a&gt;. Nvidia’s last-gen RTX 20-series mobile chips couldn’t work hard enough to smoothly run demanding games at 4K without several compromises to visual fidelity. Fortunately, things have changed for the better this year with the RTX 3080 — specifically, for the X17’s high-powered 16GB VRAM variant. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wFnDQt"&gt;The X17’s 3080 has a maximum graphics power level of 165W and a boost clock speed of 1,545MHz. That’s really powerful for a mobile GPU and close to the highest amount of power that Nvidia allows for its mobile graphics chips. It’s certainly the most graphically capable laptop that I’ve tested yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nI5Bzi"&gt;I’ll get to the performance numbers in a sec, but it’s important to note near the top that this is one of Alienware’s best gaming laptops yet, and not only because it &lt;em&gt;whips &lt;/em&gt;at gaming. Its X-series design is new for 2021, resulting in a slimmer and sleeker look that balances form and function better than most other models that have similar power levels without foregoing ports (more on that later). For gaming and other intensive tasks, its cooling system is efficient, keeping this 17.3-inch 4K beast both cool and surprisingly quiet. And even when you’re doing other stuff, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22333684/alienware-m15-m17-gaming-laptops-cherry-mx-ultra-low-mechanical-keyboard-switches-price"&gt;clicky Cherry ultra-low-profile mechanical switches&lt;/a&gt; are fun to type on. It’s a heavy laptop that you probably won’t want to lug around to many places, but functionally, the X17 is almost as good for work as it is for gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6axkpc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10847819"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="Cd0q4E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10847747"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qxMGMl"&gt;Despite these glowing remarks, if you were to ask me if you should buy this specific gaming laptop, I would advise against it unless you’re dead-set on getting a powerful 17.3-inch gaming laptop. It’s a tough sell &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-12839518?sid=VergeX17Review110521&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fcty%2Fpdp%2Fspd%2Falienware-x17-r1-laptop%3F%7Eck%3Dmn" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at its $3,680 asking price&lt;/a&gt;, as configured. (I will note that this similar &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fmsigs7611078.html&amp;amp;subid1=VergeX17Review110521"&gt;MSI GS76 Stealth&lt;/a&gt; configuration costs hundreds more than the X17, but has twice the amount of RAM. &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-laptops%2FRazer-Blade-17%2FRZ09-0406CE63-R3U1&amp;amp;subid1=VergeX17Review110521"&gt;Razer’s latest Blade 17&lt;/a&gt; costs $3,699 and has a 4K/120Hz touchscreen and a more capable processor, but has less storage, as configured, and its GPU isn’t as powerful.) Also, since I received this unit for review, Alienware has paused on accepting new orders because it needs to catch up with its supply chain backlog. A spokesperson said Alienware intends to offer it for sale again at some point in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VnJ32t"&gt;To test X17’s gaming performance, I ran some titles that have proven to be demanding at their highest graphical settings, starting with &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt;. At native 4K without Nvidia’s deep-learning supersampling (DLSS) tech that tends to give games a noticeable boost in frame rate (by lowering the render resolution and using AI to clean up the image), it ran at 46 frames per second. With DLSS set to auto and no other settings adjusted, the frame rate in 4K went up to 60 frames per second. Personally, I always lean on DLSS as much as any game will allow me to for those few extra free frames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="260muE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;’s benchmark registered an average of 55 frames per second without ray tracing. When I turned on ray tracing, DLSS dropped it slightly to 49 frames per second. On the other hand, DLSS running without the taxing ray tracing bumped it up to 64 frames per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4R9vvtq0Up_uat7LNlKskSxmmKI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859879/akrales_210915_4757_0036.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The design ID is similar to the M-series, but the X17 looks more elegant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sj-ESTJkjONRN4gLRIyJ28UpWqU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22989060/cfaulkner_211103_4757_0208.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Playing games like Deathloop on its max graphical settings in 4K is a joy on the X17.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hKDTmD"&gt;The X17 delivered similarly promising results with &lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt;. Both averaged around 55 to 70 frames per second with every possible setting switched to their highest option. With each game’s respective ray tracing settings on, performance was closer to around 50 frames per second, which is still phenomenal at this resolution. The best performing of the bunch at 4K was &lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt; without ray tracing, which sometimes sailed over 100 frames per second in smaller corridors, dropping to a steady 75 frames per second during frantic fights in larger environments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3Ou3O"&gt;These are all very playable frame rates, whether you decide to go the ray tracing route or take advantage of DLSS in games that support it. Also, since the X17 can run these demanding AAA games at 4K/60 without much of a struggle, many other games that aren’t as demanding should be able to take full advantage of its 120Hz refresh rate display in native 4K. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mNUOG4"&gt;I won’t lie: I wasn’t expecting this kind of reliable performance with this system, let alone with any other kind of thin-ish gaming laptop. I’ve seen similar specs in action before in other models, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22248630/msi-gs66-stealth-2021-review-rtx-3080-nvidia-qhd-1440p-gaming-laptop"&gt;I was less than impressed&lt;/a&gt;. While Alienware isn’t the first to use a 4K 120Hz display in a gaming laptop, or the aforementioned RTX 3080, it earns credit for cramming it all in a slim chassis that’s much more powerful, yet somehow quieter and cooler than some of the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x-N1nZGJQYbKfLTSL2IQuUofvSY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859889/akrales_210916_4757_0183.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The optional Cherry MX ultra-low profile mechanical switches are a worthy addition, since you’re already spending a ton of this laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A6UZSj"&gt;Digging more into what the X17 can do with its powerful components, its performance in Adobe Premiere Pro is as impressive as you might expect. During our test where we see how long it takes to churn out a 5-minute, 33-second 4K video, the X17 took three minutes, 22 seconds to get through the export process. For a more intensive benchmark, the PugetBench for Premiere Pro &lt;a href="https://www.pugetsystems.com/benchmarks/view.php?id=60260"&gt;scored competitively&lt;/a&gt; with similarly specced gaming desktops, which is both to be expected (and that price) and impressive. Funnily enough, Apple’s M1 Pro and M1 Max-equipped MacBook Pros each handily beat Alienware’s score, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;as we noted in our review&lt;/a&gt;. Those outliers aside, you’ll be hard-pressed to find this kind of performance in many other gaming laptops out right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fkFwAZ"&gt;It goes without saying, then, that the X17 didn’t see my usual workload as much of an obstacle. I typically run about 20 tabs in Microsoft Edge, along with Spotify, Slack, and Affinity Photo, and the X17 didn’t miss a beat. I realized once that I accidentally had around 40 tabs open in minimized Edge windows, but not even that caused a noticeable hitch or slowdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gbVdW6"&gt;The Windows Hello IR webcam here is good for logging in hands-free, but if you anticipate doing lots of video calls, the image quality is mediocre. The video feed looks passable if you’re in good light, but it proved unable to compensate for being rear-lit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eam59n_1mC3WS6B0sXQgkqQWf5c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859888/akrales_210916_4757_0159.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Windows Hello IR webcam is good at logging you in, but its 720p 1MP sensor doesn’t yield great results for video chats.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZAN8Yl"&gt;Battery life doesn’t seem to have been a high priority for Alienware since the X17 is primarily aimed at fast desktop-class 4K gaming performance while plugged in. But it’s not the worst we’ve seen, averaging almost four hours of mixed use with the workload that I mentioned above. It’d be tough for me to find a justification for lugging this heavy laptop away from its charger, though. It weighs about seven pounds, and its 330W charger is almost the size and weight of a literal brick. The good news about the power supply is that it recharges the X17 quickly, taking just over an hour to go from about 10 percent to full capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOYSEO"&gt;This X-series chassis is new for 2021, as I mentioned before, and it’s generally a positive evolution of the bulkier M-series design. It has the company’s signature Alienware alien logo as its power button, and its rear, where you’ll now find nearly all of the ports instead of just some of them, looks like the exhaust of a futuristic spaceship. That’s where most of the hot air from the X17’s quad-fan cooling system and the plentiful copper heatsinks is dispelled. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k4ewzx1cKtAnNKnO-MJoQb-7XW4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859883/akrales_210916_4757_0107.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The stylish, honeycomb-patterned rear exhaust design derived from the M-series still looks pretty cool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UHVxZb"&gt;In slimming down, Alienware didn’t make any major omissions in terms of ports. There are two USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 ports with PD charging (5V/3A), one of which is Thunderbolt 4. You also have two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports, a 2.5-gigabit Ethernet port, an HDMI 2.1 port, a micro SD slot, and a mini DisplayPort 1.4. On the right side, there’s a lone headphone jack, and on the left, there’s a plug for the power cable. Just in case you were curious, the X-series gaming laptops, along with the M15 R5 and R6 models, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/6/1/22464110/dell-alienware-graphics-amp-egpu-discontinued"&gt;don’t have Alienware’s graphics amplifier port&lt;/a&gt;, though it should support Thunderbolt GPU enclosures — not that this X17 needs any help in the graphics department.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtchZs"&gt;The two-toned body design is a small but appreciated tweak, as are a few areas around the laptop where Alienware softened its look. It rounded off the laptop’s corners that were previously angular and, frankly, leaning a little too hard into the “alien” aesthetic. Though if you didn’t like the look before, your feelings may not be changed here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4dIC-4K_ITX2CrAE-uzIuinM9jc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859882/akrales_210916_4757_0086.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some may dislike that you’ll have to reach to the back of the X17 to reach its ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alienware gets credit for cramming a lot of power into the thin section of its chassis.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tkn6lR"&gt;You can usually count on gaming laptops to bring the power, a nice display, and maybe ports, too, but you can’t always depend on getting a good keyboard to go with it. This version of the X17 includes the ultra-low-profile Cherry mechanical key switches that were first introduced on the M-series, and they feel fantastic to type on. They’re quiet for mechanical keys, but they have a much more satisfying “thock” feel than membrane laptop keyboards. I’m impressed by how many powerful components Alienware was able to cram into the thinnest section of its chassis, which is just under 16mm thick (its rear section shoots up to 22mm), with room to spare for a mechanical keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQHqdc"&gt;The key layout is intuitive, though some may be upset that the numpad is missing. I did encounter the occasional issue with the keyboard’s responsiveness. Sometimes, my first key press wouldn’t register, so I’d need to try again. It didn’t feel like an n-key rollover issue — just some strange latency with accepting the first input here and there. There were other times when the keyboard would suddenly stop accepting any input whatsoever, requiring a restart. It felt like the kind of thing that can be addressed with a patch, but it’s not an encouraging sign that I’m experiencing it several months after this laptop became available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bq_X68SxV4zmLJkACs2XsgVr_dQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859880/akrales_210915_4757_0038.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I would rather have a bigger trackpad than one that lights up, but it’d be better to have both.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware X17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cc9u7TsaoJ1oooTTla8h_mxhNpQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22859890/akrales_210916_4757_0184.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The X17 lacks the angular edges found on the M-series, giving it a more toned-down look.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="VUWOaJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10847705"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9JBTai"&gt;One weird inclusion with the RTX 3080 is the light-up trackpad that illuminates when you touch it, though the light goes out after a few seconds of inactivity. It’s just for show, but nevertheless, it’s a basic trackpad with support for Windows Precision drivers and gesture customization in Windows. I’d like to see Alienware follow in Razer and MSI’s footsteps and implement bigger trackpads instead of superfluous features like trackpad backlighting. This current one is a little too small, almost seeming to signal that you should use a dedicated mouse instead, which is usually my advice with most gaming laptops anyway. Speaking of accessories, grab a gaming headset, as the built-in speakers aren’t anything special. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpIFAI"&gt;Earlier this year, I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;heralded the arrival of QHD screens&lt;/a&gt; as “the best thing to happen to gaming laptops” because I felt a future where 4K gaming on a laptop was commonplace still seemed far off. I was excited because lowering the resolution from 4K to 1440p would mean that games would still look very good, yet more reasonably priced components would be able to run them, thus driving down the total cost of laptops. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;We now have a growing amount of powerful, fully featured QHD options&lt;/a&gt; that are cheaper than 4K laptops and well worth the cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xPKbrm"&gt;That leaves the Alienware X17 in a tough spot. On one hand, there’s nothing like gaming on a big 17.3-inch screen. The slightly smaller 16-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238671/16-9-aspect-ratio-hp-elite-folio-dell-latitude-lenovo-thinkbook-plus-legion-7"&gt;16:10 aspect ratio QHD screens&lt;/a&gt; that we’re thankfully seeing more of come close but don’t quite feel as immersive. In that way, there’s certainly a lot of fun to be had with the excessive screen real estate and power offered by the X17. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSH56E"&gt;Furthermore, it easily proves its ability to play 4K games with finesse and that Alienware’s a little more serious about improving its chassis design. All of that progress is important, and if you’ve been waiting for a big, well-designed gaming laptop that delivers on the promise of 4K gaming on the go, this is it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Z7sNUw"&gt;But for most people, it’s ultimately just too expensive. Plus, for the massive amount of power and cooling required to power 4K games, I just don’t think it offers &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;much better of an experience to warrant the cost versus more affordable, yet no less competently designed, laptops with sharp QHD displays. Pocket the rest of your money for games, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"&gt;headset&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;mouse&lt;/a&gt;, or a gaming monitor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s handy AirTag Loop is selling for a low price at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An AirTag in an Apple Leather Loop accessory" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4RdZRLPH6sD6sTOhez3BP5gSK_o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70104691/vpavic_4547_20210421_0070.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can now buy an AirTag Loop for $24 from Amazon.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o0ereY"&gt;iPhone owners planning on traveling or making lots of plans this holiday season may find today’s AirTag Loop deal useful. Right now at Amazon, you can buy the handy loop made specifically to carry Apple’s ultrawideband-capable Bluetooth tracker at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932PL9BF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an all-time low price of around $24&lt;/a&gt; instead of $29. This deal is valid on the orange or deep navy colorways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pgirnc"&gt;Other colors are also on sale, but are selling for a little more. You can pick up the white or yellow variants for $26, for example. Given that AirTags lack a lanyard hole of their own (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22394644/apple-airtag-built-in-keychain-loop-design-price-accessories-debate"&gt;a very Apple move&lt;/a&gt;), you’ll need a loop to securely attach them to backpacks, keys, and other items. So, while you might be buying one a little begrudgingly, but you’ll probably be happy you have it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k18Xy5"&gt;Note, however, we have seen the deep navy AirTag loop plunge to as low as $19 on Adorama about a month ago, so there’s a possibility that other retailers may offer deeper discounts as we approach Black Friday. We’ll keep you updated on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Guide to Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Rzgh35"&gt;You can take great photos and video clips on your next trip while saving money thanks to today’s great deal on the newest GoPro action camera. Normally $500, Amazon and B&amp;amp;H are selling the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1658382-REG%2Fgopro_chdhx_101_hero10_black.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F11%2F6%2F22765943%2Fapple-airtag-hitman-3-gopro-hero-10-black-xbox-elite-series-2-controller-amazon-omni-fire-deal-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GoPro Hero 10 Black&lt;/a&gt; for $450 instead. This GoPro Hero camera boasts all the amazing features its predecessor, which we called the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review"&gt;“biggest, baddest action camera out there,”&lt;/a&gt; and then some. What’s new here includes a new processor, which allows higher frame rates and increased resolution capture. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22675730/gopro-hero-10-black-announcement-gp2-high-frame-rate-auto-upload"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWZLEC"&gt;If that’s a little out of your budget, the 2020 GoPro Hero 9 is also on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09DJLW458/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=45&amp;amp;imprToken=ccbe78d2-1dd2-46cf-f21&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22527411%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dtheverge.com/good-deals%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $350 — the biggest price drop we’ve seen for this model as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uYWoph"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848416"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YBmkuO"&gt;Xbox owners can now buy the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller for its best price yet. We once dubbed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features"&gt;“the best Xbox controller&lt;/a&gt;” when it was released in 2019, and you can now get it for $139 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-Elite-Wireless-Controller-Series-2-Black-FST-00001%2F784834522%3Fathbdg%3DL1200&amp;amp;subid1=vergeconsoles110521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; instead of $180, and $140 at &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/Jr4gqN"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Felite-wireless-controller-series-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yPT3S"&gt;The Series 2 makes it easy to customize buttons and analog sticks, while the built-in, rechargeable battery should last for up to 40 hours on a single charge. Wrap-around grips also make the controller easier to hold, while other highlights include adjustable-tension thumbsticks and support for both USB-C and Bluetooth. It’s compatible with the Xbox Series X / S consoles, as well as the Xbox One and Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RymyvK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10763457"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NEA3gO"&gt;If you’d rather pick up one of the best 2021 video games, Target’s also offering up to 60 percent off &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/XxOzzg"&gt;select video games&lt;/a&gt; for Nintendo, Xbox, and PlayStation consoles through Saturday, November 6th. One of these deals includes 50 percent off Hitman 3, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252511/hitman-3-review-io-interactive-accessible-storytelling-end-series"&gt;in our review&lt;/a&gt;, we called “the most accessible, cohesive Hitman game to date.” Right now, Target is selling both the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fhitman-3-playstation-5%2F-%2FA-81819812&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fhitman-3-xbox-series-x-xbox-one%2F-%2FA-81819804&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X / S and Xbox One&lt;/a&gt; versions for $25 instead of $50. RedCard members can also get an extra five percent off, lowering the price to about $23.75. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FuwxIK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848465"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="SWAhw2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848480"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V23L6Y"&gt;Those in the market for an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl"&gt;affordable 4K TV&lt;/a&gt; may be interested to know Amazon is now offering the first discounts yet on its new Omni Fire TV and Fire TV 4-Series models. You can save $150 on both the $560 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P3QVFMK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt; and $510 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6F8YBH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; Omni Fire TV models, paying $410 and $360 instead, respectively. The 4K TV works with Alexa and it additionally provides access to major streaming services like Netflix, Prime Video, Disney Plus, and more without extra hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fwlKZ2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TUaEfP"&gt;Meanwhile, Amazon’s also taking $140 off of the lower-end &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08P3QB66R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/amazon-fire-tv-50-inch-4-series-4k-smart-tv/dp/B08SVZ775L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch&lt;/a&gt; Fire TV 4-Series editions. The larger-sized model usually costs $520, but it now costs $380. The 50-inch version usually costs $470, but now sells for $330. The 4K Ultra HD TV also supports HDR 10 and HLG and comes with a Fire TV Alexa Voice Remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TqwABC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10848646"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AmI8sT"&gt;But wait! There’s more! Here are some other noteworthy deals:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="11FzxK"&gt;Amazon is selling its new &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-HD-10-tablet/dp/B08BX7FV5L?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fire HD 10 tablet&lt;/a&gt; for $100 instead of $150 — an all-time low — when you buy the 32GB version. You can also get an extra 20 percent off when you trade in select devices toward the purchase.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Wg8t8q"&gt;Readers can pick up a pair of Bose’s 2017 QuietComfort 35 Series II noise-canceling headphones, which can seamlessly switch between two paired devices, for $180 instead of $299 from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0756CYWWD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;

    <title>Stranger Things 4’s new teaser promises ‘the best spring break ever’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/73mFnHhtIn3-x-PlGSBTCQkqvRI=/339x0:1530x794/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70104641/eleven.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X07yfR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 4 &lt;/em&gt;has gotten yet another mysterious teaser trailer, the latest in a series of clips promoting the upcoming fourth series of Netflix’s flagship supernatural drama. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7fhkuw"&gt;We open with a voiceover of Eleven writing a letter to Mike, looking forward to spring break when she gets to see him again. She describes how much she likes school and has made lots of friends (even though we actually see other kids being mean to her). We then get a few quick cuts of a roller rink, Eleven watching skaters and looking upset with some creepy music playing, someone shooting through windows, Joyce looking at a creepy doll, government thugs restraining Eleven, helicopters, explosions, and a dial being turned up (but we cut away before we can see if it goes to eleven). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQK1uN"&gt;The new trailer, titled “Welcome to California,” is the fourth of Netflix’s teasers, which the company has been steadily counting off in its YouTube descriptions since February 2020. So far, we’ve had teaser 001 (“&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21137590/netflix-stranger-things-4-trailer-character-teaser-missing-return"&gt;From Russia With Love...&lt;/a&gt;” promising the return of a fan-favorite character), teaser 002 (“&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422642/stranger-things-4-new-trailer-netflix-eleven"&gt;Eleven, Are You Listening?&lt;/a&gt;” diving into Eleven’s dark past), and teaser 003 (“&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22688804/stranger-things-season-4-teaser-trailer-watch-netflix"&gt;The Creel House,” revealing a creepy new location&lt;/a&gt;). Combined with the other three teasers, it seems clear that the new season is looking to expand its setting far beyond the town of Hawkins, Indiana in the coming season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWHb9m"&gt;Today’s new trailer is listed as 004/004, which would hopefully indicate that it’ll be the final of the smaller teasers for the series that Netflix is doing ahead of a proper, full-length trailer sometime in the future. Also absent from the news today is a firm release date: so far, Netflix has just said that it’ll be releasing the series sometime in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMPrqy"&gt;The new announcements come as part of Netflix’s celebration of “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Stranger_Things/status/1456622489971343360"&gt;Stranger Things Day&lt;/a&gt;,” which is meant to “commemorate” the in-universe date of November 6th, 1983 — the day that Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) first disappeared into the dark Upside-Down dimension in the first season of &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things. &lt;/em&gt;(If one was feeling less charitable, one could also attribute it to a cynical and slightly desperate attempt to try and create a cash-in fan holiday for one of its most popular genre shows like May 4th’s “Star Wars Day.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wqyZHw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;November 6, 1983. The day Will Byers disappeared and the world turned upside down. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StrangerThingsDay?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StrangerThingsDay&lt;/a&gt; returns tomorrow   &lt;a href="https://t.co/sRVrGwtvi0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/sRVrGwtvi0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Stranger Things (@Stranger_Things) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Stranger_Things/status/1456622489971343360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uGA3Ip"&gt;It’s been a longer than usual wait for the fourth season after &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 3 — &lt;/em&gt;which was released in July 2019 — due to a months-long delay in production caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which shut down filming on Stranger Things 4 after just two weeks in early 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfEblT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 4&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612753/netflix-stranger-things-season-four-release-date"&gt;set to return in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="B7dFWx"&gt;Apple hasn’t been all that vocal about its electric car project, but according to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-05/apple-hires-tesla-s-autopilot-software-director-for-car-effort?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the iPhone maker is hiring Tesla’s Autopilot software engineer to work on its EVs. Sources close to the matter told&lt;em&gt; Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; that Apple scooped up Christopher “CJ” Moore to work on its self-driving software. He’ll report to &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/news/3649749-apple-said-to-picked-up-ex-tesla-exec-for-electric-car-push"&gt;Stuart Bowers, another Tesla ex-pat&lt;/a&gt; who previously served as the vice president of engineering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KrhHAb"&gt;During his time at Tesla, Moore stirred up controversy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424592/tesla-elon-musk-autopilot-dmv-fsd-exaggeration"&gt;for calling CEO Elon Musk’s “full self-driving” claims exaggerated&lt;/a&gt;. In January, Musk stated that he was “highly confident the car will be able to drive itself with reliability in excess of human this year.” The full self-driving software, currently in beta, does not make a Tesla vehicle fully autonomous, as a driver must keep control of the vehicle at all times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kx5jcF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Moore stirred up controversy for calling CEO Elon Musk’s “full self-driving” claims an exaggeration&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3mtJrr"&gt;Moore pointed out that Tesla is currently at Level 2, referring to the vehicle’s level of autonomy — Level 2 means that the car still requires supervision from the driver, while Level 5 signifies full autonomy. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-21/tesla-engineer-who-quit-wanted-as-witness-in-key-autopilot-trial?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Moore has since been called as a witness&lt;/a&gt; to the fiery Tesla crash in April that left two people dead. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/18/22390612/two-people-killed-fiery-tesla-crash-no-driver"&gt;Initial reports suggested&lt;/a&gt; there was no one in the driver’s seat, but the National Transportation Safety Board &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/21/ntsb-driver-seat-occupied-in-fatal-tesla-crash-in-spring-texas.html"&gt;said last month that its investigation showed&lt;/a&gt; the driver’s seat was occupied in that incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKQEAs"&gt;Apple’s electric car project, codenamed Project Titan, remains shrouded in secrecy. We do know, however, that Apple has been hiring EV experts from other companies — especially Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qElJsF"&gt;After Ford &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665353/apple-watch-kevin-lync-project-titan-electric-car"&gt;hired away the head of Apple’s car project, Doug Field&lt;/a&gt;, Apple replaced him with former Adobe CTO and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665353/apple-watch-kevin-lync-project-titan-electric-car"&gt;Apple Watch executive Kevin Lynch&lt;/a&gt;. Apple also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528448/apple-ulrich-kranz-canoo-bmw-electric-car-autonomous"&gt;hired Ulrich Kranz, the co-founder of Canoo&lt;/a&gt; who helped BMW on its i3 and i8 programs. Apple previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/17/18144421/apple-designer-andrew-kim-tesla-microsoft-xbox-one-s-hololens"&gt;poached designer Andrew Kim from Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, along with Tesla’s drive systems &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2019/07/22/apple-tesla-engineering-vp-hire/"&gt;expert Michael Schwekutsch and car interiors/exteriors engineering vice president Steve MacManus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
