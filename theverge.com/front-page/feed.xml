    <title>Born in a Pandemic</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tXmGA"&gt;Alice Proujansky photographed her first birth when she was seven years old. “My parents gave me this little point-and-shoot camera that I photographed my sister’s birth with,” she says. “It was the first person I ever photographed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQrvg1"&gt;Now, Proujansky is a documentary photographer photographing stories of births and maternal health. When COVID-19 first hit New York City, where she lives, Proujansky wanted to capture birth during a pandemic. But in March and April 2020, hospitals and birth centers were restricting who was allowed to be in the delivery room with someone giving birth — for a short time, some New York City hospitals were &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/parenting/nyc-coronavirus-hospitals-visitors-labor.html"&gt;barring everyone&lt;/a&gt;, even partners, and asking people to deliver alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8nf7dl"&gt;Shut out of delivery rooms, Proujansky decided to approach the story in another way. Her project, titled “Born in a Pandemic,” included portraits of people in the last few weeks of their pregnancies and just after they gave birth. “Both pregnancy and also the pandemic are just really interesting in the ways that they point to inequities and pressures in society, and the way our culture approaches reproduction and women,” Proujansky says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lh7hFT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The following conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrlY6H"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did this project start?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gjUpwc"&gt;For me, the pandemic started when the schools closed. I have two kids. It all happened really quickly. First, there was this thing happening, and we were wondering if we needed to keep our kids home. And over the weekend, that decision was made for us. It was clear this was a big deal. I’m a freelance photographer and a teaching artist, and everything was canceled. I lost around $5,000 worth of gigs in a week, and I thought, “Is my career over? Is the world over?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tXWAAK"&gt;I started taking photos because I needed to. I was photographing the experience of parenting in the pandemic, and then I started doing these portraits. I wasn’t thinking about where they would go, but I just really needed to articulate something about what was happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dxy1Fa"&gt;I had my first contact with Jailyn Ortiz, who was the first person I photographed, in May. Going to photograph her was so strange. I drove into the city and parked in Times Square, which I’ve never done in my life, and it was completely empty. It really had that apocalyptic feeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g89MeZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pFdPX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A pregnant woman wearing a jean jacket and a blue mask is photographed on a city street in front of a stone facade, framed perfectly at the center of three tall lancet church windows." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LktewuJoY31IGUtrblfRli0Nl0I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22342562/01_Born_Pandemic_0080.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On May 7th, 2020, Jailyn Ortiz, 21, was 38 weeks pregnant and living with her partner in a hotel near Times Square designated as a shelter for families experiencing homelessness. Her first baby was scheduled to be delivered by cesarean section the following week; Jailyn wanted an unmedicated birth, but her baby was breech. She feared she wouldn’t be safe without control over her birth; she knows several women whose newborns have died. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;On &lt;em&gt;July 14th, 2020, Sarit Shatken-Stern, a 38-week-pregnant mother of two, stands outside of Baystate Franklin Medical Center in Greenfield, Massachusetts, where she works as a midwife. &lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="0b1VAZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did capturing pregnancy and newborns feel different during the pandemic than it usually does? How did your relationship with those subjects change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qK2Ep3"&gt;In one way, it was really reassuring to know that these things continue. And I also felt this kinship with the people who were pregnant and had newborns. The experience of having a baby is sort of similar to the experience of quarantine, in a strange way. Time feels very slippery and sticky. It also felt like a very animal experience. The pandemic made us realize we’re very animal, we’re very vulnerable, and I had the same experience having a newborn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bgYvIC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You started this project in May and continued to take pictures of pregnancy and birth through 2020 — both for this project and for others. How did things change for pregnant people over the course of the year?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqroPp"&gt;You have someone like Jailyn, who was pregnant and looking forward to her birth plan. And then it’s May, and the whole world changed. At the beginning, some people weren’t even able to have family in the room when they delivered. Then, the people I was meeting toward the end had most of their pregnancies take place during the pandemic. Starting in December, the first babies were born where the entire pregnancy was during these really strange circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QupGRR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="veR68P"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAyQp1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How were each of their experiences different?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3Xhfr"&gt;With Jailyn back in May, we were outside, six feet apart, with masks on, and I didn’t go anywhere near her. But we were nervous — was that safe? Then she had a newborn, and I wanted to take some follow-up pictures, but she wasn’t comfortable even taking the baby outside. There was that feeling of constant fear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYoLw3"&gt;Then, by the time I photographed my sister-in-law, Heather, her main concern was that my mother wasn’t going to be able to be in the room with her because she was due not long after the rules had changed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H2EYzG"&gt;And Sarit, she is a midwife in a rural hospital with severe PPE shortages. She was a frontline medical worker, and no one really knew what would happen if she contracted COVID-19 while she was pregnant. She was able to keep her baby and her two other children safe throughout the entire pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqG4xw"&gt;The pandemic was never going to affect everyone equally, and that was clear from the people I photographed and spoke to. I heard from a mom who was white who had a positive COVID-19 test while she was in labor — it was frightening, but she was able to hold her baby, and it wasn’t that bad of an experience. Another mom who was Black had her baby taken away. She felt that the nurses were not checking on her. It’s hard to attribute this to one thing, and I don’t have data, but people of color have been vastly more impacted by this pandemic, and it shows up in maternal health.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p id="8qxrmr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What has it been like for the people you photograph to have a baby at such a physically isolating time? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqd7c4"&gt;I have two children, and my postpartum experience was that it made such a difference whether I had people taking care of me or not. It made a huge difference when people would come by and drop off food or if I could see someone with a newborn the same age and talk about the minutiae of that particular week. That connection was really important. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7Dvk7"&gt;Right now, a lot of people are unable to get child care for their older children. They’re unable to have friends or parents or relatives drop by. Having a newborn is already kind of an isolating experience. It’s a really big mental shift to become a parent for the first time or become a parent of an additional child. You really need people around you. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Marshall’s Mode II earbuds are stuck between rock and a hard price</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The Marshall signature style and good sound don’t quite justify the cost&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="acVZzA"&gt;Marshall, the British company best known for its thunderous guitar amps, has also managed to build a solid reputation for headphones and earbuds over the last several years. Though they’re a little overpriced for what you get, I like the Marshall Monitor II ANC headphones for their style and clever mini-joystick for controlling audio playback. But now Marshall is moving into the true wireless earbuds market — and it’s very late to the party. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHfT2M"&gt;The new Mode II earbuds are priced at $179, start shipping March 18th, and aim to make up for Marshall’s tardy arrival with “phenomenal” sound, wireless charging, IPX4 water resistance, and a design that feels right at home next to the company’s other products. As a first stab at true wireless, these earbuds get a lot right for the price. But that price is also probably their biggest downside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7Fvpbr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10373622"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="auOaC4"&gt;These certainly look the part of Marshall earbuds. The case has the same textured, leather-like finish as the Monitor II headphones with the Marshall logo proudly embossed on the top and a USB-C port on the left side. Open it up and you’ll find the earbuds, three LEDs to indicate charging status for the case and each bud, and a round, gold button inside the case for pairing. Marshall claims the case has enough juice to give the earbuds four full recharges. Since the Mode II can last for up to five hours of straight listening time, that puts you at 25 hours total. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUEo3k"&gt;The earbuds have a matte black finish with a very prominent “M” on them; you’re definitely wearing the Marshall brand with these. They’re nicely compact and not as chunky as some competitors like the Jabra Elite 75t. Marshall includes four sizes of silicone ear tips in the box — including an XL option, which is nice to see. Some foam tips would’ve been even nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OihAHAN9vOOLueC47wJP_LjslKk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343731/cwelch_210303_4458_0006.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rMAXWQ"&gt;Marshall’s signature control nub is a little impractical for earbuds, so just like countless others, the Mode II earbuds use tap gestures. The controls aren’t customizable, and unfortunately, you’re left without any way to directly adjust volume:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JEhWGN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Left earbud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syHyNo"&gt;Tap once for transparency mode or to answer a call&lt;br&gt;Tap twice for voice assistant&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ek4kpU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right earbud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNiNgd"&gt;Tap once to pause/play or to answer a call&lt;br&gt;Tap twice to skip to next track&lt;br&gt;Tap three times to go back to the last track&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JpwbMn"&gt;It would sometimes take a stronger tap than I expected to register some of these commands, particularly with the right earbud. Those firmer taps pushed the earbud deeper into my ear, which got unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="FKeoEz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10373625"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L6H7D6"&gt;I’ve also encountered some odd bugs with the Mode II, like one where the right earbud wouldn’t play any audio until I touched it. There were occasionally some noticeable balance issues with vocals sliding between the left and right earbuds. Those issues both seem to have been &lt;em&gt;mostly&lt;/em&gt; resolved with the latest firmware update, but still pop up at times. Marshall tells me another OTA update will be released before the Mode IIs ship to customers to further smoothen out performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7go37"&gt;Bugs aside, these earbuds do sound quite good. I’ve been listening to The Hold Steady’s new album &lt;em&gt;Open Door Policy&lt;/em&gt;, and there’s a lot going on in some of those songs. The Mode II earbuds do a good job of keeping everything — guitars, horns, keys, vocals, drums — distinct in the mix. Upper-end frequencies can sound a little boosted on some tracks depending on how they were produced, but it’s nothing piercing. And the Marshall app gives you full EQ control if you’re not happy with the default “Marshall sound” tuning. AAC and SBC codecs are supported.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XuNOA6UEwNNWYRmNcMY2mHZhZDU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343732/cwelch_210303_4458_0007.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="r99x27"&gt;As always, fit and a good seal are crucial to getting the best sound. And that’s especially true here. Even when I have the XL tips on, these are the sort of earbud that I need to twist into my ear just the right way if I want the most bass and a balanced soundstage. They never feel loose, but something about the fit can be a bit finicky in my experience, whereas I can just plop other earbuds in without giving it much thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpJsgY"&gt;The Mode II earbuds don’t include any kind of active noise cancellation, but Marshall still added a transparency mode in case you need to more clearly hear what’s happening around you. The best I can say about this feature is that it’s serviceable, but ambient sound comes through far more muffled than the airy, natural transparency modes of other earbuds. Voice call performance is average: people I spoke to could hear me just fine but noted that my voice sounded a bit hollow and trebly — something that was also true when I listened back to voice memo samples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6IbPlSwiA94-_En4CkZ9VOmEK_0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343727/cwelch_210303_4458_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GZA82hIXF3d7-m2oO4NTVMtAirc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343725/cwelch_210303_4458_0001.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8JDJeY"&gt;Rounding out the features, Marshall includes auto-pause when you remove a bud, and they should be suitable for normal workouts thanks to an IPX4 rating. Like the vast majority of true wireless earbuds, these don’t support multipoint for two simultaneous Bluetooth connections. But you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; use either one independently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id4LWV"&gt;If the Marshall Mode II buds were priced at $130 or $100, I think I’d come away with a more positive overall take on them. But at $180, they lack any real standout tricks that would make me reach for them over established competitors. The case is sleek, totally pocketable, and includes wireless charging. Sound quality is good, but not to the point where Marshall thrashes competitors in the same price bracket. Plus, you can get a set of true wireless earbuds with proper noise cancellation by spending $30 to $50 more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="TlpoEj"&gt;Coming into the fold so late, Marshall really needed to turn the knob up to 11. But the Mode II earbuds don’t quite get there, and the style points count for less here than with the company’s wireless headphones, where the cool design is so visible.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eve is rolling out Thread support to more of its smart home lineup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VIuqUowAQbDHjW3LT8hcR-7rikM=/497x0:5476x3319/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68910245/Eve_Weather_Lifestyle_05_Fahrenheit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Eve Weather outdoor weather monitor&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Eve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DKD04N"&gt;Eve Systems, a maker of smart home products that work with Apple’s HomeKit platform, is announcing an expanded range of devices that support the Thread smart protocol. The news consists of updated versions of its existing smart plug, a forthcoming firmware update for the company’s smart sprinkler, and a new outdoor weather station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XGzaL"&gt;Thread is a wireless communication standard that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/15/5900893/wireless-protocol-standard-nest-thread-group"&gt;developed from the ground up&lt;/a&gt; for smart home purposes and is designed to replace legacy technologies such as Z-Wave and Zigbee. Benefits of Thread include more reliable connections between devices, faster response times, and longer battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qcxIB7"&gt;Though Thread support has existed in a handful of devices for quite some time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;Apple’s HomePod mini&lt;/a&gt; is the first one to really make Thread a viable option in the smart home. It can act as a bridge between Thread-enabled accessories and connect them to the internet, which they can’t do on their own. Thread is also one of the pillar technologies of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21027890/apple-google-amazon-smart-home-standard-zigbee-connected-ip-project"&gt;Connected Home over IP (CHIP) project&lt;/a&gt;, a cooperation between all the major smart home platform and device providers to standardize around an interoperable wireless protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PlUlFu"&gt;It’s with that in mind that Eve is updating and expanding its device portfolio. The new Eve Energy, which will be available in either US or UK versions, is an updated version of Eve’s smart plug. It will support both Thread and Bluetooth and will be available in the US starting on April 6th and the UK starting on May 4th. The Energy is unique in that it can act as a repeater for the Thread network, letting it extend the signal to devices even if they are out of reach of a HomePod mini. In the US, the Energy will cost $39.95.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xxm9Ef9DkEmi4Nh_1G9Hu_cch6U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341451/Eve_Energy_NA_Lifestyle_02.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The latest version of the Eve Energy smart plug adds Thread support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="88btS2"&gt;A forthcoming firmware update will add Thread support to the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eve-Aqua-Controller-Sprinkler-Irrigation/dp/B08FBHCPPF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99.95 Eve Aqua&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s smart sprinkler system. Thanks to Thread’s greater range, the updated Aqua can maintain its connection to the network better than it could with just Bluetooth. Eve says support for Thread will be released in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3vcdI"&gt;Lastly, the all-new Eve Weather is a wireless outdoor weather station that allows you to track the exact outdoor temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure at your home. It is a replacement for the Eve Degree, a similar product that relied solely on Bluetooth for its connectivity. The Eve Weather has a monochrome display that shows the current temperature, humidity, and weather conditions; the Eve app provides access to trends over time and more specific data. The Weather also has Siri integration for voice queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uS4Mwp"&gt;Eve claims the Weather is IPX3 water resistant and is specifically designed for outdoor use. It runs on a coin cell battery which should last between six and 12 months before needing to be replaced. The Eve Weather will be available starting March 25th for $69.95.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eve Weather shows current temperature, humidity, and weather trends on its monochrome display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UquTwr"&gt;These aren’t the only products in Eve’s portfolio that support Thread. The company has already issued firmware updates with Thread support for its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eve-Door-Window-Automatically-Notifications/dp/B08BDM47S2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;door and window sensors&lt;/a&gt; and European-spec Energy smart plug, and it says everything it has released since June 2020 has the hardware necessary to work with Thread. It is one of the first companies to really throw its hat into the Thread ring in a meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DR1DIU"&gt;Eve is a unique company in the smart home market as its products only work with Apple’s HomeKit platform and don’t support Amazon Alexa, Google Home, or any of the other platforms out there. That’s different from most other smart home companies, which try to reach the broadest possible audience by supporting the most popular platforms, which often means Amazon Alexa and Google Home. The HomeKit device ecosystem is much smaller in comparison, largely thanks to an onerous hardware certification that Apple used to require and has since rolled back. HomeKit is also completely inaccessible from outside of Apple’s ecosystem, so if you have an Android phone, you can’t control Eve devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KVbEWl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Eve is the first company to broadly support Thread across its lineup&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TJudZE"&gt;Eve System’s CEO Jerome Gackel told me the company’s goal isn’t just to be a HomeKit accessory maker. It’s just that Apple’s platform is the only one that allows Eve to focus its efforts on its devices and apps without having to also maintain a cloud service to allow them to connect to the internet. All of the processing for Eve devices happens locally on your home network or between your own devices, without sending data to the cloud, which helps the company achieve its goal of a privacy-first smart home. (You can still remotely control Eve devices through Apple’s Home app, provided you have a HomeKit hub, such as an Apple TV, HomePod, or iPad running in your home.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSnn1J"&gt;Gackel hopes that support for Thread and its key role in the CHIP project will open the door to working with the other smart home platforms in the future. But Eve won’t work with Alexa or Google Home so long as they continue to require a cloud connection to their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQwXPW"&gt;Eve’s bet on HomeKit has been successful so far — the company already has 18 products in its lineup and claims sales of over 1 million units by 2019, with two-thirds of its customer base in Germany and the rest in the US. Its lineup for 2021 will make it the largest provider of HomeKit accessories, with Thread support being a recurring theme throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elgato’s new Light Strip can make your setup look more chill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elgato Light Strip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u6QrXZX4DPpnSZXfEMeDewkErHQ=/0x18:2355x1588/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68910194/elgatolightstrip.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who has an entertainment center this big? Wait — no, don’t tell me.&lt;/em&gt; | Elgato&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="06YJpC"&gt;Elgato, the Corsair-owned company known for its gaming and creator-focused streaming tech, is expanding into smart lighting. It has introduced &lt;a href="http://elgato.com/light-strip"&gt;the Light Strip&lt;/a&gt;, a thin strip packed with 108 dimmable LEDs that can be mounted via sticky adhesive, bent, and trimmed to fit wherever you’d like them to go. These can be controlled over Wi-Fi (2.4GHz only) through a free app on macOS, Windows 10, iOS, or Android, or from Elgato’s Stream Deck hardware, which apparently will offer deeper integration. Elgato is charging $59.99 for two meters (about 79 inches) of lights, including the controller the lights plug into and a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Elgato Light Strip" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rKY4_kAkFJ_mCs1wJmFvXuWfJ0I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343751/lightstrip2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Elgato&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stream Deck isn’t included, for the record.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e5LsWe"&gt;These are similar in execution to most connected light strips including Philips Hue’s, which ironically has tight Stream Deck integration via plug-ins. Not to be confused with the capabilities of something like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21418861/philips-hue-play-gradient-lightstrip-tv-mount"&gt;Philips Hue Play gradient light strip&lt;/a&gt; that can sync the light to what’s on your screen (only after purchasing some pricey additional hardware), Elgato’s more affordable solution is just for looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRzj5x"&gt;If you’re a streamer who appears on-camera, Elgato says the LEDs within the Light Strip are flicker-free. It says some other options appear fine to the naked eye but can create a flickering effect when you’re on-camera. In terms of other specs, these are RGBWW LEDs that offer both cool and warm white support, in addition to millions of colors. These have a 2,000-lumen maximum output.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Elgato Light Strip" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e36SwR4hCe_dzgbarJLiSa_aPtU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343757/wavepanels.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Elgato&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coming in multiple colors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oF6noJ"&gt;Elgato, keenly aware of its target audience, is also announcing &lt;a href="http://elgato.com/wave-panels"&gt;Wave Panels&lt;/a&gt;. These are glorified foam pieces can be mounted (either by adhesive or with a wall anchor) in your space to improve the acoustics. They’ll likely be particularly useful if you’re recording your voice. They have an edgy look, and Elgato is releasing them in multiple colors. It’s $100 for six panels and mounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eyxPW3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated 9:39AM ET, March 4th: Added pricing for Wave Panels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vA2nbQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZwhZR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Halo fitness tracker is getting Alexa integration</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VUXo7a3KX8JUbTN0Pl27auTy_sM=/45x0:3795x2500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68910189/Halo_App_and_Halo_Band.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amazon Halo and its companion app&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vO5jlE"&gt;Amazon has announced a new feature for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;Halo fitness-tracking gadget&lt;/a&gt;: Alexa integration. With this new feature, Halo owners will be able to ask Alexa devices for various health stats, such as their sleep score or activity points obtained during the day. The integration will be off by default and owners will need the latest firmware on their Halo bands and the latest version of the iOS or Android app to enable it. Amazon says the feature rollout is starting today, March 4th, and will be continuing over the next week or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CehWnZ"&gt;The Halo band is Amazon’s first fitness-focused product and it’s had a less than stellar reception since it was announced last fall. Aside from the standard fitness things of tracking your movement and sleep patterns, the $99.99 Halo also has the ability to police the tone of your voice and tell you when you’re being dismissive or condescending with your words. The companion Halo app also has a feature to 3D scan your body through your phone’s camera and measure your fat composition. These two unconventional features have been criticized by reviewers at publications like &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/technology/personaltech/amazon-halo-review.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/10/amazon-halo-band-review/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (which is actually owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos) for both their invasiveness and inconsistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sJEvXiFdLtAZHmDMGibaO3sweSg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343977/Connect_Alexa_to_Halo_Screenshot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alexa integration options in the Halo app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JDyaJO"&gt;Weirdly, even though the Halo has been available for purchase &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174145/amazon-halo-fitness-tracker-voice-buy"&gt;since the middle of December&lt;/a&gt; (it first launched with a limited, invite-only rollout), it is out of stock in all sizes and colors on Amazon right now, with no information on when it might return. I’ve asked Amazon about this and the company declined to comment, though other retailers such as Best Buy &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733949121805689498" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;appear to have plenty of stock&lt;/a&gt;. As of this writing, the Halo has a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QJ6YL4T/ref=twister_B088TNNLSG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;3.7-star rating from Amazon customers&lt;/a&gt;, compared to the 4.6-star rating the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Inspire-Fitness-Tracker-Included/dp/B08DFDP1TR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;similarly sized and priced Fitbit Inspire 2 holds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dCEGvF"&gt;Amazon notes that the Alexa integration only allows for Alexa to provide information related to health data captured by the Halo — Alexa will not be able to do the tone analysis itself. It also will not store the Halo data as part of its responses. There is an option to set a voice PIN to protect access to the Halo data and you’ll be able to opt for a five-minute timeout window after the PIN is entered for easier access to the Halo data in subsequent requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GypMs6"&gt;Though the Halo integration works with all Alexa-enabled devices, including smart displays, it doesn’t have any special optimization for those that have screens. If you want to see any charts or graphs of your fitness data, you’ll have to go to the Halo smartphone app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UG1vv"&gt;Amazon says Halo owners will be able to disable the integration at any time from the Halo app should they decide they no longer want it, and they can manage and delete voice recordings from their Halo requests in the privacy hub of the Alexa app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Dorsey’s Square, Inc. is buying a majority stake in Jay-Z’s streaming service Tidal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pr4UhGH8C4OaZ6FMsIGzxtprt5k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68910014/akrales_170802_1743_0229.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zy2bKC"&gt;Square, Inc., the financial services company founded by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsquareup.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpress%2Ftidal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22313108%2Fsquare-inc-tidal-majority-stake-jack-dorsey-jay-z" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;acquiring a majority stake&lt;/a&gt; in Tidal, the high-fidelity audio and video streaming service led by Jay-Z. Square is paying $297 million in cash and stock for a “significant majority ownership stake” and says Tidal will operate independently alongside Square’s other ventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gXO1E9"&gt;Asking the obvious question in a thread on Twitter, Dorsey &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1367460907958243328"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: “Why would a music streaming company and a financial services company join forces?!” His answer: to find “new ways for artists to support their work.” Just as Square gave sellers new tools to make money, Dorsey says the company’s stake in Tidal will help artists find similar support in the new digital ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="crex6a"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Square is acquiring a majority ownership stake in TIDAL through a new joint venture, with the original artists becoming the second largest group of shareholders, and JAY-Z joining the Square board. Why would a music streaming company and a financial services company join forces?!&lt;/p&gt;— jack (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1367460907958243328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lJnJFO"&gt;“Given what Square has been able to do for sellers of all sizes and individuals through Cash App, we believe we can now work for artists to see the same success for them, and us,” tweeted Dorsey. “Square created ecosystems of tools for sellers &amp;amp; individuals, and we’ll do the same for artists. We’ll work on entirely new listening experiences to bring fans closer together, simple integrations for merch sales, modern collaboration tools, and new complementary revenue streams.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecQfm3"&gt;Tidal was founded in Norway in 2014 before being bought by a consortium of artists led by Jay-Z the following year for $56 million. Artist-owners included Coldplay, Rihanna, Daft Punk, and Madonna. The new owners positioned Tidal in opposition to big tech’s streaming services, promising fans high-quality audio and exclusive content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBVK2F"&gt;Tidal quickly ran into problems, though, failing to secure exclusive content over the long term or attract subscribers to rival the likes of Spotify. In 2017, the company secured a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/23/14357462/tidal-sprint-investment-future-tmobile"&gt;$200 million investment&lt;/a&gt; from Sprint (now merged with T-Mobile) but reports the following year said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17510390/tidal-streaming-service-subscribers-spotify-apple-music"&gt;subscriber growth had stalled&lt;/a&gt;. At that time, the service was said to have roughly 3 million paying customers, compared to Spotify’s 20 million that same year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1Gyim"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9534646/square-tidal-acquisition-majority-stake-jay-z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that as of 2020, Tidal was still behind on payments to rights holders, a problem Square’s cash injection might solve. The company’s revenue reportedly grew 13 percent to $166.9 million in 2019 according to financial documents filed in the UK by parent company Project Panther Bidco, but losses also rose from $36 million to $55.19 million in that same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6OsVKh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tidal will continue to offer its streaming service alongside new tools for artists&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NquHPb"&gt;Now, Tidal has another chance to reinvent itself. &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9534646/square-tidal-acquisition-majority-stake-jay-z"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Square’s hardware lead Jesse Dorogusker, who will serve as interim head of Tidal, said the company would build out new tools for artists while continuing to offer its streaming service to consumers. “We think the streaming service is an important part of it, and it is growing and will continue to grow,” Dorogusker told the publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qf18HQ"&gt;As part of the deal, Jay-Z will join Square’s board of directors. “I said from the beginning that Tidal was about more than just streaming music, and six years later, it has remained a platform that supports artists at every point in their careers,” said Jay-Z in a press statement. “Artists deserve better tools to assist them in their creative journey. Jack and I have had many discussions about Tidal’s endless possibilities that have made me even more inspired about its future. This shared vision makes me even more excited to join the Square board. This partnership will be a game-changer for many. I look forward to all this new chapter has to offer!”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senators call on FCC to quadruple base high-speed internet speeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Janet Yellen Confirmation Hearing For Treasury Secretary Before Senate Finance Committee" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vxcU2F0IVLZoMntp4hEn5oqPCt0=/0x0:5374x3583/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68909919/1230675894.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6A0XFv"&gt;The federal government’s definition of high-speed broadband has remained stagnant over the last six years, sitting at 25Mbps down and 3Mbps up since 2015. But faced with pandemic-fueled network loads and a new push for infrastructure spending, lawmakers are getting ready to upgrade that definition. &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344741/2021_0304_Bipartisan_Broadband_Speed_Letter_FINAL__1___1_.pdf"&gt;In a letter to government leaders&lt;/a&gt; Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators called for a quadrupling of base high-speed broadband delivery speeds making 100Mbps down and 100Mbps up the new base for high-speed broadband. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUMUQu"&gt;“Going forward, we should make every effort to spend limited federal dollars on broadband networks capable of providing sufficient download and upload speeds and quality,”  Sens. Michael Bennet (D-CO), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Angus King (I-ME), and Rob Portman (R-OH) &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344741/2021_0304_Bipartisan_Broadband_Speed_Letter_FINAL__1___1_.pdf"&gt;wrote to the FCC&lt;/a&gt; and other agencies. “There is no reason federal funding to rural areas should not support the type of speeds used by households in typical well-served urban and suburban areas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rR7OeW"&gt;The letter calls on the FCC and other agencies to change their definitions of “high speed broadband” to anything above 100Mbps down and 100Mbps up — a shift that would prohibit the FCC from identifying an area as being served with broadband unless it met those speed criteria. It’s a complete change of pace from the FCC under former Chairman Ajit Pai’s leadership, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242635/fcc-ajit-pai-internet-speed-advanced-telecommunications-3mbps"&gt;which established&lt;/a&gt; the previous 25 / 3Mbps standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dv6jGE"&gt;“We find that the current speed benchmark of 25/3 Mbps remains an appropriate measure by which to assess whether a fixed service is providing advanced telecommunications capability,” the FCC’s report said earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXhF1C"&gt;The current base speeds for high-speed broadband aren’t nearly enough for a moderately sized family working from home. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242635/fcc-ajit-pai-internet-speed-advanced-telecommunications-3mbps"&gt;Zoom recommends&lt;/a&gt; 3.8Mbps upload speeds for just one 1080p video, and the shift to remote schooling and work has forced many families to run multiple simultaneous streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmEMFX"&gt;“Ask any senior who connects with their physician via telemedicine, any farmer hoping to unlock the benefits of precision agriculture, or any student who receives livestreamed instruction, or any family where both parents telework and multiple children are remote learning, and they will tell you that many networks fail to come close to ‘high speed’ in the year 2021,” the senators wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HyqIxM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 3/4/21 at 8:15AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated quotes to reflect final text of the letter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s $260 Redmi Note 10 Pro has a 120Hz screen and a 108-megapixel camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jltKGHYnQkYNli9YcfnYVoHLGc0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68909890/DSCF7567.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gL9v7g"&gt;Xiaomi has announced its Redmi Note 10 line, the latest in its phone series that’s titanically popular in India and beyond. As is tradition for the Redmi Note phones, the 10 series brings some high-end features to much lower price points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ShkYe"&gt;The Redmi Note 10 Pro is the main attraction here, with several variants including the Note 10S, Note 10, and Note 10 5G adjusting various specs to meet different price points. The Note 10 Pro’s standout feature is its 6.67-inch 1080p OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVULZW"&gt;The Note 10 Pro also has a 108-megapixel primary camera alongside an 8-megapixel ultrawide, a 5-megapixel “telemacro”, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. On paper, that puts its camera setup in reach of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;Xiaomi’s new Mi 11 flagship&lt;/a&gt;, though the Note 10 Pro’s 1.55-inch 108-megapixel sensor is a little smaller. The holepunch selfie camera, meanwhile, is 16 megapixels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Is_OcSDViqMD2ts3YzIE2xsXkd4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344632/DSCF7564.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DxgQOC"&gt;Other specs include a Snapdragon 732 processor, 6GB or 8GB of RAM, 64GB or 128GB of storage, a 5,020mAh battery, 33W fast charging, a microSD card slot plus two separate SIM card slots, stereo speakers, a fingerprint sensor in the power button, and a headphone jack. The biggest omission is wireless charging, but that’s not a surprise for a device in this price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPmWz8"&gt;Xiaomi wouldn’t provide full international pricing details ahead of the launch, but the Indian variant of the Redmi Note 10 Pro is called the Redmi Note 10 Pro Max and starts at Rs. 18,999 (~$260) for a model with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The non-Max Indian Note 10 Pro is identical but has a 64-megapixel main camera instead and starts at 15,999 (~$220) for the 6GB/64GB model.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new Alexa app for Xbox brings visual assistant features to your TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-FHeu6JZrp7AeYyOlHUA2oC6C5Y=/1x0:1618x1078/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68909765/alexaxbox.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s new Alexa app on Xbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QTQuJu"&gt;Amazon is launching a new Alexa app for Xbox consoles this week. While you’ve been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/6/17826718/microsoft-xbox-one-alexa-features-support-voice-control"&gt;able to control Alexa from an Xbox&lt;/a&gt; for a couple of years now, this dedicated app will provide access to more of the visual parts of Amazon’s digital assistant. That includes being able to see your doorbell camera, reading emails and checking your calendar, and even seeing weather forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwwarG"&gt;It essentially turns your Xbox into more of an Echo Show-like experience for Alexa. All of the usual Xbox controls are still supported with this new app, including the ability to turn on an Xbox console using a compatible Alexa device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dfkFGs"&gt;Amazon is gradually rolling out this new Alexa app for Xbox in the coming days, and it will be available across all Xbox One and Xbox Series X / S consoles. You should be able to &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Falexa-for-xbox%2F9ngdjk7chn45%3Fwa%3Dwsignin1.0%26activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;download the Alexa app from the Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt; right now, but we’ve tried to get it to work with a couple of Xbox consoles and it doesn’t appear to be fully live just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALfnZX"&gt;Here are some of the new commands available with the visual version of Alexa on Xbox:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WhVbyh"&gt;Alexa, play &amp;lt;artist name&amp;gt; on Xbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8syrRC"&gt;Alexa, show me the front door camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hoGq73"&gt;Alexa, show me my email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PSdMLz"&gt;Alexa, show me my calendar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PWoU3H"&gt;Alexa, show me the weather&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Skydio drones reportedly owned by more than 20 US police agencies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cEhPeojzvt8pF63bnU10JGKZDnU=/57x0:1557x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68909699/Skydio_X2_commercial_drone.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skydio’s X2 drone, which is aimed at enterprise and military customers.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Skydio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xyFTwa"&gt;More than 20 police agencies around the US own drones from US manufacturer Skydio, according to &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/03/03/drones-with-most-advanced-ai-ever-coming-soon-to-your-local-police-department/?sh=619d88073f0b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which calculated the figure based on a combination of freedom of information requests and public announcements. The report follows news that Skydio is the first US dronemaker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306876/skydio-1-billion-valuation-enterprise-military-customers-chinese-drones-grounded"&gt;to be valued at over $1 billion&lt;/a&gt; following a recent funding round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aal5uj"&gt;Working with police departments is thought to be part of Skydio’s attempt to make inroads against dominant player DJI, which is &lt;a href="https://droneii.com/the-drone-manufacturer-ranking-2020"&gt;said to command&lt;/a&gt; between 70 and 80 percent of the commercial drone market. Skydio started offering its drones to government agencies for free last year, and over 30 public agencies reportedly took them up on the offer. America’s Custom and Border Protection is also testing using the company’s drones this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lgtcMP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Steering away from that just because it’s controversial or polarizing would be the wrong thing to do”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YqXNyS"&gt;Skydio’s prospects have been helped by the US government’s recent decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188789/dji-ban-commerce-entity-list-drone-china-transaction-blocked"&gt;add DJI to the Department of Commerce’s Entity List&lt;/a&gt;. Although DJI’s consumer business hasn’t seen a significant impact, with customers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22190097/dji-blacklist-ban-xinjiang-entity-list-trump"&gt;still able to buy and use its drones&lt;/a&gt;, the move has reportedly caused some police departments to explore ditching its devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcw1Nt"&gt;The selling point of Skydio’s drones is their self-flying technology, and &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; notes that police forces find this helpful for having the drones fly inside buildings or through forests. Last year, one of the company’s drones was used to help a SWAT team during a standoff with armed suspects in Burlington, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lq2RWs"&gt;Although Skydio’s CEO Adam Bry admits that working with government agencies may mean its drones are used in “potentially polarizing and charged situations,” he tells &lt;em&gt;Forbes,&lt;/em&gt; “steering away from that just because it’s controversial or polarizing would be the wrong thing to do.” In comments &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/technology/anduril-military-palmer-luckey.html"&gt;given to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO has come out strongly against Skydio’s drones being used with weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="slCPfx"&gt;“We are not putting weapons on the drone,” Bry said. “Weaponization is the one thing where you want less automation, not more.”&lt;/p&gt;
