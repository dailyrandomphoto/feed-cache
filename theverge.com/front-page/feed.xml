    <title>Crucial’s X6 lineup of durable USB-C SSDs now has a whopping 4TB model</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PmB4I7nVGezCntqfTC-gyp0FCiQ=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68896494/crucialx6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Crucial&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Peq03A"&gt;Crucial’s range of midrange, portable USB-C SSDs in the X6 lineup has a couple of new configurations starting today: one for big spenders who need a lot of storage, and another for people on a budget. On top of its 1TB and 2TB models, there’s now a 4TB SSD you can buy for $489.95. It’s priced higher than the current cost for two of its 2TB models (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fssd%2Fx6%2Fct2000x6ssd9&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F2%2F22307133%2Fcrucial-x6-4tb-portable-durable-usb-c-ssd-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$190 each&lt;/a&gt; through Crucial directly), but like most SSDs, it probably won’t take long for it to fall lower than its original asking price. As for the budget-friendly option, you can snag a 500GB model for $69.95.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwUyXX"&gt;Back to the 4TB model, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a better price on this much storage in a more compact SSD, which could make it a great option for people with large photo or video libraries who don’t want to juggle multiple drives. It could also be a convenient solution for storing all of your PS4 or Xbox One games on for easy access when it’s connected to a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S. It’s listed as being compatible with Windows 10, macOS, Android, and with consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="yvKcJ9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to choose the right portable SSD, and how to make your own","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/13/18518127/portable-ssd-external-thunderbolt-3-usb-c-samsung-x5-t5-specs-test-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DEIXHf"&gt;While Crucial has the competition beat on fitting in more storage (and for its claim of surviving drops on carpet of up to 6.5 feet), it isn’t the fastest portable SSD on the market. It claims up to 800MB/s read speeds for the 4TB model, but lesser capacities offer just 540MB/s sequential read speeds. If you want something faster, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crucial.com%2Fssd%2Fx8%2Fct2000x8ssd9&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F2%2F22307133%2Fcrucial-x6-4tb-portable-durable-usb-c-ssd-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Crucial’s high-end X8&lt;/a&gt; portable SSDs that are also drop-proof offer sequential read speeds of up to 1,050MB/s and sequential write speeds of up to 1,000MB/s, but for a hearty boost in price. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/8/20/21376091/western-digital-my-passport-ssd-portable-storage-backup-second-gen-faster"&gt;Western Digital’s latest My Passport portable SSD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21262517/samsung-t7-usb-c-nvme-portable-ssd-speed-t5-comparison-price"&gt;Samsung’s T7&lt;/a&gt; also provide these speeds, though Samsung has the advantage with the T7’s thinner size.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ratchet and Clank is now free on PS4 and PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Ratchet &amp;amp;amp; Clank" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8VrS04BRUrmqJW-VtjWPxCjN9Bg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68896447/RCPS4_4_nov_bridge.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="amtt61"&gt;March kicks off Sony’s “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297009/ratchet-and-clank-free-ps4-ps5-playstation-sony"&gt;Play at Home Initiative&lt;/a&gt;,” and the first game available for PS4 and PS5 owners is &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA01047_00-RATCHETPS4000000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. PlayStation owners on both consoles can redeem a free digital copy of the game until March 31st at 8PM PT / 11PM PT, without requiring a PlayStation Plus subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdQmfF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank&lt;/em&gt; was released on PS4 in 2016 by Insomniac Games, serving as a remake of the original 2002 game for the PlayStation 2. The game has previously been available for PS5 users with a PS Plus via the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, but this version is yours to keep and does not require an active subscription to PlayStation Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1S7cu"&gt;To encourage gamers to stay at home during the pandemic, Sony plans to offer more as-yet-unannounced games free with no strings attached to PS4 and PS5 owners through June. The option to make &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank&lt;/em&gt; available as the first game comes at an interesting time as the game’s sequel, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278233/ratchet-and-clank-rift-apart-ps5-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rift Apart, &lt;/em&gt;launches on June 11th for PS5&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Revamped Google TV app could soon work as a remote control, code suggests</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1spgN2jK04SWSD9R4-arB3o9V7k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68896303/Google_TV_Mobile_UI__2_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google TV app was rebranded last year.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0GTkd4"&gt;The Android Google TV app could soon be getting a built-in remote control for Android TVs, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-tv-app-remote-control-android-tv/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The unreleased feature was discovered in the code for &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-tv-app-remote-control-android-tv/"&gt;version 4.25 of the Android app&lt;/a&gt;. Enabling the feature reveals an apparently unfinished interface built around a large D-pad, and the option to pair the app with an Android TV device using a 4-digit PIN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cmC8O1"&gt;The discovery of the new code coincides with a renewed push from Google to update and modernize its smart TV software. Last year it launched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21466954/google-chromecast-new-price-features-tv-interface"&gt;Chromecast&lt;/a&gt; with a new Google TV interface for the operating system, and this software is also coming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218693/sony-tv-lineup-8k-4k-z9j-a90j-a80j-x95j-x90j-ces-2021"&gt;as a built-in operating system&lt;/a&gt; to smart TVs this year. As part of the launch, Google also rebranded its Play Movies &amp;amp; TV app to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21492549/google-tv-app-play-movies-name-change-chromecast"&gt;Google TV&lt;/a&gt; on Android (for now, on iOS it’s still appearing as &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/google-play-movies-tv/id746894884"&gt;Google Play Movies &amp;amp; TV&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H5cNig"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Google is working on integrating the Android TV Remote Control app into the Google TV app. Here are some screenshots of the feature, which is not yet available in version 4.25. (Surprise, surprise...it's exactly as you'd expect.) &lt;a href="https://t.co/73iqX6FRJd"&gt;pic.twitter.com/73iqX6FRJd&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mishaal Rahman (@MishaalRahman) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MishaalRahman/status/1366576676176617472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VsteLW"&gt;Google technically already has an Android TV app on &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/android-tv/id1078761166"&gt;iOS&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.tv.remote"&gt;Android&lt;/a&gt; that offers this functionality, but neither versions have been updated in years. We wouldn’t be surprised if both ended up being discontinued if the feature gets rolled in the Google TV app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lUWgfV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0HAvO5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lime’s old e-bike batteries are now powering these Bluetooth speakers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/73w0IsDFVOlIPpehWDamTXK3Uco=/644x660:2317x1775/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68896150/Gomi_0310.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The speakers are powered by old e-bike batteries and have a case made from recycled plastic.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Gomi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X1ieFr"&gt;Accessory manufacturer Gomi is launching a limited edition Bluetooth speaker powered by batteries from old Lime e-bikes. In its &lt;a href="http://v1.li.me/second-street/gomi-upcycles-lime-e-bike-batteries-to-create-zero-waste-portable-speakers"&gt;announcement of the partnership&lt;/a&gt;, Lime says Gomi will use 50,000 battery cells from over 1,000 old e-bikes. The result is a Bluetooth speaker priced starting at £99 (around $138) that has 20 hours of battery life and will be available for 30 days as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/gomi-eco-tech/gomi-speaker-powered-by-waste"&gt;Kickstarter launching later today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CC44fR"&gt;It’s an interesting initiative that Lime hopes will further decrease the environmental impact of its shareable e-bikes, which are touted as a way of reducing reliance on cars for short journeys. In the past, other shared micromobility options like e-scooters have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/12/18307591/electric-scooter-sharing-bird-lime-uber-economics-big-picture"&gt;criticized for their short lifespans&lt;/a&gt;, with &lt;a href="https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/electric-scooters/"&gt;one 2019 report&lt;/a&gt; estimating their average lifespan at around four months.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vrb1VlPDafXJKqedIoOQMGn9qBw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22339243/IMG_4123.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lime / Gomi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The speakers shown off in front of Lime’s fleet of e-bikes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSP7DT"&gt;Although Lime says the speakers use “damaged” e-bike battery cells from its early-generation e-bikes, they’ve been cleaned and “rigorously tested” before being used in the speakers. The casing of the Gomi speakers is also made using 100 percent recycled plastic waste. Available in green, black, blue, and “birthday cake,” the speakers are covered by what Gomi calls a “repairs-for-life return service” which it says will “ensure they never need to be thrown away unnecessarily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RD2A0R"&gt;E-bike batteries, like all rechargeables, have a limited number of charge cycles. VanMoof, for example, says the integrated batteries used in its S3 and X3 e-bikes are rated for over &lt;a href="https://support.vanmoof.com/en/support/solutions/articles/44001939021-what-is-the-lifecycle-of-the-vanmoof-s3-x3-s-battery-"&gt;800 charge cycles before falling below 70 percent&lt;/a&gt; (and eligible for replacement). As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22178543/bike-bicycle-boom-covid-pandemic-2020-sales-cities-infrastructure"&gt;e-bike sales explode globally,&lt;/a&gt; it would certainly be better to repurpose those old diminished batteries instead of adding to the growing issue of e-waste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nPO4Vt"&gt;Similar efforts are underway to find uses for old electric car batteries, &lt;a href="https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/car-makers-and-startups-get-serious-about-reusing-batteries"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GreenTechMedia&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Companies like &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150615005326/en/Nissan-and-4R-Energy-Partner-with-Green-Charge-Networks-for-Commercial-Energy-Storage-Featuring-Second-Life-Electric-Vehicle-Batteries"&gt;Nissan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.electrichybridvehicletechnology.com/news/joint-ventures/mercedes-benz-to-create-second-life-battery-storage-system-for-chinas-energy-grid.html"&gt;Mercedes-Benz Energy&lt;/a&gt; have announced pilots to turn old car batteries into massive energy storage systems to help with fluctuations in power on the grid.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volvo says it will only sell electric cars by 2030</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pwclOPYUDvZXaKl6UiGYQndHtEs=/287x0:4814x3018/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68896092/259202_Volvo_XC40_Recharge_P8_AWD_in_Glacier_Silver.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Volvo unveiled its first fully electric car, the XC40, in 2019.  | Image: Volvo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DuISGu"&gt;Swedish automaker Volvo says it will &lt;a href="https://www.media.volvocars.com/uk/en-gb/media/pressreleases/277409/volvo-cars-to-be-fully-electric-by-2030"&gt;only sell electric cars&lt;/a&gt; by 2030, phasing out all diesel, petrol, and hybrid options in an effort to reduce global carbon emissions. The company previously aimed for half of its cars sales to be electric by 2025, but says the new strategy is an “acceleration” of this goal driven by “strong demand” for its electric options. The company also says future sales of its electric cars in “coming years” will be online-only. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CvhPnZ"&gt;Volvo, which is owned by Chinese conglomerate Geely, launched its first fully-electric car, the XC40 Recharge, last year. The SUV has a roughly 200 mile range and can charge its batteries to 80 percent capacity in 40 minutes. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195499/volvo-xc40-recharge-ev-suv-first-drive-specs-price"&gt;our time with the car&lt;/a&gt; we found it to be an “impressive blend of Swedish ingenuity, crossover utility, and electric performance,” though shipments to the US are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307866/volvo-xc40-recharge-delay-software-update-on-call-ota"&gt;currently delayed&lt;/a&gt; while Volvo waits on a crucial software update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tqWVTi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are fully focused on becoming a leader in the fast-growing premium electric segment.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ph3JWh"&gt;By making its future family of electric cars available for sale online only, Volvo is following a similar move from Tesla, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/28/18245296/tesla-stores-closing-online-only-car-sales"&gt;closed&lt;/a&gt; most of its physical stores in 2019. Tesla’s move to e-commerce helped the company cut operating expenses, and presumably Volvo is eyeing similar benefits. The company &lt;a href="https://www.media.volvocars.com/uk/en-gb/media/pressreleases/277408/all-pure-electric-volvo-models-to-be-available-online-only"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it will invest “heavily” in its online sales platform while offering customers fewer products with more transparent pricing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5jizu"&gt;“To remain successful, we need profitable growth. So instead of investing in a shrinking business, we choose to invest in the future — electric and online,” said Volvo’s chief executive Håkan Samuelsson in a &lt;a href="https://www.media.volvocars.com/uk/en-gb/media/pressreleases/277409/volvo-cars-to-be-fully-electric-by-2030"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;. “We are fully focused on becoming a leader in the fast-growing premium electric segment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXDaAx"&gt;Volvo says there is simply “no long-term future” for cars with internal combustion engines, and it’s not the only automaker to come to this conclusion. UK manufacturer Jaguar says it plans to be an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22284000/jaguar-land-rover-electric-cars-i-pace-2025"&gt;all-electric brand by 2025&lt;/a&gt;, while the century-old luxury automaker Bentley aims to &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/luxury-automaker-bentley-go-all-electric-n1246862"&gt;hit that same goal by 2030&lt;/a&gt;. As these names suggest, going all-electric is more feasible for higher-end brands. Volvo will unveil its second fully-electric car later today. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="aq3EMv"&gt;Google is updating its augmented reality SDK so that phones with dual cameras can capture better depth information. &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/03/01/googles-about-to-enhance-ar-performance-by-taking-advantage-of-your-phones-dual-cameras/"&gt;As noted by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the most recent update to the Google Play Services for AR app, which is how Google distributes ARCore features, now notes “Dual camera stereo depth on supported devices” in its changelog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDIf0S"&gt;For now, it appears that the support will be limited to Google’s own Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL, which were both released in 2019. The &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/ar/discover/supported-devices"&gt;list&lt;/a&gt; of compatible ARCore devices on Google’s developer site says that dual camera support will roll out in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NN0JB1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google keeps adding Pixel features it claims it didn’t need: 2020 edition","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496779/google-pixel-5-ultrawide-telephoto-camera-headphone-jack-direction-change"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ERD4y1"&gt;Notably, this means that the Pixel 5 and 4a 5G, both of which are 2020 Pixel phones with dual cameras, won’t see the benefits for now. That may be because their secondary cameras are ultrawides rather than the Pixel 4 and 4 XL’s telephotos, which would have implications for how they could produce more detailed depth maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eWhWoV"&gt;In any case, it’s another consequence of Google’s indecision on Pixel camera lenses. The company long insisted that it only needed a single camera due to computational features like &lt;a href="https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/10/see-better-and-further-with-super-res.html"&gt;Super Res Zoom on the Pixel 3&lt;/a&gt;, then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/16/20916938/pixel-4-camera-vs-iphone-11-pro"&gt;confusingly added a telephoto lens&lt;/a&gt; on the Pixel 4 anyway, then backtracked and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496686/pixel-5-camera-comparison-sensor-specs-features"&gt;swapped it out for an ultrawide&lt;/a&gt; on the Pixel 5.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rudy Giuliani just lost his YouTube privileges for two weeks</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Rey Del Rio/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wikrPL"&gt;YouTube has suspended Rudy Giuliani’s YouTube channel for the second time this year for making false claims of fraud in the 2020 US presidential election and has issued a strike against his channel. It’s Giulani’s second strike within 90 days, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-01/youtube-suspends-rudy-giuliani-again-for-election-fraud-claims"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;meaning that Giuliani cannot upload videos for two weeks. In a statement, YouTube also cited Giulani’s promotion of nicotine, which is against the company’s rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvUyKd"&gt;“We have clear Community Guidelines that govern what videos may stay on YouTube, which we enforce consistently, regardless of speaker,” a YouTube spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We removed content from the Rudy W. Giuliani channel for violating our sale of regulated goods policy, which prohibits content facilitating the use of nicotine, and our presidential election integrity policy. Additionally, in accordance with our long standing strikes system, we issued a strike against the Rudy W. Giuliani channel, which temporarily restricts uploading or live-streaming.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KHFBo"&gt;In January, YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-26/youtube-temporarily-suspends-rudy-giuliani-from-partner-program?utm_content=business&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;suspended Giuliani for a week&lt;/a&gt; for sharing 2020 election misinformation and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251338/twitter-facebook-youtube-election-misinformation-ban-trump"&gt;temporarily suspended&lt;/a&gt; him from YouTube’s partner program, meaning he couldn’t earn ad revenue on his videos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7AT5Y"&gt;If Giuliani gets a third strike in the same 90-day period following the first, his channel will be permanently removed from YouTube, according to the &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/2802032?hl=en"&gt;company’s strikes policy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cmZZIr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook continue bans over Trump election claims","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22251338/twitter-facebook-youtube-election-misinformation-ban-trump"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Roku’s advertising ambitions just got even bigger with new Nielsen deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o_xl6o-P1xgohBd4v5owUnDePvk=/0x47:1200x847/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68894583/roku_verge.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zaL2fS"&gt;Roku, one of the most popular streaming platforms in US homes, &lt;a href="https://newsroom.roku.com/news/2021/03/roku-and-nielsen-announce-strategic-alliance-/b-twyx4b-1614633923"&gt;is acquiring Nielsen’s video advertisement business&lt;/a&gt; as it tries to become a central hub for TV advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYhHSN"&gt;Specifically, Roku is acquiring Nielsen’s Advanced Video Advertising unit. The acquisition means that Roku will also acquire Nielsen’s automatic content recognition (ACR) and dynamic ad insertion (DAI) technology. DAI technology simply means that advertisers will be able to receive “better targeting and measurement” capabilities so they can hyper-target a specific audience instead of more broad demographics like age and gender. Think of ads for products people might actually want playing before a YouTube video compared to seemingly random ads playing on CNN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9vTL8e"&gt;It’s often referred to as addressable TV advertising because of how advanced the targeting is compared to previous ad tech. For networks, this allows them to maximize their ad inventory value, while advertisers can better track return on investment for ads on a specific show or network. Effectively, the acquisition is going to allow Roku to work with different linear TV programmers to turn traditional TV ads into digital ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Upbs3e"&gt;So, why does this matter for Roku? Think of the power dynamics at hand. There are more than 51.2 million Roku accounts using the platform to stream everything from live, linear television to streaming services like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/streaming-wars"&gt;Netflix and Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;. With Roku controlling Nielsen’s advanced advertising technologies, it puts Roku in a good spot when it comes to negotiating with advertisers who are looking for the best way to target viewers consuming television in a litany of ways. Roku will be able to use its tech platform, and the new advertising tools, to provide the best, focused advertising for firms across both linear TV and streaming video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6iy6sU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Think of ads for products people might actually want playing before a YouTube video compared to seemingly random ads playing on CNN&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4576su"&gt;Prior to the announcement, Nielsen’s advanced advertisement group “struck deals with Disney, CBS, Discovery, Fox, NBCUniversal, WarnerMedia, A+E Networks and AMC Networks,” &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/roku-acquires-nielsen-advanced-video-advertising-1234918532/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Those companies are expected to have “renewed conversations” with Roku, &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;adds, specifically about “working with Roku to enable addressable ads.” Nothing in life is free, and it seems possible that Roku’s new deal means it’ll be able to take a cut of the ad inventory that would come with new deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fWhxSU"&gt;When NBCUniversal executives were trying to negotiate with Roku over bringing their new streaming service, Peacock, to Roku devices, a large part of the delay came from disagreements over advertising inventory. NBCUniversal executives didn’t want to give up a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445118/roku-nbc-tv-everywhere-channels-peacock-streaming-distribution-comcast"&gt;significant portion of their advertising revenue&lt;/a&gt; (Roku typically takes 30 percent of ad inventory, but works out specific deals with each partner depending on the offering). Peacock is also ad-supported, and NBCUniversal developed its own targeted digital advertising technology to try and persuade advertisers to place commercials on the platform. Giving up a percentage of that advertising revenue is a tough pill to swallow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjgzxD"&gt;Roku’s biggest advantage — and what seemingly tipped the negotiations — is its scale. The company grew its user base by roughly 40 percent between 2019 and 2020, according to fourth quarter earnings. Even more impressive is its ad-supported Roku Channel, which doubled its audience and reached approximately 61.8 million people in the US in the fourth quarter. Roku’s tech platform and scale is exactly what Nielsen’s Advanced Video Advertising unit needed. So many people in the United States have Roku devices, that not having a channel or streaming service on it is detrimental.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lMSibf"&gt;While executives feel strongly that addressable TV advertising is the future, it still only makes up about 10 percent of the overall US linear ad business, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/roku-to-acquire-nielsens-advanced-tv-advertising-division-a316980f-a63c-4305-b816-8208bf33f951.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Now, the unit will work off more than 100 million connected devices instead of 55 million, &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;adds, giving Nielsen even more insight into the potential of digital ads on linear networks. Spending on addressable TV advertising in the United States is expected to hit “$3.6 billion by 2022, up 75% from August 2020, according to recent estimates by research firm eMarketer,” &lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbgqJG"&gt;If the industry eventually shifts into more being spent on addressable TV advertising, Roku will hold the key position. This also helps explain why Roku spent $150 million in late 2019 to purchase Dataxu, an ad tech company, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/roku-nielsen-acr-acquisition"&gt;as noted by &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Roku’s business is increasingly more reliant on its digital platform, which is powered by advertising. Making it so everyone else may have to pay a fee to reap the benefits of being on the platform seems like a smart business move for Roku. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JzkT16"&gt;Grimes is the latest artist to get in on the NFT gold rush, selling around $6 million worth of digital artworks after putting them up for auction yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RKdrsb"&gt;A series of 10 pieces — some one of a kind, others with thousands of copies — went up for sale on &lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/profile/grimes"&gt;Nifty Gateway&lt;/a&gt; on February 28th. The highest-selling piece was a one-of-a-kind video called “&lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0x948b3515d81034a3c16d5393c6c155946c93c103/1"&gt;Death of the Old&lt;/a&gt;” that involves flying cherubs, a cross, a sword, and glowing light that’s set to an original song by Grimes. The winning bidder took it for nearly $389,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZfZMIe"&gt;The bulk of the sales came from two pieces with thousands of copies available that sold for $7,500 each. The works, titled “&lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0xe04cc101c671516ac790a6a6dc58f332b86978bb/1"&gt;Earth&lt;/a&gt;” and “&lt;a href="https://niftygateway.com/itemdetail/primary/0xe04cc101c671516ac790a6a6dc58f332b86978bb/2"&gt;Mars&lt;/a&gt;,” are both short videos featuring their titular planet with a giant cherub over it holding a weapon, also set to original music. Nearly 700 copies were sold for a total of $5.18 million before sales closed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C0lEKV"&gt;If you’re totally perplexed as to what’s happening here, welcome to the party. After slowly growing in popularity over the past several months, NFTs exploded over the past week or so as the hot new tech thing. The tech — which stands for “non-fungible token” — allows buyers to purchase ownership of a digital good, usually an image, animation, or video, in the form of a unique digital token living on a blockchain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZLj6y"&gt;NFTs allow buyers to support artists, but it also gives buyers a couple things in return. Buyers may not get to hang these digital pieces on their wall, but they might get bragging rights for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22287956/nyan-cat-crypto-art-foundation-nft-sale-chris-torres"&gt;purchasing a famous work like Nyan Cat&lt;/a&gt; or something from a popular artist like Grimes. NFTs are also a speculative asset, and many marketplaces have popped up that offer the ability to resell them — theoretically for a lot more, so long as the hype around NFTs continues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsejjH"&gt;Grimes isn’t the only artist to have made out big on NFTs already. The digital artist Beeple sold $3.5 million worth of art through Nifty Gateway last year. The artist behind Nyan Cat made around $600,000. And the electronic musician 3LAU &lt;a href="https://edm.com/gear-tech/3lau-record-breaking-nft-sale"&gt;reportedly made more than $11 million&lt;/a&gt; from album sales and digital goods just this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QM57Ob"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; ️The "War Nymph" collection is dropping tomorrow, February 28 @ 2pm EST.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Are you ready for this collaboration between &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Grimezsz?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Grimezsz&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MacBoucher1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@MacBoucher1&lt;/a&gt;? Who is excited for this drop?    &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don't forget a % of the proceeds from the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NFT?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NFT&lt;/a&gt; sales will be donated to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/carbon_180?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@carbon_180&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href="https://t.co/Z07WTvrM6g"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Z07WTvrM6g&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nifty Gateway (@niftygateway) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/niftygateway/status/1365806419828596738?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6hWtwR"&gt;Nifty Gateway said that an undisclosed percentage of Grimes’ sales would go to Carbon180, a nonprofit focused on removing carbon from the atmosphere. The donations may be meant to address one of the major problems that NFTs share with other blockchain technologies — they’re hugely inefficient in their electricity use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAMbd3"&gt;Each of the works is part of Grimes’ “WarNymph” collection, made in collaboration with her brother Mac Boucher. Grimes debuted War Nymph in 2019 and initially used &lt;a href="https://pitchfork.com/features/interview/grimes-miss-anthropocene-interview/"&gt;the “digital persona” slash “alternative psyche”&lt;/a&gt; to promote her album &lt;em&gt;Miss Anthropocene&lt;/em&gt;. War Nymph’s appearance has changed over time, morphing into the vaguely demonic winged baby seen in these NFTs last January, shortly before she confirmed her pregnancy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Fka88"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction March 1st, 11:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yesterday was February 28th, not November 28th, as this article very clearly misstated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Clue gets FDA clearance for digital birth control</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BioWink GmbH Secures $7million In Funding From Investors" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XHMI6q2gn5wvfYGww_wrvnd_Ie0=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68894296/491970246.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SI53NX"&gt;Clue, best known for its period tracking app, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/clue-gets-fda-clearance-to-launch-a-digital-contraceptive/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it &lt;a href="https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfpmn/pmn.cfm?ID=K193330"&gt;received clearance&lt;/a&gt; from the Food and Drug Administration for a digital birth control function, which it says can help users prevent pregnancy based only on the start date of a user’s period. It calculates the window where someone could get pregnant based on statistical modeling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GBASYu"&gt;“It personalizes over time. So as the individual puts in their cycle day one then we’re able to personalize the window of their high risk days vs their low risk days,” Clue’s chief medical officer Lynae Brayboy &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/clue-gets-fda-clearance-to-launch-a-digital-contraceptive/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSdDV2"&gt;The company plans to launch its digital birth control some time this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4y9eyG"&gt;Clue says that its digital birth control is 92 percent effective at preventing unwanted pregnancy when it’s used the way most people do (accounting for some errors) and 97 percent effective under perfect use. The statistical method it uses was &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2019/03/18/fertility-app-dot-bills-itself-as-contraception/"&gt;originally developed&lt;/a&gt; and tested by researchers at the Institute for Reproductive Health at Georgetown University and a company called Cycle Technologies, and acquired by Clue in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V0PQ6F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This is the second form of digital birth control to get clearance from the FDA &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="od10zS"&gt;This is the second form of digital birth control to get clearance from the FDA to market itself as birth control. The first, Natural Cycles, requires users to take their body temperature each morning. Its 2018 clearance was controversial — it came just after the app was blamed for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/16/16895978/natural-cycles-contraceptive-app-unwanted-pregnancies-complaint"&gt;unwanted pregnancies in Sweden&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ETFsE"&gt;Clue’s digital birth control was cleared by the FDA under its “substantially equivalent” designation, meaning that the agency determined that it was safe and effective because it’s similar to a product already on the market. In this case, Clue’s product was considered similar enough to Natural Cycles. Elina Berglund, the CEO of Natural Cycles, said in a statement that the company will be doing its own analysis of Clue. “Our initial findings based on the FDA filing indicate a significant difference between Natural Cycles and this other product — including that this product is solely based on menstrual data and no other biomarker such as temperature,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGgDdz"&gt;The idea behind digital birth control is related to fertility awareness methods of birth control, where people track metrics like the dates of their periods, &lt;a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/basal-body-temperature/about/pac-20393026#:~:text=Your%20basal%20body%20temperature%20is,predict%20when%20you'll%20ovulate."&gt;their temperature&lt;/a&gt;, and changes to their cervical mucus to predict when they’re ovulating and could become pregnant. These methods &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/09/fertility-apps-birth-control-evidence.html"&gt;can be highly effective&lt;/a&gt; when used correctly, but they typically take rigorous, hands-on tracking. They can be good options for people who can’t or don’t want to use hormonal birth control or other methods, but some experts &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2018/09/fertility-apps-birth-control-evidence.html"&gt;worry that the principles&lt;/a&gt; can’t translate into apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fdlxH6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If someone is ineligible or their cycle becomes too irregular, the app will lock them out&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GwAXBL"&gt;Only people who are between 18 and 45 years old and who have regular periods should use Clue’s birth control, the company &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/01/clue-gets-fda-clearance-to-launch-a-digital-contraceptive/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If someone is ineligible or their cycle becomes too irregular, the app will lock them out, said CEO Audrey Tsang. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rrX4kq"&gt;Clue’s period tracker previously had a feature that predicted if users were in a fertile window — the day of and days leading up to ovulation. The app said that the fertile window feature &lt;a href="https://helloclue.com/articles/about-clue/clue-is-not-a-contraceptive-for-now"&gt;should not be used as birth control&lt;/a&gt; but could help users who are &lt;a href="https://helloclue.com/articles/about-clue/how-to-use-the-clue-app-to-help-you-become-pregnant"&gt;trying to become pregnant&lt;/a&gt;. The company removed that feature &lt;a href="https://helloclue.com/articles/about-clue/how-to-use-the-clue-app-to-help-you-become-pregnant"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;, saying that it could be inaccurate. “We determined that it could be misleading to those who wish to use the fertile window to avoid pregnancy,” it said in a &lt;a href="https://helloclue.com/articles/how-to-use-clue/why-we-are-removing-the-fertile-window"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “We hope to offer a solution to this problem in the near future.”&lt;/p&gt;
