    <title>Go read this deep dive into Uber founder Travis Kalanick’s CloudKitchens startup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VH-8BaBADc7b8vQWUcXJuPbkIkw=/66x0:779x475/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69176234/uber-travis-kalanick-vf-summit-2.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="susc3u"&gt;As Uber founder Travis Kalanick prepared to leave &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/24/21036471/travis-kalanick-leaving-uber-board-of-directors"&gt;Uber’s board of directors in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, he was already hyping his next venture: a startup called CloudKitchens that rents out space to restaurants for delivery-only services. He predicted at the time that the startup would be “bigger than Uber.” &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/uber-founder-turns-real-estate-mogul-for-ghost-kitchen-startup-11603186200"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last October that CloudKitchens had purchased more than 40 properties in some two dozen cities, for more than $130 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mJQ9Uf"&gt;But a &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/travis-kalanicks-cloudkitchens-repeats-uber-playbook-loses-staff-2021-4"&gt;new report from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggests that many of the tactics that became infamous at Uber — the always be hustlin’ mentality and aggressive internal culture — are in place at CloudKitchens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="gzaymO"&gt;Inside CloudKitchens, people describe an alpha-male organization helmed by a “temple of bros,” in which Kalanick and two pals reign supreme and where a “Fight Club”-like code of secrecy affects all aspects of the job. Visual cues, like “No Quinoa” T-shirts worn by Kalanick loyalists, reinforce a hard-knock culture that frowns on coddled techies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DEgzN4"&gt;Kalanick’s time at the helm of the ride-hailing startup was riddled with controversy. Former engineer Susan Fowler wrote a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/19/14664474/uber-sexism-allegations"&gt;now-infamous blog post&lt;/a&gt; alleging that Uber had serious sexism problems; the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/03/technology/uber-greyball-program-evade-authorities.html"&gt;Project Greyball was designed to mislead authorities&lt;/a&gt;, allowing Uber to continue operations in places where it had been banned; and Kalanick was recorded yelling at an Uber driver while he was still CEO of the company. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/21/technology/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick.html"&gt;He resigned in 2017&lt;/a&gt; under pressure from the company’s board of directors and shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVJ3CP"&gt;There seems to be a good deal of Uber-like chaos at CloudKitchens, according to &lt;em&gt;Insider, &lt;/em&gt;and it has led to a lot of turnover:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="N7dAaI"&gt;Since the start of the year, more than 300 corporate employees have left the company, some of whom say they quit over paltry bonuses and a contentious new leveling system. And now, with the pandemic lockdowns easing and competitors pilling into the food-delivery market, the ousted Uber founder’s comeback plan will be put to the test — with his critics and fans watching closely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="EEzjLx"&gt;It seems like the strategies that propelled Uber to be (at one time) one of the most valuable startups in the world are in effect at Kalanick’s new venture. Whether CloudKitchens suffers the same fall from grace (and rebound) that Uber did is still very much up in the air. Go read this excellent deep dive by &lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;that delves into the dark corners of the hot startup company. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Quiplash, one of the best party games ever, is free on Steam this weekend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UEszbBfavIFWba5GsNvQdS1gz_Y=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69176232/ss_b43742be0818c5c18a6415f51ac4d2e383aa732f.1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Quiplash&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Jackbox Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="in3R8d"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quiplash&lt;/em&gt;, the hilarious sentence-completion party game from Jackbox Games, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/351510/Quiplash/"&gt;is available for free on Steam this weekend&lt;/a&gt;. The deal runs until April 26th at 1PM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtAEjk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quiplash&lt;/em&gt; is, without question, my extended family’s favorite game for group gatherings. (Technically, we play &lt;em&gt;Quiplash 2&lt;/em&gt;, included in &lt;em&gt;Jackbox Party Pack 3&lt;/em&gt;, but they’re extremely similar games.) The premise is simple. At the beginning of a round, players will be given prompts to fill in an answer privately on their smartphones or browser. Then, everyone will get to vote on which response was the best by seeing them pitted head-to-head on the main screen (whether that’s a TV, a Zoom call, a Twitch stream, etc.). More votes equal more points, and the person with the most points at the end wins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lbf8h8"&gt;My family can spend hours in &lt;em&gt;Quiplash&lt;/em&gt; trying to make each other cry tears of joy with ever-more ridiculous answers. After years of playing, we now have dozens of &lt;em&gt;Quiplash&lt;/em&gt;-related in-jokes (to my family reading this: SSQ), and there are even phrases we’ve had to ban because people used them too much. Best of all, &lt;em&gt;Quiplash&lt;/em&gt; is really easy to play — all you need is a device with a browser. At the price of free, I definitely recommend picking it up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZY2SA"&gt;Jackbox Games has also put a bunch of its other games on sale, and you can &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/JackboxWeekendParty"&gt;browse those deals here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ad9Iy2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s new 12.9-inch iPad Pro won’t work with the original $349 Magic Keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1j8ntN2FIvbvCJtwgIuxpUeXV-Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69176079/vpavic_042018_3979_0072.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y1jUjU"&gt;Apple’s new 12.9-inch iPad Pro has a big catch: it turns out that the new 2021 model is incompatible with the old Magic Keyboard folio case for the 2018 and 2020 models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Caamg9"&gt;The news, first reported by French site &lt;a href="https://www.igen.fr/accessoires/2021/04/lipad-pro-129-de-2021-besoin-dun-nouveau-magic-keyboard-selon-apple-122043"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iGeneration&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and confirmed via sources familiar with the matter to &lt;em&gt;The Verge, &lt;/em&gt;means that if you’re looking to upgrade from a 2018 or 2020 12.9-inch iPad Pro to the refreshed model (with its Mini LED display, faster M1 processor, and upgraded camera), you’ll also have to shell out an extra $349 for a new Magic Keyboard case, even if you already bought the prior version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1cohH8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Bad news for 2020 iPad Pro owners&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="08S7i0"&gt;The 2021 12.9-inch iPad Pro is slightly thicker than the 2020 version: the new model measures in at 6.4mm thick, or 0.5mm thicker than the 5.9mm 2020 model, an increase that’s speculated to be due to the more complex Mini LED screen technology. The updated 11-inch iPad Pro, on the other hand, will still be compatible with the older Magic Keyboard case (it doesn’t have an upgraded screen and its dimensions haven’t changed).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hG6aB1"&gt;The good news is that the new 2021 Magic Keyboard case is backwards compatible with the previous 2018 and 2020 iterations of the iPad Pro, so if you end up shelling out for the new model, you’ll be able to use it with older iPads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OVREGv"&gt;But it’s certainly frustrating for anyone who already owns a 12.9-inch iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard to see that upgrading won’t just mean spending at least $1,099 to get the benefits of the new model — they’ll also have to spend the extra $349 for a new Magic Keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney’s amazing bipedal robot Groot looks like Asimo discovered cosplay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C0rFepbcQVrxXpfwft038fOeDz8=/47x0:553x337/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69176073/disney_groot_robot.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;He walks, he waves, he probably falls over in a strong breeze. &lt;/em&gt; | GIF: Disney via &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/disney-imagineerings-project-kiwi-is-free-walking-robot-that-will-make-you-believe-in-groot/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zfGpCE"&gt;Disney’s R&amp;amp;D labs, commonly known as its Imagineering team, does some extremely impressive — and &lt;em&gt;expressive&lt;/em&gt; — things with robots. It’s made &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=theverge.com+disney+robot&amp;amp;oq=theverge.com+disney+robot&amp;amp;aqs=chrome..69i57.4139j0j7&amp;amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;amp;ie=UTF-8"&gt;mechanical stunt doubles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/29/15702592/pandora-world-of-avatar-navi-river-journey-ride-review"&gt;lifelike alien Na’vi&lt;/a&gt;, and, uh, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/1/21544341/disney-skinless-robot-blink-human-robotics"&gt;this skinless weirdo&lt;/a&gt;. But the company’s latest creation looks like it quite literally walked out of a Disney movie. It’s a bipedal Groot that can amble about tether-free. As Disney’s Pinocchio would put it: he’s got no strings to hold him down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hes8JJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;’s Matthew Panzarino &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/disney-imagineerings-project-kiwi-is-free-walking-robot-that-will-make-you-believe-in-groot/"&gt;has the low-down&lt;/a&gt; on this robotic milestone for Disney. It’s part of the company’s long-term efforts to develop autonomous robot actors for its parks, says Panzarino, under the codename of “Project Kiwi.” The company’s engineers spent years creating their own free-standing bipedal robotics platform to power Groot, and Panzarino — who got to see the robot in person — came away impressed with their efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EKrN9C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The gait is smooth, the arms swing in a lifelike manner and the feet plant realistically”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gaC29y"&gt;“The gait is smooth, the arms swing in a lifelike manner and the feet plant realistically. The body sways exactly as you’d expect it. There’s no other way to say it, it’s ambling,” he writes of the robotic Groot. “The pint sized character has accurately rendered textures on its face, hands and feet. It’s dressed in a distressed red flight suit that you may remember from the films. And its eyes are expressive as it looks at me and waves.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qNCsUR"&gt;You can see for yourself below (though if your browser is blocking embedded YouTube videos, there’s a direct link right &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/6spi7nBqrro"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eR4gcx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6spi7nBqrro?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4B3Pe"&gt;What Disney has done stands up to the output of any industrial or academic lab (pun intended). Engineers have been working on bipedal robots for decades, but their creations are generally too unreliable or brittle to operate in the real world. Honda’s path-breaking Asimo robot was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17514134/honda-asimo-humanoid-robot-retire"&gt;retired in 2018&lt;/a&gt; without ever leaving the lab, while Boston Dynamics’ Atlas can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/11/17/16671328/boston-dynamics-backflip-robot-atlas"&gt;leap and backflip&lt;/a&gt; but only if there are ample crash mats in its vicinity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tlGRev"&gt;To be clear, Disney’s Project Kiwi isn’t ready to do a meet and greet at Walt Disney World just yet. As Panzarino reports: “I wouldn’t expect to see this in the wild soon, there is still a lot of work to be done on the way that Kiwi works and interacts with people and WDI does not have immediate plans to put it in the parks.” But it’s still looking pretty darn close. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9JrzWt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;notes that the robot has only a single cable to deliver live instructions, as well as a 45-minute battery life and built-in speakers for interactions with nearby humans (though in Groot’s case, the dialogue options are surely limited). For more technical details and the background on Project Kiwi, I recommend reading &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/23/disney-imagineerings-project-kiwi-is-free-walking-robot-that-will-make-you-believe-in-groot/"&gt;full report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thank you for the memories, Siri Remote</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rT4fXeZaUdJ_leb-zSgmxY9I6Vs=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69176015/VRG_ILLO_4545_Siri_Remote.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4Wc76v"&gt;The Apple TV remote is gone and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/18277449/apple-tv-remote-new-design-4k-features-price-release-date"&gt;new remote&lt;/a&gt; — with the exact same name, considerably more buttons, and a two-tone color scheme straight out of 2010 — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394196/apple-tv-4k-new-siri-remote-sold-separately-price-buttons"&gt;has replaced it&lt;/a&gt;. The majority of people have rejoiced this move, but I am here to mourn a remote that had no business being as captivating for my thumb as it was.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g07aNG"&gt;Technically called the Siri Remote, the super-slim minimalist remote launched in 2015 alongside the fourth-gen Apple TV (now known as the Apple TV HD). It was the third remote designed by Apple to control your TV and the first one to include a touchpad or microphones. The Siri Remote was named for the big Siri button below the touchpad and was meant to make the digital assistant a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/9/10948544/apple-tv-is-finally-getting-voice-dictation"&gt;more natural part of the way&lt;/a&gt; you interacted with your television. It didn’t do that for me, personally, but I may be an outlier on all things Apple remote. I just used it as a remote to control my TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjjh1s"&gt;I loved the Lightning port it used for charging. It was too thin to use the tiny coin cell batteries the previous Apple remotes used (and that I never had lying around my house). I could let it go months between charges, and then I just had to plug it in with the same cord I used to charge my phone. It was a nice little convenience I appreciated, and far more expensive and capable remotes, like Logitech’s recently discontinued line of Harmony remotes, felt old-fashioned next to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAWrUr"&gt;The Siri Remote was also one of the first set-top box remotes I used that let me put away my TV remote. The fourth-generation Apple TV was the first with volume control over HDMI CEC. What that meant was you could use the included Siri remote to control your TV. While it didn’t have a dedicated power button like the new remote does, it was easy for me to turn on my TV by pressing any button on the remote. I could even control my Sonos soundbar with the volume buttons. Turning the TV off did require an adventure to the Settings menu on the Apple TV if you were like me and didn’t know there was a shortcut for sleeping all devices.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Being able to control everything with one tiny remote was a welcome change of pace from juggling multiple remotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EodowT"&gt;But I didn’t just love the Siri Remote because it gave me limited control of my TV or had a Lightning port. It was also because of the touchpad, which made skimming through content on Netflix or Plex or fast-forwarding through a show on Hulu an absolute breeze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="THBRLK"&gt;At least I think so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8xrna5"&gt;While some (again maybe it was just me!) have praised the Siri Remote’s touchpad, the majority of people — including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/22268724/apple-tv-remote-game-boy-color-mod"&gt;bulk&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/9/9297131/new-apple-tv-update-remote-2015-hands-on-video-photos"&gt;staff&lt;/a&gt; here at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300891/apple-tv-siri-remote-touchpad-button-design-form-function"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, every Apple TV user on Reddit, and my mother — absolutely hated it.  Many complained about the sensitivity of the touchpad, which let you fly across the screen with a swipe but required a far gentler touch if you just wanted to pop over a row. They also complained about how easy it was to accidentally select something or lose the remote due to its size. My mother even complained because she somehow managed to shatter her remote with an accidental drop onto her tile floor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="An image of a broken Apple Remote. Followed by the text: Oops fell off chair. Put some tape on it. Should I get a new one? Still works ...." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oQl0BSdgj56WFzsGDWr3wTJuVwM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22463422/Capto_Capture_2021_04_22_05_43_11_PM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Alex Cranz / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It has not been fine.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bccDQY"&gt;I loved it precisely because it was so sensitive. I run my trackpad and mouse at similarly high sensitivity levels and like the ability to yeet across a screen with a flick. With the Siri Remote, I could flit from place to place or rewind back exactly 10 seconds with a very careful swipe of the remote. The tvOS user interface worked perfectly with the touchpad and every app icon’s appearance shifted slightly as you dragged your finger back and forth across the remote. More than once I returned to the home screen when someone called, and I used the remote and the app icons up on my TV as a digital fidget toy while I chatted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TnNBeB"&gt;The sensitivity of the touchpad also resolved naysayers’ other major problem with the remote: its size. I loved how it could fit in my extremely small hands and make me feel like the rest of you feel when you hold a normal-size remote. Many people complained about how it could slip in between cushions on the couch or disappear under an entertainment center or chair. But I’ve lost it exactly once, and that was because I stuck it in a jacket pocket and then tossed the jacket in the laundry. I never lost it when it slipped between or beneath cushions. It took just the barest of pressure on the couch to depress the touchpad’s button. Simply sitting down would reveal the remote’s location whether I wanted to find it or not. Finding it under furniture was easy, too. I just squatted down and blindly reached. If things changed on the TV I knew I’d come in contact with some part of the touchpad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaXRzQ"&gt;I can only hope the touchpad built into the directional pad of the new remote is as sensitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2Hhx0"&gt;And it’s really everything about the new remote that has me missing the old one (which technically survives even now in a basket of remotes by my couch). The new remote looks so drastically different and is such a major improvement on others’ complaints that I feel sort of how that dad who never amounted to much after high school must feel when he sees his large son dominate in the popular sport of their hometown. “Oh,” I think, “this is what it was supposed to be.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oculus is rolling out its new and more expressive avatars starting today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B_voS2YkWbsEA3J8XjvuazuATz4=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69175846/Avatar_Animation.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4v1Prd"&gt;Oculus is beginning to roll out redesigned avatars that are more expressive and customizable than those that launched in 2016. They’ll appear starting today in just a few games for the Quest VR platform, including &lt;em&gt;Epic Roller Coasters&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;PokerStarsVR&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Topgolf with Pro Putt&lt;/em&gt;. Soon, they’ll appear in &lt;em&gt;Synth Riders&lt;/em&gt;, and later in the year, a new game called ForeVR Bowling will feature them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpLsuS"&gt;The avatars launching today, starting with those few select games, seem far more fleshed out. They’ll have legs in the editor, for one (though they won’t yet appear on your avatar in VR). The new avatar editor apparently allows for a quintillion possible combinations of hair, eyes, body type, facial hair, piercings, clothing, and other features. There’s no &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/7/13195664/oculus-avatars-non-gendered-virtual-reality"&gt;gender toggle&lt;/a&gt;, nor are there a pre-baked batch of face presets. Instead, the editor lets you dive into each facial feature, down to wrinkles, nose, and makeup. It’s like a glorified character creator from an RPG. You can make an avatar that looks similar to you or just one that’s aspirational, reflecting how you want to be seen in social VR spaces.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Oculus avatar editor" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0LZTDkcqaWjsXxd42Clc3vkD4IY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22464870/oculusavatarsnew.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Oculus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A look at the new avatar editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N7d2kt"&gt;By the end of 2021, Oculus will have opened its new avatar SDK to all developers, and these VR personas will be supported in &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Ffacebook-horizon%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Facebook Horizon&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s own expansive social VR playground. Though, games are just one application for these refreshed avatars. Oculus says the avatar you create will eventually appear in some form within the Facebook app, Messenger, Instagram, and more, but only if you choose to. Oculus wouldn’t divulge any specifics on how exactly your avatar will appear in those apps or when. “We’re at the start of a long journey,” Mike Howard, product manager for avatars at Oculus, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuU8v5"&gt;Avatars first launched on the Oculus Rift platform in 2016 as “monochrome busts with floating hands,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/6/13191240/oculus-connect-3-rift-virtual-reality-avatars-hands-on-video"&gt;as my colleague Adi Robertson put it&lt;/a&gt;. Howard shared that all of the avatars from the early days had eyewear on because they weren’t trying to simulate realistic facial features, particularly the eyes. Hand movement was the big breakthrough at the time, since Oculus had launched its Touch controllers for the Rift.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UTpuhm8KinoqN9aFE04NkWez9B0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22464901/ProPutt_2_GIF.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Avatars in &lt;/em&gt;Topgolf with Pro Putt.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KGb4Fm"&gt;The design of these new avatars builds off the learnings from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/2/17189516/facebook-spaces-vr-avatar-customization-options-oculus-rift"&gt;now-defunct Facebook Spaces&lt;/a&gt; and the aforementioned Horizon experience that’s currently in an invite-only beta — both of which opted for a more welcoming, cartoon-y look than the more realistic Expressive Avatars that Oculus showed off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/26/17906514/oculus-vr-rift-expressive-avatars-eye-mouth-tracking-home-customization"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Howard told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that these new avatars are oriented in their design toward delight with attributes from animation techniques. The expressions look a little exaggerated, and they’re about as harmless-looking as Memoji. They’re cute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MB4ZzB"&gt;Despite their unassuming look, Oculus studied behavioral traits, like how often people usually blink and the speed at which their eyes shift around to look at points of interest, to make the new avatars seem more grounded in reality. It worked to make a compelling eye gaze, even though Oculus’ current headsets don’t track what your eyes are doing. Perhaps the next-generation Quest headset will, though. Mark Zuckerberg recently talked about eye tracking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319737/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-vr-ar-face-sensors"&gt;in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, saying, “One of the things that I’m really excited about for future versions is getting eye tracking and face tracking in, because if you’re really excited about social presence, you want to make sure that the device has all the sensors to really kind of animate realistic avatars so you can communicate well like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="epic roller coasters" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a_vQxbXNB_JTD1vOSUw0IQWvgP4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22464907/EPIC_ROLLERCOASTER.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Epic Roller Coasters&lt;em&gt; with avatars.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HOMllw"&gt;As for making the rest of your body move in a believable way, Oculus is leaning on machine learning to make your arm and head movements look less stilted. It trained a prediction model that can guess your shoulder and elbow positions based on where the headset and Touch controllers are located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Je1am"&gt;You can create a new avatar within the Quest and Quest 2 headsets by clicking into your profile. For Rift users connected to a PC, the new avatar editor will be located within the floating row of navigation buttons near the bottom of your field of view.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon tests letting sellers email customers directly about new products and sales</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TnKOFuYOgAPSYFzweNyRe0C1YGk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69175673/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gHGT0e"&gt;Amazon is testing a new feature for sellers that will let them contact customers directly by email to notify them of things like new product announcements or sales. It’s a major change from Amazon’s current policy, which is to limit the amount of interaction between customers and companies that sell on Amazon, outside of resolving things like returns or order issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEh4QB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/23/amazon-tests-tool-that-lets-some-brands-contact-shoppers.html"&gt;As CNBC reports&lt;/a&gt;, the new “Manage Your Customer Engagement” tool won’t let companies just spam previous customers with promotional emails. They’ll only be able to contact Amazon users who have specifically chosen to follow a particular company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tYayJT"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kwD_L7obHjo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P29wJg"&gt;Crucially, Amazon isn’t giving sellers blank-check access to customers’ personal contact information. Rather, Amazon will tell brands how many customers have opted to receive the emails, along with metrics and tracking of clicks through to product pages and any purchases that an email campaign results in — but not the names, information, or email addresses of individual customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZVbSe5"&gt;The new email campaign option is a free service for sellers, but it’s only available to brands registered through Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://brandservices.amazon.com/"&gt;Brand Registry program&lt;/a&gt; (a list that includes big names like Garmin, GoPro, KitchenAid, and more). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tS9xL"&gt;But the new tool should be a useful one for brands that rely on Amazon’s store as a way to reach their customers by giving them a new way to loop in their most enthusiastic buyers of new products or deals. Customers who are wary of getting bombarded with thirsty brand deals, though, might want to take a look at which companies they’re currently following on Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vergecast: the two Apple events from this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HiSohv"&gt;You may have heard of the new Apple products announced at the company’s “Spring Loaded” event this week — including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394034/apple-new-imac-m1-chip-colors-design-specs-price-release-date"&gt;the redesigned colorful iMac&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"&gt;location-tracking AirTags&lt;/a&gt;, and the boosted specs on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22385675/apple-ipad-pro-m1-chip-specs-features-price"&gt;the next iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. But there was another big event focused on Apple this week: on Capitol Hill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wBOZAJ"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/0Wmd05zs48HYLqPq2AkWK3" width="100%" height="232" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9H9lt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1HLZF"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Verge’&lt;/em&gt;s flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, co-&lt;/em&gt;hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22384756/apple-spring-loaded-event-recap-biggest-announcements-airtag-ipad-pro-imac"&gt;Tuesday hardware event&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; news editor Chaim Gartenberg as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396544/apple-app-store-google-play-monopoly-antitrust-bill-hearings"&gt;Wednesday’s congressional hearing&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to antitrust in the App Store with &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; politics reporter Makena Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dXqqlO"&gt;The show bridges the gap between Apple announcing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215381/tile-ultra-wide-band-tracker-apple-airtags-samsung-smartthings"&gt;Tile competitor&lt;/a&gt; and Tile speaking in front of Congress the following day.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="sJXgK0"&gt;The season finale of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22337849/falcon-winter-soldier-episode-1-recap-explainer-marvel-mcu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has arrived, bringing an end to the latest Marvel saga and settling the legacy of Steve Rogers and his emblematic shield. But the show doesn’t just answer the question of “Who is the next Captain America?” It charts a path forward for the next generation of Marvel heroes — and it uses a solution borrowed right from the comics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mL9HmU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spoilers for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; below.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TvVtY2"&gt;As basically everyone expected, the finale of &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt; sees Sam Wilson step fully into the role as the new Captain America — complete with a ripped-from-the-comics outfit and a new title card at the end of the series for “Captain America and the Winter Soldier.” (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/1/5566896/captain-america-the-winter-soldier-review"&gt;Not to be confused with the 2014 film&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoFjkI"&gt;The six-episode series had its ups and downs; it rocked back and forth between high-flying action scenes, a meandering plotline, and portentous questions about legacy, race in America, and issues of global refugees. But the most important legacy of the show (which may or may not be getting a second season) might be how it solves one of Marvel’s biggest behind-the-scenes challenges: keeping characters fresh after almost a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZXHtj4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The obvious solution is to pass down the roles to new actors&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kgiUPO"&gt;Marvel’s films effectively operate as a gigantic-scale TV series, with a massive ensemble cast that comes and goes across different episodes. Those episodes just happen to be two-hour-long big-budget movies. And like any long-running TV show, it starts to run into the issue of keeping its stars on the show as the costs rise and fatigue or boredom starts to set in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dowjM9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Iron Man &lt;/em&gt;star Robert Downey Jr. &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2019/07/robert-downey-jr-avengers-endgame-salary-1202156978/"&gt;cost $75 million&lt;/a&gt; for his final appearance in &lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame&lt;/em&gt; (compared to $500,000 for his first MCU outing), and Chris Evans was so burned out from being Captain America that, at one point, he declared a &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2014/03/chris-evans-says-he-will-basically-quit-acting.html"&gt;plan to quit acting altogether&lt;/a&gt; (although he hasn’t quite followed through yet). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/36phH4lXQPmLe24E13kBlJg_saY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22464600/TAG_102_11562_R_C.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chuck Zlotnick / Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2jQuo2"&gt;The obvious solution is to pass down the roles to new actors, much as the comics have done with Jason Aaron’s &lt;em&gt;Thor&lt;/em&gt; run or G. Willow Wilson’s reimagining of Ms. Marvel. It’s a good solution, keeping characters fresh or allowing for new spins on the idea of what, exactly, makes someone Captain America (or Iron Man or Thor). It frees up actors from being stuck playing Tony Stark until they’re 80, lets storylines resolve, and gives characters room to grow instead of hitting the reset button each film. (There’s also the helpful side effect of keeping Disney’s costs down by rotating in a new, younger star who hasn’t skyrocketed to fame through years of superhero films yet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="P4hixC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The perfect blueprint for handing down heroic roles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NDOSCd"&gt;In that regard, &lt;em&gt;The Falcon and the Winter Soldier&lt;/em&gt; is the perfect blueprint for handing down heroic roles for the rest of Marvel’s universe. Sure, Disney could have just picked up in the next film with Sam Wilson wielding the shield that he got at the end of &lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt;, but that kind of off-screen handoff would likely feel like a cop-out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqJU4C"&gt;Instead, Disney devoted an entire miniseries to the transition. It explores how and why Sam doesn’t — and then ultimately does — choose to take up the shield, showcases different contenders for the title, and ultimately shows (instead of just telling) everyone why &lt;em&gt;Sam,&lt;/em&gt; in particular, is the right choice. Even more importantly, it gives fans &lt;em&gt;time&lt;/em&gt; with Sam in a way his previous bows as Steve Rogers’ sidekick didn’t quite allow for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRSCmt"&gt;It’s the kind of strategy that Marvel is already gearing up to employ for other future second-generation Avengers. Later this year, we’ll see &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; hit Disney Plus, which looks to deal with a similar inheritance of Clint Barton’s role to Hailee Steinfeld’s Kate Bishop. The &lt;em&gt;Ironheart&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Armor Wars&lt;/em&gt; shows set to stream in the coming years will look to explore a similar shift of Tony Stark’s legacy to War Machine and Riri Williams. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Iron Man Suit (source: Paramount Pictures)" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yrSZQwdqRlCfecpahdcsf9X8IX0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/14619916/iron-man.1419980327.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Paramount Pictures&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OpmovB"&gt;Even the films are looking to get in on the action: &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; is rumored to &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2020/07/black-widow-florence-pugh-more-mcu-movies-1234571414/"&gt;see Florence Pugh take over the title&lt;/a&gt; of Scarlett Johansson’s Russian super-spy, and &lt;em&gt;Thor: Love and Thunder&lt;/em&gt; will see Natalie Portman wield the hammer as the new god of thunder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mh1EXw"&gt;Giving these character changes room to breathe doesn’t just make for better storytelling, either; it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22229076/wandavision-marvel-studios-disney-plus-streaming-loki-falcon-winter-solider-black-widow-theatrical"&gt;furthers the interconnectedness of the MCU’s storyline&lt;/a&gt;, making each subsequent show and movie a must-watch to understand the next one. And much like the first decade of the Marvel universe, it’s easy to see how Kevin Feige’s Marvel Studios could bring all of these new heroes together for the kind of box office-shattering crossovers the Marvel films are known for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmj0ZG"&gt;After all, if it worked the first time, there’s no reason why Marvel can’t pull off the same trick with a new and more diverse generation of heroes again. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Humble extends its Spring Into VR Bundle into next week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Job Simulator" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r1XQLGPQcEcr-bF4m5UF1zuUkhM=/0x43:1024x726/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69175228/job-simulator-htc-vive-adi-robertson.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Job Simulator, HTC Vive&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Oif4zu"&gt;Last week, Humble launched its &lt;a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/spring-into-vr-bundle?partner=VoxMedia"&gt;Spring Into VR Bundle&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a pack of games for use with a virtual reality headset. Originally set to end on April 21st, the company has decided to extend the deal until April 28th, giving you more time to take advantage of it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HBS2M9"&gt;You can pay as little as $1 to receive one game or pay at least $15 to unlock all eight games available in the pack — once you’ve paid, you’ll get keys that you redeem on Steam. The bundle contains the following games, all of which are compatible with wired headsets that support Steam VR:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qVyD9y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borderlands 2 VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="exIXJx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Job Simulator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="O4DlSk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sairento VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IrOCET"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Bridge Crew&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="s1MEuE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surgeon Simulator: Experience Reality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QpvZ4N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Swords of Gurrah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="APjjZg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Espire VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VoNmmA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detached&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="jAQ8br"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10461935"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ys0zRX"&gt;If you have been keeping up with the news about next-gen consoles, you will know that it is extremely difficult to purchase any next-gen gaming system. This includes not only the PS5, but some of its accessories, like the HD Camera.  If you managed to get your hands on a PS5 and are looking to buy this camera accessory, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1595098-REG%2Fsony_3005726_hd_camera_for_playstation.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo has the product in stock and has knocked $10 off its original price&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $50. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nbqEF5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562900"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x1DfUC"&gt;While we are on the topic of PS5 accessories on sale, the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1595096-REG%2Fsony_3005715_dualsense_wireless_controller.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;DualSense controller is back down to its lowest price&lt;/a&gt; of $60 at B&amp;amp;H Photo. When you purchase a PS5, it includes one DualSense controller, but if you plan to share this console with other people or play local co-op games with friends and family, you’re going to want to purchase an extra controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EjTg5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562878"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7r5lMU"&gt;Finally, at our sister site, &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/strategist/article/the-strategist-two-day-actually-good-sale.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Strategist&lt;/em&gt;'s Two-Day (Actually Good) Sale&lt;/a&gt; is underway. The two-day event contains deals on over 40 items selected by &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Strategist&lt;/em&gt;'s editors. One highlight is Sony’s WH-1000XM4 headphones, which are marked down to $268 from $348 at B&amp;amp;H Photo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Wg6UGp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;
