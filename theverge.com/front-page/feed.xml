    <title>Uber reintroduces shared rides with a new name</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Uber logo against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CCjwVJW7Da3aGqgfXJiUBGDtypM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70151970/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cWvUoh"&gt;Uber is bringing back shared rides with a new name: UberX Share. The revamped carpooling product is available first as a pilot in Miami.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vPzot"&gt;Uber suspended its Uber Pool carpooling feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183276/uber-uberpool-suspension-coronavirus-us-canada-carpool-pandemic"&gt;in March 2020&lt;/a&gt; in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the company promised earlier this month that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22764246/uber-pool-prices-shared-ride-covid-earnings"&gt;planned to bring shared rides back&lt;/a&gt;. Uber prices have gone way up recently, so a carpooling option allows the company to offer cheaper costs that could make taking an Uber a more popular transportation option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F2N7ZD"&gt;On an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fride%2Fuberx-share%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F16%2F22786147%2Fuber-uberx-share-rides-carpooling-new-name" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;UberX Share ride&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll only ride with one other person (in addition to the driver) during your trip. Everyone in the car must wear a mask, even if they are all vaccinated. UberX Share rides will have a 5 percent discount, and you’ll get &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.uber.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fride%2Fhow-it-works%2Fuber-cash%2F%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DUber%2520Cash%2520can%2520be%2520used%2Cfor%2520orders%2520with%2520Uber%2520Eats.%26text%3DYes%252C%2520you%2520can%2520pay%2520with%2Cis%2520available%2520in%2520select%2520markets.&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F16%2F22786147%2Fuber-uberx-share-rides-carpooling-new-name" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Uber Cash&lt;/a&gt; if another person is picked up during your trip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gYcpYQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;609 days later, shared rides are back in the US—and better than before&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We’ve built a new experience that’s more efficient and sustainable for riders, drivers, and the cities we serve&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;UberX Share starts piloting in Miami today! &lt;a href="https://t.co/P1HM7htO9a"&gt;pic.twitter.com/P1HM7htO9a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Andrew Macdonald (@andrewgordonmac) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andrewgordonmac/status/1460669562312138760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bw33uG"&gt;It’s unclear when UberX Share might expand, and the company said Tuesday it didn’t have anything additional to share about future rollout plans to other cities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DjwyfF"&gt;Uber rival Lyft brought back &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578402/lyft-shared-rides-rideshare-back"&gt;shared rides in July&lt;/a&gt; after also suspending the feature in March 2020. Similar to Uber, only one other rider can join, and everyone &lt;a href="https://help.lyft.com/hc/e/articles/115013078848-Lyft-Shared-rides-for-riders"&gt;must wear a mask&lt;/a&gt;. Lyft’s shared rides launched in Chicago, Denver, and Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senate confirms Google critic to lead DOJ antitrust division</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Judiciary Holds Nominations For U.S. Judicial Positions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qMp86snPI4Er8x0M4UPcObr1CC4=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70151851/1345165235.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AC6tZT"&gt;On Tuesday, the Senate confirmed Google critic and competition lawyer Jonathan Kanter to lead the Justice Department’s antitrust division, marking yet another progressive win in antitrust enforcement under the Biden administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQf7kb"&gt;Kanter has a long history representing tech companies, like Yelp and Microsoft, in lawsuits accusing Google of anti-competitive behavior. Now that he’s been confirmed, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585590/joe-biden-jonathan-kanter-antitrust-lina-khan-tim-wu-google"&gt;Kanter will lead several Justice Department&lt;/a&gt; competition cases against big tech, including a monopoly lawsuit against Google alleging that the company maintains an illegal monopoly in the digital ads market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NA0xdO"&gt;“Throughout his career, Kanter has [sic] been a leading advocate and expert in the effort to promote strong and meaningful antitrust enforcement and competition policy,” the White House said in a statement over the summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wKa4yl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Kanter is just the latest progressive favorite confirmed to lead the federal government’s crackdown on tech companies&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uYsumk"&gt;Kanter is just the latest progressive favorite confirmed to lead the federal government’s crackdown on tech companies like Facebook and Google. In June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;the Senate confirmed Lina Khan&lt;/a&gt; to chair the Federal Trade Commission. Khan first rose to prominence as a law student after authoring a 2017 paper titled “Amazon’s Antitrust Paradox.” The paper argued that the government needs new antitrust laws to prevent anti-competitive conduct in the tech industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05OtEd"&gt;The FTC has the authority to sue companies for anti-competitive behavior, and the agency is currently enmeshed in litigation against Facebook and Google. Kanter aligns closely with Khan and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22315224/tim-wu-net-neutrality-antitrust-big-tech-biden-administration-national-economic-council"&gt;progressive antitrust scholar Tim Wu&lt;/a&gt;, who currently sits on the National Economic Council. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SixUj5"&gt;Kanter’s history of leading lawsuits against big tech companies in the past has led to calls from critics for him to recuse himself from the DOJ’s active antitrust cases against Google. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6W889"&gt;“Given that Kanter is famous for representing Microsoft and Yelp and attacking Google, Kanter will raise questions about his ability to impartially enforce the law against tech businesses, just like FTC Chair Khan,” said NetChoice vice president and general counsel Carl Szabo in a statement this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xq1oh5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LK7Arw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Universal’s new contracts will make it more difficult for artists to rerecord their work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Saturday Night Live - Season 47" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nsc0qxhoHIP3lKOLYP2MVuOBefk=/524x361:2424x1628/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70151692/1236560335.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By: Will Heath/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YhinUA"&gt;Universal Music Group is modifying its contracts to extend the period in which an artist can rerecord their music, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/as-taylor-swift-rerecorded-her-red-album-universal-reworked-contracts-11636741201"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The move comes after the success of Taylor Swift’s rerecorded albums and the music label’s effort to gain more rights from artists who decide to rerecord their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1sh3P"&gt;Before, a standard contract stated that an artist couldn’t rerecord their work five years after their last delivered recording or two years after the end of their contract term, whichever is later. The new format increases the time after recording to seven years and the time after a contract term to five years, &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDIcZA"&gt;Swift owns the music composition rights to her music. Her first label, Big Machine Records, sold the rights to her master recordings (the final version we hear) to an investment firm in 2019. Her masters were reportedly &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/music/news/scooter-braun-sells-taylor-swift-big-machine-masters-1234832080/"&gt;later sold to an investment fund&lt;/a&gt; for over $300 million in 2020, which was also around the time she was free to rerecord her music. So far, she has rerecorded and released her 2008 album &lt;em&gt;Fearless&lt;/em&gt; and her 2012 album &lt;em&gt;Red&lt;/em&gt;, with “(Taylor’s Version)” in the album title to distinguish ownership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwoTRX"&gt;Music labels have gradually been losing their grip on their power and influence on the music industry with the rise of music streaming platforms like Apple Music and Spotify. One impact of music streaming platforms in the industry is a change in the way business is done because artists can release and promote their own work without the help of a label.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fon7Mj"&gt;This change will prevent an artist from creating competition during the recording’s biggest monetization period within the first 10 years, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrBpyD"&gt;Universal’s change is likely to set a standard for other recording companies. With artists who are wanting to start out, this is another consideration for how they interact with labels and their work. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lucid Motors passes Ford’s market cap four years after it nearly got bought</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QPAgGan5uW8uXFixoWh8xzXKDgw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70151615/ahawkins_210623_4646_0016.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gQwQ02"&gt;Four years after Ford was reportedly considering buying Lucid Motors, the EV startup is now worth more than the Detroit automaker. Lucid Motors’ market capitalization passed Ford’s on Tuesday, one day after the startup reported its &lt;a href="https://ir.lucidmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lucid-announces-third-quarter-2021-financial-results-and-lucid"&gt;first quarterly financial results&lt;/a&gt; as a publicly traded company and just a few weeks after it started shipping its luxury electric sedan, the Air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0roY9M"&gt;Lucid Motors has a comparatively long history for an EV startup as it was founded in 2007 as a battery company called Atieva. But after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/23/13723308/lucid-motors-vs-tesla-electric-luxury-car-concept-design"&gt;a 2016 pivot to making an electric sedan&lt;/a&gt;, Lucid Motors found itself running out of money at a time when others were starting to take off. One of the options it turned to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2017/7/20/15999024/lucid-motors-ford-funding-tesla-electric-car"&gt;was a potential Ford acquisition&lt;/a&gt;. From a July 2017 report in &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="AvpXUJ"&gt;Lucid began its fourth round of institutional fundraising earlier this year, with the help of investment bank Morgan Stanley. Ford’s acquisition offer came as a surprise, said a source close to Lucid: “The bank approached Ford to see if they wanted to participate in the Series D. They came back and said they wanted to acquire.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="naaTTy"&gt;That never happened, though, and Lucid Motors ultimately treaded water until striking a massive deal with Saudi Arabia, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594177/lucid-motors-spac-nasdaq-saudi-arabia-ev-startup"&gt;now owns a majority of the startup&lt;/a&gt;. Ford, for its part, was able to work out a pretty sizable investment of its own into Rivian — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/7/22768373/go-read-this-gm-deal-ford-rivian-fell-apart"&gt;a deal it swiped out from under rival General Motors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyrySg"&gt;In the years since, Lucid Motors spent billions of dollars of Saudi Arabia’s money getting the Air EV ready for production. The startup revealed Monday that it has lost more than $1.5 billion this year alone in the mad dash to start shipping the Air to customers and has spent some $5 billion across its lifetime.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C7Patx"&gt;The stock market — which has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774403/rivian-ipo-debut-evs-12-billion-amazon-tesla-valuation"&gt;extremely hot on electric vehicle startups lately&lt;/a&gt; — rewarded that effort Tuesday, pushing Lucid Motors’ valuation to nearly $90 billion. Ford finished the day at about $79 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyiMuK"&gt;Lucid Motors still has a lot of work ahead. The startup is still building out its new factory in Casa Grande, Arizona, and says it plans to build 20,000 Air sedans in 2022 before adding an electric SUV to its lineup at the end of the following year. It will be challenging work, to be sure. Today, at least, the market treated that to-do list as pretty much pure upside.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram may soon ask users to verify themselves with video selfies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rpFX3VzndJ99zzY4L5Z6EbgRllw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70151611/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JdMg34"&gt;Instagram is asking some users to provide a video selfie showing multiple angles of their face to verify that they’re a real person, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1460341104667201536"&gt;screenshots posted to Twitter&lt;/a&gt; by social media consultant Matt Navarra. The social network has long struggled with bot accounts, which can leave spam messages, harass people, or be used to artificially inflate like or follower counts, and it’s possible that Meta (formerly Facebook, Instagram’s parent company) is looking to this feature to help curb the prevalence of bots on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msLUZ6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/instagram-video-selfie-verification/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company started testing the feature last year but ran into technical issues. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/vicente_vma/status/1460517235055808515?s=20"&gt;Multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/darvi_sh/status/1459191474332000258?s=20"&gt;users&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StellarHeather/status/1459991213600296964?s=20"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Shannon79053723/status/1457754879578025987?s=20"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; being asked to take a video selfie to verify their existing accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0zQbHv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Instagram is now using video selfies to confirm users identity&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meta promises not to collect biometric data. &lt;a href="https://t.co/FNT2AdW8H2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/FNT2AdW8H2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Matt Navarra (@MattNavarra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattNavarra/status/1460341104667201536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ksIGUz"&gt;Another writer on Twitter, Bettina Makalintal, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bettinamak/status/1460306493207715840?s=20"&gt;posted a screenshot&lt;/a&gt; of the help screen for the step where you actually take the video selfie — it reiterates that it’s looking at “all angles of your face” to prove that you’re a real person and shows that the verification screen is showing up for multiple people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uYlNEC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;why the fuck is instagram making me take a video selfie in order to access my account &lt;a href="https://t.co/BxSW0Bnodt"&gt;pic.twitter.com/BxSW0Bnodt&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— tender juicy tofu pup (@bettinamak) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bettinamak/status/1460306493207715840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1SMgb7"&gt;It’s unclear whether this feature is currently a test or slowly rolling out — I made several attempts at setting up a sketchy-looking Instagram account and was never presented with the video challenge. Meta didn’t immediately respond to request for comment about the feature or its rollout. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcerUu"&gt;The move may surprise some, given &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/update-on-use-of-face-recognition/"&gt;Meta’s recent announcement&lt;/a&gt; that it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22759613/meta-facebook-face-recognition-automatic-tagging-feature-shutdown"&gt;shutting down one of its Face Recognition features&lt;/a&gt;. As the company has &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22761598/facebook-facial-recognition-meta"&gt;since reiterated&lt;/a&gt;, though, it was only shutting down a specific Facebook feature, not Meta’s use of facial recognition as a whole. The message on the bottom of the screenshot also implies that the feature won’t use face recognition at all and that the video will be deleted after 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6F5pR0"&gt;Meta’s promise to not store or post the data may not reassure some users who are already distrustful of Facebook. People may remember the time when &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189494/facebook-bug-instagram-email-birthdays-messages"&gt;a bug let attackers access&lt;/a&gt; Instagram users’ supposedly private birthday info (which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22648578/instagram-age-birthday-requirement-younger-people-ai-verification"&gt;you’ll soon be required to provide to use the app&lt;/a&gt;) with just a DM. Of course, Instagram hadn’t promised to delete that birthday info like it says it’ll do with the video selfie, but it’d be hard to blame people (especially minors or those who want to stay anonymous) for feeling uncomfortable with providing that data.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech reworked its G303 mouse just for Shroud, but you can buy it, too</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logitech G303 Shroud Edition" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6TQU-xhN8wMmUsWPUqCgzvzs17w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70151247/g303shroudhero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A top and bottom view of the new, wireless G303.&lt;/em&gt; | Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3yz6g5"&gt;Logitech has announced the G303 wireless gaming mouse. It’s a little more than just a cordless version of the G303 Daedalus mouse that the company released several years ago. Both a prolific streamer and pro gamer, Michael “Shroud” Grzesiek seemingly got to call the shots for how this revised version would look and feel — even down to requiring that it charged via USB-C. I doubt that he had any input on the price, though. It costs $129.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gtWrT"&gt;Logitech says that in this collaboration, it was decided by Shroud that the mouse should have “subtle markings approximating Shroud’s finger grip positions, translucent side panels to allow a window into the technology that Shroud wanted to see, and USB-C connections.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPjj7L"&gt;To me, the overall shape of the newer mouse looks nearly identical to the older G303 mouse, save for a few tweaks. Logitech says it repositioned side buttons, and on the inside, it changed the switch location. I think the most noticeable difference is the lack of RGB lighting (there’s just a battery indicator light near the scroll wheel). Logitech has been trending toward more subtle designs for its mice recently, and I’m all for it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech G303 Shroud Edition" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EXyEHjIOKkiz3JCEMAi6KAOugbw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23008949/g303shroudinline.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Underneath the side buttons, the G303 transitions to translucent plastic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="he4Ob9"&gt;The G303 wireless mouse is lightweight at 75 grams, though if you’re looking for the most feather-light wireless mouse under Logitech’s umbrella, check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21562618/logitech-g-pro-x-superlight-wireless-gaming-mouse-release-date-price-features-weight"&gt;the G Pro X Superlight&lt;/a&gt;, which weighs around 63 grams. Logitech claims that this new G303 model can last up to 145 hours per charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOeUU7"&gt;Included in the box along with the mouse is a USB-C to USB-A cable that’s used for charging the G303, as well as serving as an extender for the USB-A dongle. Also in the box is a new USB-A to USB-C converter that allows the cable to interface with the dongle. The G303 Shroud Edition, as it’s being referred to, is available now through Logitech G’s site for $129.99. I’ll be testing it more in the coming weeks for an upcoming update to our best gaming mice buying guide, so stay tuned for that. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Brave built its own crypto wallet into its browser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ucwKSALZ3Y85Xn9c5_dFsnYaYZo=/131x0:850x479/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70151183/image3_980x479.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Brave&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AoOVv2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://brave.com/brave-wallet-launch/"&gt;Brave has announced&lt;/a&gt; that its web browser now includes a native cryptocurrency wallet, replacing the previous one that was based on the MetaMask wallet extension. With it, most users should have their blockchain needs covered (depending on what blockchain they use, more on that in a second): they’ll be able to buy, sell, and trade cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, store their NFTs, keep track of how much coins are selling for, and experience the magic of Web3, or websites that have built-in blockchain features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bkgvNA"&gt;Brave &lt;a href="https://brave.com/wallet/"&gt;also says&lt;/a&gt; that its built-in wallet will take up fewer CPU resources compared to extension-based ones (like the aforementioned MetaMask) and be less susceptible to phishing or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22723092/opensea-nft-vulnerability-gift-security-researchers-wallet-hack"&gt;attempts to steal NFTs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6T9ygM"&gt;The wallet seems to work mainly with the Ethereum or Ethereum-based blockchains (ones that support EVM, like Polygon, or Layer 2 systems designed to make transactions significantly faster). Currently, that means that you’re not able to buy some of the other popular cryptocurrencies from within the wallet, like Dogecoin or Bitcoin (though you can buy &lt;a href="https://wbtc.network"&gt;wrapped Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;, which is basically an Ethereum token whose value is pinned to Bitcoin’s). But hey, given that a lot of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFTs&lt;/a&gt; are stored on Ethereum, you can at least use Brave Wallet to store those. Brave also says that it’s in the process of adding support for Bitcoin and other blockchains.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pY1n2WsALyzUbkorFI9WixCGr1Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019703/Screen_Shot_2021_11_16_at_11.12.41.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brave’s homescreen contains several crypto links out of the box. It’s not a surprise it’s added a wallet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c4bxvk"&gt;Brave has been paying attention to the blockchain, and websites built on it, for quite a while. Years ago it &lt;a href="https://brave.com/into-the-blockchain-brave-with-metamask/"&gt;started recommending that people install MetaMask&lt;/a&gt; if they found themselves on a website that could connect to the blockchain to provide extra functionality (usually related to payments). Now, Brave is finally getting built-in support for these Web3 sites (or “dapps,” a portmanteau of “decentralized apps” and a word I desperately hope to never hear said out loud in real life). It also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238334/brave-browser-ipfs-peer-to-peer-decentralized-transfer-protocol-http-nodes"&gt;recently added support&lt;/a&gt; for the decentralized tech that some hope will prevent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs"&gt;NFTs from disappearing if an image-hosting site goes down&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nEpKjY"&gt;Brave says that the wallet feature will currently be limited to its desktop browser, but that it hopes to add it to its Android and iOS versions (though it notes that iPhone users likely won’t be able to use blockchain-based websites on release). It’s always possible Brave will run into trouble with Apple’s App Review, though the company currently doesn’t seem to be aggressively against crypto — MetaMask has an iOS app, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772092/tim-cook-cryptocurrency-investment"&gt;Tim Cook has said&lt;/a&gt; that he’s invested in cryptocurrency and called NFTs “interesting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3hbXn"&gt;Given that Brave has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962085/brave-beta-1-0-privacy-browser-chrome-firefox-safari-ad-block-tracker"&gt;paid users in blockchain tokens&lt;/a&gt; since it launched (which, obviously, can be stored in the Brave Wallet), it makes sense that it’s adding more and more features for people interested in crypto. And it’s likely that a good portion of Brave users will enjoy a crypto wallet, based on the browser’s long-running support for blockchain currencies and applications — as long as they’re willing to import their crypto assets, something that Brave’s tool does support for other self-custody or certain hardware wallets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yq6x0E"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated November 16th, 6:05PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information from Brave about future support for Bitcoin and non-Ethereum blockchains.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard board rallies around embattled CEO hours after damning report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sis7keCzVJaNg09tp9YxRqV-pL8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70151045/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="snLRLS"&gt;Hours after &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; published a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/activision-videogames-bobby-kotick-sexual-misconduct-allegations-11637075680"&gt;shocking report&lt;/a&gt; alleging Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick was aware of sexual misconduct allegations at the company, the company’s board of directors &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/activision-blizzard-board-directors-issues-statement-regarding"&gt;posted a statement voicing its support of the CEO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOG3bu"&gt;The board’s language shows no indication that Kotick is in danger of losing his job. “The Board remains confident in Bobby Kotick’s leadership, commitment and ability to achieve these goals,” the statement concludes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AYbj8R"&gt;Here is the board of directors’ statement in full:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZlUIU4"&gt;The Activision Blizzard Board remains committed to the goal of making Activision Blizzard the most welcoming and inclusive company in the industry. Under Bobby Kotick’s leadership the Company is already implementing industry leading changes including a zero tolerance harassment policy, a dedication to achieving significant increases to the percentages of women and non-binary people in our workforce and significant internal and external investments to accelerate opportunities for diverse talent. The Board remains confident that Bobby Kotick appropriately addressed workplace issues brought to his attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTVVRs"&gt;The goals we have set for ourselves are both critical and ambitious. The Board remains confident in Bobby Kotick’s leadership, commitment and ability to achieve these goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="oaBvew"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Journal’s&lt;/em&gt; report also alleged that Kotick harassed one of his assistants more than a decade ago, which included a death threat. Kotick settled the matter out of court, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPlKyo"&gt;The statement arrives shortly after A Better ABK, an advocacy group formed by employees, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1460671347382755329"&gt;said that it would&lt;/a&gt; “not be silenced until Bobby Kotick has been replaced as CEO” and that it would be staging a walkout on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix launches new website for reporting its Top 10 titles </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-BN17n-RWMy-xtKG_tuhSUiyuCM=/314x0:3689x2250/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150947/still_mobile_EN.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ADjjaG"&gt;After announcing last month that it will begin to shift the way it ranks its top titles, Netflix today is launching a new website where it will share those metrics every week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWXESh"&gt;During its earnings call in October, the company said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735379/netflix-changing-ranking-metric-popular-titles-hours-viewed"&gt;shift away&lt;/a&gt; from its longtime two-minute viewing time metric to instead rank titles by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697364/netflix-viewing-data-code-2021"&gt;total number of hours&lt;/a&gt; viewed. The new &lt;a href="https://top10.netflix.com/"&gt;weekly Top 10 hub&lt;/a&gt; will update every Tuesday with lists of its top films and series in the following categories: Films (English), Films (Non-English), TV (English), and TV (Non-English). Each list will display the number of hours each top-ranking TV show or movie was watched.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tBeB4DEhtuwwqaBBpBWo_RgA0Io=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019306/Top_10_TV__English__November_8___November_14.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Iy62sf"&gt;Each list will track the success of Netflix content during the prior Monday through Sunday period before being published Tuesday. According to the company, the lists will count seasons of series as separate titles, but it will count repeated watches within a season toward that season’s overall watch hours, for example, if you watch a scene in a single episode repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxCmKo"&gt;All content on Netflix’s app is eligible to appear on these lists, including both its original and licensed shows and movies. The company will also disclose its most popular shows and movies of all time for the aforementioned four categories. As a caveat, however, the company said its figures are “rounded to 10,000 to account for any fluctuations in Internet connectivity around the world.” Titles are ranked based on their first 28 days on the service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NpHmzE6PSrz2MXZKzJnap43-Lus=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23019309/Top_10_Films__Non_English__November_8___November_14.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M9Iq5J"&gt;While the data will shift which titles rank highest, as the company demonstrated in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697364/netflix-viewing-data-code-2021"&gt;slides it shared&lt;/a&gt; during Code 2021 this year, Netflix said in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735379/netflix-changing-ranking-metric-popular-titles-hours-viewed"&gt;letter to shareholders&lt;/a&gt; last month that it believes “engagement as measured by hours viewed is a slightly better indicator of the overall success of our titles and member satisfaction.” The company said the move is part of an initiative for greater transparency around viewing data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXCbJl"&gt;The new metric will also more closely align Netflix with other viewing metrics, the company said last month, and will give “proper credit to rewatching.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden’s $7.5 billion EV charging plan will require a lot of patience</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Electric Vehicle in Maryland" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9leV7Soi6mCH08a0TN4WqTLt884=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70150736/1235384443.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZCprrT"&gt;The Biden administration’s effort to blanket the country in half a million new EV chargers in the next half-decade got $7.5 billion in funding Monday when the president &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/15/22783684/biden-infrastructure-bill-bipartisan-broadband-ev-electrical-grid-climate"&gt;signed the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill&lt;/a&gt; into law. But while those chargers will be necessary as electric vehicle sales continue to climb, Biden’s plan will require institutional — and personal — patience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgW42u"&gt;Not only will it simply take a while to build out that many chargers, but the majority of what gets built will likely be of the “Level 2” variety, which can replenish about 25 miles of battery capacity per hour. That means EV buyers in the US will have to get used to the idea of sipping energy while they’re out and about and doing most of their charging at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RO7aA"&gt;“The use case we think will be the most frequent is you’re doing something else in your life — you’re at the grocery store, or the movies, or church — and you’re just going to plug in there,” says Joe Britton, the executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association. “[That’s] instead of the gas station model, which is like, ‘Oh shoot, I’m on empty, I need to go and get all the way to full &lt;em&gt;immediately&lt;/em&gt;.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWrqV5"&gt;This is, by all accounts, how &lt;a href="https://ihsmarkit.com/research-analysis/us-infrastructure-bills-ev-charger-funding.html"&gt;most current EV owners handle charging&lt;/a&gt;. But it could prove to be an obstacle for some buyers in our petrol-centric society. At least one study already found that the top reason causing EV owners to switch back to a gas-powered car &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22419150/ev-charging-us-joe-biden-infrastructure-plan"&gt;was the inconvenience of charging&lt;/a&gt;. But another shows that the &lt;a href="https://www.coxautoinc.com/news/as-more-americans-choose-evs-price-and-range-continue-to-hold-back-the-market-according-to-new-cox-automotive-study/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social-org&amp;amp;utm_content=news"&gt;percentage of people worrying about a lack of charging is dropping&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ombJxo"&gt;The infrastructure bill does allow for funding to go to new DC Fast charging stations. (Same with hydrogen fueling stations.) But Level 2 chargers are far cheaper to build and install, meaning the administration can get more of them for the same amount of money. Level 2 chargers only cost a few thousand dollars to get in the ground, while faster chargers can be 50 to 100 times as expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="J1Oeop"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"EV charging in the US is broken — can Joe Biden fix it?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22419150/ev-charging-us-joe-biden-infrastructure-plan"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jsL2Kg"&gt;Focusing on Level 2 chargers makes it possible for them to become a ubiquitous technology, Britton says. In turn, that will make it easier for people to charge while running errands or at work since there will (hopefully) be less competition for a plug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ke7JEg"&gt;Building out hundreds of thousands of Level 2 chargers should also make finding one feel less like a burden. Many current chargers are scattered in dark corners of hotel parking lots, often with just a handful of hookups. Making them easier to find will help encourage people to top up their cars’ battery packs while on the go, Britton says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZsjTw"&gt;The language of the infrastructure bill related to EV charging is pretty broad, but it at least is focused on making these new chargers easy to access. They must be built in publicly accessible locations like parks, shopping centers, multiunit housing structures, government-owned buildings, or at transit hubs. They can be installed on private property but only if they’re accessible for a minimum amount of time per week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6DiBW"&gt;Moreover, companies applying for funding to build out more chargers can’t use a proprietary plug and have to work with local governments to figure out a long-term maintenance plan so the stations aren’t abandoned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJUY2A"&gt;It’s hard to know what exact shape this world of new chargers will look like until companies start requesting funds and local governments start doling them out. But while it’s not as ambitious a commitment as the $15 billion Biden originally wanted for EV charging infrastructure, people like Britton and Jonathan Levy, the chief commercial officer of EVgo, see it as a crucial step.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dj6XfF"&gt;“The specifics on the numbers aren’t as important as the direction” things are going, Levy said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “What we need from the tailwinds of policy is the support to accelerate ahead of full EV adoption.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKzDc4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GuG5wb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
