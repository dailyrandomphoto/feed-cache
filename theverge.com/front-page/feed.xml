    <title>How tech companies are ignoring the pandemic’s mental health crisis</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vMX2Ka"&gt;There is plenty that scientists don’t understand about the long-term effects of COVID-19 on society. But a year in, at least one thing seems clear: the pandemic has been terrible for our collective mental health — and a surprising number of tech platforms seem to have given the issue very little thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TmyD6R"&gt;First, the numbers. &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; reported that the number of adults in the United Kingdom showing symptoms of depression had nearly doubled from March to June of last year, to 19 percent. In the United States, 11 percent of adults reported feeling depressed between January and June 2019; by December 2020, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nature.com%2Farticles%2Fd41586-021-00175-z&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F9%2F22375409%2Fmental-health-crisis-tech-companies-self-harm-platform-policy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;that number had nearly quadrupled, to 42 percent&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="MM9kSR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:831613"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Y0gJ3"&gt;Prolonged isolation created by lockdowns has been linked to disruptions in sleep, increased drug and alcohol use, and weight gain, among other symptoms. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/04/07/biden-says-suicides-are-up-because-covid-that-may-not-have-happened/"&gt;Preliminary data about suicides in 2020 is mixed&lt;/a&gt;, but the number of drug overdoses soared, and experts believe many were likely intentional. Even before the pandemic, Glenn Kessler reports at &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;, “suicide rates had increased in the United States every year since 1999, for a gain of 35 percent over two decades.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wP7Rmb"&gt;Issues related to suicide and self-harm touch nearly every digital platform in some way. The internet is increasingly where people search, discuss, and seek support for mental health issues. But according to new research from the Stanford Internet Observatory, in many cases, platforms have no policies related to discussion of self-harm or suicide at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9nlwzj"&gt;In “&lt;a href="https://cyber.fsi.stanford.edu/io/self-harm-policies-report"&gt;Self-Harm Policies and Internet Platforms&lt;/a&gt;,” the authors surveyed 39 online platforms to understand their approach to these issues. They analyzed search engines, social networks, performance-oriented platforms like TikTok, gaming platforms, dating apps, and messaging apps. Some platforms have developed robust policies to cover the nuances of these issues. Many, though, have ignored them altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpOgpU"&gt;“There is vast unevenness in the comprehensiveness of public-facing policies,” write Shelby Perkins, Elena Cryst, and Shelby Grossman. “For example, Facebook policies address not only suicide but also euthanasia, suicide notes, and livestreaming suicide attempts. In contrast, Instagram and Reddit have no policies related to suicide in their primary policy documents.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8hXXX0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook is miles ahead of some of its peers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nlpzxW"&gt;Among the platforms surveyed, Facebook was found to have the most comprehensive policies. But researchers faulted the company for unclear policies at its Instagram subsidiary; technically, the parent company’s policies all apply to both platforms, but Instagram maintains &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/instagram-community-guidelines-faqs"&gt;a separate set of policies&lt;/a&gt; that do not explicitly mention posting about suicide, creating some confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="csrYJO"&gt;Still, Facebook is miles ahead of some of its peers. Reddit, Parler, and Gab were found to have no public policies related to posts about self-harm, eating disorders, or suicide. That doesn’t necessarily mean that the companies have no policies whatsoever. But if they aren’t posted publicly, we may never know for sure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgeIqO"&gt;In contrast, researchers said that what they call “creator platforms” — YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch — have developed smart policies that go beyond simple promises to remove disturbing content. The platforms offer meaningful support in their policies both for people who are recovering from mental health issues and those who may be considering self-harm, the authors said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xEh6AO"&gt;“Both YouTube and TikTok are explicit in allowing creators to share their stories about self-harm to raise awareness and find community support,” they wrote. “We were impressed that YouTube’s community guidelines on suicide and self-injury provide resources, including hotlines and websites, for those having thoughts of suicide or self-harm, for 27 countries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ewrPuT"&gt;Outside the biggest platforms, though, it’s all a toss-up. Researchers could not find public policies for suicide or self-harm for NextDoor or Clubhouse. Dating apps? Grindr and Tinder have policies about self-harm; Scruff and Hinge don’t. Messaging apps tend not to have any such public policies, either — iMessage, Signal, and WhatsApp don’t. (The fact that all of them use some form of encryption likely has a lot to do with that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MKrgzV"&gt;Why does all of this matter? In an interview, the researchers told me there are at least three big reasons. One is essentially a question of justice: if people are going to be punished for the ways in which they discuss self-harm online, they ought to know that in advance. Two is that policies offer platforms a chance to intervene when their users are considering hurting themselves. (Many do offer users links to resources that can help them in a time of crisis.) And three is that we can’t develop more effective policies for addressing mental health issues online if we don’t know what the policies are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vsk6VK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can’t moderate if you don’t even have a policy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NzJ3yI"&gt;And moderating these kinds of posts can be quite tricky, researchers said. There’s often a fine line between posts that are discussing self-harm and those that appear to be encouraging it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jb2otw"&gt;“The same content that could show someone recovering from an eating disorder is something that can also be triggering for other people,” Grossman told me. “That same content could just affect users in two different ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ImZ7i"&gt;But you can’t moderate if you don’t even have a policy, and I was surprised, reading this research, at just how many companies don’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u03w8O"&gt;This has turned out to be a kind of policy week here at Platformer. We talked about how &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/clarence-thomas-lobs-a-speech-bomb"&gt;Clarence Thomas wants to blow up platform policy as it exists today&lt;/a&gt;; how YouTube is &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/youtube-does-a-number-on-us"&gt;shifting the way it measures harm on the platform&lt;/a&gt; (and discloses it); and how &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/twitch-calls-in-the-cavalry"&gt;Twitch developed a policy for policing creators’ behavior on other platforms&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTPA0p"&gt;What strikes me about all of this is just how fresh it all feels. We’re more than a decade into the platform era, but there are still so many big questions to figure out. And even on the most serious of subjects — how to address content related to self-harm — some platforms haven’t even entered the discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6TijlA"&gt;The Stanford researchers told me they believe they are the first people to even attempt to catalog self-harm policies among the major platforms and make them public. There are doubtless many other areas where a similar inventory would serve the public good. Private companies still hide too much, even and especially when they are directly implicated in questions of public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="79e17x"&gt;In the future, I hope these companies collaborate more — learning from one another and adopting policies that make sense for their own platforms. And thanks to the Stanford researchers, at least on one subject, they can now find all of the existing policies in a single place.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Flying Lotus crafted the sounds of Yasuke, Netflix’s new samurai anime</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2018 FORM Arcosanti" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oa_uGSpxPrPAXSFWxt24GXCBRUI=/0x17:3000x2017/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69101385/957575312.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘It was a lot of fun to be a samurai for six months.’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="o6p31Z"&gt;Before he started working on &lt;em&gt;Yasuke&lt;/em&gt;, an upcoming anime series on Netflix, Grammy-nominated producer Flying Lotus was only somewhat familiar with the story. “I knew that there was a Black samurai that existed, but I didn’t know much, because there wasn’t really much out there for so long,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. So when it came time to adapt the tale, Lotus — who served as both composer and executive producer on the show — knew that they’d have to take some creative liberties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6ZR7X"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yasuke&lt;/em&gt; is a six-episode series that follows the life of the titular samurai, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasuke"&gt;a real-life historical figure&lt;/a&gt; who arrived in Japan in 1579. However, much of his life remains a mystery, and much of what has been documented could be best described as conjecture. There are a lot of holes in the Yasuke legend — which gave the team lots of room to be creative. The anime follows the samurai’s life, but it also mixes in elements of fantasy and sci-fi: there are mechs and robots, humans transforming into animals, and all kinds of magic and sorcery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5iXFC"&gt;For Lotus, it was the fact that the show would be an anime that inspired many of these far-out ideas. “It was rich enough on its own,” he says of the Yasuke legend, “but for anime it just needed that extra thing to take it over the edge.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wV51x0"&gt;Lotus is just one part of an impressive creative team behind the show. &lt;em&gt;Yasuke&lt;/em&gt; is directed by LeSean Thomas, possibly best-known as the creator of &lt;em&gt;Cannon Busters&lt;/em&gt;, and features &lt;em&gt;Get Out&lt;/em&gt; star Lakeith Stanfield in the lead role. Meanwhile, revered animation studio Mappa is helming the production. Lotus is no stranger to these kinds of collaborations — most notably, he’s worked with C&lt;em&gt;owboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; creator Shinichirō Watanabe on a number of projects — and he says part of what made &lt;em&gt;Yasuke&lt;/em&gt; so interesting was that he was involved beyond just the soundtrack, which included helping shape the story early on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="Vd0hRf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oYcK1LQl_Fs?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zMdH5Z"&gt;The trick, he says, was balancing history and fantasy. “I think there’s enough of the historical document in the show that serves Yasuke’s story, and honors his story,” he explains. “When we tell our version, no one really knows what happened to him after a certain point — I thought it was fun to speculate as to what that could be. It’s such an important time for this story to come out.” Lotus adds that, while Thomas was well-versed in the historical side, his own contributions were different. “I was the person to bring in the more left-field concepts, and the more ethereal ideas and spiritual concepts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ykt59I"&gt;Being so involved in the production also helped when it came to the score. Lotus says that, initially, he mostly knew what he &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; want the show to sound like. “I knew that people were going to be like ‘Oh, Flying Lotus is involved, he’s going to do a hip-hop thing, so it’s going to be like &lt;em&gt;Afro Samurai&lt;/em&gt;, it’s going to be like &lt;em&gt;Samurai Champloo&lt;/em&gt;, maybe it’ll be like &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; if he does a jazz thing,’” he explains. “This is also the stupid voice in my head, the voice that’s going off all the time. I also wanted to do something that’d surprise me, and be true to what I’m looking at.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HwdBtf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I wanted it to be a journey getting there.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yzYavO"&gt;He says he started thinking about the music from the very beginning, but it wasn’t until production was well underway, and he was able to see actual animation, that he could properly compose. The process involved watching episodes with musical instruments in arms’ reach — a few keyboards, some Japanese and African percussion instruments — and seeing what felt right. It took a while to find that sound, he explains, but once he did things started to flow. “I just felt the call to action,” Lotus says. “Alright, Yasuke’s got to cut some people up, well I’m gonna help him with my music. I’ll help him win these battles. I’m going through this with you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="MIQm5v"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylqBPksn36A?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mUAXpI"&gt;Part of that involved writing the songs in chronological order, so that the music developed alongside the character. “I wanted to have the music have progression like Yasuke’s character and the story that’s being told. Along the way, the story gets more magical; you start dealing with witchcraft and shamans and sorcery and all of this stuff. I wanted it to be a journey getting there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lYRvQF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I have a deep connection with this.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B7hzjK"&gt;Often composers aren’t given a lot to go on; maybe they’re shown some art and given a few notes from the director about the mood of a scene. But because he was so involved in the show’s creation, Lotus was able to create the score in a more organic way. That’s not to say that the process didn’t have any drawbacks: namely, there was a lot more pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="30W79C"&gt;“It makes it way more intimidating,” Lotus says. “Being there from the beginning, you know how much everybody worked on this. You know how much LeSean put in, and Lakeith had his voice in there, and the studio drew all of these amazing things and all these animators, character designers, directors worked on it already. They did their part. Now here you go: set the tone, and be great, in a pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="pBlhit"&gt;The important thing, he says, is that he wasn’t just a “gun for hire,” a big name brought on to help promote the show. For Lotus, his relationship to the source material was much more significant than that. “I have a deep connection with this, deeper than someone giving me a bunch of cool pictures to make music to. I’m invested in this.” Plus, he notes, “it was a lot of fun to be a samurai for six months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ux3p5B"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Yasuke &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;debuts on Netflix on April 29th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony is reportedly remaking The Last of Us for PS5 as it chases big hits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Last of Us" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jSEmvqxAZ33gWRcjWMbLzm4FdWk=/75x0:885x540/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69101182/2013_06_13_LaunchDayPost_960p.0.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jmzqvn"&gt;Sony is reportedly working on another remake of Naughty Dog’s &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; — first released in 2013 for the PlayStation 3, followed by a PlayStation 4 remaster in 2014. The latest version of the game is intended for the PlayStation 5 and would reportedly feature the gameplay and graphical improvements introduced in 2020’s &lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-09/sony-s-obsession-with-blockbusters-is-stirring-unrest-within-playstation-empire?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gKWoJT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports the remake’s status is part of a broader reorganization at Sony’s first-party development studios, which are struggling with the conflicting goals of the company’s desire for larger, blockbuster-scale projects from its major studios and the smaller, less lucrative passion projects from its smaller teams. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrqlRc"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Last of Us&lt;/em&gt; remake is one such project. The remake was originally started by Sony’s Visual Arts Service Group, an internal team that largely provided support work for art, animation, and development to Sony’s other studios on bigger projects like &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man &lt;/em&gt;or the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; games. But the Visual Arts Service Group aspired to work on its own games, and it figured that lower-cost remakes of popular Sony franchises would be a good place to start — &lt;a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonys-secret-san-diego-team-what-are-they-working-on.342760/"&gt;leading to rumors last year&lt;/a&gt; of a “secret” new Sony studio in San Diego. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zB6rL2"&gt;But Sony reportedly largely ignored those efforts. It tentatively approved the Visual Arts Service Group’s remake project but refused to give the team an expanded budget for the remake. The project was then moved back to series creator Naughty Dog, where it’s apparently still in development — with the Visual Arts Service Group assisting, as usual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpKaWg"&gt;It’s worth noting that all these projects are still apparently fairly early on, so there’s plenty of time for Sony’s plans here to change regarding if, when, or how these games actually are released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FsG16y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s report notes similar issues with Sony’s Bend Studio, the developer of &lt;em&gt;Days Gone. &lt;/em&gt;The Bend team reportedly tried to pitch a sequel to the open-world zombie game but was rejected — instead being tasked with helping Naughty Dog on a multiplayer project and a new &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; game. Bend’s leadership was apparently so concerned about being fully absorbed into Naughty Dog’s team that it asked to be removed from those projects; it’s now reportedly working on a new game of its own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wb49d1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One side effect of the COVID-19 vaccine could be a heavier period  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Feminine hygiene articles" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZqG6AOc1EM_9HV6Lu2h4_f6RopA=/0x4:4674x3120/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69101014/1229921264.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Annette Riedl/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GyvRpd"&gt;Katharine Lee got her COVID-19 vaccination early on in the United States’ rollout. So did a friend of hers — they got their shots on the same day. They compared notes, curious to see what the side effects would be. Lee, a research fellow in the Division of Public Health Sciences at Washington University in St. Louis, says that they both had one surprising symptom: they both started their period soon after they took the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vkBXJb"&gt;“It wasn’t a symptom that was on the list,” she says. “I expected that my arm would be sore, or that I might have a fever or a headache, but this just wasn’t on the list.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdGACl"&gt;Lee reached out to Kate Clancy, who studies the menstrual cycle at the University of Illinois, to share the observation. When Clancy got her vaccination, she also had an unusual period. So she posted on Twitter asking if other people did, too — and watched dozens of responses roll in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cIi9YN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A colleague told me she has heard from others that their periods were heavy post-vax. I'm curious whether other menstruators have noticed changes too? I'm a week and a half out from dose 1 of Moderna, got my period maybe a day or so early, and am gushing like I'm in my 20s again.&lt;/p&gt;— Dr. Kate Clancy  ️‍  (@KateClancy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KateClancy/status/1364671490772320259?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="79Rk7t"&gt;“It made us want to capture those experiences,” Lee says. So this week, the pair launched a &lt;a href="https://redcap.healthinstitute.illinois.edu/surveys/index.php?s=LL8TKKC8DP"&gt;formal study&lt;/a&gt; to collect data about the relationship between the COVID-19 vaccines and the menstrual cycle. It’s not a side effect that clinical trials checked for, and it’s not included on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s vaccine health check-in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RN8dhK"&gt;There isn’t much research on how vaccination affects menstruation. But vaccines do stress the immune system, and the menstrual cycle sometimes responds to those types of changes. “The menstrual cycle is really dynamic, and it responds to tons of things,” Lee says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jr2Vas"&gt;There’s also a potential relationship between the nanoparticles used in the COVID-19 vaccines and changes in bleeding patterns. In some people, the nanoparticles end up creating a temporary immune reaction that kills off platelets, a type of blood cell involved in clotting, Clancy says. They regenerate quickly, but if someone has a bleeding event like a period just after they get a shot, it could make it heavier. She’ll be collaborating with Anirban Sen Gupta, a platelet researcher at Case Western Reserve University, to try to understand that potential mechanism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NNHdSf"&gt;If it turns out that there is a relationship between the vaccines and the timing of a person’s menstrual cycle, that doesn’t mean there’s something wrong or dangerous about the vaccines themselves. It would most likely be a temporary side effect, and probably wouldn’t have effects on fertility, Lee stressed. It wouldn’t be that different from other side effects that crop up with the vaccines, like a fever or headache. But it’s important to have a full understanding of what kinds of reactions the vaccinations can cause so that people are as informed as possible about what they might experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e88Czo"&gt;“It really sucks to be surprised by your period,” Lee says. “It’s nice to know that it could happen, in the same way that it is knowing that you might have a fever and headache.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="H0pHJM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It really sucks to be surprised by your period”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tFe2eN"&gt;Similarly, unusually heavy periods are generally something people should be concerned about — they can be a sign that something is wrong, Clancy says. Knowing that it’s a possible effect of the vaccine could make the experience less concerning. On the other hand, if the research shows that there isn’t a strong link to vaccination, it may mean that people who do have this experience need to go to the doctor to make sure there isn’t something else wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x3lfVA"&gt;People are eager to share their stories on this survey, Clancy says. Within a day of launching the survey, there were already over 700 responses. They’re hoping to better understand how people’s periods are changing and the characteristics of people having those experiences — their age, gender, underlying health conditions, or other factors. They’re also tracking the timing. Clancy says she suspects that people who get the shot just before their period is supposed to start might be more likely to see heavy bleeding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7PGb7"&gt;Right now, Lee says they’re hoping the survey fills a knowledge gap around menstruation and the vaccines. People have discussed their experiences on social media, but it hasn’t appeared in any scientific literature. Lee says she isn’t surprised. It took until the ‘90s for women to be regularly included in clinical trials of any kind, and some of those lingering biases remain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLqG2h"&gt;“These are just not things some people think about. It’s not part of their daily lived experience. I think a lot of it is related to that history, and the bias around who gets to decide what’s important to consider as a side effect,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGwgrq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How an offshore wind boom in the US could boost ocean research </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Block Island Wind Farm" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ych5GHmlvw4vy2pCrDu9oPh_Tbo=/0x97:4596x3161/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69100880/695950446.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;LOCK ISLAND, RI - JUNE 13: The Block Island Wind Farm off the coast of Block Island, RI is pictured on Jun. 13, 2017. | Photo by David L. Ryan/The Boston Globe via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aQDagO"&gt;The US wants to use offshore wind farms to collect valuable data on climate change and ocean health. Renewable energy giant Ørsted recently signed a memorandum of agreement with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), agreeing to help the agency gather data in US waters leased to the company&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; NOAA &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/media-release/noaa-signs-data-share-agreement-with-offshore-wind-energy-company"&gt;says the agreement&lt;/a&gt; “paves the way for similar data-sharing agreements with other developers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJsezC"&gt;The Biden administration plans to dramatically &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/03/us-secretary-commerce-gina-m-raimondo-announces-efforts-advance"&gt;expand&lt;/a&gt; the country’s offshore wind capacity. The US currently only has 42 megawatts of capacity from two relatively small projects on the East Coast. If the Biden administration makes good on its commitment to offshore wind development, that’ll grow this decade to 30,000 megawatts coming from wind farms across both East and West coasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="odkD0p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Each new wind farm could also boost the agency’s ability to track the effects of climate change&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eR6fnu"&gt;That growth should help the US slash its greenhouse gas emissions and avert a deeper climate crisis. The new agreement puts forward a smaller but still significant benefit for research; each new wind farm could also boost the agency’s ability to track the effects of climate change that are already here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="isoduX"&gt;“Having more data sharing and more sampling from the wind developers is going to help us, wherever there are wind development projects, to understand that bigger picture,” says Carl Gouldman, director of the NOAA Integrated Ocean Observing System program office. Conducting research at sea gets costly, so partnerships like the one with Ørsted can help fill in gaps in NOAA’s ocean observations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrSfUR"&gt;The memorandum outlines broad areas of research with which Ørsted will help NOAA. Ørsted agreed to share data on air and water quality, marine life, meteorology, as well as coastal and ocean currents and waves. It will also collect data to better map the sea and study its physical properties. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yKmlBs"&gt;They haven’t hashed out many specifics yet, but one area Gouldman is excited about is weather data. Weather forecasting could get better, for example, thanks to LIDAR data Ørsted collects. LIDAR, or Light Detecting and Ranging, can map an environment by shooting out laser pulses. The technology &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055011/lidar-sensor-self-driving-mainstream-mass-market-velodyne-ces-2020"&gt;helps self-driving cars “see,”&lt;/a&gt; but in this case LIDAR is used to take a profile of wind speed in the atmosphere. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xVUpKj"&gt;“We’re thrilled to hear that they’re going to be willing to share that data,” Gouldman says. “A couple of years back we heard things like, ‘well, the companies won’t want to share that because it’s proprietary data that they’re going to want to hold for themselves.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8FVK2"&gt;Ørsted collects additional data using buoys and vessels that conduct surveys for future wind farm projects, a spokesperson for the company said in an email. It also has a glider that gathers oceanographic data used for storm forecasting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCeigc"&gt;The first wind farm in the US at &lt;a href="https://www.popsci.com/future-energy-is-blowing-in-wind/"&gt;Block Island&lt;/a&gt;, operated by Ørsted, is ideally located for studying the effects of climate change at sea and even onshore. It’s just 13 miles off the coast of Rhode Island, which is &lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/center-news/northeast-warming-faster-rest-us#:~:text=Rhode%20Island%20is%20heating%20up,for%20regional%2Dscale%20climate%20modeling."&gt;heating up more rapidly&lt;/a&gt; than much of the rest of the United States. Scientists are still trying to understand why the &lt;a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0168697#sec001"&gt;Northeast is the fastest warming region&lt;/a&gt; in the continental US. One culprit could be &lt;a href="https://www.usgs.gov/center-news/northeast-warming-faster-rest-us#:~:text=Rhode%20Island%20is%20heating%20up,for%20regional%2Dscale%20climate%20modeling."&gt;warmer water in the Atlantic ocean&lt;/a&gt;, which can raise temperatures inland.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="bBSfDB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Scientists are still trying to understand why the Northeast is the fastest warming region&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4hZzhd"&gt;After announcing plans last month to expand offshore wind development and data collection, Secretary of Commerce and former Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo said in a &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.gov/news/press-releases/2021/03/us-secretary-commerce-gina-m-raimondo-announces-efforts-advance"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, “These actions illustrate the Department’s commitment to innovative partnerships to advance the best science and data that will ensure the development of offshore wind is transparent and inclusive of all stakeholders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dh1sdQ"&gt;Separately from its agreement with Ørsted, NOAA is also &lt;a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/new-tool-available-explore-effects-offshore-wind-fisheries"&gt;studying the potential impact&lt;/a&gt; that offshore wind development could have on marine life. It’s using an &lt;a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/feature-story/scientists-collecting-data-commercial-fish-species-wind-energy-lease-areas-0"&gt;autonomous underwater glider&lt;/a&gt; to study Atlantic cod and other species found off the Southern New England coast, for example. The agency provides data and analyses to the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which issues leases to companies for offshore wind development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0hH97"&gt;NOAA also agreed to share some of its own data with Ørsted. It has 10 to 15 years of data on current velocities on the East Coast, which it says would help developers understand how ocean conditions might affect wind farm construction. Ironically, new wind farms might interfere with the high-frequency radar stations used to gather that data. So NOAA is looking into whether it can add sensors to wind turbine stations to bolster that effort, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iQ1ZcA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gq7vG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung tries to woo iPhone users with a browser-based Galaxy test drive</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w-tL5rT3tnAniP5hRb7OXfcVVG8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69100721/DSCF0384_result.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s iTest site on an iPhone 12 Pro.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jon Porter / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Y70C9m"&gt;Samsung has released &lt;a href="https://www.itest.nz/"&gt;a new website&lt;/a&gt; to give iPhone users “a little taste of Samsung” from their mobile browser. When visited on an iPhone, the site prompts users to add it to their phone’s home screen, after which it turns into a shortcut to a simulated Samsung Galaxy device. The site appears to be the work of Samsung New Zealand, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/04/08/samsung-itest-galaxy-device-iphone-experience/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pqyLej"&gt;The experience might be limited, but it’s a neatly designed bit of marketing. Open up the camera “app” and a video will automatically play featuring influencer Logan Dodds, who describes Samsung’s camera app features in the interface around him. Poke around the other “apps” in the home screen and Samsung happily markets its phone’s other features and accessories, while text messages and even a fake phone call outline others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8yqhwHjJNLmEPaYlw_596woOS5E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22431983/IMG_0574.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: iTest.nz&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A tooltip from the settings app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SoB9n6iGmuve8gHxjCxLgYflnkg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22431982/IMG_0573.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: iTest.nz&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There are fake contacts in the message app to text.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nCrW3d"&gt;There are also a couple of Easter eggs thrown in if you dig a little deeper. I particularly liked finding the “Friends with kids” contact in the text message app, who sends you garbled nonsense whenever you send them a message. Pry too much into the settings app and you’ll be shown a tooltip that reads, “We’ve simplified the settings menu experience, just so our developer could have a lunch break.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jgXzj"&gt;Samsung is targeting the experience squarely at iPhone users. Try to visit the site with another Android phone and you get a message that says, “You’re on Android already,” while if you try to visit using a desktop browser the site gives you a QR code to scan with your iPhone. Yes, it’s ultimately just a bit of marketing, but it’s more creative than most other smartphone ads out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRwl3z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U12vbn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I’m salivating over this new four-volume Philip K. Dick collection by the Folio Society</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IW-TE6zanU9vW-QmRFobZxA0Kuo=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69100273/maxresdefault.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eugdg6"&gt;The Folio Society has released a &lt;a href="https://www.foliosociety.com/uk/the-complete-short-stories.html"&gt;limited-edition, four-volume set&lt;/a&gt; of Philip K. Dick’s collected short stories and I am seriously considering selling my plasma to buy a copy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lg2Yux"&gt;Each volume is bound in fluorescent colors, with 2,560 pages of text containing some 118 stories. There are 24 illustrations by 24 different artists, and the set itself has a theme inspired by the symbols found on &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zener_cards"&gt;Zener cards&lt;/a&gt; — famously used throughout the 20th century to test for telepaths (mind-reading being a recurrent theme in Dick’s fiction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XPpBC"&gt;The collection is absolutely stunning, like so many special editions by The Folio Society, but has a hefty price-tag of £495 ($679). There are also only 750 copies available to buy and it looks like they’re selling out quick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EUBEEz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YfLlxcY4F6w?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C0Ggf8"&gt;Philip K. Dick is an undisputed titan of science fiction, and I’ve long been a particular fan of his short stories. Not just because they contain some of the genre’s most iconic tales but because they also offer a capsule history of Dick himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EqPMmR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Philip K. Dick’s short fiction tells the story of his career as a writer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8tirnG"&gt;He was famously prolific as a writer, and lived at a time when it was possible to earn a decent living pumping out quick fiction hits. He published four stories in 1952 and then accelerated to publish 30 in 1953. (His love of amphetamines also contributed to this prolific output.) A sense of writing as drudgery bleeds into Dick’s stories, which often feature resentful toilers, like the tire regroover in &lt;em&gt;Our Friends from Frolix 8&lt;/em&gt; who takes bald, worn-out tires and carves fresh grooves into them with a red hot iron.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZ02LR"&gt;Despite the grinding nature of the work, Dick’s fiction is endlessly imaginative. His short stories are still being retold today, and are particularly beloved by Hollywood. “We Can Remember it for You Wholesale” became 1990’s &lt;em&gt;Total Recall&lt;/em&gt;; the 1956 short “The Minority Report” was turned into the 2002 Tom Cruise blockbuster of the same name; while the  “Adjustment Team” became 2011’s &lt;em&gt;The Adjustment Bureau, &lt;/em&gt;and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FHZiaT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10437324"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="e9IDBA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4wD6TeIkBFg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vp8rrk"&gt;As we progress through Dick’s career into the ‘70s, and ‘80s his output slows. In 1974, Dick famously experienced a series of visions in which an entity that was perhaps God, but which he dubbed the Vast Active Living Intelligence System or VALIS, “fired a beam of pink light directly at him, at his head, his eyes.” His stories from this era, particularly his novels, consequently move away from standard sci-fi tropes into post-modern themes, delving into slipstreams of consciousness, alternate realities, and hidden, unbelievable truths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gz9obQ"&gt;Reading through Dick’s short fiction chronologically offers its own narrative: the story of this magnificent writer and thinker. The Folio Society’s new set looks like a fabulous accompaniment to this intellectual history. Now excuse me, I have some Googling to do about “infallible get rich quick schemes.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYi3nU"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung reportedly inks deal to buy OLED TV panels from rival LG Display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5U3314OuYNet2bMCJP9OA29F0z8=/120x0:1302x788/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69100165/LG_OLED_TV_Lineup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fApiIr"&gt;Samsung Electronics is close to ordering millions of OLED TV panels from LG Display, according to &lt;a href="https://m.mtn.co.kr/news/news_view.php?mmn_idx=2021040910490127790"&gt;new reports from &lt;em&gt;MTN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.etnews.com/20210409000074"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ETNews&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.sedaily.com/NewsVIew/22L0NM8RQV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Seoul Economic Daily&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Officials reportedly met recently to agree to the deal, which would see 1 million panels supplied to Samsung in the second half of this year, rising to 4 million panels next year. If the deal is finalized, it would be the first time Samsung has bought OLED panels from its South Korean rival and market leader. TVs with LG’s OLED panels consistently rate amongst the best in professional reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrJYhP"&gt;Samsung exited the OLED TV market &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-samsung-elec-tv/how-samsung-fell-behind-sony-and-lg-in-the-premium-tv-market-idUSKBN1I24K2"&gt;over half a decade ago&lt;/a&gt;. Today, LG Display supplies OLED panels to a variety of TV manufacturers including Sony, Vizio, and Hisense, as well as LG Electronics. Last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336883/lg-display-oled-panel-manufacturing-plant-tv-china-lcd"&gt;LG Display announced an expansion&lt;/a&gt; of its OLED production lines, and market research firm &lt;a href="https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20210409008400320?section=news"&gt;TrendForce says&lt;/a&gt; its production capacity is due to further increase in the second quarter of this year. &lt;em&gt;MTN&lt;/em&gt; reports that LG Display’s total OLED TV panel production capacity is around 8 million units this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZzVJ5P"&gt;Today’s reports are the latest indication of Samsung’s shift away from LCD panels, which it currently uses across its television lineup. Even its QLED TVs still use LCD panels behind that quantum dot layer. Last year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200859/samsung-display-ending-lcd-panel-production-quantum-dot-oled-south-korea-china-factories"&gt;Samsung Display announced&lt;/a&gt; it would stop producing LCD panels in the face of stiff price competition from Chinese competitors, however it &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/samsung-lcd-production-shut-down-postponed/"&gt;reportedly postponed this shutdown&lt;/a&gt; after the pandemic led to a rise in demand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3U4AX5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rising LCD prices are reportedly to blame&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wjw2Pd"&gt;While falling LCD panel prices were believed to be behind last year’s move, &lt;em&gt;MTN&lt;/em&gt; reports that the trend is reversing this year. LCD panels are reportedly growing more expensive, prompting Samsung to explore alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1DGm5p"&gt;While Samsung Electronics plans to buy panels from LG Display, its own display division is believed to be working on Quantum Dot OLED (QD-OLED) TV panels. A report from &lt;a href="http://www.thelec.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=2590"&gt;South Korean publication &lt;em&gt;The Elec&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this week says Samsung Display is currently working on a prototype TV using the technology, which will be sent to potential customers like Samsung Electronics after it’s produced in June. However, QD-OLED panel samples sent to Samsung Electronics in January was reportedly criticized for their low brightness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K3xetE"&gt;QD-OLED isn’t the only new display technology on Samsung’s horizon. It recently commercialized a new display type called Micro LED, which uses an array of tiny self-emissive LEDs to produce an image. Although Samsung has released the technology in a &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-microled-opens-a-new-era-of-breathtaking-picture-quality-and-design"&gt;series of ultra-high end TVs&lt;/a&gt;, it’s believed to be years away from being affordable enough for mass-market sets. There are &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/samsung-develops-method-for-self-emissive-qled/"&gt;also reports&lt;/a&gt; that the company is working on self-emissive quantum-dot TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLQLBN"&gt;When asked about the potential deal &lt;a href="http://it.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2021/04/09/2021040902225.html"&gt;in an interview&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung Electronics Jong-Hee Han, who oversees the company’s display division, dismissed the reports as rumors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpx1zE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKeBsb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airplane takes off a metric ton heavier than expected after computer error weighs adults as children</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Disturbance of air traffic by drones" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MRXa7kDnpmHpMe3GpFA8rq2KZzE=/74x0:3638x2376/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69099955/1231725546.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wh1FQZ"&gt;A flight from the UK to Spain took off with more than a metric ton of unexpected weight after a software error classified female passengers using the title “Miss” as children. This led to the flight’s load sheet estimating the weight of 38 female passengers as 38 kg or 77 pounds each, the standard weight for children, instead of 69 kg or 152 pounds, the standard weight used for female adults. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePt20H"&gt;The error was classified as a “&lt;a href="https://www.gov.uk/aaib-reports/aaib-investigation-to-boeing-737-8k5-g-tawg-21-july-2020"&gt;serious incident&lt;/a&gt;” by the UK’s Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) but did not affect the flight’s safety. Despite a discrepancy of 1,244 kg (2,743 pounds) between the expected and actual mass of the aircraft, the thrust used in takeoff by the pilot was only “marginally less” than what was required. “This meant the safe operation of the aircraft was not compromised,” concluded the AAIB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="knLFYD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This meant the safe operation of the aircraft was not compromised”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5A9bFR"&gt;The error was introduced to the software after the flight operator suspended operations for several months due to COVID-19 restrictions. During this time, it upgraded its IT systems, but in the country where the software was programmed, the honorific “Miss” is used for children while “Ms” is used for female adults. The error affected two more flights from the same operator that same day, July 21, 2020, before it was corrected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7ZxG3"&gt;According to a report by the &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/apr/09/tui-plane-serious-incident-every-miss-on-board-child-weight-birmingham-majorca?CMP=Share_iOSApp_Other"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Press Association&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the flight was operated by Anglo-German company Tui. In statement the company said: “The health and safety of our customers and crew is always our primary concern. Following this isolated incident, we corrected a fault identified in our IT system. As stated in the report, the safe operation of the flight was not compromised.”&lt;/p&gt;
