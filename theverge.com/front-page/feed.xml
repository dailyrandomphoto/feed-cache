    <title>Netflix is making a Redwall movie, and The Verge staff is very excited</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G7xpIg8_G8vI1_9nc392lzxSGyM=/223x0:978x503/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68814471/Et1wZBOVoAAcZxI.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KWC6NP"&gt;Earlier this week, Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276221/redwall-tv-show-netflix-announcement-film"&gt;dropped a surprise announcement&lt;/a&gt; that it’s adapting author Brian Jacques’ iconic &lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt; books into a new animated movie and TV franchise. Based on the 22-book children’s series that was published from 1986 through 2011, the books span generations of sword-fighting anthropomorphic mice, rabbits, badgers, and other woodland creatures living at the titular Redwall Abbey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dsns1l"&gt;While the show was previously made into a TV series back in the late ‘90s, it’s never been adapted with the scale (or presumably, the budget) of a Netflix feature film. Many of us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; are longtime fans of the series. Here’s how we’re taking the news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="FxYCni"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Netflix is turning iconic series Redwall into a TV show, film","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276221/redwall-tv-show-netflix-announcement-film"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="oaUxYH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were your initial thoughts on a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redwall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; adaptation? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nm9KDF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim Gartenberg&lt;/strong&gt;: I think my initial reaction was “OMG” followed by a lot of screaming from my internal seven-year-old. I grew up reading the &lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt; books. I remember the original being one of the first “real” books I ever read. And the entire series just has this shining, golden spot in my memory. They’re wholesome, lovely books full of daring adventures, clever puzzles, and where good always triumphs over evil. What’s not to like?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvcWfa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jay Peters&lt;/strong&gt;: I was elated when I first saw the news of the &lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt; remaster. I was a devoted fan of the books for years as a kid, devouring each new entry in the series as soon as I could. But if I’m being honest, I couldn’t tell you a single plot point from any of the books right now. Hopefully, that doesn’t matter for the new series; as long as it features adorable forest creatures in epic battles and enjoying decadent feasts, I’ll be happy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3FPU3I"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adi Robertson&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m partly in the same boat: I read the books religiously, but I remember very little about their actual plots. They really hit the part of my brain that loved dollhouses and other miniature things. Unlike Jay and Chaim, though, I remember enjoying that they could be kind of bloody and creepy — we’re not talking &lt;em&gt;Watership Down&lt;/em&gt; or anything, but I remember a lot of eerie fortresses and mad kings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cY7fnA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitchell Clark&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, I have to agree. While I remember books like &lt;em&gt;Triss&lt;/em&gt; being light-hearted adventures, I know there were some pretty dark ones like &lt;em&gt;Marlfox &lt;/em&gt;and parts of &lt;em&gt;Salamandastron — &lt;/em&gt;assassins, bloodlust, the whole nine yards. As an adult, and given Netflix’s reputation, I’ve wondered if they’ll get into the darker parts, but I’m honestly kind of hoping they keep it aimed more at kids, and that it’ll inspire some of those kids to pick up the book series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgGR92"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What makes &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redwall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; a good choice for a TV show?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="palvmX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jay&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s lots of swashbuckling action and heroic tales, which consistently makes for pretty good TV. I’m sure many of the characters will be fuzzy and adorable, making the show even more watchable. And Netflix has a lot of source material to pull from, given there are approximately 1,000 books in the series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmSnn1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: So many books. But part of the brilliance is that they’re all (for the most part) fairly standalone, so adapting each one could be its own project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tptBA5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitchell&lt;/strong&gt;: Fantasy has been very &lt;em&gt;in&lt;/em&gt; lately, but it’s usually not aimed at kids. It’s a good series that has a lot of elements that really let your imagination run wild, and I think that’ll be very fun. It could also lend itself to a really neat art style. There’s always a lot of talk of tapestries and paintings in the books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KdM8Rs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What parts or books in the series are you most looking forward to seeing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mFWYRD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russell Brandom&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s been a good 20 years since I read these books, but two scenes stand out. First, the outright terror of Matthias standing off against Asmodeus in the first &lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt; hooked me like nothing else. The snake hypnotism is a great use of the central animal-fantasy conceit, and the fact that Asmodeus isn’t the primary villain makes the encounter that much more unsettling. The second — spoilers for &lt;em&gt;Mossflower&lt;/em&gt;, I guess? — is Tsarmina in the sinking castle at the end of the second book, a legitimately haunting image if you have any fear of drowning, which I definitely did at the time. (Cats hate water! So true.) I’ll have to wait for the Martin the Warrior prequel series to see that one on-screen, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCFoG2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim: &lt;/strong&gt;I’m kind of hoping for some good, fuzzy, &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;-style battles. Show us some Badger Lords, please. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z87eAH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Any concerns about making a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redwall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; show?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5k6FSe"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitchell&lt;/strong&gt;: There’s just so much lore, backstory, and regular stories told over the series that I hope Netflix and the show’s creators have come up with a specific story they want to tell within the universe. I’m not sure I want to see them try to tackle the whole thing. I’d rather be left wanting more than overstuffed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LefjFy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: It’s a good point, but it seems like they’re starting (relatively) small: a movie based on the first book, and a TV series focused on Martin the Warrior, which makes sense to me. Martin’s story is a broader one, spread across a number of books, while the first book is relatively self-contained. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gm0PVK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adi&lt;/strong&gt;: I remember the books relying a lot on Tolkien-style species-based morality, and that’s objectively weird, and I’m not sure how the show will deal with it! I was going to soften this by saying that I remember some good foxes or something, but the &lt;a href="https://redwall.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Foxes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt; Wiki informs me&lt;/a&gt; that foxes are “without exception villainous vermin,” so I guess that settles that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lD5y8C"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russell:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m going to throw in a practical concern here. Part of the fun of the books is imagining this wide range of animals interacting both as friends and enemies, with rabbits, badgers, mice, crows, and various obscure mustelids interacting more or less as equals. But if you have to draw canonical versions of these characters, the size differential becomes a problem. Mice are just much, much smaller than crows, cats, weasels, rats, and most of the other common &lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt; antagonists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmdmrw"&gt;Sword or no, even the bravest mouse cannot realistically take down an animal more than 10 times its size, so choreographing the fight scenes is going to be a serious problem if we stay even slightly close to natural proportions. But at the same time, an undeniable draw of the series is picturing mice holding swords in their little mouse hands, which becomes less fun if you stray too far from the sort-of photorealistic animals depicted on &lt;a href="https://redwall.fandom.com/wiki/Book_Cover_Gallery?file=Redwall10.jpg"&gt;the classic book covers&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a real bind!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13SCsq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;CGI? Hand-drawn animation? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lion King&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;-esque faux live action? How would you want to see a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Redwall&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; show realized? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5XZcT9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitchell&lt;/strong&gt;: I hate to be boring, but it’s gotta be hand-drawn. I think that’ll work best for the fantasy setting, and while I don’t need it to have the same art style as &lt;em&gt;Over The Garden Wall&lt;/em&gt;, I’d like the vibe to be similar, if that makes sense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fFSigh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chaim&lt;/strong&gt;: Anything but “realistic” CGI, please. These books are... pretty violent, which I’m worried would translate &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; badly to a realistic style. No one needs to see a mouse murder a bunch of rats with a sword in faux-live-action, especially not the family-friendly target audience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYdUuB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jay&lt;/strong&gt;: I want hand-drawn, but I expect CGI. Netflix, if it’s not too late: please, make the show hand-drawn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nPzNxw"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Russell&lt;/strong&gt;: Given the surreal nature of the setup, I think they could also get away with computer-assisted 2D animation, along the lines of &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2020/9/15/21438560/wolfwalkers-review-apple-tv-plus"&gt;what Cartoon Saloon does&lt;/a&gt;. But definitely not 3D and definitely not photo-realistic. Nobody wants to see another &lt;em&gt;Lion King&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AHb6x"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some Deeper’n’Ever Turnip’n’Tater’n’Beetroot Pie or some strawberry cordial? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3XVd3Z"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitchell&lt;/strong&gt;: While I don’t love beetroots, strawberries are extremely out of season right now, so rustle up what roots you can from the cellar, aye chap? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYhAaS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adi&lt;/strong&gt;: Anything except clotted cream, because A) the large amount of dairy-based food in &lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt; has always raised questions to me about where exactly the milk is coming from in a series about humanoid animals (I vaguely remember “aphid milk” being an answer at one point?), and B) I still don’t really know what it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEqLkt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jay&lt;/strong&gt;: Honestly, I’d try any of it. If the show is successful, maybe Netflix can make a &lt;em&gt;Redwall-&lt;/em&gt;themed cooking show spinoff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GnPVoZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adi&lt;/strong&gt;: Either way, &lt;em&gt;Redwall&lt;/em&gt; Feast TikTok is gonna be great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJxBUs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vaccine rollout won’t be equitable unless health care reckons with racism</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="New York’s Northwell Health Hospital Administers Covid Vaccines" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q69SeKk9ph-Wb36Gefz5dLnT3bw=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68814338/1230124989.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ki8dEm"&gt;The pandemic has been anything but “the great equalizer” that some people called it when it started more than a year ago. Here in the US, COVID-19 has sickened and killed a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/covid-data/investigations-discovery/hospitalization-death-by-race-ethnicity.html"&gt;disproportionate&lt;/a&gt; number of Black, Native American, and Latinx people. Vaccine rollout is &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/02/health/white-people-covid-vaccines-minorities.html"&gt;proving to be inequitable&lt;/a&gt;, too. Black and Latinx elders in Los Angeles, for example, have been &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-02-08/l-a-latinos-black-seniors-fall-behind-in-covid-19-vaccine-access-compared-to-whites"&gt;vaccinated at a lower rate&lt;/a&gt; than their white and Asian American counterparts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBz4bn"&gt;Distrust in vaccines has been a challenge across the board. But Black Americans were less inclined than other racial and ethnic groups to want to get vaccinated, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/science/2020/12/03/intent-to-get-a-covid-19-vaccine-rises-to-60-as-confidence-in-research-and-development-process-increases/"&gt;Pew Research Center&lt;/a&gt; survey from December. To fix a system that isn’t fully serving Black Americans and other people of color, “There really needs to be some healing,” says &lt;a href="https://www.unlv.edu/people/melva-thompson-robinson"&gt;Melva Thompson-Robinson&lt;/a&gt;, executive director of the Center for Health Disparities Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGPGdj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with Thompson-Robinson about the roots of that distrust and how to heal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqMr9l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IoC5e6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does distrust for vaccines in communities of color differ from white celebrities or conspiracy theorists who are anti-vaxxers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKtm9e"&gt;It’s not just a simple matter of, “Oh, I don’t believe that something works because this is what I heard.” This is about that deep-rooted, historical trauma that has been carried down through generations. That distrust comes out of the racism that they experience. When you’re talking about African Americans, in particular, you’re talking about a group of people who are descendants of slaves. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="F7EuPE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XPw1uH"&gt;And so it’s a different kind of thing. It’s not “I believe that these vaccines aren’t effective because I heard that’s what somebody said.” This is “I’m not trusting because of the experience that my family has had under slavery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TeZ3Bb"&gt;A big thing now is people are looking at who’s in charge. Who’s running the vaccine trials? Who’s participating in the trials? They say, “Well, I don’t see people who look like me.” Or “I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; see people who look like me.” And all of that is huge. We need to see people who look like us who are involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TcOU8G"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are some of those historical traumas that have led to distrust of vaccines among some people of color?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORkLlS"&gt;When you start to talk particularly about slaves, one of the men who is credited as being the founder of gynecology actually did &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/02/07/513764158/remembering-anarcha-lucy-and-betsey-the-mothers-of-modern-gynecology"&gt;surgery on Black women&lt;/a&gt; because they were considered property. He was doing gynecological surgery with no anesthesia because part of the thought was “Well, they don’t experience pain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NyA1iy"&gt;That’s not true. All people experience pain. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEK7oI"&gt;You can jump the &lt;a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/oss/article/history/40-years-human-experimentation-america-tuskegee-study"&gt;Tuskegee syphilis study&lt;/a&gt;. You could also even look at the story of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/nih-family-of-henrietta-lacks-reach-deal-on-access-to-dna-code/2013/08/07/68f3da04-ff8b-11e2-96a8-d3b921c0924a_story.html"&gt;Henrietta Lacks&lt;/a&gt;, who had cervical cancer. And they harvested her cells at Johns Hopkins and still to this day still use her cells for research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dvVTH4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That’s not true. All people experience pain.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CoYyp3"&gt;So people are saying, “Well, you need to trust the health care system.” But health care systems, health care facilities, and health care providers need to act in a trustful manner. You can’t just expect people to say, “Oh yeah, I’ll now trust you” after centuries of mistrust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QPBCB4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do we see inequities playing out today when it comes to vaccine rollout in the US? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4RizTg"&gt;The challenge has been with some of the vaccines that you have to have very specialized storage capabilities, which then has limited where some of these can be distributed. Communities of color don’t always have access to those storage facilities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ux9e95"&gt;For people working in grocery stores or other retail and food outlets, it’s not as simple for them to take time off to go to an appointment. If they don’t have sick leave or they have a limited amount of leave, they can’t go and stand in line for hours at a time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2zqOeQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You can’t just expect people to say, ‘Oh yeah, I’ll now trust you’ after centuries of mistrust.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IYckqS"&gt;Another challenge is the messaging that’s going out to people. You already know that you have populations that are concerned about getting the vaccine. So the messaging for that population needs to be different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMpzF9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s no “one size fits all” prescription for how to reach out to different communities of color. But what should solutions or outreach strategies look like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSxusx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://thenevadaindependent.com/article/sisolak-establishes-new-equity-initiative-as-working-class-communities-hit-hard-by-covid-19-slow-to-receive-vaccine"&gt;Here in Clark County&lt;/a&gt; where Las Vegas is located, the governor just came out last week with an equity initiative. Because if you look at the data, where the cases are versus where people are who are getting the vaccine — it’s two different places within the same city. It’s not the same group of people. We’re seeing this inequitable distribution of resources. We’re in this perfect storm, and in order to survive it, I think there has to be some relinquishing of power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jQYB9b"&gt;There really needs to be some healing and some stepping back. Not rushing, but stepping back and saying: “You know what, we hear what you’re saying. We understand where we’ve done wrong, and we want to do better.”&lt;/p&gt;

In Connecticut, there’s a 65 percent difference in vaccination rates between the wealthiest and poorest communities. (Olivia Goldhill / &lt;em&gt;STAT&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="P6OrbG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perspectives: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

    <title>Minneapolis prohibits use of facial recognition software by its police department</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sC42K8mphTgM4URpVh5EdfjtNJU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68814291/acastro_180730_1777_facial_recognition_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="njnJsy"&gt;The Minneapolis City Council voted unanimously on Friday to approve an ordinance banning the use of facial recognition software by its police department and other city agencies, the &lt;a href="https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-passes-restrictive-ban-on-facial-recognition-use-by-police-others/600022551/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Tribune&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The ban adds Minneapolis to the list of US cities moving to limit or end the use of such technology by its law enforcement officers and city employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qw7dC6"&gt;But Minneapolis police chief Medaria Arradondo said in a statement that the ban was created without feedback from him, and that he believes it’s possible for facial recognition technology to be “utilized in accordance with data privacy and other citizen legal protections,” according to the &lt;em&gt;Star Tribune&lt;/em&gt;. Facial recognition software &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21031255/facial-recognition-algorithm-bias-gender-race-age-federal-nest-investigation-analysis-amazon"&gt;has been found&lt;/a&gt; to have age, race, and ethnic biases, and privacy advocates have raised concerns about its use by law enforcement. Minneapolis’ ordinance created an appeals process allowing city agencies to request exemptions under some circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5XVQH"&gt;Minneapolis was the site of huge public protests last summer after one of its &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/officers-involved-deadly-arrest-black-man-minneapolis-have-been-fired-n1215046"&gt;police officers killed George Floyd&lt;/a&gt; during an arrest in May. The city council &lt;a href="https://minnesota.cbslocal.com/2020/06/26/minneapolis-city-council-takes-another-step-toward-dismantling-police-department/"&gt;voted to disband its police department&lt;/a&gt; last June, but ended up &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/us/minneapolis-police-funding.html"&gt;reducing the department’s 2021 budget&lt;/a&gt; by less than 5 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7WQF8a"&gt;Software made by Clearview AI —the controversial firm that has a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/technology/clearview-privacy-facial-recognition.html?searchResultPosition=1"&gt;database of some 3 billion images&lt;/a&gt; scraped from social media and other websites— would be included under Minneapolis’ facial recognition ban. &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/carolinehaskins1/george-floyd-protests-surveillance-technology"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last year that Minneapolis was one of the police departments that had access to Clearview’s software. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/14/21368930/clearview-ai-ice-contract-privacy-immigration"&gt;Clearview also has contracts&lt;/a&gt; with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0w4qUu"&gt;Other cities have also implemented bans on facial recognition software, with Portland blocking both public and private use of the technology. &lt;a href="https://www.wbur.org/news/2020/06/23/boston-facial-recognition-ban"&gt;Boston&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/14/18623013/san-francisco-facial-recognition-ban-vote-city-agencies"&gt;San Francisco&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Oakland-bans-use-of-facial-recognition-14101253.php"&gt;and Oakland&lt;/a&gt; have also passed laws prohibiting public institutions from using facial recognition, but Portland was the first to prohibit private use. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A few of the best deals for the holiday weekend</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DgHOMvPC4l4HqCezWv46RgbNwc0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68814046/akrales_190716_3546_0060.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s The Verge’s Chris Welch wearing Bose’s Noise Canceling Headphones 700&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Uz30AX"&gt;You wouldn’t know it from looking at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s deals coverage this week, but we’ve been getting &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; many pitches for deals that are on because of Valentine’s Day on Sunday, February 14th, and Presidents’ Day, which is happening the following day in the US. We haven’t featured any of them because, truthfully, better deals have popped up. But below, you’ll find a mix of the holiday-themed deals you actually need to know about, along with some favorite discounts of the week that are still happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8ng4jF"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6oiPeLI9h3CU5VY0iEucQh5AOKE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/18314842/akrales_190716_3546_0185.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="J2V0HV"&gt;Bose’s refurbished headphones are $150 off until today at 10:55AM ET&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsO9y5"&gt;At eBay, you can save 20 percent on refurbished tech by using the code &lt;strong&gt;PREZDAY20 &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout. I invite you to try it out on anything that strikes your fancy, but I think one of the best ways to utilize the one-time-use coupon is on Bose’s refurbished Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, its latest (and greatest) set of over-ear noise-canceling cans. These usually cost $379 new, but they’re $224 before tax with the offer code applied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBXgHL"&gt;Seeing “refurbished” might spook some people, and I get it. But you shouldn’t worry as much with these. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FBose-Noise-Cancelling-Headphones-700-Certified-Refurbished%2F153863412679&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F2%2F13%2F22278064%2Fpresidents-day-headphones-tech-sale-bose-beats-flex-earbuds-oneplus-8#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;On the page&lt;/a&gt;, it says that each set of headphones is in “pristine, like-new condition” and that it’ll be “in new packaging with original and new accessories.” Also, if you live in the US, eBay automatically tacks on a two-year warranty through Allstate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nv5yaU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9586877"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="xsg9Vm"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Apple’s new Beats Flex earbuds, pictured in yellow." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xTmRbKZGtzUUNb7kIN3CIlmRsnM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21971885/BF904AC7_A371_4D8E_B0A9_0CA38299CBD9.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KOuw1O"&gt;Beats Flex neckbuds with USB-C charging start at just $40&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="p7JCmx"&gt;If those Bose headphones are a little too pricey, the Beats Flex wireless neckbuds are $40 at Amazon in either the black or neon green colorway. They’re normally $50, so it’s not a huge price cut, though it amounts to a 20-percent discount. These are the first Beats that are just as easy to recommend for people using Android phones as they are for iPhone users. That’s because they charge via USB-C, and they also have a companion app on Android. On iPhone, they can easily and quickly pair with their Apple W1 wireless chip, letting them also switch between compatible Apple devices that have previously been paired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oxTM4t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591203"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="b0udGT"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/czJXSyl16KZGyyLDmJE-iunqvSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19895598/vpavic_042008_3967_0089.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F9WegQ"&gt;Get the OnePlus 8, then save 50 percent on a second phone&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="D0MT1l"&gt;OnePlus is hosting a Presidents’ Day deal that lets you save when you buy two OnePlus 8 phones, which is helpful if you’re buying for a family. The glacial green-colored phone costs $599, and if you add a second one to your cart, you’ll automatically get 50 percent off it, totaling $898 for both. This deal will go on until Wednesday, February 17th, or until supplies last.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You shouldn’t have to publicly humiliate AT&amp;T to get usable internet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JeEMhyv_WMG2_-j9LCMo_8vvg9k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68813093/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gEybzN"&gt;Earlier this month, Aaron Epstein spent $10,000 to buy an ad in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; to tell AT&amp;amp;T’s CEO he wasn’t happy with his internet service — service that was limited to a paltry 3Mbps (&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/02/att-customer-since-1960-buys-wsj-print-ad-to-complain-of-slow-speeds/?comments=1"&gt;v&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/02/att-customer-since-1960-buys-wsj-print-ad-to-complain-of-slow-speeds/"&gt;ia &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/a&gt;. Now, AT&amp;amp;T &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/90-year-old-gets-att-300mbps-fiber-a-week-after-complaining-in-wsj-print-ad"&gt;has him hooked up with a fiber connection&lt;/a&gt;, and he’s getting over 300 Mbps up and down. All it took was getting interviewed by &lt;em&gt;Ars&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/raju/status/1356958555824414721"&gt;the ad going viral on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/6eDIFJvW0gQ?list=PLiZxWe0ejyv92RSYPiA1AcKYiOZtRVABO&amp;amp;t=141"&gt;a Stephen Colbert mention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5YxIuY"&gt;In his ad, the North Hollywood, CA resident says he’s been an AT&amp;amp;T customer for 60 years (and backs it up with a @pacbell.net email address), and says he’s disappointed that the company isn’t keeping up with competitors when it comes to his area’s internet. Less than two weeks later, AT&amp;amp;T techs had him hooked up, though the company says it was part of a planned rollout. That’s a statement that may belong in the “dubious” category. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wjx43c"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I mean how upset one must be, over slow home internet speeds, to pay for a personal quarter-page national ad in print &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WSJ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@WSJ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Zk9umKD0t1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Zk9umKD0t1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Raju Narisetti (@raju) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/raju/status/1356958555824414721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xGdDlo"&gt;It’s certainly good for Epstein that his ad worked, especially given how much it cost. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/3/21117306/iowa-caucus-rural-broadband-access-election-campaign-sanders-warren"&gt;it’s  been estimated that there are millions of Americans&lt;/a&gt; who don’t have access to any access to home internet at all, let alone broadband (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242635/fcc-ajit-pai-internet-speed-advanced-telecommunications-3mbps"&gt;which itself is arguably not fast enough&lt;/a&gt;), and they can’t all afford ads in the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. Besides, that certainly seems like a trick that would only work once, especially given that it may only work for one household at a time — &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/02/90-year-old-gets-att-300mbps-fiber-a-week-after-complaining-in-wsj-print-ad"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica &lt;/em&gt;wasn’t able to get a straight answer&lt;/a&gt; about whether Epstein’s neighbors would be getting faster service anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfjw9o"&gt;Yes, this is a success story: Epstein was able to get AT&amp;amp;T, a goliath telecom company, to install fiber to his house. He even got a call from AT&amp;amp;T CEO John Stankey himself. But even those of us who do have decent internet are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22264430/comcast-data-cap-rollout-delayed-twelve-us-states-isp-bills"&gt;struggling with data caps&lt;/a&gt;, ISPs that don’t really compete, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;don’t even seem to have a clear picture of what their own networks are capable of&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nXaLYn"&gt;If anything, this story highlights how little power the public has when it comes to their internet access — if you need to have $10,000 to publicly humiliate your ISP, we’re doing something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="I8ERjl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"In 2021, we need to fix America’s internet","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>PSA: eBay might not let you sell items without a bank account starting Valentine’s Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="eBay new logo STOCK" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f5rPr94Ej4MgjhutHv1R1aVz-ws=/0x1:1020x681/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68813065/ebay-logo-stock_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YNgOlx"&gt;In 2002, eBay bought PayPal for $1.5 billion, turning it into &lt;em&gt;the &lt;/em&gt;way you’d buy and get paid for items you sell on the ginormous auction site. But the once-happy couple has been breaking up for years — and on Valentine’s Day, some sellers may no longer be able to sell items on eBay &lt;em&gt;at all&lt;/em&gt; without connecting an old-school bank account instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAAj0E"&gt;This morning, I received a final warning that I would need to add a bank account by February 14th or else “your ability to revise or relist existing listings, or create new listings will be disabled.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LmHATrQVjQjsvexgK27_hhFOQQQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22301302/ebay_warning.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MwsVpP"&gt;eBay tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; this isn’t the deadline for every seller — it’s rolling out in phases, and a quick scan of the web shows it’s been going on for at least a couple years. This isn’t the final phase either, as eBay tells us the rollout won’t be complete until 2022. But I suspect it’s moving fast: I got this message despite rarely ever selling items on eBay, and company tells me the “majority of sellers” will have eBay-managed payments by the end of this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EHaWCF"&gt;Digging up a bank account and plugging it into your profile may not be the only annoyance here, by the way. You could be waiting a lot longer for your money, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.ebay.com%2Fseller-center%2Fservice-and-payments%2Fmanaged-payments-on-ebay.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F12%2F22281056%2Febay-bank-account-required-not-paypal-february-14th#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as eBay’s managed payments site&lt;/a&gt; points out:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4_bpRgbRiihf5EQP-CkfZ653buk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22301328/managed_payments.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mIB6ZI"&gt;Three to six business days is a long time to theoretically wait for money that could have instantly popped into your PayPal. (That said, my last eBay sale didn’t immediately release my funds to PayPal, either. Shrug emoji.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwvVpg"&gt;On the plus side, eBay says most sellers should actually pay lower fees than before, and provides a variety of case studies &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpages.ebay.com%2Fseller-center%2Fservice-and-payments%2Fsimpler-fees.html%23m22_tb_a1__1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F12%2F22281056%2Febay-bank-account-required-not-paypal-february-14th#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;at this page&lt;/a&gt; — but it’s not like eBay’s really passing along the savings. Previously, eBay would typically take a 10 percent cut and PayPal would take a 2.9 percent cut for a total of 12.9 percent of your take; now, eBay will take a 12.35 percent cut in the same situations.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ROg8wya_rxaTISrKK9vnGWk9bnE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22301344/ebay_fees_change.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="48VYny"&gt;While eBay’s graphic (above) might look like you’re saving a big chunk of money when you axe the middleman, you can see (if you look carefully) that the sizes of these bars are misleading. The new middleman is eBay. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Edge extensions store hosted illicit copies of Sonic and Mario Kart 64</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JhNmDBq_Dq26uty49fszJODkG_0=/0x4:527x355/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68812989/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_4.54.10_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An image from the Mario Kart 64 listing on the Edge extensions store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3vc7tZ"&gt;Microsoft’s Edge extensions store was hosting likely illegal copies of a number of iconic games, including &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/mario-kart-64-n64-simul/abfdnoiheolhpbdcehdnhecgclaaekie"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 64&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/super-mario-bros-game/nmkdnipcejjcbliglpibnffkgpjjpjld"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/sonic-the-hedgehog-game/dibhlaandmahmcgndlebpobpcchcjilp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/original-pacman-game/mahclhjcbhohmmkcobhoglipcajcnfcp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/tetris-game/iefpnmfngbceeldlcfmkancbginibhno"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tetris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/cut-the-rope/bcnmodafbghancmdkbbbijkkdoejjfno"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cut The Rope&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and even Microsoft’s own smash hit &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/minecraft-game-online/cdeankbhhhghfpmlhbebphangglimeog"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The developers listed on the titles aren’t Microsoft, Nintendo, or any other recognizable game developer, meaning that they almost certainly aren’t official copies of the games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdYSYR"&gt;In the hours since we published this story, every one we initially linked has been pulled down, but others still exist for now, like &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/sonic/nflchbbjkneglfanbofhlbdekbhndoko"&gt;this Sonic game&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://microsoftedge.microsoft.com/addons/detail/super-mario-bros-game/akoiiggjcphhkjaogelehljleeofpnjp"&gt;this Mario game&lt;/a&gt;, a couple of Pac-Man games, and a variety of copies of &lt;em&gt;2048, Flappy Bird, Fruit Ninja, Temple Run &lt;/em&gt;and others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v13RhF"&gt;Initially, we saw 35 listings across 10 different “developers” with names like “GamePro Inc,” “Gamelands,” “StayReal” and “Kday,” including a number of duplicate games. Many listings, even from different developers, had very similar descriptions, indicating that they could be coming from the same source. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eYBf7G"&gt;Here are screenshots of just a few of the games we found:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qn5xfB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10340835"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AcuZn8"&gt;Oddly, Microsoft&lt;em&gt; itself&lt;/em&gt; appeared to promote the browser extensions in what looks to be a now-deleted tweet from the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/msedgedev"&gt;@MSEdgeDev account&lt;/a&gt;, which we saw &lt;a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-promotes-that-you-can-pirate-games-through-their-browser-for-some-reason.377748/"&gt;via ResetEra&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S-LZ4a2KfrNhJS1fp6k1VwAm8uc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22301271/nm5i6DK.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-promotes-that-you-can-pirate-games-through-their-browser-for-some-reason.377748/#post-58490358" target="_blank"&gt;KoolAid on ResetEra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="07oFte"&gt;We didn’t see this purported tweet ourselves, and it isn’t currently on the @MSEdgeDev account right now. But one brave soul on Twitter, Jordan Chase, said he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/olynative/status/1360343707845726208"&gt;installed the &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 64&lt;/em&gt; extension&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter — and he said that in a reply to a now-deleted tweet from @MSEdgeDev. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJxmK8"&gt;In his tweet, Chase said the Mario Kart 64 extension downloads a ROM of the game. While emulators are generally legal, and some sites (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/19/17138752/internet-archive-handheld-history-collection-game-emulator-mame"&gt;like Internet Archive&lt;/a&gt;) host abandonware you can play in a browser, it’s extremely unlikely that Nintendo, which is well-known for cracking down on sites hosting ROMs and pirated content, would let people download copies of its most-loved games over free browser extensions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uZEr8T"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Mario Kart 64 extension downloads a ROM of the N64 game.   &lt;a href="https://t.co/BY9VDMqp3B"&gt;pic.twitter.com/BY9VDMqp3B&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jordan Chase (@olynative) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/olynative/status/1360343707845726208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7KxQOx"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Tetris&lt;/em&gt; extension also appears to be a clone of the famous puzzle game, though it didn’t download a ROM, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/olynative/status/1360343707845726208"&gt;according to Chase&lt;/a&gt;. He &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/olynative/status/1360345226733182976"&gt;also said&lt;/a&gt; he installed the &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man&lt;/em&gt; extension, and it “seems like it’s using direct assets from the original game.” I didn’t install the games myself in case they were doing something nefarious, and I’d recommend against putting them on your machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0OpWS"&gt;Some of the games we found have reviews dating back to October, indicating they have been sitting unnoticed in Microsoft’s catalog for quite some time. It’s unclear why they have been available for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6sKOW"&gt;Many listings attempt to skirt trouble with dubious disclaimers acknowledging the listings aren’t affiliated with the original games. Here’s one for the listing for &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 64, &lt;/em&gt;for example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hi6Qwz"&gt;IMPORTANT: This emulator is not affiliated with nor endorsed by Nintendo. All graphics, games, and other multimedia are copyrighted to their respective owners and authors. This game is for ALL Mario fans!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="tuyAcP"&gt;Microsoft and Nintendo tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; they are looking into the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ZSN5C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 13th, 1:39AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that some of the games have now been removed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gjr7pR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 13th, 2:52AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that most of the biggest names have been removed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2 leaks out with ‘3D motion detection’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iPAwm4_p9z6eVGOoAHDQ9G08JCA=/4x0:784x520/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68812594/ring_video_doorbell_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gngwcs"&gt;Amazon’s Ring has so many different video doorbells in the market it’s getting hard to keep track, but one of them is apparently about to get a big bump with some brand-new features: The Ring Wi-Fi Video Doorbell Pro 2 has just leaked &lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:_ynSlpvK_2EJ:https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/ring-wi-fi-video-doorbell-pro-2-satin-nickel/15299144+&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=us"&gt;in a listing at Best Buy Canada&lt;/a&gt;, as spotted by &lt;a href="https://zatznotfunny.com/2021-02/ring-pro-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ZatzNotFunny&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUvoQa"&gt;It appears to be a direct successor to the high-end Ring Video Doorbell Pro at the same CA$325 (roughly $250 US dollars), but also the first Ring to stream video resolution at higher than 1080p, with a 1536p “expanded Head to Toe view” that “allows you to clearly see who is at your door.” That means Amazon’s catching up to the field-of-view and resolution &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/17/20918750/arlo-video-doorbell-price-date"&gt;that Arlo’s Video Doorbell introduced in late 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wF1YwI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10340730"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yEQuWU"&gt;As a Ring Video Doorbell Pro owner myself, that would have been a desirable feature: I had to angle my doorbell down with two different add-on brackets so I could actually see packages being delivered to my front porch. But I’m more intrigued by the mention of “3D motion detection,” which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227528/arlo-touchless-video-doorbell"&gt;sounds like something a touchless doorbell&lt;/a&gt; could use to tell when someone’s standing right in front of it — and maybe cut down on false positives buzzing my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAhk7z"&gt;Here’s the rest of Best Buy’s product description:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MtTHCs7PjLveAeIgw6MQUXg4hqw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22301142/ring_video_doorbell_pro_2_3.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jodl99"&gt;You’ll also notice it comes with Alexa greetings — something Ring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22279020/alexa-ring-doorbell-greeting-quick-replies"&gt;brought to the original Video Doorbell Pro just the other day&lt;/a&gt;. Note that unlike most other Ring doorbells, the Pro models typically don’t have swappable batteries as an option; you have to wire them up to a powerful doorbell transformer, which you may or may not already have in your home. In January, Ring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252181/ring-video-doorbell-new-wired-size-features-price"&gt;also added a $60 wired model&lt;/a&gt;, its least expensive yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kz39U3"&gt;The Best Buy page suggests it might be available March 31st, though you should always take release dates on early product pages with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWvNgD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If Whoopi Goldberg tells you to wear a mask on the subway, you wear it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-HEALTH-VIRUS-COMMUTERS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jnk3v9yKEf_E2LcGeNus7SRMcjM=/54x0:3969x2610/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68812486/1229473130.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Daniel Slim / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cpk9YC"&gt;You might not have to ride public transit to work right now, but if you’re one of the many workers who still commutes in New York City (or if you’re someone like me who fantasizes about their old commute), you’ll now have some new celebrity voice talent to keep you company on your bus or subway ride, &lt;a href="https://www.mta.info/press-release/nyc-transit/mta-teams-newyorknico-bring-iconic-new-york-voices-subway-and-bus"&gt;the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) announced&lt;/a&gt; Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W59Z7w"&gt;Normal transit announcements can easily fade in the back of riders’ minds. They’re either too garbled to be understood or you’ve heard them so many times that they don’t even register. But that might be different if, say, Whoopi Goldberg was the one reminding you to wear a mask on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aXHyhJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KqH3ck4gDlw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v9kQUl"&gt;At least that’s a theoretical benefit of the MTA’s new announcements rolling out today, created in partnership with director and Instagram star Nicolas Heller (&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/newyorknico/?hl=en"&gt;@newyorknico&lt;/a&gt;). There are 25 “iconic New Yorkers” set to speak over the intercom on New York City transit, so if Whoopi isn’t your speed, Jerry Seinfeld is reading some announcements, too, as are Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson from &lt;em&gt;Broad City&lt;/em&gt;, Edie Falco from &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos, &lt;/em&gt;rappers Cam’ron and Jadakiss, and someone who’s been having a bit of a moment lately, Fran Lebowitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CEyhKW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Starting today, you will be hearing over 25 new voices representing the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MTA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@mta&lt;/a&gt; on subway platforms and buses all over NYC. &lt;a href="https://t.co/UfxuBkkpXL"&gt;pic.twitter.com/UfxuBkkpXL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nicolas Heller (@NuevaYorkNico) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NuevaYorkNico/status/1360272219641946118?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qz78dg"&gt;Getting celebrities to read reminders to wear masks and social distance may not be the best use of the MTA’s resources or time, but according to what &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/02/09/jerry-seinfeld-and-more-celebs-to-voice-nyc-subway-psas/"&gt;Heller told the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;“there was no budget for this.” So whether it’s a charming commute distraction or yet another reason to put in your headphones, at least Awkwafina reminding you to wear a mask didn’t cost taxpayers anything. In fact, the project produced some real gems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="A4GV9L"&gt;Ey yo check it out it’s Harlem’s own Killa Cam. Look—I don’t care if you from uptown, downtown, Harlem, Switzerland, wherever. I don’t care if you a chicken or a duck. And you know what? Covid don’t care either. Are you wearin’ a mask? Ya, well is it covering your mouth and nose? Then good, you’re doing great. Remember not only wearin’ a mask is the law—it’s the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="agig1c"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZACeaC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irCrNO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rJ9EV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bAi3R"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fucpnj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Komodo dragon has been crowned Twitch’s permanent PogChamp replacement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KOu9AYUbcN1UpWOIPn3V_gm6lkE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68812478/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_1.50.13_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WHQUNR"&gt;On January 6th, the day a riot of pro-Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22218088/twitch-bans-pogchamp-poggers-capitol-trump-violence-gootecks"&gt;Twitch removed&lt;/a&gt; the iconic PogChamp emote because the person it depicted made statements calling for further violence. Two days later, the company committed to rotating in a new version of PogChamp &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220874/twitch-pogchamp-face-change-ryan-gootecks-gutierrez"&gt;every 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;, meaning many streamers briefly became the new face of the emote — but they were sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229209/criticalbard-pogchamp-gootecks-hasanabi-twitch-emote-harassment"&gt;subjected to harassment&lt;/a&gt; following their new site-wide prominence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hh0i50"&gt;On Friday, the Twitch community voted to crown a new face for PogChamp — and the winner isn’t the face of a streamer. It’s a Komodo dragon. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1360340937302552582"&gt;Here’s what the emote looks like&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TceMd6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The community has spoken! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's fire up the PogChamp Machine and activate the new face of Pog. &lt;a href="https://t.co/idQ2cNtMiH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/idQ2cNtMiH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch (@Twitch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1360340937302552582?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sy23at"&gt;If you’ve hung out in Twitch chats, you may actually recognize this emote: it’s the beloved &lt;a href="https://twitchemotes.com/emotes/81273"&gt;KomodoHype&lt;/a&gt;. And I can see why it won the community vote. While the &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pogchamp"&gt;original PogChamp&lt;/a&gt; was Twitch’s hype emote, I think this Komodo dragon’s face is &lt;em&gt;even better&lt;/em&gt; at expressing hype, especially with its shockingly huge maw that somehow seems to be smiling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wkz43D"&gt;KomodoHype was selected over another excellent PogChamp done by &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/uminokaiju"&gt;streamer UmiNoKaiju&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to watch the full stream about the vote, you can &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/911396128?t=00h15m54s"&gt;check it out on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
