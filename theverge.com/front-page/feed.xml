    <title>Apple Music for Android reveals lossless audio could be imminent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4UT15XCqQGfaN_axm_imGPPjKSo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69289332/acastro_180927_1777_apple_music_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vG0d0x"&gt;Apple might have bigger plans for next week than initially thought. The new iMac, iPad Pro, and Apple TV 4K are all set to start shipping to early preorder customers on or around May 21st, but now it seems there could be two surprise announcements: a hi-fi streaming tier of Apple Music, and maybe even AirPods 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3VVVA"&gt;The Apple Music part seems extremely likely when you factor in &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/14/apple-music-android-lossless-audio-streaming/"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Digging into the latest Apple Music for Android beta app, they discovered direct references to high-resolution audio that didn’t exist previously&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCJlbD"&gt;These are the prompts found in the app’s code, though they’re not user-facing quite yet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KV8zLy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lossless audio files preserve every detail of the original file. Turning this on will consume significantly more data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zWWoGL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lossless audio files will use significantly more space on your device. 10 GB of space could store approximately: – 3000 songs at high quality – 1000 songs with lossless – 200 songs with hi-res lossless&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fbta9x"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lossless streaming will consume significantly more data. A 3-minute song will be approximately: – 1.5 MB with high efficiency- 6 MB with high quality at 256 kbps- 36 MB with lossless at 24-bit/48 kHz- 145 MB with hi-res lossless at 24-bit/192 kHzSupport varies and depends on song availability, network conditions, and connected speaker or headphone capability.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rTO1ot"&gt;It doesn’t get much more direct and clear than that, with Apple warning about both the higher data consumption of streaming lossless music and the added storage space that will be necessary to download it for offline listening. The fact that Apple has now added this data to its Android app suggests that this could all be happening sooner than later. I say that because Apple’s Apple One bundle &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/09/10/apple-one-music-unified-subscription-apk-insight/"&gt;showed up in Apple Music for Android&lt;/a&gt; just days before its public announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFONBz"&gt;The Android app code also reveals that Apple Music will offer two choices for lossless playback:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dYi573"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lossless&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;ALAC up to 24-bit/48 kHz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WvETqM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;High-Res Lossless&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;ALAC up to 24-bit/192 kHz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="oArq2e"&gt;So it sounds like Apple has every intention of matching what Tidal, Amazon Music HD, and services like Qobuz currently deliver. It’s also worth noting that there’ve been recent references to Dolby Atmos spatial audio in Apple Music on iOS, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/01/ios-14-6-beta-1-hinted-at-apple-music-hifi-support-with-dolby-audio-references/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IdUGhC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple has stuck with 256kbps AAC since 2007&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vPDgS0"&gt;Apple has for years stuck to its customary 256kbps AAC files for both iTunes and Apple Music. When &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2007%2F05%2F30Apple-Launches-iTunes-Plus%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F14%2F22436575%2Fapple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iTunes Plus debuted all the way back in 2007&lt;/a&gt;, that was a substantial upgrade over heavily compressed MP3s that people were downloading from peer-to-peer apps like Napster and Limewire during the height of music piracy. And it’s still perfectly adequate. Mastering of tracks has just as much influence on the listening experience as encoding details do, and Apple has tried to play to this aspect with its “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fitunes%2Fmastered-for-itunes%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F14%2F22436575%2Fapple-music-android-lossless-audio-airpods-3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple Digital Masters&lt;/a&gt;,” which aim to get the most dynamic range and detail from songs on its platform.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZisbz"&gt;But in terms of pure music fidelity, Apple has objectively been surpassed by companies like Tidal and Amazon over the last several years. My friend Micah Singleton has &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9572851/music-streaming-hi-fi-resolution-amazon-spotify-apple/"&gt;a great piece over at &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about how we’re entering the hi-fi era of the streaming music wars. Amazon Music HD is performing strongly, with subscriptions up 100 percent year over year. Spotify has also promised &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;the launch of “Spotify HiFi”&lt;/a&gt; for later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2lJ89M"&gt;There’s money to be made, and the ingredients are all there: Apple now sells premium headphones in the AirPods Max, and wireless carriers continue to talk up the promise and speeds of their growing 5G networks. I can’t imagine 5G will be &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; for lossless Apple Music streaming, but it’s a nice flex of the technology right in the middle of the iPhone 12 cycle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o9Z79u"&gt;What about those AirPods 3, though?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OwVM0N"&gt;There have already been quite a few leaks that revealed details about &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/guide/airpods-3/"&gt;Apple’s next iteration of AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, but the real question has been around release timing. Yesterday, a report from a site called &lt;a href="https://appletrack.com/rumor-suggests-new-airpods-coming-next-week/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ReviveOldPost"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AppleTrack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; suggested that the new AirPods could be announced alongside this new lossless tier of Apple Music. I don’t quite follow the logic, myself; no one really thinks of regular AirPods as the right choice for audiophile listening, but maybe Apple just wants new hardware of some sort to launch in tandem with the new service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9G5Hh1"&gt;Taken on its own, the AirPods rumor seems “sketchy” as &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/13/sketchy-rumor-claims-apple-will-launch-airpods-3-on-may-18/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; said. But the sudden discoveries about lossless audio in Apple Music for Android seem to add some fuel to the fire.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A driverless Waymo got stuck in traffic and then tried to run away from its support crew</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rzPEMtNZHBD51Zh0ICpCnI_fa9Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69289249/vpavic_181127_3122_0042.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GZ30lS"&gt;One of Waymo’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/9/21000085/waymo-fully-driverless-car-self-driving-ride-hail-service-phoenix-arizona"&gt;fully autonomous minivans&lt;/a&gt; got stuck at an intersection in Chandler, Arizona, prompting the company to send a roadside assistance team to come extract it. But when the crew arrived, the vehicle started to drive away before pulling over and completely blocking a three-lane road. It was a rare moment captured on video of one of Waymo’s driverless vehicles performing erratically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8KifZs"&gt;The incident was recorded from inside the vehicle by Joel Johnson, who publishes videos on YouTube under the handle &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JJRicksStudios/featured"&gt;JJRicks Studios&lt;/a&gt; about his experiences using Waymo’s Level 4 autonomous vehicles, which operate without a safety driver behind the wheel. Johnson’s video is a rare unedited look at what happens when one of the world’s most proficient autonomous vehicles gets tripped up by a few orange safety cones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aayK8v"&gt;“It’s no longer stranded and now it’s blocking, okay,” a remote operator is heard saying to Johnson at one point in the video, to which he replies, “Well, this is interesting!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="orKVND"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zdKCQKBvH-A?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zf8bBR"&gt;The Alphabet-owned company has approximately 600 vehicles as part of its fleet. More than 300 vehicles operate in an approximately 100-square-mile service area that includes the towns of Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, and Tempe — though its fully driverless cars are restricted to an area that is only half that size. (Waymo hasn’t disclosed how many of its vehicles operate without safety drivers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ibdzvM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;When one of the world’s most proficient autonomous vehicles gets tripped up by a few orange safety cones&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ddIYHN"&gt;In late 2018, the company launched a limited public &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18126103/waymo-one-self-driving-taxi-service-ride-safety-alphabet-cost-app"&gt;ride-hailing service called Waymo One&lt;/a&gt;, but the only customers to get access were people who had first been vetted through Waymo’s early rider program of beta testers. Waymo said it has around 1,500 monthly active users from both programs, the same number it reported in December 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1flSa"&gt;Waymo has a team of remote employees that watch the real-time feeds of each vehicle’s eight cameras and can help, with the push of a button, if the software runs into a difficult spot and needs a human eye to figure out what’s going on. But the company claims that the remote assistance team can’t “joystick” the vehicles, only offer suggestions to help extract the car from tough situations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJ0svy"&gt;One of those situations emerged in Johnson’s recent ride. The car wanted to make a right turn onto a street that had orange cones blocking that lane of traffic, which apparently confused the vehicle. In a statement provided to Johnson, Waymo said that it “detected an unusual situation and requested the attention of a remote fleet response specialist to provide additional information.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ki2Pbu"&gt;Where things got hairy is that apparently the remote specialist “provided incorrect guidance, which made it challenging for the Waymo driver to resume its intended route, and required Waymo’s roadside assistance team to complete the trip,” the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WOtm96"&gt;The remote operator tells Johnson that Waymo doesn’t assign a roadside assistance team to trail each of its fully autonomous vehicles in case something goes wrong. Crews are usually “two to five miles out,” she said. “It never was assigned one-to-one.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3Zbkmo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Crews are usually “two to five miles out”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9YOvtN"&gt;At this point in the video, the car starts to reverse from its position where it was slightly blocking the road to a spot where it was more fully clogging traffic. It then stops again, as if unsure how to proceed. The wheel turns slightly to the right on its own, but nothing happens. “Very interesting,” Johnson says, gamely watching this all happen from one of the middle captain seats. “Now it’s blocking the whole lane instead of half of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKG7Y5"&gt;Meanwhile, a flatbed truck drives passed collecting all of the orange cones that originally confused the Waymo car. And right when the roadside assistance crew arrives, the vehicle suddenly decides to hightail it out of its embarrassing situation. Johnson sounds disappointed that he never gets to interact with Waymo’s team of roving problem-solvers as the car speeds away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8DcDfC"&gt;But oh, no! More orange cones appear, and the Waymo vehicle slows down and then stops again. The roadside crew eventually shows up, and the car tries to run away again. But eventually, it surrenders, and everything gets worked out. The whole video is worth watching if you want an inside look at what happens when our driverless future confronts the intractable problem of minor road construction. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this story about how TikTok and apps are making Starbucks orders obnoxious</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zeQUs3rUIAypzbYEBPxsK0f5cZk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69288888/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lV3rCC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News &lt;/em&gt;has &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/appuccino-tiktok-starbucks"&gt;published a great story&lt;/a&gt; that looks at the cultural phenomenon that was on display when &lt;a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/starbucks-viral-order-edward-b1845504.html"&gt;that picture of a mile-long Starbucks order&lt;/a&gt; (which included over 18 pumps of flavor) went viral earlier this month. It explores both the phenomenon of people ordering more customizations when using apps (something I know I’ve fallen prey to myself, though nowhere close to the extent displayed in the photo), as well as the world of TikTok Starbucks influencers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fEuJMv"&gt;Wait, what? Starbucks influencers? If you, like me, had never heard of this corner of the internet, be prepared to read about TikTok teens and even some Starbucks employees on the platform coming up with drink recipes that can become so popular that some employees estimate they take up 20 percent of orders they fill in a shift. The reporter also interviews some of those employees to figure out how they feel about the sometimes audacious orders. (Spoiler alert: their opinions are not as unanimous as I would’ve thought.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="caLQYj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katienotopoulos/appuccino-tiktok-starbucks"&gt;The story is a fascinating look&lt;/a&gt; at how internet culture can affect even the mainstay of real-life American culture that is Starbucks. Some drinks that are popular online have even made their way to the menu, and it seems like Starbucks actually keeps an eye on what’s happening on TikTok. The story even includes a fun term for the phenomenon: “appuccino,” a mashup of app and Frappuccino, the popular coffee drink that often finds itself the victim of many, many add-ons.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leaked renders reveal an even more affordable 5G Samsung phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ZAfjACwY8f9NyWLvRz0TSI92Eg=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69288778/a22_5g_render_91mobiles.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Images show what could become Samsung’s least expensive 5G phone, nabbing the A32 5G’s title.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: 91mobiles&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0akzLd"&gt;A new batch of leaked images shows what could become Samsung’s least expensive 5G phone yet: the Galaxy A22 5G. The Galaxy A32 5G currently holds that title at an already low $279. The images come from &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/samsung-galaxy-a22-5g-4g-renders-specs-exclusive/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;91mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and match up with previous leaks hinting that the phone might be on its way with a 200,000 KRW price (~$180), though it may be only destined for India and parts of Asia in the immediate future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNeDqF"&gt;The leaked images show two variants — 5G and 4G versions — with two slightly varied sets of specs. The 5G model will allegedly have a 6.4-inch LCD and a rear triple-camera array (probably a 48-megapixel main / macro / depth sensor combo). A MediaTek Dimensity 700 chipset looks likely, thanks to a &lt;a href="https://www.mysmartprice.com/gear/samsung-galaxy-a22-5g-spotted-on-geekbench/"&gt;previous &lt;em&gt;Geekbench&lt;/em&gt; leak&lt;/a&gt;, plus a substantial 6GB of RAM. The 4G model includes one additional rear camera and an OLED rather than LCD. They’re both expected to offer large 5,000mAh batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qWEWzJht9WJPHWtWQrDOCXNTW3w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22515022/galaxy_a22_5g_image.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: 91mobiles&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leaks suggest that the A22 5G will offer a 6.4-inch LCD, rear triple-camera array, and 5,000mAh battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LJ95qB"&gt;There are a few other budget phones between the $200 and $300 mark offering 5G, including the Realme 8 5G for €199 (~$240) and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;OnePlus Nord N10 5G&lt;/a&gt; for $300, but the A22 5G stands to become one of the first in the sub-$200 range, depending on how things shake out. In the US, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;5G is still in a sorry state&lt;/a&gt;, but wireless carriers are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425022/verizon-t-mobile-att-phone-promotion-magenta-max-5g-c-band"&gt;racing to improve their networks&lt;/a&gt; and may be eager to stock their shelves with more aggressively priced 5G devices like the A22 5G soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1uOtk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mj7LGifJ1euP-dbrplwPMhD36I4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67781485/dseifert_191123_3810_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Echo Show 5 (left), Echo Show 8 (middle), and the Echo Show (right).&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Late last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;fourth generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry: Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;third-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the fourth-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30. However, it’s currently only available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702%3Fpreselect%3D80770243%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; for $50. There is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-With-Clock-4th-Gen/dp/B085M66LH1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a model with a built-in LED display&lt;/a&gt; to show the time, weather, and other information that is available for $60, which is the typical retail price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YHsulr"&gt;Amazon is also currently selling some bundles, including a $60 one that features &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K4FDPHZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one Sengled Bluetooth bulb&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Amazon-Smart-Charcoal/dp/B08GTWC9ZB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot and Amazon Smart Plug bundle&lt;/a&gt; available for $60, a $15 discount.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The fourth-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;We have seen this product go down to $40, but, unfortunately, it’s currently only available for its usual price of $60 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502548%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;fourth-gen Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt; smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the fourth-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;Currently, the fourth-gen Echo is available for $100 (usual price) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733330369536034962#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-4th-gen-smart-home-hub-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795705%3Fpreselect%3D80770246%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiNGuc"&gt;If you are looking for a pair of Amazon Echo devices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589613981487950#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is selling an Amazon Echo two-pack for $180&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $20 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/6/20950100/amazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker-alexa-3d-audio-test-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Studio&lt;/a&gt; is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-studio-smart-speaker%2F-%2FA-81412943&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeAmazonEchoDeals051421" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for a compact Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; is the one to consider, especially since Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22429549/amazon-echo-show-8-5-camera-update-price-kids-edition" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recently announced&lt;/a&gt; that it would begin outfitting the device with an improved 2MP camera. Like the last-gen model, the latest edition, set to arrive in June, features an always-on microphone, a 5.5-inch display, and a physical shutter, allowing you to block the camera’s view. It’s currently available for preorder at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Staging-Product-Not-Retail-Sale/dp/B08KJN3333/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=echo+show+5&amp;amp;qid=1621006774&amp;amp;s=amazon-devices&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740550908332818656" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $84.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDeSDU"&gt;In wake of the news, Amazon has reduced the price of the last-gen Echo Show 5. The first-gen model used to retail for $90, and we have seen it drop to as low as $45. But for a limited time, it’s on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; for $50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJmJw1"&gt;Amazon also has a few bundles available for the first-gen model; you can get an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089Q2RJH9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and three months of Amazon Kids Plus&lt;/a&gt; for $51, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086P992GD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $60, and an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SW188FP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 plus an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $70.

&lt;h2 id="FiYkkx"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JGaEAZ"&gt;The Echo Dot isn’t the only Echo device with a kid-friendly design. The Echo Show 5 Kids Edition offers all of the same features as the standard, second-gen Echo Show 5, only with a vibrant print on the rear and a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which grants your family access to a trove of videos, games, and other kid-friendly content. It even comes with a two-year warranty, providing a bit of protection from whatever your child might (literally) throw at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1db3Rn"&gt;Available in June, the Echo Show 5 Kids Edition is currently available for preorder from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08LMSC4WZ/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08ZN7QP73_toAsin_B08LMSC4WZ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740551130085982176" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $95. If you’re looking for add-ons, you can also preorder an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09345FQWY/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08ZN7QP73_toAsin_B08LMSC4WZ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $115 or an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B093462JMH/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08ZN7QP73_toAsin_B08LMSC4WZ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 Kids Edition with an Echo Glow&lt;/a&gt; for $110, a $15 discount, through Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="O97UD3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Like the Echo Show 5, the Echo Show 8 will soon be available in two distinct models. Both feature 8-inch displays and dual speakers. However, unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8&lt;/a&gt;, the forthcoming model sports a 13-megapixel camera and some unique software tricks, one of which grants it the ability to keep the subject centered in the frame as they move around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNLpG4"&gt;When pitted against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, their closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, both iterations of the Echo Show 8 are better options for a few reasons: they feature slightly larger displays, better speakers, and cameras that allow you to use them as video chatting devices for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;We have seen the first-gen Show 8 go as low as $65. However, it’s currently on sale for $110 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. There are also a few bundles available for a few dollars more. For $120, you can get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZND1QQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a first-gen Echo Show 8 and a 1080 Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt;, or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YD5WDCB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 8 with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $135. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovLiAu"&gt;If you prefer to opt for the newer Echo Show 8, you can preorder the device at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B084DCJKSL/ref=pav_d_fromAsin_B08J8FFJ8H_toAsin_B084DCJKSL?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; before it arrives in June for $130.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;. This device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and, unlike the Show 5 and 8, this model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It’s also mounted on a motorized swiveling base that lets the screen follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;We have seen the latest Echo Show 10 get discounted as low as $200, but no active deals are available right now. But if you want to buy this product, you can get it for its usual $250 price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-hd-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-82381551&amp;amp;sharedid=vergedeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Itch.io is waiving all sales fees today for ‘Creator Day’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I6H527X15a0-jViGBhO8NkPJ1y8=/275x0:2540x1510/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69287986/Screen_Shot_2021_05_14_at_9.26.22_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zbhGdJ"&gt;Indie game storefront &lt;a href="http://Itch.io"&gt;Itch.io&lt;/a&gt; is waiving sales fees on everything today, May 14th, as part of the company’s first &lt;a href="https://itch.io/blog/252069/announcing-the-first-itchio-creator-day"&gt;Creator Day&lt;/a&gt;. Anyone selling things on the diverse storefront (which includes everything from indie games to music to entire magazines) will be able to keep “100 percent of sales after taxes and payment processor fees.” It’s similar to Bandcamp’s monthly creator program &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188143/bandcamp-waives-sales-fees-artists-affected-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;Bandcamp Fridays&lt;/a&gt; (although Itch.io hasn’t said on what schedule it’ll run the promotion in the future).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwNe5R"&gt;Itch.io is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/29/18118217/itchio-steam-leaf-corcoran-pc-games-indie"&gt;beloved by creators&lt;/a&gt; for being relatively easy to use and generally more transparent than other bigger game storefronts like Steam. It also takes a smaller cut than most other online game platforms: Itch.io traditionally only asks for 10 percent of what creators earn on its storefront in comparison to Apple’s App Store and Steam, which typically start with a 30 percent cut (you can read about other platform fees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;in our handy guide&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0P5fw"&gt;Content standards are also a bit looser on Itch.io, which might be the other reason you’ve heard about the storefront recently. Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22395997/epic-games-store-pc-apps-windows-store-brave-discord-itch"&gt;started offering Itch.io’s desktop client&lt;/a&gt; in April as a free download in its storefront (yes a store inside a store, it’s odd). As part of the ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic Games v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, Apple attempted to use the fact that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425759/epic-apple-trial-app-store-itch-io-offensive-sexualized-unspeakable-games-day-5"&gt;Itch.io features experimental and often sexually explicit content&lt;/a&gt; as justification for why Epic shouldn’t be allowed to offer its app store as an alternative to Apple’s. Of course Epic has no responsibility to moderate games sold on an entirely separate platform just because they offer that store as a download.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hv7AwY"&gt;Online marketplace drama aside, Itch.io is absolutely worth a browse, especially today. The games can be a bit NSFW and even unfinished, and there’s almost certainly stuff you won’t want to play, read, or listen to, but it’s also on the cutting edge. Whether you realize it or not, the next big thing (or your next favorite game) could already be hanging out on &lt;a href="http://Itch.io"&gt;Itch.io&lt;/a&gt;, made by someone on their free time. And if you buy that game today, they’ll get to keep more of the proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g94oMx"&gt;Itchi.io’s Creator Day runs all of May 14th and ends at 11:59PM PT / 2:59 AM ET (May 15th).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wvX4BN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="NXmO8B"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKDtL1"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, Nilay and Dieter talk with &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; senior reporter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/adi-robertson"&gt;Adi Robertson&lt;/a&gt; about the second week of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic Games v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; trial, which involved a lot of arguing over the definition of a game and whether a banana should wear clothing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hulilM"&gt;Both Nilay and &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; writer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/monica-chin"&gt;Monica Chin&lt;/a&gt; have tried to use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22435030/starlink-satellite-internet-spacex-review"&gt;Starlink&lt;/a&gt;, Elon Musk’s space-based ISP. The results have been middling — and infuriating if you think too much about why everybody is so excited for Starlink in the first place. Plus, Monica has the details on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22423545/intel-tiger-lake-h-mobile-processors-11th-gen-laptops"&gt;Intel’s newest Tiger Lake-H processors&lt;/a&gt; and the many, many laptops that are about to use it. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart confirms it is indeed still selling Pokémon cards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Walmart DTD 555" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kJ4O4rdunWA3AnLF7uQkXSod2w4=/2x0:554x368/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69287642/walmart555.1419973090.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Walmart DTD 555&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1PfR9J"&gt;Contrary to published reports, Walmart confirmed in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Friday that it has not suspended the sale of any trading cards, including the Pokémon cards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433236/target-halts-sale-pokemon-mlb-nba-nfl-trading-cards-may-14"&gt;that Target recently took off its shelves&lt;/a&gt;. There have been &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-05-13-pokemon-cards-pulled-from-target-and-walmart-due-to-safety-concerns"&gt;reports on social media&lt;/a&gt; of people seeing signs at Walmart stores indicating that the retailer would also no longer be selling the cards in stores, but it appears that’s not official policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1DLyxi"&gt;There’s been a bit of a mania around Pokémon cards, and trading cards in general lately, with card rating companies being buried in “an avalanche of cardboard” as collectors try to up the value of their cards with an official grade. Apparently, the collectors’ market has people excited about buying new cards: the Pokémon Company has been rushing to produce more new cards, and there have been &lt;a href="https://www.fox6now.com/news/fight-over-trading-cards-outside-brookfield-target"&gt;fights in parking lots&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.thegamer.com/man-arrested-after-failed-pokemon-card-heist-no-team-rocket-members-involved/"&gt;elaborate heists&lt;/a&gt;. Unsurprisingly, &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/pokemon-card-opening-day-celebration-video-logan-paul-elite-box-2021-2"&gt;Logan Paul is involved&lt;/a&gt;, hyping up the value in the collectors’ market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A0yS1Y"&gt;It’s gotten to the point where Target decided to call it quits, posting signs informing customers that Pokémon, MLB, NFL, and NBA cards would no longer be sold in stores. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Thursday, Target said that the temporary suspension was done “out of an abundance of caution” for the safety of its employees and customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zA8Vr"&gt;Walmart did say that it had, in fact, seen increased demand for the cards, and that it was “determining what, if any, changes are needed” to meet it, while still keeping everybody safe. So far, it’s unclear if the situation will change for Walmart and other retailers, now that people have one fewer store to buy their cards from.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Whale hugs, ‘active sea serpents,’ and the wild world of whale sex </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Northern Right whale" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/luI0npye8sJPGQLpGzs1tnKaf68=/9x0:5091x3388/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69287370/639203570.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ebccv0"&gt;Adorable drone footage came out last week showing two right whales touching bellies and wrapping their flippers around each other — appearing to “hug.” It was a moment rarely caught on camera. Scientists still aren’t exactly sure what that behavior really means, but the moment is a window into the dramatic world of whale sex and conservation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZGeBdY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lZvO4pp6Alo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OhVKPN"&gt;The video that’s been released to the public was just one snippet of a series of footage from two drones that was captured on February 28th in Cape Cod Bay, Massachusetts. The team documenting what happened that day included veterinarian and senior scientist Michael Moore from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI), National Geographic photographer Brian Skerry, and Amy Knowlton from the New England Aquarium. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;spoke with Moore about what he saw that day, and why the video they captured is important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AINbNB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcL600"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were you researching when your team caught this moment?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qGrI4H"&gt;We’ve had a longtime interest in the health of North American right whales because they need to be healthy to be able to reproduce and make babies. The focus of so much of the conservation efforts for the endangered species or declining endangered species has been on reducing mortality. Mortality is really important stuff, obviously. But if you stop the mortalities, but you don’t enable them to have a better reproductive life, then the trend isn’t going to reverse. So you need babies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="rZqmgf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You need babies.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KMoqLy"&gt;As a veterinarian, I’m always interested in the condition of an animal. How does it look? For a wild animal, that means getting informative photographs because you can’t get hands on them. You can’t listen to them with a stethoscope. And so we’ve been working with colleagues since the late ‘90s to look at the body condition and the growth rate of North Atlantic right whales using aerial photography. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DdulUb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you walk me through the moments leading up to the event?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1rdki"&gt;Essentially, our routine is to line up the stars in terms of weather, people, and whales. It was early in the season, so the information wasn’t that solid and the weather wasn’t that good, but we did have a good day. We hopped on the boat and out we went. We work with folks with the aquarium who are really good whale observers to help us find the whales, and Brian Skerry was also with us getting footage, stills, for his work in the magazine business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BuPzCH"&gt;We’d scoot around the bay looking for groups of whales, and we found some. Once we felt that we knew what was going on and settled down, we launched the drones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gyygYw"&gt;The behavioral event that we documented there is called a surface active group; that’s where right whales come together and they spend time at and near the surface together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dccHx6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did you see the whales doing? Is what you captured considered a hug? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1CPlQ"&gt;The word “belly-to-belly” is the word that has been used in the database of behaviors by the New England aquarium to standardize, “Okay, at this point in time, these animals are lying side by side and their bellies were touching each other.” So belly-to-belly is a neutral term that adequately describes what that video shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nLydnX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“belly-to-belly”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dSmxTs"&gt;Were they hugging? I mean, we didn’t ever say they &lt;em&gt;were&lt;/em&gt; hugging. But we asked the question because I think it’s a reasonable question. I guess hugging has an operational definition and an implication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnFsCb"&gt;So, operationally, a hug is where two mammals — I don’t know, maybe only humans can hug, it all depends on how you define things — wrap their arms around each other. You know, the flippers of a right whale are homologous to the arms of a human. So physically, yeah, they were hugging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TzmX3Z"&gt;If you include the concept of affection in the definition of a hug, then we don’t know whether they were hugging or not. We don’t know if they were showing affection or not. We can hypothesize that they were; it would be hard to test that hypothesis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrQ3CR"&gt;The hardcore scientists do believe that behaviors that humans demonstrate are unique to humans. Certainly it’s easier to interrogate two humans who have been hugging and ask them whether they were showing affection. You can’t do that for whales, so we really don’t know what they were doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZPVZbj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They need a whole lot more love”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nI2ppY"&gt;One of the reasons why I wanted that video to be widely seen was there was an aesthetic in that video that certainly had some emotional qualities. And given the extent to which the right whale species has been devastated by anthropogenic trauma, a little bit of anthropomorphism, if that were to build some sympathy and empathy for these animals, is something that I’m totally prepared to indulge in. These animals need every piece of help they can get from the human race. They need a whole lot more love from many humans than they’re currently getting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6iB52g"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;North Atlantic right whales are considered &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.iucn.org/news/species/202007/almost-a-third-lemurs-and-north-atlantic-right-whale-now-critically-endangered-iucn-red-list"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;critically endangered, and “one step from extinction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.” What threats are the whales facing from humans? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Editor’s note: the rest of the interview contains some graphic descriptions of both whale injuries and whale sex. Also, “sea serpents.”]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gunvcm"&gt;I’ve spent a fair amount of time looking at dead right whales on beaches to diagnose why they died, and the two primary causes of death we document are entanglements with fishing gear and collisions with ships. Collisions with ships generally break down into either being cut up like a loaf of bread with a spinning propeller, or they get hit by a blunt part of the ship, and then they get bruised and broken bones. That’s unfortunate and totally inappropriate, and needs to stop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAWrJn"&gt;The entanglement process varies in terms of the size of the animal. The bigger and stronger they are, the more likely they are to successfully avoid drowning because they have enough power to swim up to the surface and break the gear away so they can breathe. If you’re entangled fatally, you’re probably going to take six months to die. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XY02VV"&gt;I don’t care if it’s a wild animal or if it’s a human, it shouldn’t happen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5Pvfdn"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It must have been a welcome break for you to see healthy whales.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZqUtt"&gt;One of the motivations for us to share that video was that there’s been so much bad news about right whales. It was time to have something that was beautiful — and intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wRPPcc"&gt;These surface active groups can involve copulation. We don’t know if any baby right whales were conceived that day. The two in that video were male so obviously not in that instance. But there were females around and there were active penises in the video and so on so forth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2EIWX8"&gt;So it’s as close as one comes to seeing some hope that these animals have a chance of recovering through sexual activity, which is good. Right whale reproduction is actually pretty extraordinary. I don’t know if you want to hear about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KGNhFL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I do now. Were you able to actually capture reproduction from that group of whales that day? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JIPZIh"&gt;I don’t know, to answer your question briefly. In the surface active groups, there are quite often observations of what we call “sea serpents.” And you can imagine what they really are: these long, flexible, snaky things. A right whale penis is about 12 feet long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ms2bIb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We did see penises waving around in the water”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YUjP6H"&gt;We did see penises waving around in the water. But we didn’t actually record any finishes in the right place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruMF3U"&gt;Male right whales have the largest testicles of any living mammal. And that is because males have evolved to compete with each other, not physically or violently in any way, for access to the female, but purely by sheer volume. At times, we have had photographs in the past where not one but two finished in the &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Simultaneous-copulation-of-two-male-right-whales-with-a-female-in-the-Bay-of-Fundy-11_fig1_236892818"&gt;right place at the same time&lt;/a&gt;. Because essentially, they try to flush each other out by having more volume than anybody else. I’m trying to be sensitive to this because it’s just a complicated topic. &lt;em&gt;Chuckles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xao9h1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did the two whales that were captured in that belly-to-belly moment have “active sea serpents”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNN3t2"&gt;Actually what I recall was the active sea serpents were coming up from further down in the water column so they were from other whales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EPoM2f"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since your conservation research focuses on reproduction, is there anything that conservationists can do to encourage that behavior?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B6pgqR"&gt;The behavior will happen when they’re ready to get pregnant, when they’re receptive. The receptiveness of these animals, I think, depends upon their health. If they are fit and fat and ready to commit to get pregnant, they’ll do it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Right Whales Spotted Close To Shore On Cape Cod Bay" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ASuXsin5BZwmuNd8MrfefO83rjs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22514472/472571336.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;DUXBURY, MA: An aerial view of a right whale erupting from the blowhole while feeding off the shores of Duxbury Beach. There were groups of the North Atlantic right whales swimming offshore.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2uXhca"&gt;So, what we have to do as conservationists is to enhance their health, not just stop killing them. How do we do that? We reduce these stressors that are reducing their health. Vessel collision and entanglement aren’t just mortality factors. They’re are also sub-lethal stressors. The sub-lethal stressors involved with vessels are sub-lethal collisions, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22166314/covid-19-pandemic-ocean-noise-pollution"&gt;noise that they make when they go by causing a reduction in the abilities of the animals to communicate with each other&lt;/a&gt;. Every entanglement is another detriment to their health. They may just brush against [fishing gear] and get a small scar and that really wasn’t a big deal. They may be entangled for weeks or months, and then they’ll get out of it. During that time, they’ve been towing gear and traps and rope around. It’s been traumatizing to their skin, to their blubber. The drag will increase their energy output, they need to feed more. They’ll probably lose weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PaUMmz"&gt;So, what can we do to encourage that behavior? Get them into a situation where they are healthy enough to want to indulge in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFlqve"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything else you want people to know about right whales? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uiLwk"&gt;Anything they need to know about right whales they can read in my book that comes out in October, &lt;a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/W/bo113867120.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We are all Whalers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Famicom Detective Club brings more great crime drama to the Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dLMjFWCHA095inMjZheCwh3VyLc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69287135/Switch_FDCgsb_SCRN_03_bmp_jpgcopy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p76AUx"&gt;There’s something about the Nintendo Switch that makes it a great fit for murder mystery stories. Just like a good novel, these are games best enjoyed while curled up in a comfy chair with a warm drink, ideally when it’s dark and rainy outside. That’s one of the reasons why games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/12/18306762/phoenix-wright-ace-attorney-trilogy-remastered-review-xbox-ps4-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/6/21166865/murder-by-numbers-review-nitendo-switch-steam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Murder By Numbers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; are best enjoyed on Nintendo’s tablet, which lets you play wherever you want. It’s also what makes the &lt;em&gt;Famicom Detective Club&lt;/em&gt; series so interesting — a pair of long-lost titles from the ‘80s that have been given a fresh new life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KaP6CM"&gt;There are two titles launching today: &lt;em&gt;The Missing Heir&lt;/em&gt; and a prequel called &lt;em&gt;The Girl Who Stands Behind&lt;/em&gt;. Though they look new, these games were first released in 1988 and 1989, respectively. Each game has been given a modern makeover, with beautiful character portraits and detailed backdrops with just a hint of animation to make them feel alive. It’s a big step up from the original games, which were dominated by plain black menus and comparatively simple pixel art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VuVFNJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10500084"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nX9zZt"&gt;The Switch release also marks the English-language debut for the &lt;em&gt;Famicom Detective Club&lt;/em&gt; series. So far I’ve played through the first, &lt;em&gt;The Missing Heir&lt;/em&gt;, and it stands up surprisingly well for a 30-year-old game. It’s a typical setup for a murder mystery. After the matriarch of a rich family in a small Japanese town dies, the family’s butler hires you to investigate. It’s a story involving feuding siblings vying for control of a company, the titular missing heir who has the rights to a big inheritance, and even some superstitious villagers who believe the family is cursed. Oh, and to make matters even more challenging, your character is also suffering from amnesia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jymmtS"&gt;It’s not a particularly original story, but it’s full of some great twists and turns, including more than one unexpected death. It plays out sort of like a less goofy version of the &lt;em&gt;Ace Attorney&lt;/em&gt; series, albeit without the courtroom drama. &lt;em&gt;Famicom Detective Club&lt;/em&gt; is probably best described as a visual novel, which means most of your time is spent talking to characters to gather hints. There’s also some light detective work where you can scan the environment for clues. You don’t necessarily get those big “ah ha!” moments that happen in other detective games, but &lt;em&gt;The Missing Heir&lt;/em&gt; makes up for this with a story that’s packed with mysteries, making it hard to put down.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i7nIR0Ab--_bvX-Jp9vRynww8To=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22514367/Switch_FDCmh_SCRN_04_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OYH14P"&gt;It’s mostly pretty straightforward: at any given moment there are only a few characters to talk to and one or two locations to explore. But this is also where the game starts to show its age. One of the more annoying aspects involves asking people the same questions multiple times in order to get new information. It gets tedious after a while, and there were a few times in the game where I found myself stuck, unable to find the trigger that pushed the story forward. There’s no hint system to help you along, either. That said, there are some nice quality-of-life features, like a robust notebook detailing all of the characters and a “previously on” story update every time you start playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WQWFma"&gt;Perhaps the most remarkable thing about these games is that they barely feel dated at all. If it didn’t have “Famicom” in the title, I might think they were new crime dramas from Nintendo that just so happened to be set in the 1980s. What &lt;em&gt;Famicom Detective Club&lt;/em&gt; lacks in innovation it makes up for with everything else: gorgeous art, captivating writing, and more than enough mystery to keep you glued to your Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKYboU"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Famicom Detective Club: The Missing Heir &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt; The Girl Who Stands Behind&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; launch today on the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
