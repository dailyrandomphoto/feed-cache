    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="svo9eH"&gt;Demand for Pokémon cards has been high the last few weeks as the series celebrates its 25th anniversary. To accommodate the high demand, The Pokémon Company announced today that it &lt;a href="https://support.pokemon.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056644571-Update-on-Pok%C3%A9mon-Trading-Card-Game-Product-Availability"&gt;will be reprinting trading cards&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="212vyK"&gt;The Pokémon Company &lt;a href="https://support.pokemon.com/hc/en-us/articles/360056644571-Update-on-Pok%C3%A9mon-Trading-Card-Game-Product-Availability"&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; on its support page that it is “aware that some fans are experiencing difficulties purchasing certain Pokémon trading card products due to a very high demand and global shipping constraints impacting g availability,” while also confirming that it is reprinting impacted products at “maximum capacity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W2UsoE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We’re aware that some fans are experiencing difficulties purchasing certain Pokémon TCG products due to very high demand. In response, we are reprinting impacted products at maximum capacity to ensure more fans can enjoy the Pokémon TCG. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;More info here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/sClZo3BXsp"&gt;https://t.co/sClZo3BXsp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Play Pokémon (@playpokemon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playpokemon/status/1359548922780213249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HIeblb"&gt;There’s no specific time frame on when retailers are expected to receive new shipments, but the company pledged that it will “replenish stock at retailers as soon as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uo0NbP"&gt;Over the last several months, Pokémon trading cards have been &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/11/6/21551503/pokemon-card-charizard-appraisal-shadowless-collection-first-edition-prices"&gt;in high demand&lt;/a&gt; with products selling out quickly at retailers and older cards selling for as much as &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/10/28/21538821/box-of-first-edition-pokemon-cards-fake-375000-dumb-money-logan-paul"&gt;$375,000 by third-party sellers&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, card opening videos have &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQB8scCtrKg"&gt;blown up on YouTube&lt;/a&gt; over the last year — in some cases, getting millions of views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bMdJQz"&gt;With the franchise celebrating a major milestone this year, Nintendo has been finding various ways to commemorate the occasion. This includes partnering with McDonald's to give out &lt;a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/collect-25th-anniversary-pokemon-tcg-cards-in-mcdonalds-happy-meals/"&gt;collectible cards when you buy a Happy Meal&lt;/a&gt; at the fast-food chain, but as our sister site &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/9/22274841/mcdonalds-pokemon-cards-anniversary-25-scalpers-ebay-prices-resell-happy-meal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out, the demand for these items is high, and some people are taking advantage of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Asus TUF Dash F15 gaming laptop is efficient but not excellent</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Its quad-core CPU and low-powered RTX 3070 are great for efficiency but not intensive tasks&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="BKRRgh"&gt;If it’s a thin gaming laptop you seek, Asus makes several, including last year’s excellent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt; and the intriguing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22249408/asus-rog-flow-x13-review-price-specs-features"&gt;ROG Flow x13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt; that we recently reviewed. The TUF Dash F15 is the latest option to join the pack, and it’s the one that might catch your eye if you’re looking for a laptop outfitted with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226544/nvidia-rtx-3080-laptops-gpus-ces-2021"&gt;Nvidia RTX 3070 graphics chip&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225370/intel-11th-gen-h-series-chips-ultraportable-gaming-laptop-ces-2021"&gt;11th Gen Intel Core H-series processor&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to other perks like a Thunderbolt 4 port and a fast refresh rate display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPUGlG"&gt;As one of the first machines to launch with this processor and GPU, the TUF Dash F15 is a showcase for what you can expect from a thin chassis that costs $1,449, Asus’ MSRP for the configuration it sent over to me. (This specific model is set to release on March 8th. A $1,699.99 model with a slightly better processor is available now. A $1,099.99 model that contains the RTX 3060 is available as of February 15th, 2021.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QoVUeZ"&gt;Like those other models I mentioned, the TUF Dash F15 is a really solid laptop — except for the fact that, like the Zephyrus G14, it doesn’t have a webcam. For that reason, it’s not an ideal machine if you frequently hop on video calls for work, class, or leisure. In terms of specs, I’m not convinced it has the chops to brave the next wave of demanding games in a year or two. I’ll explain why in a bit. At least for now, it can run most games at their highest graphical settings with relatively smooth frame rates, and it has great battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="r0z5CE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10336076"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j7oTsC"&gt;The TUF Dash F15 has a new chassis design that looks more refined than Asus’ TUF A15 gaming laptop. This model has a slimmer, more confident look that ditches the older version’s faux-brushed metal detailing and garish yellow backlit keys. Its lid is gunmetal grey (Asus also makes a “Moonlight White” variant), while the inside is black and all-plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zquto9"&gt;The keyboard is backlit in a color that I would describe as Mountain Dew Baja Blast. It’s a strange color choice — but I don’t hate it. The effect is more subtle than it seems and can be turned off or the brightness adjusted. Also, seeing the light shine through the transparent WASD keys looks cool (in addition to helping you quickly find those all-important directional keys).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus TUF Dash F15" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/y9jYjwepRC4jr97BDGoMc26A0nE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22253386/cfaulkner_210114_4374_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This keyboard is a dream to type on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus TUF Dash F15" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zHkmfPw2SgH3oNnvS9_BCkpFG-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22253380/cfaulkner_210114_4374_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The volume keys have their own spot at the top.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4GkldM"&gt;I commend Asus for engineering a good keyboard, both in terms of key feel and usability. All of the keys are nicely spaced out, and I was quickly able to acclimate to typing on it. It was also smart to separate the volume keys from the row of function keys since they’re so commonly used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="iy7JHd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10336106"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fOJ4dO"&gt;Continuing Asus’ trend from the Zephyrus G14, this machine also has fantastic battery life. In my testing, the TUF Dash F15’s battery lasted into the start of a second day before needing to recharge. That’s over eight hours of use, which is fantastic longevity for a machine pitched as a gaming laptop. Unplugging the charger automatically puts it in “Silent” mode within Asus’ Armoury Crate performance-tracking software and knocks the display’s default 240Hz refresh rate down to a choppier 60Hz. In this mode, the system switches automatically to integrated graphics. (The Nvidia graphics chip is disabled when you unplug.) That’s a compromise, but I like that no toggling is necessary to get good results like these.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4YWz4p"&gt;Out of curiosity, I switched to 240Hz while running off the battery. It lasted most, but not all, of my workday. It’s no secret that high refresh rate displays can kill battery life, so I wouldn’t suggest doing this unless you keep a charger nearby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LzyzP3"&gt;Speaking of chargers, the laptop ships with a big 200W power brick, but you have the option to recharge it with up to a 100W USB-C charger using its Thunderbolt 4 port. (Thunderbolt 4 doesn’t support wattage over 100W.) Obviously, it doesn’t charge as quickly that way; in fact, in my experience, the laptop drains faster while gaming than it can charge via USB-C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus TUF Dash F15" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gDEYeYSB1DzdUJTOcp1ySwDhwpU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22253381/cfaulkner_210114_4374_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I like that Asus lets the TUF Dash F15 charge via the Thunderbolt 4 port (up to 100W).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus TUF Dash F15" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rS3unEU_iFgqHiUfVyTi-q0u-Oo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22253385/cfaulkner_210114_4374_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;But if you want the fastest recharge, you’ll have to plug in with the included 200W power brick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="81oDvw"&gt;The TUF Dash F15’s quad-core Intel Core i7-11730H processor and 16GB of DDR4 RAM didn’t miss a beat while I was using 10 tabs in Google Chrome, along with Spotify (streaming music via Bluetooth to my headphones — the laptop’s built-in speakers are awful), Slack, and Affinity Photo. For those apps, this device feels snappy enough to use as a daily driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNA38N"&gt;However, this doesn’t seem like the best choice if your work involves editing and exporting video or other processor-bound projects. When I ran our video export test (which crunches an Adobe Premiere Pro project into a 5-minute, 33-second 4K file), it took 6 minutes, 41 seconds, which was slower than I anticipated. The machine’s four-core, 35W TDP processor seemed to be the bottleneck, as Windows Task Manager performance stats showed that it was at full, or near full, utilization the entire time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2apqzC"&gt;There are some older midrange gaming laptops we’ve reviewed that delivered faster Premiere Pro results, thanks to their higher-power 45W 10th Gen hexa-core and octa-core processors. A few include last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335740/lenovo-legion-5i-gaming-laptop-review-intel-nvidia"&gt;Lenovo Legion 5i&lt;/a&gt; and the 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21348101/msi-gs66-stealth-gaming-laptop-review-rtx-2070-super-300hz"&gt;MSI GS66 Stealth&lt;/a&gt; as well as the maxed-out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 15&lt;/a&gt; we tested. However, I wouldn’t recommend opting for those since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225370/intel-11th-gen-h-series-chips-ultraportable-gaming-laptop-ces-2021"&gt;Intel has 45W 11th Gen processors in development&lt;/a&gt; that should leave the older chips in the dust. But none of this helps this laptop’s case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus TUF Dash F15" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c61J82MAh6rl1FOBzOH3d_Iq3DE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22253382/cfaulkner_210114_4374_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Asus also makes a “moonlight white” version of the TUF Dash F15.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus TUF Dash F15" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mj2algGtoORnz1kj7JOBXOwhgRs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22253387/cfaulkner_210114_4374_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Games look great on its 240Hz refresh rate IPS panel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G1w6dy"&gt;The TUF Dash F15 was more middling with high-end gaming than I expected, too. Its RTX 3070 struggled to meet the bar for smooth 60 frame-per-second gameplay when I ran some demanding titles like &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt; at their highest graphical settings in 1080p. Open-world titles and games with ray-tracing features were particularly good at pushing this laptop to its limit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="qCslkm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10336141"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tBPsdU"&gt;With the games running at their highest graphical settings, the benchmark utility in &lt;em&gt;Horizon: Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; averaged 68fps, while &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt;’s benchmark averaged 58fps. &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt; fared better at around 80fps with DLSS settings set to quality mode. &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;topped out at around 50fps with all ray-tracing settings set to max and DLSS on, though performance varied wildly depending on the level of action or environment. These are all very playable frame rates, though the numbers tell me that you’ll need to make a few graphical tweaks to run these games smoothly. And possibly, games releasing in the next year or two might not fare as well as these ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMo9P2"&gt;I was expecting better performance from this chip in these tests since the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22244409/msi-gp66-leopard-gaming-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;MSI GP66 Leopard&lt;/a&gt;, also using the RTX 3070, tested with higher numbers. However, there’s a good reason for these results. &lt;a href="https://www.asus.com/Laptops/For-Gaming/TUF-Gaming/2021-ASUS-TUF-Dash-F15/techspec/"&gt;Asus explains on its product page &lt;/a&gt;that it set the chip’s clock speed and total graphics power to its lowest-possible power requirements, likely due to the laptop’s slim design and to maintain efficient performance. The TUF Dash F15’s GPU is clocked at 1,290Mhz (with a boost of up to 1,390MHz), and it has a total graphics power of 85W; this is compared to 1,620MHz and 130W in the GP66 Leopard, which is the highest-possible configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Raz2Kb"&gt;This kind of occurrence isn’t new. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;what is new (and the cause for some confusion) is Nvidia’s recently evolved Max-Q branding&lt;/a&gt;, which previously indicated the power discrepancy noted above by attaching “Max-Q” to the graphics chip’s name. It now exists instead to tell people that a laptop ships with a particular set of power and efficiency software tools, which this one does.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus TUF Dash F15" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ypUcBWbn719pm-KqjLiC-i0bOaI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22253379/cfaulkner_210114_4374_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A nice slim bezel, but one without an essential webcam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KX5zX6"&gt;In short, Asus’ new TUF Dash F15 includes a batch of specs that offer quite a bit of power when it’s needed and long-lasting efficiency when it’s not. But while the laptop provides a good balancing act and some relatively smooth gaming, I don’t think it’ll be perfect for everyone, mainly because it doesn’t really make the grade for many of the things we use laptops for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPH9fX"&gt;Not only is it unusable for video meetings (again, no webcam), but it probably won’t meet the bar for more heavy-duty tasks like video production or even a daily load of apps like the ones I use. And for gaming, this slim machine’s RTX 3070 isn’t as powerful as I would want for a long-term investment like this, especially because I’m not convinced it has the chops to brave the next wave of demanding games in a year or two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="1aHEZ9"&gt;I think there will probably soon be some machines containing these new components that can manage to please everyone. But this isn’t it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter resists Indian government’s orders to block protest accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OcekTka59RpIrGSNlq-oI51XQAE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68799738/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="51Yd1g"&gt;Twitter has refused an order from the Indian government to block certain Twitter accounts, including ones from politicians, activists, and journalists that were critical of the government’s response to a protest carried out in the country’s capital in January. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X92LrE"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_in/topics/company/2020/twitters-response-indian-government.html"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; on Wednesday, Twitter explained that, while it has started blocking some accounts, it has “not taken any action on accounts that consist of news media entities, journalists, activists, and politicians” because it believes doing so would “violate their fundamental right to free expression under Indian law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQPP6G"&gt;Starting at the beginning of February, the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology has sent orders to Twitter to block a number of accounts and hashtags connected to mass protests that have gripped the country. Many of the accounts &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/indian-government-block-critics?bfsource=relatedmanual"&gt;were critical of the Indian government and its response to the protests&lt;/a&gt;, including the official Twitter account of a prominent magazine &lt;em&gt;The Caravan&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/india-threatens-twitter-jail"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the government ordered the accounts suspended because they were “spreading misinformation about protests.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHO00w"&gt;Twitter initially &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/narendra-modi-media-social-media-india-9777a8af9a08aa6dac64e7f8ee227872"&gt;complied with the orders&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;a decision that drew significant criticism from civil rights groups. Some activists &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/india-threatens-twitter-jail"&gt;called the action censorship&lt;/a&gt;, while others &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/pranavdixit/indian-government-block-critics?bfsource=relatedmanual"&gt;accused of Twitter bowing to government overreach&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cd04UB"&gt;The protests have been building since November, and have resulted in violence, deaths, and internet blackouts &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/01/asia/india-internet-cut-farmers-intl-hnk/index.html"&gt;in parts of the country’s capital region&lt;/a&gt;. Tens of thousands of farmers have gone on strike over the course of the protests, according to &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-55793731"&gt;the BBC&lt;/a&gt;. The farmers &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/violence-erupts-at-indian-farmers-latest-protest-against-agricultural-law-changes-11611664480?mod=article_inline"&gt;are concerned about changes to agricultural laws&lt;/a&gt; in India that they fear could cut their income. Farming policy is a hugely important issue in India. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/01/asia/india-internet-cut-farmers-intl-hnk/index.html"&gt;According to CNN&lt;/a&gt;, 58 percent of the people in the country make their money primarily through agriculture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w18GB9"&gt;Twitter’s justification for unblocking the accounts, in opposition to government orders, is it believes keeping them inaccessible “would violate their fundamental right to free expression under Indian law.” In its blog post, Twitter says it “do[es] not believe that the actions [it has] directed to take are consistent with Indian law,” and that unblocking the accounts is consistent “with [its] principles of defending protected speech and freedom of expression.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP’s refreshed Pavilion x360 convertible laptops are optimized for streaming  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WmxvVXiA26OL4TrIvkUZVa27xYo=/0x78:2094x1474/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68799528/Screen_Shot_2021_02_10_at_2.01.44_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hLKeb7"&gt;HP announced today that it has refreshed its Pavilion x360 line of 14- and 15-inch convertible laptops, making them smaller, lighter, and more geared toward streaming entertainment. The 15-inch version is available today. With an 11th Gen Intel Core i3 processor, 8GB of memory, and 256GB of storage, it starts at $750. The 14-inch version will be available later this spring; no pricing was available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JU5IN6"&gt;In view of marketing to “Gen Z” during a streaming-heavy pandemic, HP says it has optimized the new line for entertainment. The bezels have been reduced — something you’ll likely appreciate when watching videos — and HP has included a simplified version of its Omen Gaming Hub, which allows you to customize your keystrokes, lighting, and other features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxOFDZ"&gt;The two new Pavilion x360 laptops also have a smaller footprint than before. For example, the 14-inch version has been shrunk down from a width of 221mm to 209mm, and its weight has dropped from 1.61kg (3.5 pounds) to 1.50kg (3.3 pounds). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7qZDwX"&gt;Other specs include an 11th Gen Intel Core i3/i5/i7 processor, storage up to 1TB, Intel Iris Xe graphics (in the i5 / i7 systems), and optional Wi-Fi 6. HP also is promoting the sustainability of the new computers, claiming they use post-consumer recycled and ocean-bound plastic and recycled aluminum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="givVVN"&gt;The 14-inch Pavilion x360 will come in three colors: “natural silver,” “warm gold” (premium only), and “spruce blue” (non-premium only). The 15-inch version comes in “natural silver.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4529DG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CJm2GwlbGF56gpDmNhJwIgppWKg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21989898/dseifert_201025_4263_0002.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Echo Dot with LED display&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30. Currently, you can buy the Echo Dot for $45 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K4FDPHZ?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=9435ae8f24eb1f1ce631fc393e5b63fc&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, you will also receive &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K4FDPHZ?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=1f8cec5c4de66d34faec62b689563081&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one Sengled Bluetooth bulb&lt;/a&gt; at no extra cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjABjU"&gt;Amazon is also selling a bundle that includes one &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Amazon-Smart-Charcoal/dp/B08GTWC9ZB?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=9d071f8b7fa655d000e04ef86f37a2ae&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Dot and an Amazon Smart Plug&lt;/a&gt; for $60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QG96M6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zX6pQw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot Kids Edition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The 4th-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;We have seen this product go down to $40. Right now, you can buy one for $55 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=62af1027db0f9e0b5d445aa7e24b9179&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502548%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The 4th-gen Amazon Echo smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the 4th-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;You can buy a fourth-gen Amazon Echo for $90 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KVFM2XM?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=361ad144f7f58ae894b621dc4e2bef89&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;; the retailer will also throw in two Philips Hue bulbs along with the Echo.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiNGuc"&gt;If you are looking for a pair of Amazon Echo devices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589613981487950" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is selling an Amazon Echo two-pack for $180&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $20 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for an Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the Echo Show 5 is one of two smart displays to consider. The Echo Show 5 includes a 5.5-inch display, making it easy to fit just about anywhere inside your home. Not only does the device include a built-in camera, but there’s also a physical shutter on the device, allowing you to block the camera’s view while keeping the always-on microphone active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsps6q"&gt;The Echo Show 5 usually costs $90 and we have seen it go down as low as $45. Right now, you can get it for $60 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZD7VZG?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4261fc6b8543b690542caa2dcbd1968d&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy the Echo Show 5 on Amazon, you can also receive a one-year subscription to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZD7VZG?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=6fde3082530c75af7d8ff189576c8fdf&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Food Network Kitchen&lt;/a&gt; at no extra cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJmJw1"&gt;Amazon also has a few bundles available at a discounted price; you can get an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089Q2RJH9?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=d2be23f6d66fe42b8ce0b1b1ba09793f&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and three months of Amazon Kids Plus&lt;/a&gt; for $61, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086P992GD?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=2fbb41aba454fb34ba8b518124dbff4e&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $70, and an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SW188FP?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=5e0b558c561fc5f089e3706f5558b213&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 plus an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $80. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVFAcO"&gt;Best Buy also has a few bundles currently available, including the $70 bundle with the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730445461281046110" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 features an eight-inch display; it costs $40 more than the Echo Show 5. When stacked up against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is its closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option for a few reasons: it has a slightly larger display, better speakers, and a camera, allowing you to use it as a video chatting device; this includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New North Dakota bill would force Apple to allow alternative app stores and payment systems</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q-d1yMVzQ6_Ag-Fic9CxIW_ZQKI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68799462/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TQFidg"&gt;A new bill introduced in the North Dakota Senate might have far-reaching consequences for app store operators. The bill, &lt;a href="https://www.legis.nd.gov/assembly/67-2021/documents/21-1044-01000.pdf"&gt;Senate Bill 2333&lt;/a&gt;, seeks to ban stores like Apple’s App Store and the Google Play Store from mandating developers only use those app stores and their respective in-app payment systems. It also bans retaliation against developers in the event they choose an alternative distribution channel or payment system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6YbDg"&gt;“The purpose of the bill is to level the playing field for app developers in North Dakota and protect customers from devastating, monopolistic fees imposed by big tech companies,” said Sen. Kyle Davison (R-Fargo), who introduced the bill before a Senate committee on Tuesday, told reporters in a press conference yesterday, as &lt;a href="https://bismarcktribune.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/north-dakota-senate-bill-targets-monopolistic-app-stores/article_dc491c88-97e0-54cd-beb2-5a26044cb97c.html"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Bismarck Tribune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Davison said the 30 percent fee imposed on app developers who sell software through Apple and Google’s marketplaces has the effect of “raising prices and limiting choices for consumers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zmLQNZ"&gt;The bill is quite simple and lays out three key restrictions for any “digital application distribution platform” that exceeds $10 million in annual revenue. That means an app store cannot: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="KrRc8v"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;“Require a developer to use a digital application distribution platform or digital transaction platform as the exclusive mode of distributing a digital product.”&lt;/strong&gt; That would likely mean that companies like Apple would have to allow app purchases outside a single locked-down store.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xvC9Ot"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;“Require a developer to use an in-application payment system as the exclusive mode of accepting payment from a user to download a software application or purchase a digital or physical product through a software application.”&lt;/strong&gt; This would allow an iOS version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, for instance, to process in-app payments through Epic instead of Apple’s system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JGsDGf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Retaliate against a developer for choosing to use an alternative application store or in-application payment system.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="Femqby"&gt;As a state bill, the proposed legislation would only affect the operation of businesses like the App Store within North Dakota. But the sweeping changes the bill calls for would likely require companies like Apple to make substantial platform-level changes that could affect software distribution on a national scale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U9Tusp"&gt;The use of alternative in-app payment methods is at the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;heart of an ongoing legal battle&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;em&gt;Fornite &lt;/em&gt;developer Epic Games and both Apple and Google, after &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;was removed from the App Store and Play Store in August of last year for introducing its own payment processing tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijA1wq"&gt;Epic purposefully engineered its &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;update to bypass the 30 percent cut of all in-app purchases required by Apple and Google as a form of protest, both to the standard 30 percent cut and specifically Apple’s App Store rules that bar third-party app stores from the iPhone. (Google does allow Android users to sideload third-party software and for developers to create alternative app stores for distributing software, though it does make doing so difficult.) Epic is now suing both companies for alleged antitrust violations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3ti9F9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The purpose of the bill is to level the playing field for app developers.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LCbdc1"&gt;The Epic case is just one part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506682/google-apple-amazon-facebook-antitrust-report-house-judiciary"&gt;growing antitrust movement in the US that’s taken aim at Big Tech&lt;/a&gt;. Every one of the major US tech companies, save Microsoft, is currently under increased antitrust scrutiny from the US Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, as well as state attorneys general, with various levels of investigations underway. While Apple is not under formal investigation, CEO Tim Cook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/29/21335706/antitrust-hearing-highlights-facebook-google-amazon-apple-congress-testimony"&gt;testified this past summer&lt;/a&gt; before the Senate Judiciary Committee during its tech antitrust hearing. Meanwhile, the European Commission has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21292651/apple-eu-antitrust-investigation-app-store-apple-pay"&gt;two ongoing antitrust investigations&lt;/a&gt; into Apple’s App Store and Apple Pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4f3J3m"&gt;Apple has already testified against North Dakota’s new bill in a hearing on Tuesday with North Dakota’s Senate Industry, Business and Labor Committee. Apple’s Erik Neuenschwander, its chief privacy engineer, told the committee the bill “threatens to destroy iPhone as you know it” and that it would “undermine the privacy, security, safety, and performance that’s built into iPhone by design,” according to the &lt;em&gt;Bismarck Tribune&lt;/em&gt;. “Simply put, we work hard to keep bad apps out of the App Store; (the bill) could require us to let them in.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y1XOt5"&gt;Basecamp co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson, who attended the hearing and testified in favor of the bill, criticized Apple for exaggerating the threat the bill poses to its business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GwInFj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;North Dakota's SB 2333 is the first real, concrete legislative proposal I've seen that actually gives me hope that tech monopolies aren't going to rule the world forever. Fargo or Bismarck sound like wonderful places to set up shop under a shield against abuse   &lt;/p&gt;— DHH (@dhh) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1359203441827078145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fNPc52"&gt;Hansson has become a vocal critic of Apple’s App Store policies, following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293419/hey-apple-rejection-ios-app-store-dhh-gangsters-antitrust"&gt;showdown his company had with Apple&lt;/a&gt; last summer over Basecamp’s Hey email client. The disagreement centered on the functions of the Hey iOS email app, and Hansson and Basecamp CEO Jason Fried complained that the situation was emblematic of Apple’s inconsistently applied rules and the lengths the company goes to ensure developers are not sidestepping the 30 percent cut mandate. Although Apple and Basecamp &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;reached a compromise&lt;/a&gt;, Hansson has since called for congressional action, as well as stronger antitrust regulation, to try to force Apple to alter its policies and to reign in Big Tech at large. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="APyX5i"&gt;In written testimony Hansson prepared prior to the hearing, he laid out his case for Senate Bill 2333. “After the recitals, the 17 lines of SB 2333 read like music. Written in a language I can understand without hiring counsel to parse it for me. It almost seems too good to be true! But I sincerely hope that it is not,” he wrote in his testimony, which he later &lt;a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/testimony-before-the-north-dakota-senate-industry-business-and-labor-committee/"&gt;released online&lt;/a&gt;. “That you will listen to the small software developers from all over the country, who are tired of being bullied and shaken down by a handful of big tech monopolists out of Seattle and Silicon Valley.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmdyQn"&gt;Hansson says the US needs a “fair digital marketplace free of monopoly abuse” and that “no single change will have a greater impact than giving small software makers like us a choice when it comes to in-app payment systems, and protection from retaliation, if we refuse the onerous deal the monopolists are offering.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayiay1"&gt;Chairman Sen. Jerry Klein (R-Fessenden) said during the committee hearing that “there’s still some mulling to be done” and that no action would be taken on the bill as of yet. Neither Apple nor Google have immediately responded to requests for comment for this story. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google is teasing us with dark mode for desktop search</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mqA596MFJlwA7s9DhGhXlNI2CJM=/0x3:1147x768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68799457/capture.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P2C9Nx"&gt;Google appears to be rolling out a dark mode for desktop search, but only some people have it right now. If the change has rolled out to you and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/22/18270975/how-to-dark-mode-iphone-android-mac-windows-xbox-ps4-nintendo-switch"&gt;your system is set to dark mode&lt;/a&gt;, the background of Google’s search pages will be a very dark gray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3AVOV5"&gt;Here’s an example of what the new dark mode looks like:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A8iD1eb17R-1uVbKpkD6biNdQVw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22294957/capture__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ct0rJV"&gt;A couple of &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers had their search pages automatically switch to dark mode, and &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/10/google-search-dark-mode-on-desktop-will-be-able-to-match-your-system-theme/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and some &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ruchernchong/status/1359537637049028611"&gt;people&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/olearycrew/status/1359525437643362305"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mkgirlnextdoor/status/1359522898067750913"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; have seen the new dark mode, too. But it doesn’t seem to be something that everyone has just yet. Google’s search pages are still white for me, for example, even though I have dark mode turned on right now on macOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s62hQy"&gt;This isn’t the first time a desktop search dark mode has appeared: &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reported &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/29/google-search-dark-mode-web/"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt; that some people were seeing dark mode then. It’s unclear if what people are seeing now is some kind of test or a full rollout, so there’s always a chance that Google could turn dark mode back off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lqJoJW"&gt;Google didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CopNrs"&gt;If you’re a dark mode fan, it’s been an eventful few days. Changes to Twitter’s dark mode caught some people unawares last week when their dark mode unexpectedly got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22265306/twitter-dark-mode-dim-lights-out-black-darker-light-settings"&gt;even darker&lt;/a&gt;. And Microsoft is now testing changes to Word to make &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274181/microsoft-word-dark-mode-canvas-update-beta"&gt;entire documents dark&lt;/a&gt; when you’re using dark mode.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is reportedly working on a Clubhouse copy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BAYeAVXWxgZm8J5boQeVRA4jPGo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68799406/acastro_180522_facebook_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CzhMGo"&gt;Facebook, a company known for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22216692/facebook-nearby-feature-copied-italian-court-app-faround"&gt;ripping its ideas&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21136898/facebook-pinterest-photo-sharing-app"&gt;competitors&lt;/a&gt;, has reportedly set its sights on social audio. &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/10/technology/facebook-building-product-clubhouse.html"&gt;reports today&lt;/a&gt; that the company is working on a copycat of Clubhouse, the buzzy invite-only social audio startup. The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reports the product is in the “early stages of development,” so it’s unclear if and when it might launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrG4Uw"&gt;The news comes only &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-on-clubhouse-2021-2"&gt;five days after&lt;/a&gt; CEO Mark Zuckerberg joined Clubhouse and participated in a room to talk about the future of augmented and virtual reality. His presence on the app was shocking, given it’s a new social network, so the fact that Facebook might now be cloning Clubhouse is no surprise. The company has already done so with multiple other apps, including, most infamously, Stories, which it took from Snapchat, and Reels, its TikTok competitor that launched last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFxjZV"&gt;Twitter is also working on a Clubhouse competitor called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22187490/twitter-spaces-test-voice-chat-rooms"&gt;Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, which is in beta at the moment. Its team &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/04/twitter-acquires-social-podcasting-app-breaker-team-to-help-build-twitter-spaces/"&gt;acquired&lt;/a&gt; social podcasting company Breaker, seemingly for its expertise in social audio, to help beef up its efforts. Meanwhile, Mark Cuban is also at work on a live audio app called Fireside, which &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;reported on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22272148/mark-cuban-fireside-podcast-app-launch-creator-conversations"&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;. Clearly, lots of people in tech think audio will be an important format for communicating in the future, and they’re rapidly trying to get in on it before the trend dies out.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V9cZCU"&gt;Apple AirPods are among the most popular headphones on the market. They’re compact, easy to pair with your devices, and offer reliable connectivity, which can sometimes be a problem with truly wireless earphones. So there’s a chance that you might be looking for a deal on them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OR97R2"&gt;Surprisingly, they’re no stranger to the occasional price cut. There are often discounts on even the more expensive AirPods Pro, which offers noise cancellation and better sound than the standard second-generation model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;We’ll run through all three of the current models below, including the standard AirPods, the more expensive AirPods that include a wireless charging case, and finally, the AirPods Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZuVjFm"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Apple AirPods 2 review: even more wireless|63428" data-volume-uuid="c798b260f" data-volume-id="63428" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-115" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AirPods&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="R1mQdI"&gt;These are Apple’s entry-level wireless earbuds. They are a reliable pair of wireless earbuds with a one-size-fits-most design. The AirPods usually retail for $160, which is not a bad price, but this model frequently gets discounted.  You can currently find Apple’s most affordable AirPods for $110 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, or for $130 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731722633239801630" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ImEUfP"&gt;The AirPods with wireless charging case are identical in every way to the standard AirPods, save for one: their charging case can be charged on a Qi wireless pad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNUWv"&gt;You’ll need to provide your own wireless charging pad to take advantage of this feature (if you have no use for it, just get the more affordable option above), but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;even the best ones are fairly inexpensive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glqkTs"&gt;Most of the time you can find this version for less than Apple’s sticker price of $199, but keep a lookout for deals that bring the price down to $160 or below. You can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=4781ccd9dac6fb8bf9e60c657cd3fbba&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/979838/2092?sharedid=verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="s9Ofwq"&gt;Apple’s high-end truly wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, have better sound quality than the other models described above, include noise cancellation, and now support Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. We think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;they’re the best wireless earbuds that iPhone owners&lt;/a&gt; can buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yaMGwU"&gt;The AirPods Pro are frequently available for less than their $249 retail price, and in fact, sometimes drop down to $200 and lower. Right now, if you don’t mind buying refurbished, they are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730154636955201273" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$190 at Best Buy (Geek Squad Certified)&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Google now pays 450 sites to bring you free news, including some paywalled stories</title>

  &lt;p id="UqTREX"&gt;Google’s News Showcase, a program wherein the search giant pays to curate news content from publishers, has launched in the UK and Argentina. &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/news/google-news-showcase-launches-uk"&gt;In the UK&lt;/a&gt;, the service covers over 120 publications, while &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/news/google-news-showcase-launches-argentina-/"&gt;40 Argentinian publications&lt;/a&gt; have signed up. For readers, the service includes the ability to access &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22149118/googles-news-showcase-free-paywall-access"&gt;select paywalled content for free&lt;/a&gt;. News Showcase launched in &lt;a href="https://blog.google/outreach-initiatives/google-news-initiative/google-news-showcase/"&gt;Germany and Brazil&lt;/a&gt; last year, and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/05/google-launches-news-showcase-in-australia-in-sign-of-compromise-over-media-code"&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt; last week, and now includes content from over 450 publications worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bnt5q5"&gt;In the UK, publications available through the service include &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, the&lt;em&gt; Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Independent&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;New Statesman&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt;, while Argentinian publications include &lt;em&gt;Clarín&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;La Nación&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Perfil&lt;/em&gt;. An &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/australia/answering-your-top-questions-about-google-news-showcase/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28The+Keyword+%7C+Official+Google+Blog%29#jump-content:~:text=Payments%20are%20made%20for%20the%20publishers%E2%80%99,is%20on%20top%20of%20that%20fee."&gt;FAQ from Google&lt;/a&gt; notes that publishers are paid a monthly fee to curate news stories for the service, as well as for access to paywalled content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pidFWT"&gt;News Showcase is available in the Google News app on iOS, Android, and mobile web, as well as Discover on iOS. On select Android phones, like Google Pixel devices, Discover is available by swiping to the left on the home screen. The interface shows lists of articles from each publication, which you can tap to read in full. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XB5saf"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;More than 120 publications in the U.K. will start curating content for News Showcase, many of them local newspapers that do not have the same resources that many larger, national papers have to invest in their digital transformation. 2/ &lt;a href="https://t.co/CV3mFa2QUK"&gt;https://t.co/CV3mFa2QUK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/buDHqtiA9N"&gt;pic.twitter.com/buDHqtiA9N&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Google News Initiative (@GoogleNewsInit) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleNewsInit/status/1359543094106984453?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6Xwz5z"&gt;Last week, Google News Showcase launched in Australia, a country where the company is currently locking horns with lawmakers over new rules &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/19/21227263/australia-facebook-google-ad-revenue-media-coronavirus-economy"&gt;that could force it&lt;/a&gt; to pay news publishers for their content. Google recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243468/google-threatens-to-remove-its-search-engine-from-australia-if-new-law-goes-into-effect"&gt;threatened to pull its search engine&lt;/a&gt; from the country if the News Media Bargaining Code goes into effect. Last week, Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he’d held “&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2021/feb/04/scott-morrison-has-constructive-talks-with-google-boss-on-news-media-code"&gt;constructive&lt;/a&gt;” talks with Google CEO Sundar Pichai over the new rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUV1ob"&gt;The situation means that although seven Australian publishers have joined the program, covering over 25 publications, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/05/google-launches-news-showcase-in-australia-in-sign-of-compromise-over-media-code"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that one outlet, Nine, chose not to negotiate with Google until the new code is brought in. In &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/australia/top-questions-news-code/#jump-content:~:text=Google%20News%20Showcase%20would%20be%20subject,an%20arbitrator%20to%20resolve%20any%20disagreements."&gt;an FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, Google says it believes News Showcase should be compatible with the new rules, since publishers are free to enter into arbitration if they don’t like Google’s News Showcase deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VWdiWF"&gt;Facebook has a similar news initiative that involves paying publishers to license their content in the form of the News tab, a section of the service that includes a mix of curated and personalized news stories. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/9/21285656/facebook-news-tab-section-launch-us-local-publishers-partnership"&gt;launching in the US&lt;/a&gt;, the tab recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248814/facebook-news-uk-launch-articles-tab-curated"&gt;arrived in the UK&lt;/a&gt;. Similar to Google News Showcase, the service involves Facebook paying select publishers to license content, including some that would normally be paywalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G9P66I"&gt;Beyond the UK and Argentina, Google says it’s also readying to launch News Showcase in France, Canada, and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pk7ndD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
