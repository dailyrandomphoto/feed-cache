    <title>Asus Zenfone 8 Flip leak pairs flipping cameras with Snapdragon 888</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CCi4BG0vVvAlij763OVfUNK4bEs=/0x0:1296x864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245135/asus_zenfone_8_flip_image_feat.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Zenfone 8 Flip.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/asus-zenfone-8-flip-specifications-renders-exclusive/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IDv02h"&gt;Asus’s successor to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21400709/asus-zenfone-7-flipping-triple-camera-zoom-ultrawide-battery-90hz-oled-display"&gt;last year’s Zenfone 7&lt;/a&gt; has leaked online, pointing to a return for the phones’ flipping camera array on May 12th. Specs and images of two upcoming devices — the Zenfone 8 and Zenfone 8 Flip — have been &lt;a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/asus-zenfone-8-flip-specifications-renders-exclusive/"&gt;published by &lt;em&gt;91Mobiles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, based on information provided by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ishanagarwal24/status/1389987244295950354"&gt;leaker Ishan Agarwal&lt;/a&gt;. As its name suggests, the 8 Flip has three cameras built into a mechanical flipping mechanism that rotates them over the top edge of the display to take selfies, while the 8 has two rear cameras in a more standard rectangular camera bump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MV8F8G"&gt;From the leaks, the Zenfone 8 Flip appears to be a comparatively minor spec bump compared to last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21408307/asus-zenfone-7-pro-review"&gt;Zenfone 7 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. It’s got a Snapdragon 888 processor rather than a Snapdragon 865 Plus, but the new model has the same massive 5,000mAH battery, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of internal storage. The 1080p OLED display is still notchless thanks to the flipping cameras, still 6.67-inches in size, and still 90Hz, according to the leak. It also reportedly weighs the same at 230 grams, which could mean another heavy device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6Ffrdn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Full Specs &amp;amp; Renders of the ASUS Zenfone 8 &amp;amp; Zenfone 8 Flip, launching on May 12&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Zenfone 8 is a compact smartphone with 5.92" screen size while th 8 Flip has a 6.67" AMOLED Display.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Both feature Snapdragon 888 &amp;amp; 64MP Main Camera.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Please link &amp;amp; credit: &lt;a href="https://t.co/9ZO803tRlk"&gt;https://t.co/9ZO803tRlk&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/MCc2p5ISaK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/MCc2p5ISaK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ishan Agarwal (@ishanagarwal24) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ishanagarwal24/status/1389987244295950354?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5rn2rP"&gt;The cameras also appear similar, with one key difference. While last year’s Zenfone 7 Pro had a 64 megapixel main camera paired with a 8 megapixel telephoto and 12 megapixel ultrawide, the new 8 Flip will apparently swap out the ultrawide for a 12 megapixel macro. We generally find ultrawide cameras much more useful than macro cameras on phones, making this an unfortunate change if accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Zenfone 8.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aOE2WZ"&gt;Meanwhile, the standard Zenfone 8 is a much more traditional device, according to the leak. It’ll apparently have a smaller 5.92-inch 1080p display, but internally there’s the same Snapdragon 888 processor, and 8GB of RAM, albeit with a smaller 4,000 mAh battery and 128GB of internal storage. It’ll also reportedly come with one less rear-facing camera since it lacks the telephoto of the 8 Flip. That said, it should have the same number of cameras overall thanks to its separate hole-punch selfie camera on the front. It’s also fitted with an increasingly rare headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RzXUYu"&gt;No details were given on the phones’ pricing or release dates, but with a launch event reportedly coming next week, we won’t have long to wait for official information.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why the bad iPhone web app experience keeps coming up in Epic v. Apple</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OIbeBrT5UyAXI-cns6znc8cu6Eo=/9x0:2631x1748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245096/xcloudiphone.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Safari just doesn’t support key features — and Safari’s the only option&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="8gwpz8"&gt;Something keeps coming up at the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial as a potential alternative for getting &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; on the iPhone: web apps. It’s an intriguing idea, as web apps are able to do surprisingly complex things: just look at a Chromebook or even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22393793/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-iphone-ipad-hands-on"&gt;game streaming services on the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. But potential is far from reality, because the ability for web apps to look, feel, and perform as well as native apps on iOS is severely limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M9Merj"&gt;These web apps aren’t the preferred way for consumers or developers to use or create apps on the iPhone, either. But Apple has forced companies like Microsoft and Nvidia to use web apps, instead of native ones available in the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yylJtA"&gt;Though the term itself hasn’t really come up explicitly, what’s being discussed are Progressive Web Apps, or PWAs. If you’re unfamiliar, think of them as slightly more advanced web apps that you can “install” directly from your web browser on to your home screen. Google has been pushing the idea (though support for PWAs on its own platforms is a little mixed), and some companies like Microsoft and Twitter have wholeheartedly embraced PWAs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUwtju"&gt;Not Apple, though. There are a variety of reasons for that — ranging from genuine concern about giving web pages too much access to device hardware to the simple fact that even Apple can’t do everything. There’s also the suspicion that Apple is deliberately dragging its feet on support for features that make PWAs better as a way to drive developers to its App Store instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wRg3ygALY-Q38sy-_H2NB_ZyQDU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10437351/fortniteiphonex.JPG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite running on an iPhone before its removal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J19AAK"&gt;But the App Store has restrictions that aren’t tenable for some developers. That’s the whole crux of this trial for Epic, after all. On the stand, a Microsoft executive detailed the company’s struggles to get its xCloud game streaming service onto iOS. Lori Wright, VP of Xbox business development at Microsoft, revealed the company spent around four months talking to Apple to try and get xCloud launched as a native app. Apple seemed, initially open to the idea of letting Microsoft use the same model as Netflix or Audible. But Apple changed its mind and forced Microsoft, Nvidia, and others to list cloud games as separate apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PCMbLT"&gt;Submitting Xbox games one-by-one was simply a nonstarter for Microsoft, so it resorted to making a web app. In addition to the technical hurdles a web app involves, it also introduces a discoverability issue. Users simply aren’t used to installing apps from the web on their iPhones. Apple has effectively trained everybody that if they want an app, they go to the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f0etUj"&gt;Wright essentially admitted that the only reason Microsoft is releasing Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) as a web app is because Apple’s terms on the App Store are too onerous. “People don’t play games through the browser on iPhone,” said Wright, but “it was our only outcome in order to reach mobile users on iOS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vXkjIF"&gt;Even the judge in the case seemed confused by Apple’s rule, which says that services that stream movies can offer them all in a single app but services that stream games have to separate each game for individual listing and review. “I can use Netflix with a native app and I can see lots of different movies or TV shows or whatever. Is it that you didn’t want to use a subscription model?” Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers asked at one point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Uu-KLuKdNnlK8sa1T0vd91UANM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16334298/microsoft_xcloud_e3_2019_1.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple has forced Microsoft and others to head to the web for gaming streaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U2sTjH"&gt;But back to those technical hurdles: they’re tall, numerous, and can be blamed both on the nature of web apps and Apple’s own decisions. Safari on the iPhone only &lt;em&gt;recently&lt;/em&gt; became capable of supporting a service like Xbox Cloud Gaming via specific controller support. Until then, that sort of thing was on the list of features Apple was reticent to include in Safari. There are legitimate reasons to block things like Bluetooth access from web apps, including fingerprinting for tracking, but it was getting harder to justify and Apple needed some kind of escape valve as pressure mounted to support cloud gaming services. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FYerIx"&gt;Google software engineer Alex Russell recently &lt;a href="https://infrequently.org/2021/04/progress-delayed/"&gt;published a very comprehensive list of all the features that Safari on iOS doesn’t support yet&lt;/a&gt; — and it’s a long list. For PWAs to truly be a viable alternative to App Store apps, there are at least a few of these features that need to be enabled. The inability to send push notifications via a web app, for example, is particularly galling as it’s already possible on Safari on macOS. An app that can’t send notifications is simply not competitive with an app that can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="gEm2RS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Grant is touching on some more of the benefits to native versus web apps; push notifications and ARKit both come up. The former is another example of Apple letting native apps reduce friction points — Epic needs to convince the judge these smaller features are meaningful.&lt;/p&gt;— Adi Robertson (@thedextriarchy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1390045337000284161?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h9L1lz"&gt;As Russell notes, his “interests and biases are plain” as a Google engineer. But it doesn’t change the fact that there are many things that a PWA cannot do on the iPhone that a developer like Epic would need to support Fortnite as a web app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EQVkX"&gt;“Native [iPhone] apps would have access to a far wider range of APIs than web apps,” explained Andrew Grant, engineering fellow at Epic Games, during the trial. “Access to things like push notifications, to Siri, to health data, and augmented reality features” are also limited to native apps, said Grant. Web apps also have to be far smaller than native apps, and are capped at about 50MB in size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jl61s4"&gt;Plus, from a simple performance perspective, web apps have more overhead than native apps — and lack access to Apple APIs that can speed up games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0ncWG"&gt;In fact, this was a sticking point for a lot of the questioning of an Nvidia employee. Nvidia, like Microsoft, has been trying to get its GeForce Now cloud gaming service into the App Store, but has faced the same restrictions that Microsoft is struggling with. Nvidia director of product management Aashish Patel spent a lot of time answering questions around latency in a browser and the benefits of using native apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZgVIj"&gt;“There are less controls over the streaming, so you could argue in some ways it’s worse,” than a native app, said Patel. Developers are also locked into using the video codecs provided in Safari on iOS, whereas they could use alternatives that might be better at handling latency inside a native iOS app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5THJwULmAlKJTxhxmhw3tU-Irjc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19206401/akrales_190914_3666_0259.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All iOS browsers run the same WebKit engine underneath.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KtWlda"&gt;All of this is compounded by yet another Apple policy: no third party browser engines. You can install apps like Chrome, Firefox, Brave, DuckDuckGo, and others on the iPhone — but fundamentally they’re all just skins on top of Apple’s Webkit engine. That means that Apple’s decisions on what web features to support on Safari are final. If Apple were to find a way to be comfortable letting competing web browsers run their own browser engines, a lot of this tension would dissipate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEbgNQ"&gt;As it relates to &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt;, a lot of this PWA discussion isn’t germane to the fundamental arguments in the case. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; as a PWA would necessarily be a streaming app instead of a native game and that introduces an entirely different set of compromises. Which is why it’s so fascinating to see Apple’s lawyers float web apps as a potential solution — because web apps on the iPhone are famously more limited than they are on other platforms, including even Apple’s macOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SC0v1r"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The human-readable versus machine-readable code bit is back now — Grant is talking about how web apps don’t go through the same kind of compilation process that increases processing efficiency, yet another reason they’re not as good as native apps.&lt;/p&gt;— Adi Robertson (@thedextriarchy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thedextriarchy/status/1390047726549749760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="HcaeCs"&gt;Even if every single browser feature was available on mobile Safari or even if Apple allowed alternative browser engines on the iPhone, a web app will never match the performance of a native app. At the end of the day, though, all the discussion of web apps in the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; case highlight the limitations of Apple’s App Store policies, not PWAs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is finally ditching its Windows 95-era icons</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/duBv9J2vh3DTpDWsqSkCF6MaQ2Y=/170x0:1430x840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69245027/Windows_10_Sun_Valley_refresh.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5R89km"&gt;Microsoft is finally preparing to refresh its Windows 95-era icons. The software giant has been slowly improving the icons it uses in Windows 10, as part of a “sweeping visual rejuvenation” planned for later this year. We saw a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348639/microsoft-windows-10-file-explorer-new-icons-system-update"&gt;number of new system icons back in March&lt;/a&gt;, with new File Explorer, folder, Recycle Bin, disk drive icons, and more. Microsoft is now planning to refresh the Windows 95-era icons you still sometimes come across in Windows 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLgwiy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2021/05/06/windows-10-sun-valley-update-also-refreshes-icons-in-shell32/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Latest &lt;/em&gt;has spotted&lt;/a&gt; new icons for the hibernation mode, networking, memory, floppy drives, and much more as part of the shell32.dll file in preview versions of Windows 10. This DLL is a key part of the Windows Shell, which surfaces icons in a variety of dialog boxes throughout the operating system. It’s also a big reason why Windows icons have been so inconsistent throughout the years. Microsoft has often modernized other parts of the OS only for an older app to throw you into a dialog box with Windows 95-era icons from shell32.dll.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iFM30IRP6ii4m4qHakyhlVYZyzs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22495516/Windows_Shell32_icons.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Windows Latest&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New vs. old Windows 95-era icons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PoqXjv"&gt;Hopefully this also means Windows will never ask you for a floppy disk drive when you dig into Device Manager to update a driver. That era of Windows, along with these old icons, has been well and truly over for more than a decade now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jXDOB"&gt;All of this work to improve the consistency of Windows is part of Microsoft’s design overhaul to Windows 10, codenamed Sun Valley. The visual changes are expected to appear in the Windows 10 21H2 update that should arrive in October. Microsoft has not officially detailed its Sun Valley work, but a job listing earlier this year teased a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212817/microsoft-windows-10-visual-changes-update-sun-valley-2021"&gt;sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XVywzI"&gt;Microsoft has so far revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313037/microsoft-windows-10-new-system-icons-ui-overhaul-sun-valley"&gt;new system icons&lt;/a&gt; for Windows 10, alongside File Explorer icon improvements, and more colorful &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145157/microsoft-windows-10-new-icons-modern-release-update-apps"&gt;Windows 10 icons&lt;/a&gt; that appeared last year. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheXamlGuy/status/1385334869073567749"&gt;Rounded corners&lt;/a&gt; will also be a big part of Sun Valley, alongside changes to built-in apps and the Start menu. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHhIOJ"&gt;We’re expecting to hear more about Sun Valley at Microsoft’s Build conference later this month, or as part a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261997/microsoft-news-events-gaming-cloud-windows"&gt;dedicated Windows news event&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google expects most staff to spend about three days per week in the office post-pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nKNe_r6JP-hBMGcfwQ_OPCu5LLc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69244868/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JJnYOp"&gt;Google expects 60 percent of its approximately 140,000 global employees to spend around three days in the office per week post-pandemic. The policy was announced in a company-wide memo by CEO Sundar Pichai, which was later published as a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/inside-google/life-at-google/hybrid-approach-work/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1390110202435801089"&gt;series of tweets&lt;/a&gt;. While Pichai said a majority of employees will come into the office “a few days a week,” 20 percent are expected to work from home permanently, with another 20 percent working from new office locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUxTvb"&gt;The search giant is the latest tech company to announce big shifts to its post-pandemic working culture. Microsoft will allow employees to freely work from home for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21508964/microsoft-remote-work-from-home-covid-19-coronavirus"&gt;up to 50 percent of the working week&lt;/a&gt;, or to work remotely on a permanent basis with their manager’s approval. Meanwhile Salesforce, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21719666/salesforce-slack-acquisition-purchase-announced"&gt;owner of Slack&lt;/a&gt;, has declared that the “9-to-5 workday is dead,” with the majority of its employees coming into the office between one and three days a week. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21256060/twitter-employees-work-from-home-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/facebook/2020/5/21/21265699/facebook-remote-work-shift-workforce-permanent-covid-19-mark-zuckerberg-interview"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt; have announced similar plans to let employees work from home or work remotely indefinitely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Qknj0n"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;...spending time in another city for part of the year, or even moving there permanently. Google’s future workplace will have room for all of these possibilities. We’re moving to a hybrid work week with most Googlers in the office approximately 3 days a week.&lt;/p&gt;— Sundar Pichai (@sundarpichai) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sundarpichai/status/1390110318538366976?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lPQddi"&gt;While Google says the majority of its employees will work from the office around three days a week, it also says it’ll make it easier for employees to switch between offices or to work fully remotely. Employees will be able to apply to move offices with their manager’s approval, or to work entirely remotely. Meanwhile, a “work-from-anywhere weeks” policy will let Googlers temporarily work from places outside their main office for up to four weeks a year. Pichai says Google will provide more details on the changes by mid-June, around the same time it’s introducing process to allow employees to request office moves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hLnt5t"&gt;Pichai’s memo also briefly mentions the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/4/30/22411593/google-post-pandemic-office-plans-inflatable-robot-walls"&gt;experiments with future hybrid workplaces&lt;/a&gt;. A recent &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/30/technology/google-back-to-office-workers.html"&gt;report in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; outlined some of the design elements being explored, which include inflatable robot walls to create temporary divides between open plan desks, and a “fabric-based overhead air duct system” that can be unzipped and moved over a weekend to create new seating arrangements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ecRXx"&gt;Google’s employees across North America, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa were told to work from home &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/10/21173994/google-coronavirus-north-american-employees-work-from-home-sick-leave-fund"&gt;last March&lt;/a&gt; in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Last month, the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360713/google-office-reopening-april-covid-19"&gt;US offices opened on a limited basis&lt;/a&gt;, with employees asked to follow safety guidelines like wearing masks and practicing social distancing if they wanted to come in. In his memo, Pichai says that in places where Google has opened its offices almost 60 percent of employees have chosen to come back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5qCdQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Nintendo Switch can’t be stopped</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo Switch sales fuel full year profits. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PcXptX"&gt;Nintendo Switch sales were up 44 percent percent from January to March compared to the same pandemic-impaired quarter from a year earlier. &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/210506e.pdf"&gt;Today’s numbers&lt;/a&gt; bring total Switch sales to 28.83 million for the fiscal year, up 37 percent compared to the 21 million Switch consoles the company shipped the year prior, and beating the company’s own revised forecast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="88Dd9H"&gt;In February, Nintendo raised its annual forecast to 26.5 million Switch units for the fiscal year ending March 31st on the strength of increased demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, a number that had already been raised from 19 million units at the start of the year. The lifetime-to-date sales figure now stands at 84.59 million Switch units shipped worldwide since its launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/12/14237060/nintendo-switch-console-launch-date-price-announced"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, creeping up on the Wii console’s 101.63 million lifetime sales mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rlIgWD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Game sales for the year also spiked by 37 percent&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S14mA7"&gt;Game sales for the year also spiked by 37 percent, selling 230.88 million units compared to 168.72 million units in the previous fiscal year, led by &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; with 20.85 million units sold. Other notables were &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&lt;/em&gt; (10.62 million units), &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D All-Sta&lt;/em&gt;r (9.01 million units), and &lt;em&gt;Ring Fit Adventure&lt;/em&gt; (7.38 million units). Nintendo claimed 36 million-seller titles during the fiscal year, 22 from Nintendo and 14 by other publishers. Newly released &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury &lt;/em&gt;sold&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;5.59 million units.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hpoKgk"&gt;Looking forward, Nintendo is planning to release a blue Switch Lite in May. The company is also preparing global launches for additional first-party software titles, including &lt;em&gt;Miitopia&lt;/em&gt; in May, &lt;em&gt;Mario Golf: Super Rush &lt;/em&gt;in June, and&lt;em&gt; The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD&lt;/em&gt; in July. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Brilliant Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Shining Pearl&lt;/em&gt; are planned for late 2021. Nintendo says that it’s working with Niantic “to develop a new application featuring Pikmin for smart devices” that will be released in the second half of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqyLfz"&gt;Nintendo’s full-year revenue increased to 1.76 trillion yen, up 35 percent compared to the 1.3 trillion yen earned last year, netting a full-year profit of 480.3 billion yen (about $4.4 billion). The company is forecasting sales of 1.6 trillion yen against 25.5 million Switch consoles for the year ending March 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wmoue7"&gt;Nintendo is rumored to be working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22312559/new-nintendo-switch-oled-screen-holiday-release-report"&gt;a new Switch with 4K output&lt;/a&gt; that will better compete with more powerful Xbox and PlayStation consoles. It’s said to have a larger 7-inch 720p OLED panel built by Samsung that’s set to enter mass production in June for July assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cowboy’s improved C4 electric bike launches alongside first step-through model</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M7tPi7EiXYe1s94kZpUPIJ5CaWg=/286x0:2086x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69244693/Lead_Image_bright.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cowboy 4 (left) next to step-through Cowboy 4 ST.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Cowboy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s6pL7z"&gt;Cowboy, maker of some of our favorite pedal-assisted electric bikes, is back with two new models for 2021. The &lt;a href="https://cowboy.com/products/e-bike-cowboy-4"&gt;Cowboy 4&lt;/a&gt; is a complete overhaul to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21454206/cowboy-3-electric-bike-review-price-features"&gt;last year’s Cowboy 3&lt;/a&gt; while the &lt;a href="https://cowboy.com/products/e-bike-cowboy-4?variant=39314404606091"&gt;Cowboy 4 ST&lt;/a&gt; features the company’s first step-through frame. Both bikes benefit from a new powertrain with 50 percent more torque than last year’s C3 as well as a new integrated “cockpit” with Quadlock mount that wirelessly charges your phone as you ride. But that’s just a start to the bevy of tweaks both big and small that Cowboy hopes will justify a price tag of €2,490 / £2,290 (about $3,000 USD) when the bikes ship in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MUhial"&gt;I had a chance to ride near final pre-production versions of the Cowboy 4 and Cowboy 4 ST alongside Adrien Roose, co-founder and CEO of Brussels-based Cowboy. While the two bikes share the same specs, the rides couldn’t be anymore different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ol77W2"&gt;“We’ve stayed true to our initial vision of providing a better alternative to the car — in form and function — and with the Cowboy 4 it’s a shift we will accelerate and lead,” said Roose in a press statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tWsT5va8wM_F3eVd-vB-YRRbi0Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22487957/verge_DSC_4328_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cowboy CEO Adrien Roose riding a near-final C4 in Amsterdam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h6gHAKp9GWK9GJ7KizygsLiZOEw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22487974/verge_DSC_4311_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cowboy 4 ST is the Belgian company’s first step-through frame.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yjx4Ky"&gt;The fourth-generation C4 maintains the same sporty riding position and ultra-responsive steering as every Cowboy before it. But this year’s model has a redesigned 250W rear-hub motor that remains silent as it assists riders up to a max speed of 25km/h (15.5mph), even though it’s smaller and produces noticeably more torque. The bump from 30Nm to 45Nm of torque is apparent on the first downstroke, with the lightest of touches propelling the slightly heavier 18.9kg / 41.67-pound e-bike forward with enough gusto to help smooth out hills. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2oooSK"&gt;The C4 ST has a lower saddle and higher grips that put the rider into a more upright position. That coupled with a lower gear ratio (2.71 on the C4 ST vs. 2.85 on the C4) makes the ride feel more relaxed despite having the same motor and Gates Carbon belt drive as its brother. The C4 ST is the model you buy for long, lazy commutes with a laptop bag, or for anyone who won’t fit the C4’s taller frame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ra2lUc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One of the most intuitive pedal-assisted rides on the road&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3mQPUI"&gt;The C4 e-bikes, like their predecessors, offer only a single power setting with no throttle and no extra gears. They rely on a torque sensor to adjust the power delivery as needed, which has traditionally resulted in one of the most intuitive pedal-assisted rides on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyXnAy"&gt;Cowboy refers to the Quadlock mount with integrated wireless charging unit as the “cockpit.” It can charge your phone at up to 15W from the e-bike’s removable 360Wh battery, but requires a Quadlock-compatible case that must be purchased separately for about €29 / £29. Although the cockpit is bulky enough to fit another battery, the space is mostly empty I’m told, providing a wide base for the wireless coils and access to the frame to run brake cables through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ycLdlU"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Cowboy 4 redesigned app|101972" data-volume-uuid="0f1c42690" data-volume-id="101972" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-728" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cowboy’s redesigned app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MbB1PQ"&gt;The Cowboy apps for iOS and Android have also been totally redesigned with an emphasis on health and fitness in addition to navigation, with many new features rooted in game design theory. “What we’re trying to achieve is some weird mix between Strava, Peloton, and &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;,” said Roose, “simply to encourage people to bike more.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLRTdw"&gt;The fourth-generation Cowboy 4 also improves upon the Cowboy 3 in a number of other ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="s79OGp"&gt;The C4 is redesigned down to the component level, making one of the best looking e-bikes look even more cohesive and sleek. Cowboy says the C4 now features “200 custom-made parts” assembled by Flex in Hungry, including the motor and tires. The Selle Royal saddle, SunRace hydraulic brakes, and Gates drive are the notable outliers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="I0EVj1"&gt;The €89 Cowboy mudguards are finally standard, which partially explains the added weight and price of the new e-bikes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="j1CpsU"&gt;The C4 and C4 ST still don’t come with kickstands, but at least Cowboy now makes its own as a €29 / £29 add-on. It’s also making an optional rear rack priced at €99 / £99.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="EFH9YM"&gt;Cowboy doesn’t currently sell e-bikes in the US, but that will change next year, according to Roose, who’s particularly bullish after hearing President Biden’s plans to cut CO2 emissions. “Our growth, and the growth of the US e-bike market, is making a move for us quite appealing and we want to jump,” said Roose. “We’re talking the next 12 months.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0F3k3y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10481923"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dIPGSt"&gt;For Europeans, the €2,490 / £2,290 purchase price for a Cowboy 4 / 4 ST includes theft and crash detection, and free on-demand mobile repairs available nationwide in Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany, France, Austria, Luxembourg, the UK, and in select cities in Spain and Italy. Cowboy also touts its 94.4 percent customer satisfaction rate, noting that owners get replies to support requests within six minutes, on average. A little poke at e-bike rival VanMoof, perhaps, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21437704/vanmoof-interview-s3-electric-bike-issues-delays-mobile-service-network"&gt;struggled to support buyers&lt;/a&gt; of its S3 and X3 e-bikes as sales ramped up during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OnCp6x"&gt;The C4 and C4 ST are available in three colors: black, khaki (greenish), and sand (off-whiteish). Test rides will begin in July before the bikes start shipping in September to Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain, and the UK. Preorders begin today after a €100 / £100 deposit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEpirt"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21454206/cowboy-3-electric-bike-review-price-features"&gt;Cowboy 3&lt;/a&gt; is also being reduced to €2,190 today and now comes standard with mudguards. That’s a price drop of €189 compared to the same e-bike purchased last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Internal emails reveal how badly Apple wanted to keep Netflix using in-app purchases</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v4h4D6CLronvfEYrCk6F1XhPj8Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69244186/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kNJ4s1"&gt;Internal emails revealed during the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;Epic Games v. Apple lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; show that employees at Apple were considering giving Netflix special treatment to convince the streaming service to not abandon in-app purchases. In the run up to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/28/18159373/netflix-in-app-subscriptions-iphone-ipad-ios-apple"&gt;Netflix removing its subscription offering&lt;/a&gt; to avoid Apple’s fees, a presentation circulated within Apple proposed to advertise Netflix in its retail stores, use a portion of its cut of App Store commission fees to pay for search ads, and even bundle Netflix with other Apple services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wkdav4"&gt;The emails, spotted by &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/05/netflix-apple-in-app-purchase/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, start with an explanation of a test Netflix wanted to run to study the impact of disabling in-app purchases on iOS. Netflix’s main concern, as Director of App Store Business Management Carson Oliver wrote, was over the “voluntary churn” of subscribers through the App Store. The exact amounts are redacted, but that seems to suggest that Netflix subscribers from the App Store cancelled the service more than subscribers who joined other ways, like through Netflix’s website.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ch-v_51dkLOdt7otKzrq0A5XTas=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22494902/Screen_Shot_2021_05_05_at_5.55.19_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Carson Oliver’s summary of Netflix’s in-app purchase test.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Eaa8G1"&gt;Since Apple takes a 30 percent cut from subscription fees as part of its App Store policy, there’s also clear financial reasons why Netflix might want to consider not using IAPs. Netflix could keep more of each monthly subscription without Apple’s cut. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2aLBc"&gt;In Apple’s first internal responses to Netflix’s plans, Oliver asks whether the company should consider punishing Netflix if it went forward with its test. There’s a several-month gap between the initial thread of emails and Apple’s later Netflix discussions, but the tone seems to have changed once Netflix appeared committed to A/B testing the removal of in-app purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i2GqYV"&gt;An email from July of 2018 showed Apple employees had created a presentation in favor of in-app purchases. It included reminders of the things Apple has done for Netflix and floated new deals, like offering subscriber discounts (Apple would eventually&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21419634/apple-app-store-subscription-offer-codes-ios-ipados-14"&gt; launch something like that in 2020&lt;/a&gt;) and letting Netflix determine what Netflix shows and movies Apple writes about it in the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uL3cMR"&gt;Apple also highlighted all of the promotion it did for Netflix in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/5/15741096/apple-app-store-games-redesign-announcement-wwdc-2017"&gt;editorial section of the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, Apple also calls out that Netflix was featured more than any partner, and content written about the streaming service’s shows had boosted its downloads by six to seven percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xmhnXm"&gt;But in the same presentation, Apple considered floating even more benefits to Netflix, some of which went beyond what the company has publicly offered other developers — though in the email it was stressed that “the ‘What we could do’ section is inclusive of pie in the sky ideas for completeness, and these ideas have not yet been approved.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7naa4R"&gt;The presentation included email campaigns devoted to promoting just the Netflix app, carving out a portion of subscription fees for advertising in the App Store, and the possibility of bundling Netflix with Apple’s other services, well before Apple launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20850842/apple-tv-plus-release-date-price-shows-oprah-streaming"&gt;Apple TV Plus&lt;/a&gt; or its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21541685/apple-one-subscription-individual-family-premier-music-tv-plus-arcade-icloud-news-fitness"&gt;Apple One bundle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3J89oT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10485382"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I2F2Cw"&gt;Whatever discussion between the companies did eventually happen, in-app purchases were still removed from Netflix’s app and the company doesn’t seem to have been hurt by it in the longterm — Netflix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238877/netflix-200-million-subscribers-q4-earnings-bridgerton-emily-paris-cobra-kai-queens-gambit"&gt;reached over 200 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; in January 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P20zlS"&gt;What this whole email saga is illustrative of is how Apple’s policies for developers seem to have exceptions. The details aren’t fully explained in the presentation, but Apple does bring up offering “video partner program benefits” to Netflix, which sound similar to the deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21203630/apple-amazon-prime-video-ios-app-store-cut-exempt-program-deal"&gt;it cut with Amazon for Prime Video&lt;/a&gt;. The emails could serve as evidence that for lucrative and powerful partners, Apple seems to be willing to make concessions.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic v. Apple turns into Windows v. Xbox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fT5NHsTnMdB7w9V7x756qXQasng=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69244012/twarren_200908_4177_0006.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iOxBbv"&gt;Is an iPhone more like a PC or an Xbox?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSGTMc"&gt;That question was asked — implicitly and explicitly — over and over on the third day of &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; testimony. The antitrust trial started on Monday with some heady pronunciations about &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417697/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-1"&gt;game and/or metaverse&lt;/a&gt; at the heart of the case. Yesterday, both sides argued about whether iPhones and iPads &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419894/apple-epic-fortnite-app-store-antitrust-trial-day-2"&gt;were truly locked down&lt;/a&gt;. And today, Apple and Epic delved into one of the biggest questions of the trial: whether saying iOS violates antitrust law would make every major game console an unlawful monopoly too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="mOUsMk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple says if Epic wins, ‘other ecosystems will fall’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nm7vev"&gt;Apple’s attorneys issued a dire warning to Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft during its opening statement, saying that their business models were all fundamentally similar. “If Epic prevails, other ecosystems will fall too,” they warned. But today, Epic called up Microsoft’s Xbox business development head Lori Wright as a sympathetic witness. In response to a line of questioning, Wright divided computing devices into “special-purpose” and “general-purpose” devices — in a way that clearly defined iPhones as the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hrnw00"&gt;The Xbox, as Wright describes it, is a special-purpose device. “You are basically building a piece of hardware to do a specific thing,” she told a judge. “The Xbox is designed to give you a gaming experience. People buy an Xbox because they want to play games.” As a result, Microsoft keeps tight control of what content users can access — it’s a “curated, custom-built hardware/software experience.” The market is also much smaller: tens or hundreds of millions sold, compared to “billions” of Windows devices. Later in the day, Epic engineering fellow Andrew Grant gave his own, similar definition of gaming consoles in general, calling a console “a single-purpose device for entertainment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="R8kA1N"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It can do a bunch of things already, and it has the aperture to do a bunch more”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YaV4Py"&gt;Windows computers, according to Wright, are “general-purpose” devices. “You’re buying it to do a wide variety of things, and that changes every day as new ideas are getting created,” she said. “It can do a bunch of things already, and it has the aperture to do a bunch more things.” These platforms can support unexpected, emergent applications across more aspects of people’s lives, particularly when it’s easy to &lt;em&gt;get &lt;/em&gt;an app onto them in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9g0qLq"&gt;Wright made a point of discussing all the different ways that users could get apps on Windows. That includes Microsoft’s own app store, but also Steam, the Epic Games Store, and direct downloads from a website. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22411686/microsoft-windows-store-game-fees-change-apple-app-store-epic-games-eu"&gt;recently dropped its commission on Windows apps&lt;/a&gt; to 12 percent to compete with Epic, while the Xbox still takes a 30 percent commission. Wright says there’s no plan to change that discrepancy. That’s despite the fact that under the hood, there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/12/13/21020149/xbox-series-x-pc-specs-analysis"&gt;not a massive hardware difference&lt;/a&gt; between an Xbox and a desktop PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V9c6yi"&gt;It’s hard to call the iPhone anything but a general-purpose device under Wright’s definition.  (She described a “special-purpose” Apple product as something like an iPod.) Intentionally or not, Wright also linked the distinction to one of Epic’s major talking points: profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Ps2EP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft’s Xbox head says the console is more like an iPod than an iPhone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hCoY1l"&gt;Epic describes profit as one of the biggest differences between iPhones and consoles. It argues console makers have to treat app makers better because they lose money on hardware, unlike Apple, so they need to plan around attracting developers to the platform. And from Microsoft’s point of view, Wright emphasized in testimony that no Xbox console has been sold at a profit, even late in a generation’s lifespan after manufacturing costs fall. So part of that curated hardware/software experience includes planning around a specific genre of app and attracting the developers who will build it, rather than simply turning it loose and seeing what happens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNDeo7"&gt;Microsoft later hedged in a statement saying that “profits are generated in game sales and online service subscriptions,” but it didn’t really contradict the claim — it just made clear, as Wright did, that the overall operation is profitable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gnnCvu"&gt;Will these distinctions convince the court? It’s hard to say, and Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers has asked questions that appear lightly skeptical of Epic’s hard lines between consoles and iPhones &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;Wright’s strict delineation of “general” and “specific” devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9DtAVa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You knew you were being dishonest, didn’t you?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="68PLhS"&gt;Apple’s attorney didn’t spend as much time arguing over precise definitions. Apple’s strategy relied more on questioning Wright’s credibility by noting that she’d failed to produce documents that Apple requested. Later, an attorney similarly lambasted Grant for working on the hotfix that secretly introduced a new payment system into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, insisting that “you knew you were being dishonest, didn’t you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DAzXo0"&gt;But Apple &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; push Wright to lay out in detail just &lt;em&gt;how &lt;/em&gt;much more locked-down Xbox is than Windows, asking whether it did things like support rival game stores or streaming services. (This questioning was muddled by the fact that Microsoft refers to both its consoles &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;general gaming division as “Xbox,” so you can have an “Xbox store” on PC — a fact that led to some confusion during cross-examination.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUAFA4"&gt;Why is this useful to Apple? Well, Epic began the trial by saying that iOS should work more like macOS. Both operating systems have a reputation for relative security and seamlessness, but only the latter allows installing software from outside the App Store. Epic’s opening statement questioned why Apple needed to lock down the iPhone when it had already created a perfectly workable but more open system. But with Wright and Microsoft, Apple has a perfect comparison point: a major computing company that offers two very different versions of a big black box.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google ‘arguably violated’ labor law by illegally firing three workers claims NLRB</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MQfPB4e7p5CseoV4r9Y2imIKyss=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69243937/acastro_191014_1777_google_pixel_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="load1x"&gt;The acting head of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) said Google “arguably violated” US labor law by illegally firing three workers in 2019 amid their organizing activities, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-05/biden-labor-board-counsel-revives-google-illegal-firing-claims?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. On Wednesday, the NLRB reversed an earlier decision which had dismissed claims from Sophie Waldman, Rebecca Rivers, and Paul Duke that Google had retaliated against them for labor activism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9fYlBJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The employees claim Google fired them to send a message&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AyKYo3"&gt;The NLRB’s general counsel’s office has already accused Google of unlawfully terminating former Google workers Laurence Berland and Kathryn Spiers. Now, acting general counsel Peter Sung Ohr has asked that the complaint be amended to include Waldman, Rivers, and Duke. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fg2Ckv"&gt;Google claims that four employees, Berland, Waldman, Rivers, and Duke, were fired for violating data security policies; the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/11/25/20982649/google-fired-rebecca-rivers-employee-questioned-work-customs-and-border-protection"&gt;employees say that’s not true&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/12/3/20992786/google-workers-fired-nlrb-laurence-berland-rebecca-rivers-sophie-waldman-paul-duke"&gt;They argue&lt;/a&gt; the firings were retaliation for trying to organize in the workplace, and that Google terminated them to send a message to other employees. Rivers and Berland say that the documents they accessed weren’t sensitive, and that they were monitoring public calendar events. Spiers was fired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/17/21024472/google-employee-fired-labor-rights-notification-tool"&gt;for allegedly bypassing proper code submission procedures&lt;/a&gt; — she says she did a routine update to an internal system to remind employees of their labor rights. The trial is set to begin in June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SXo3eO"&gt;In a statement emailed to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Google spokesperson said: “Our thorough investigation found the individuals were involved in systematic searches for other employees’ materials and work, including distributing confidential business and client information. As the hearing on these matters moves forward, we’re very confident in our decision and legal position.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX successfully landed a Starship prototype for the first time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A rocket sitting on a concrete pad" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7TTx2rZ1hnlIlcihVcKvFQKpRns=/0x48:1922x1329/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69243586/Screen_Shot_2021_05_05_at_6.32.58_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;SN15 on the landing pad after landing  | SpaceX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Me94nM"&gt;SpaceX launched a high-altitude Starship prototype rocket and successfully landed it for the first time on Wednesday, overcoming a key challenge in Elon Musk’s whirlwind quest to build a fully reusable Mars rocket. Musk has said the SN15 rocket contained “hundreds of design improvements” over past high-altitude prototypes, which were all destroyed during explosive landing attempts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPQnNg"&gt;Starship SN15 lifted off at 6:24PM ET from SpaceX’s Boca Chica, Texas facilities, soaring more than 6 miles in the sky to test in-flight maneuvers. As it reached peak altitude, SN15’s three Raptor engines gradually shut down to begin a horizontal free-fall back to Earth. Nearing land, two engines reignited to execute a complex “landing flip maneuver,” where the rocket reorients/repositions itself vertically ahead of a soft touchdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EQr7vf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z9eoubnO-pE?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=733&amp;amp;start=733" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QhAzgJ"&gt;The rocket deployed a set of tiny legs and landed firmly on a concrete pad not far from its launchpad, becoming the first surviving Starship prototype. A small fire appeared near the base of the rocket after landing — “not unusual with the methane fuel that we’re carrying,” SpaceX engineer John Insprucker said on the livestream — and was extinguished a few minutes later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L35Ig2"&gt;“Starship landing nominal!” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1390073153347592192"&gt;Musk tweeted &lt;/a&gt;about seven minutes after SN15’s touchdown, declaring success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nmbbm0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Starship landing nominal!&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1390073153347592192?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C4GC1R"&gt;All four previous high-altitude prototypes exploded upon attempting to land — either &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262937/spacex-sn9-starship-test-flight-successful-explode-landing"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358060/spacex-starship-prototype-fail-landing-texas"&gt;shortly before&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311916/spacex-starship-prototype-landing-successful"&gt;moments after&lt;/a&gt; the touchdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fCXlem"&gt;SpaceX’s Starship system is made for sending humans and up to 100 tons of cargo to the Moon and Mars. The 16-story-tall high-altitude prototypes like SN15 represent just the top half of Starship. The bottom half will be a towering “super-heavy” booster that will help launch Starship’s top half before returning back to land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FCDko"&gt;The success at SpaceX’s so-called “Starbase” facilities in Texas on Wednesday follows a strong signal of approval from NASA, which last month &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22387887/elon-musk-spacex-win-nasa-lunar-lander-contract-artemis"&gt;awarded Musk’s space company $2.9 billion&lt;/a&gt; to use Starship for the agency’s first two missions to the Moon by around 2024. Two other companies were in the running for the award: Blue Origin, which led a group of established space contractors including Lockheed Martin, and Dynetics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yOIp4d"&gt;SpaceX’s award shocked many in the space industry who expected NASA to pick two companies. Blue Origin and Dynetics &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404528/nasa-bezo-blue-origin-protest-spacex-contract"&gt;protested&lt;/a&gt; NASA’s decision, saying two companies should have been picked as expected and alleging the agency’s evaluation unfairly favored Starship. Those protests have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/30/22412771/nasa-spacex-hls-moon-lander-blue-origin-protest"&gt;put a hold&lt;/a&gt; on SpaceX’s ability to use the $2.9 billion in funds, but development of Starship, supported largely by private funding and Musk’s wealth, has continued regardless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DvrfJ4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A busy two weeks for SpaceX&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oE01vo"&gt;“The past two weeks have been full of accomplishments by the SpaceX team,” Insprucker said after SN15’s clean touchdown, mentioning SpaceX’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22398981/spacex-launches-third-nasa-astronaut-crew-used-crew-dragon-capsule"&gt;launch of astronauts&lt;/a&gt; on its used Crew Dragon capsule last month and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/2/22413121/spacex-crew-dragon-resilience-splashdown-nasa-record-iss"&gt;first nighttime splashdown&lt;/a&gt; of a US astronaut capsule in 52 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AjG3ku"&gt;For SpaceX and NASA’s two Moon missions, Starship will need to demonstrate it can refuel itself in orbit before flying to the lunar surface — two feats never before accomplished by a private company. The lunar version of Starship will also need to prove it can use an entirely different set of thrusters to ease itself down on the dusty surface of the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
