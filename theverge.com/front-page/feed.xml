    <title>2021 was hot as hell, NASA confirms</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o3fPPM"&gt;The last eight years have been the eight hottest years on record, NASA and the National Oceanic Administration (NOAA) confirmed today. 2021 ranks as the sixth hottest year on record, the agencies said, as global average temperatures trend upward. Rankings aside, there were plenty of red flags throughout 2021 to show us how remarkable the year was for temperature extremes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEsqtU"&gt;“The fact is that we’ve now kind of moved into a new regime ... this is likely the warmest decade in many, many hundreds, maybe 1000s of years,” says Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. “There’s enough change that it’s having impacts locally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2zTQ1r"&gt;In North America, those local impacts included epically bad summer heat, even for typically cool regions. In late June and early July, the Pacific Northwestern US and Western Canada struggled with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602208/june-heatwave-most-extreme-summer-record-north-america"&gt;record-smashing&lt;/a&gt; temperatures that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22559961/heat-roads-washington-oregon-climate-infrastructure"&gt;buckled&lt;/a&gt; roads and melted &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/29/1011269025/photos-the-pacific-northwest-heatwave-is-melting-power-cables-and-buckling-roads"&gt;power cables&lt;/a&gt;.  In the desert further south, California’s Death Valley reached a blazing 130 degrees Fahrenheit (54.4 degrees Celsius) in July, potentially breaking the world record for the hottest temperature ever recorded on the planet — for the second year in a row. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eqr2vP"&gt;Across the Atlantic, Europe experienced sweltering heat, too. A reading of 119.8 degrees Fahrenheit (48.8 degrees Celsius) &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/news/mediterranean-gripped-extreme-heat-new-reported-temperature-record"&gt;in Sicily&lt;/a&gt; might have broken the European record for maximum temperature. (The World Meteorological Organization is still &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/wmo-recognizes-new-arctic-temperature-record-of-38%E2%81%B0c"&gt;working&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/21/21395621/hottest-temperatures-verification-research-death-valley-wmo-record"&gt;vet those records&lt;/a&gt;.) All told, July 2021 was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623843/july-2021-hottest-month-recorded"&gt;hottest month humans have ever recorded&lt;/a&gt;, according to NOAA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0HpFZ7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Record-smashing temperatures that buckled roads and melted power cables&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QPt5MA"&gt;More than a discomfort, the heat took a serious toll on communities. Emergency department visits spiked in the Pacific Northwest as a result of the extreme heat wave, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580120/emergency-department-visits-spiked-june-heat-wave-us-northwest"&gt;CDC reported&lt;/a&gt;. Further north, an inferno all but &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/10/world/canada/canadian-wildfire-british-columbia.html"&gt;wiped out the small town&lt;/a&gt; of Lytton, British Columbia soon after it recorded Canada’s highest temperature on record. The event stood out as one of the most shocking of 2021 for Schmidt. “The scale of human tragedy there, you know, even if people don’t die, that’s a community destroyed,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dERM3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/jan/11/oceans-hottest-temperatures-research-climate-crisis"&gt;Heat trapped in the world’s oceans&lt;/a&gt; also reached record levels in 2021, according to &lt;a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00376-022-1461-3"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published this week. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20882502/marine-heatwaves-oceans-united-nations-ipcc-report-climate-change"&gt;Ocean heatwaves&lt;/a&gt; are likely twice as common now as they were in the early 1980s, and they can be devastating for marine life and coastal communities. They kill coral, take a toll on fishing and crabbing industries, and can even make droughts worse onshore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkAyFF"&gt;Temperatures might have been even hotter in 2021, were it not for a La Niña event. La Niña is a &lt;a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/ninonina.html"&gt;recurring climate phenomenon&lt;/a&gt; defined by cooler-than-average waters in the eastern equatorial Pacific, which has predictable effects on weather patterns worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94E50n"&gt;Earlier this week, the European Union’s Copernicus Climate Change Service released its own &lt;a href="https://climate.copernicus.eu/copernicus-globally-seven-hottest-years-record-were-last-seven"&gt;data&lt;/a&gt; on global temperature records, which vary slightly from NASA and NOAA because the agencies use somewhat &lt;a href="https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/blogs/earthmatters/2015/01/21/why-so-many-global-temperature-records/"&gt;different methods&lt;/a&gt; to make their calculations. Copernicus determined that 2021 was fifth warmest year on record. It also confirmed that the world has warmed by more than a degree Celsius since the preindustrial era, a result of greenhouse gases released by burning fossil fuels. Experts are urging a transition to clean energy because global warming needs to stay well below two degrees Celsius to prevent catastrophic climate change — as this year’s heat extremes illustrate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1zCV7"&gt;“We are unfortunately, reaping what we have sown,” Schmidt says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUi9Pb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JwQl15"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite is technically back on iOS, thanks to a GeForce Now game streaming loophole</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HtyUxf0pBtgDZv_BRibCrnvuzKs=/256x0:1792x1024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70383281/GFN_Thursday_January_13.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YlWmSf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is back on iOS today... sort of. The popular battle royale game isn’t back on the App Store (where it’s been missing since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21366438/apple-fortnite-ios-app-store-violations-epic-payments"&gt;Apple pulled the app from its storefront&lt;/a&gt; in August 2020), but iPhone and iPad owners can now stream &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to play on their phones and tablets through Nvidia’s GeForce Now service, which opened up a closed beta today to test the new streaming version of the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2L94w"&gt;Nvidia and Epic Games have been promising that Fortnite would come back to iOS through GeForce Now running through Safari’s web browser (the only way that Apple currently allows game streaming services like GeForce Now, Stadia, xCloud, or Luna to operate on iOS) &lt;a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/11/19/geforce-now-on-ios-safari/"&gt;as far back as November 2020&lt;/a&gt;, when the service first launched on Apple’s hardware. But it’s apparently taken quite a bit of time to sort out the details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PwgyeL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fortnite streamed to iOS, complete with touchscreen optimized controls&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YMVD3h"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has technically already been available on GeForce Now for Android users, but that version of the game is a streamed copy of the desktop version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. The new version that Nvidia and Epic Games are beta testing is optimized for mobile devices, with similar touchscreen controls and menus to the old native iOS and Android versions of the game. (Nvidia warns that Android users who join the beta will &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; be able to play the new mobile version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;and won’t be able to use a keyboard and mouse like they currently can.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X1WrZP"&gt;According to Nvidia, beta sign-ups start today, with “selected members” set to get access later in January. The company says that the &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;beta will be a “limited time” process but that “we do not have an exact timeline for how long it will last.” Anyone interested in trying the new streamed version of Fortnite can sign up at Nvidia’s website, with both free and paid GeForce Now customers getting an “equal chance at the closed beta.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KP7q7m"&gt;Nvidia is notably the only game streaming service that Epic Games is partnering with for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; — as a deposition in the Apple / Epic trial revealed last year, Epic deliberately isn’t allowing Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407849/fortnite-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-epic-games-block"&gt;to offer &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;as part of its xCloud service&lt;/a&gt;, due to concerns that xCloud would compete with Epic’s own PC offerings. Streaming &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; through xCloud to iOS would also require that Epic pay Microsoft’s 30 percent fee for in-app purchases — similar in Epic’s eyes to the Apple fees that led to the company’s lawsuit in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vhPDK6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Fortnite isn’t on Microsoft’s Xbox Cloud Gaming service because Epic won’t allow it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407849/fortnite-xbox-cloud-gaming-xcloud-epic-games-block"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OjhX3i"&gt;Nvidia’s GeForce Now service, on the other hand, just acts as a conduit for Epic’s existing storefront, meaning that Epic Games won’t have to hand over a cent of any of the in-game purchases players make on the new streamed version of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; through GeForce Now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pv6m2h"&gt;Epic and Nvidia aren’t saying how long the beta will last or when to expect the GeForce Now-streamed version of Fortnite to be broadly available for all Android and iOS users. And while game streaming has improved in leaps and bounds in recent years, it’s hard to imagine that the streamed version will be a better long-term solution than the native Fortnite app that used to be on the App Store. Still, for Fortnite fans looking to get a quick round in on the go, the GeForce Now option will probably be better than nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>White House hosts tech summit to discuss open-source security after Log4j</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qGTwSp6WvpPDQQbMartrYY_gVn4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70383279/acastro_210708_4663_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QVdwQ2"&gt;The White House &lt;a href="https://www.cyberscoop.com/white-house-log4j-open-source-software-security/"&gt;will meet with leaders of major tech&lt;/a&gt; companies including Apple, Google, Amazon, Meta, IBM, and Microsoft on Thursday to discuss the security of open-source software. The issue has become urgent in the wake of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828303/log4j-library-vulnerability-log4shell-zero-day-exploit"&gt;extremely serious Log4j vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;, discovered in December 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iq5QbA"&gt;The summit will also include the Apache Software Foundation — the owner and maintainer of the Log4j library — and Oracle, owner of the Java software platform on which the Log4j library runs. GitHub and the Linux Open Source Foundation will also be represented.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZhRJT"&gt;Executives from the tech companies will meet with representatives of various federal agencies, including the departments of Commerce, Defense, Energy, and Homeland Security. Other agencies include the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the National Science Foundation, according to &lt;em&gt;Cyberscoop&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z05cZv"&gt;In the wake of the discovery and fallout from the Log4j vulnerability in December, White House national security advisor Jake Sullivan &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/12/23/politics/white-house-log4j-tech-firms-meeting/index.html"&gt;described open-source security&lt;/a&gt; as a “key national security concern.” The open-source security summit was called shortly after as a direct response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ocRxY6"&gt;In May 2021, well before the Log4j vulnerability was discovered, President Biden issued an &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/05/12/executive-order-on-improving-the-nations-cybersecurity/"&gt;executive order on improving the nation’s cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt;. Among other things, the order mandated that agencies of the federal government shore up their software supply chains by “ensuring and attesting, to the extent practicable, to the integrity and provenance of open source software.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SD1FPb"&gt;Vulnerabilities in open-source software have led to some of the most serious security flaws in recent memory. The Heartbleed bug, discovered in 2014, affected an open-source encryption library called OpenSSL that was believed to be used in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/8/5594266/how-heartbleed-broke-the-internet"&gt;two out of three servers across the web&lt;/a&gt;. Despite its large-scale usage, the library was maintained largely by unpaid volunteers — &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-13/how-apache-raced-to-fix-a-potentially-disastrous-software-flaw"&gt;as was the case with Log4j&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M0sBXX"&gt;Open-source software that is critical to the functioning of highly profitable tech companies may still struggle to attract funding, a fact that is likely to be discussed at today’s summit. Just days ago the issue was brought to the fore again when an open-source developer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/9/22874949/developer-corrupts-open-source-libraries-projects-affected"&gt;intentionally corrupted two JavaScript libraries&lt;/a&gt;, potentially affecting thousands of projects. Reporting by &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt; uncovered previous posts in which the developer lamented “support[ing] Fortune 500s...with my free work.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZrvv4"&gt;Writing &lt;a href="https://github.blog/2022-01-13-open-source-software-security-summit-securing-the-worlds-code-together/"&gt;on Github’s company blog&lt;/a&gt; Thursday morning, chief security officer Mike Hanley described a landscape in which open software was widely used but still poorly supported in terms of resources made available to developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avRdC6"&gt;“First, there must be a collective industry and community effort to secure the software supply chain,” Hanley wrote. “Second, we need to better support open source maintainers to make it easier for them to secure their projects.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Neurotech company will use Magic Leap 2 for dizziness</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hp7BqgxEAOEEYXaHKiKOAQNap0M=/59x0:692x422/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382964/magic_leap_2_image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Magic Leap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BotmcB"&gt;Magic Leap &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22880090/magic-leap-2-ar-headset-rollout-healthcare-companies"&gt;announced Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that it was giving four healthcare partners early access to its next-gen augmented reality headset, including neurotechnology company SyncThink. With the new partnership, the company is interested in targeting vestibular disorders, which cause dizziness, SyncThink chief clinical officer Scott Anderson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4RpWb"&gt;SyncThink has been collaborating with Magic Leap for a few years, Anderson says. Now, it’s expanding that relationship to bring Magic Leap 2 into the neurological health space and collaborate on clinical studies, he says. SyncThink already has FDA clearance for an eye-tracking VR device that helps &lt;a href="https://syncthink.com/2021/10/05/syncthink-receives-second-fda-clearance-for-eye-sync-platform-the-first-mobile-rapid-test-for-concussion/"&gt;diagnose concussions&lt;/a&gt;. Changes in eye movements are also linked to vestibular disorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="koXF6Y"&gt;The upgrades to the camera and sensors in the Magic Leap 2 headset let SyncThink flag abnormal eye movements that could cause or worsen dizziness, Anderson says. “We need high fidelity cameras and sensors that can track at a medical-grade level, not a consumer-grade level,” he says. That affects the accuracy of the tools SyncThink is able to build. The company is initially working on tools that could diagnose vestibular conditions, but Anderson says he thinks they could eventually develop VR-based treatments for those disorders, as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hSANGK"&gt;Digital tools that treat diseases are becoming &lt;a href="https://morningconsult.com/2021/06/15/digital-therapeutics-use-coverage-polling/"&gt;more common&lt;/a&gt;, and the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated their adoption. Early in the pandemic, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) &lt;a href="https://www.medtechdive.com/news/digital-therapeutics-eye-opportunity-as-pandemic-prompts-fda-to-ease-rules/576628/"&gt;relaxed&lt;/a&gt; some guidelines, which gave patients more access to products under development. Magic Leap’s announcement and its new relationships with healthcare companies come on the heels of first-of-their-kind FDA authorizations for VR-based therapeutics this fall: one to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736894/fda-vr-tv-movies-treatment-lazy-eye-amblyopia"&gt;treat lazy eye&lt;/a&gt; in children and a second for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785609/vr-chronic-pain-fda"&gt;chronic pain&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cExLFZ"&gt;More and more virtual and augmented reality companies like Magic Leap are moving toward healthcare as part of that digital health trend, Anderson says. And that’s made it easier for companies like SyncThink to find the hardware they need to develop new tools. Over the past five or so years, many VR equipment manufacturers have started to move away from gaming and esports and toward industries like healthcare or the military (which Magic Leap says it’s also interested in). The companies interested in healthcare have started paying attention to the types of features important for medical applications and incorporating those features into their devices, he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6S1R40"&gt;“Even going back five years, we were having to go buy off-the-shelf VR devices and send them to Germany and have infrared sensors put in,” Anderson says. “Now, everyone is learning really quickly the importance of specific types of features that appeal to sectors like healthcare.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ciEhAs"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="chtJf5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HBO Max monthly plans are 20 percent off for a limited time</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the ad-free and ad-supported HBO Max plans are currently on sale.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ga2vY3"&gt;Whether it’s exclusives like the new Harry Potter reunion special, &lt;em&gt;Return to Hogwarts&lt;/em&gt;, or access to new films like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22841582/matrix-resurrections-lana-wachowski-keanu-reeves-carrie-anne-moss-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; an HBO Max subscription means you can watch some of today’s most popular titles from the comfort and safety of your home. Unfortunately, we rarely see deals on the popular streaming service — that is, until today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IgsyvQ"&gt;Right now, HBO Max is offering 20 percent off both its ad-supported and ad-free monthly subscription plans, which throughout 2021 gave subscribers limited-time access to movies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22737214/dune-review-hbo-max-denis-villeneuve-timothee-chalamet-sandworm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; the same day they hit theaters. And while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22850666/hbo-max-2022-trailer-westworld-game-of-thrones"&gt;Warner Bros. has stated&lt;/a&gt; it doesn’t intend to keep simultaneously releasing movies in theaters and on HBO Max this year, &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-max-reveals-new-campaign-spot-highlighting-upcoming-originals-warner-bros"&gt;it will release six exclusives&lt;/a&gt; on HBO Max that won’t make it to theaters, including &lt;em&gt;House Party&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Father of the Bride&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Kimi&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Fallout&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Scoob: Holiday Haunt&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Moonshot. &lt;/em&gt;The subscription also gives you access to HBO Max exclusives and original shows like &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Euphoria&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Doom Patrol&lt;/em&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUyunM"&gt;Now until January 25th at 11:59PM PT, HBO Max is dropping the price of its &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeBestHBOMax2021&amp;amp;aff_unique1=https://www.hbomax.com/subscribe/plan-picker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ad-free subscription plan from $14.99 a month to $11.99 a month&lt;/a&gt;. That equates to about $36 in savings over the span of one year, which is like getting two months of the ad-free plan for free. Alternatively, you can &lt;a href="http://voxmediapartner.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=2&amp;amp;aff_id=1&amp;amp;source=Verge&amp;amp;aff_sub=VergeBestHBOMax2021&amp;amp;aff_unique1=https://www.hbomax.com/subscribe/plan-picker" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;opt into the $9.99-a-month, ad-supported tier for $7.99 a month&lt;/a&gt;, saving yourself about $24. The promotion is available to both new and lapsed subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

If you’d like a lower-cost, full-featured alternative to Samsung’s more expensive Galaxy S21, the new phone is worth a look, especially given you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Unlocked-Smartphone-Intelligent-Lavender/dp/B09PMRDM9Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;get a $100 Amazon gift card&lt;/a&gt; right now when you &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Unlocked-Smartphone-Intelligent-Lavender/dp/B09PMRDM9Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;purchase the unlocked, 128GB configuration from Amazon for $699.99,&lt;/a&gt; its typical retail price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBObe6"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22860324/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-screen-camera-specs-price"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;Allison Johnson noted in her first impressions of the phone&lt;/a&gt;, this edition shares many features with the more expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Galaxy S21&lt;/a&gt;. This includes a 1080p OLED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate, a Snapdragon 888 chipset, 5G support, 25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, and an IP68 weather-resistance rating. The Galaxy S21 offers a higher-res telephoto camera and more RAM, though interestingly, the S21 FE boasts a greater battery capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVwudQ"&gt;Of course, if you’d prefer the latest (and maybe greatest?), it might be worth waiting for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/6/22870027/samsung-s22-series-unofficial-dummy-leak-design-camera-specs"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S22&lt;/a&gt;, which should arrive sometime this year. Samsung typically launches new lineups in February; however, given ongoing supply chain issues and the global chip shortage, it’s unclear if that will happen. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22644338"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8qN5gA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10974491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5bgazm"&gt;For those of you with a Nintendo Switch Online membership, &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-entertainment-system-controllers.html"&gt;you can currently pick up the $59.99 Nintendo Entertainment System Controllers for just $34.99&lt;/a&gt; — one of their lowest prices ever — from Nintendo. This deal lasts through 11:59PM PT on February 2nd, and the price includes two wireless controllers, which work with all Nintendo Switch models but require a standard Switch console or the OLED edition in order to charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XH5Kgr"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/12/13/18139299/nintendo-switch-online-nes-controller-review"&gt;noted in our review&lt;/a&gt;, these are wireless recreations of the original NES gamepad that work perfectly with classic Switch Online NES games. In fact, they work so well, we believe they’re the best way to access classic Nintendo titles. However, given they only offer two face buttons, they don’t work well with other modern games. Thus, if you require more flexible gamepads with extra buttons that work with multiple platforms, this controller may not be the best pick. Otherwise, this deal is a great one, definitely worth taking a look at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JwY3pE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"PSA: you can now buy a Nintendo Switch OLED or an Xbox Series S without the hassle","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22848923/nintendo-switch-oled-model-console-microsoft-xbox-series-s-in-stock-stores-amazon-best-buy-walmart"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="WwygNl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10470259"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="blAZLe"&gt;The Super Bowl season is nearly upon us, and already we’re starting to see some great TV deals trickling in. For those looking for a smaller 4K TV, the 43-inch configuration of the new Omni Fire TV is available at a new all-time low at Amazon. Typically $409.99, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6DZ81T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the retailer is selling it right now for $284.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is $15 less than what we saw it go for on Black Friday. The 4K TV works with Alexa, boasts a low input lag and support for two-way video calling, and offers access to major streaming services like Netflix without extra hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3SYGDG"&gt;Other configurations are on sale for up to $200 off, too, so fans of larger TVs can also save on Amazon. However, it’s important to note only the 65-inch and 75-inch models include support for Dolby Vision HDR. If that’s a feature you’d like, or you’d just prefer a larger TV, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08T6J1HG8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch is also available for $599.99 instead of $829.99&lt;/a&gt;, just $1 shy of its lowest price to date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SZCxjT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best deals on 4K TVs","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="npDpgX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10974342"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VeCscB"&gt;One of the smallest smart displays on the market, Lenovo’s new Smart Clock 2 incorporates a touchscreen display with a form factor that’s ideally suited for your bedside table. At the same time, it also offers full Google Assistant capabilities. What we particularly liked, however, is the separate wireless charging dock, which provides up to 10 watts of power, a USB Type-A port for your peripherals, and a built-in night light. Normally $89.99, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgo8plWliEV" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling&lt;/a&gt; both the smart clock and its wireless charging dock for just $69.99, the typical retail price for the smart clock &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; the wireless dock. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22714538/lenovo-smart-clock-2-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c2sx0o"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10974433"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eaaJf9"&gt;You can save even more today with these great deals:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="nloyEi"&gt;You can save $50 today on the new Samsung 980 Pro 1TB SSD, which comes with a built-in heatsink. Regularly $249.99, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JHL33X7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling it for $199.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is just $9 more than its best price ever.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nv6byv"&gt;Whether you’re a streamer or you’re simply looking for a webcam that’s better than your laptop’s for Zoom calls, Razer’s Kiyo is a solid pick. Right now, the webcam — which features a built-in ring light and supports 1080p resolution at 30 frames per second or 720p resolution at 60 frames per second — is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B075N1BYWB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling for $61.23 (nearly $40 off) at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, its second-best price to date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0U8EQW"&gt;If you’re into tabletop gaming, the digital version of &lt;em&gt;Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics &lt;/em&gt;for the Nintendo Switch is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086Z9D3TD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $27.99&lt;/a&gt;, almost matching its best price to date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Hvf91u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PWC32ZD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;This 60W Anker USB-C charger&lt;/a&gt; comes with both a USB-C PowerIQ 3.0 port and a USB-A port equipped with PowerIQ 2.0. Right now, it’s on sale at Amazon for $26.34 instead of $39.99, nearly half off the typical list price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>The pandemic has blurred the lines between laptop categories</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HP Eite Dragonfly G3 seen from above on a marble table. The screen displays a multicolor background. To the left is an open notebook with a pen on top. To the right are two cups and a phone." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QBK17J6NJKv8-s3LQ5egUMR9174=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382869/3.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Elite Dragonfly G3 is one of thebiggest laptop releases from CES, bringing more consumer-friendly features to a traditional business laptop.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YkLAWJ"&gt;HP had one of the most expansive laptop launches of this year’s CES. The headliners included two &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866703/hp-elite-dragonfly-g3-chromebook-enterprise-laptops"&gt;Elite Dragonfly models&lt;/a&gt;, a whole &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865588/hp-elitebook-805-g9-amd-ryzen-6000-605-work-laptops"&gt;gaggle of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865447/hp-intel-commercial-laptop-intel-alder-lake"&gt;Windows 11 Elitebooks&lt;/a&gt;, and a dump of &lt;a href="https://press.hp.com/us/en/press-releases/2022/hp-ces-2022-gaming-experiences.html"&gt;gaming laptpos and desktops&lt;/a&gt; (as well as accessories). We saw the usual spec upgrades: better chips, smaller bezels, better battery life, bigger touchpads, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zeOdQM"&gt;But a few newer themes ran through HP’s releases and through those of many other major laptop manufacturers as well. Less obtrusive, chic-er looks. Heavier duty chips in chassis that are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22862528/lenovos-thinkpad-z-series-z13-z16-business-laptop"&gt;thinner, lighter,&lt;/a&gt; and easier to take from place to place. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22868089/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-nano-yoga-laptops-ces-2022"&gt;AI features&lt;/a&gt; meant to prevent snooping in public places. Better conferencing technology — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22864968/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-g15-gaming-laptop-2022-webcam-amd-16-10-aspect-ratio-specs-features"&gt;lines that have resisted adding webcams for years&lt;/a&gt; finally have them. These aren’t changes limited to the business sphere. We’re seeing these trends in consumer lines, gaming lines, workstation lines, and even Chromebooks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ruc53a"&gt;It’s clear what these companies’ market research is showing: people want to work on the move more than ever before, and their definition of “work” is expanding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nx3eDp"&gt;That’s certainly what HP has found. “People are working differently,” Alex Cho, HP’s president of personal systems, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “People are going to create even more. They’re going to be getting entertained and playing differently. They’re going to connect with other people differently.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A worker uses the HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook in a cafe setting." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KReHQP0c34v83OiirzcgdKLwtao=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144523/2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Elite Dragonfly Chromebook, a device that was previously unthinkable in the business sphere.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ks8vpy"&gt;It’s hardly a no-brainer that remote work has exploded around the world since early 2020. But there’s certainly been some question as to whether that explosion would lead to temporary trends or longer-term changes to the laptop sphere. Per this CES, it appears that the market has spoken: consumers expect that conferencing and on-the-go work are here to stay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiCdoQ"&gt;HP has found that “75 percent of people are now saying they want to set up their permanent home office,” Cho says. Meanwhile, “80 percent of conferencing rooms in the office are being upgraded, because you’re recognizing that ‘I will now be working from home on a permanent basis, and when I go back into the office, I need that office to be far more around collaboration.’” Cho added that 75 percent of people have admitted to judging others based on their appearance on video calls, per HP’s findings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svvamL"&gt;The new demands extend beyond webcam quality. COVID-19 has driven swaths of people in some countries (the US included) from full-time jobs to freelance work. This means the demand for devices that can serve both as workstations and personal drivers — workstation power in a small, attractive chassis — is higher than ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pCYWI4"&gt;“We’re seeing that a lot of people are having more personal gigs,” says Cho. “They’re creating a lot more on their devices. They’re doing a lot of custom work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpPckT"&gt;While many of the biggest “creator” laptops of the past few years have looked more like a gaming laptop than an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;, last year saw a few creation-oriented ultraportables (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22445605/acer-swift-3x-review-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Acer’s Swift 3X&lt;/a&gt;, for example) that tried to bridge the gap. Expect to see more of those in 2022; Cho hinted that HP is prioritizing better screen technology this year to target that market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="14HBn5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“People are having more personal gigs.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FfA7Lm"&gt;Gaming is also a rapidly growing segment, which the pandemic has accelerated. “It’s not just a lot of people, but there’s new segments,” Cho says. HP has found that 60 percent of new gamers, for example, are female. But gaming, for many of these new users, is more of a social affair than it has been in the past — the isolation that COVID-19 imposed upon many people has made some turn to gaming as a source of virtual interaction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qFZvr"&gt;“Gamers game because they want to connect,” says Cho. “People are going online ... at set times — ‘Hey, why don’t we all get on at 8PM?’ We see that in multiple age demographics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Es93I"&gt;Not only does that mean more people want laptops that can game; it also means gamers are looking for better keyboards, webcams, and other peripherals that have previously been more of a focus in the consumer laptop sphere. There’s more demand for gaming laptops that can also work, and personal laptops that can also game. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13 Plus seen from above on a blue plush stool.

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 Plus is another heavy-hitting consumer model that’s undergone bold changes to target a wider audience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Three ThinkPad Z13 models closed stacked on top of each other on a gridded table. The black is on top, with the gray underneath, and the leather on the bottom." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eRzmWXv3wnnYvBBoqThzR2M-FRw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23119043/bfarsace_211216_4940_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;With the ThinkPad Z-Series, Lenovo is trying to push the ThinkPad line to a hybrid-focused audience.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4QlsrQ"&gt;Much marketing for personal technology (laptops included) makes reference to a “hybrid world,” an “era of remote work,” and the like. Those terms are being used to describe an American workforce that consists of, by recent estimates, &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/355907/remote-work-persisting-trending-permanent.aspx"&gt;less than 50 percent&lt;/a&gt; remote or hybrid workers. While many people have permanently altered their lifestyles and are upgrading their home offices, there’s still a large segment that needs (or wants) to work in person. Do companies like HP expect to split their products between those segments or focus on products that accommodate both? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYP3XB"&gt;Cho didn’t directly answer that question. “There are needs that are converging because you want some consistent type of experience, but there are distinct needs in each of the spaces for which we’re continuing to innovate,” he said. Noted. But the broader point — that the needs of the business, consumer, gaming, and creative laptop spaces are converging and will likely lead to more laptops that bridge those categories — is well taken. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQLhFF"&gt;That comes with all sorts of questions. For one: laptops in the business, gaming, and workstation sphere are traditionally much more expensive than consumer laptops of similar quality. There’s certainly a question of whether the needs of these customers’ encroaching on the consumer sphere could make the category as a whole less accessible. (HP’s Elite Dragonfly Chromebook, for example, positioned as one of these work-and-play devices, is expected to start at $999, which is not at all cheap for a Chromebook.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rduiIl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865547/dell-xps-13-plus-2022-hands-on-new-design-features"&gt;Multiple established lines&lt;/a&gt; have also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22862528/lenovos-thinkpad-z-series-z13-z16-business-laptop"&gt;made significant compromises&lt;/a&gt; to keyboard and touchpad quality this year in the name of thinness and portability — compromises that have been, at least in part, positioned for the benefit of work-on-the-go use cases. That may be a sacrifice the new generation of workers is willing to make, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/27/21270299/apple-butterfly-keyboard-hardware-design-macbook-pro-physical-key-button"&gt;MacBooks of the last decade&lt;/a&gt; certainly beg to differ. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="US0D7a"&gt;And then there’s the problem of security — using the same laptop for work that you use for freelance gigs, gaming, or the like, is something IT departments have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22671697/personal-laptop-work-security-privacy"&gt;begging people not to do&lt;/a&gt; since the dawn of time. It has the potential to compromise your privacy (IT can see everything you’re doing on there, after all) and your company’s information (what if you accidentally copy and paste the wrong thing?). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xe9nW0"&gt;These are likely bridges we’ll be crossing further down the line — laptop production is often a multiyear cycle, and while some features can be added or tweaked on the fly, it may take some time for the market to see any drastic reimagining of a laptop’s role in the workplace. But within the next five years, Cho hopes that the ideal laptop will be one that “easily transitions”. It will recognize “that you use that device to work, but you’re not just working — you’re checking an email, you’re shopping.” That certainly appears to be the case for many people. I just hope that’s a feature of today’s market, not a bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NxJUM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leica’s new M11 gains some resolution and sheds some weight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ULs55wXs6eXO_3h3uEokqMpxdNQ=/0x1:3000x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382823/Leica_M11_Ambient_03_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leica M11 in black&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Leica&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SKCnQb"&gt;Leica has introduced the latest generation of its venerated M rangefinder camera, the new M11. The M11 is very similar in appearance to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/17/14592306/leica-m10-digital-camera-review-photography"&gt;M10 line it’s replacing&lt;/a&gt;, with much of the claimed 40 new improvements found on the inside. Leica says the M11 will be available starting today, January 13th, 2022, with a price tag of $8,995.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JouvEO"&gt;The most significant upgrade is a new, 60-megapixel backside-illuminated full-frame CMOS sensor that captures 14 stops of dynamic range at its full resolution. Uniquely, the M11 also allows photographers to capture RAW files at 36 or 18 megapixels, which unlocks another stop of dynamic range, provides better low light performance, and allows for longer burst shooting at the expense of zoomed-in detail. (The company says it is using pixel binning alongside a newly developed algorithm to create the lower resolutions, a similar technique used by many smartphone cameras.) File sizes range from 70 to 120MB for a 60-megapixel DNG RAW file; the 18-megapixel setting can reduce that down to as low as 20MB per image.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4O3XW"&gt;Along with the new sensor, Leica is using a new, ultra-thin UV filter on top of it, which the company claims provides more natural color reproduction. The company says the M11 captures the highest dynamic range of any digital M ever, including the black-and-white Monochrom models that were praised for their ability to capture a wide range of tones. The M11’s ISO range starts at 64 and goes up to 50,000.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ftyncpqz9yHWeCJDUFaRPUc5A5w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23164831/Leica_M11_HF_Ambient22.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Leica&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The silver M11 maintains the classic brass top plate (and its heavier weight).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mowh5o"&gt;On the outside, the main difference between the M11 and its predecessors is the lack of Leica’s signature bottom plate, which had to be removed to load film or swap memory cards and batteries on the old cameras. The M11 instead adopts the slick cartridge-style battery system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/7/18253745/leica-q2-camera-announcement-price-features-specs"&gt;from the Q2&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s much faster to swap batteries or memory cards as a result. Leica says the new battery is 64 percent larger than the M10’s and can last for up to 700 shots using live view on the rear display or 1,700 shots when using the rangefinder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="J8SydJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The black M11 is 20 percent lighter than the silver model thanks to its more aluminum construction&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cnBRP7"&gt;Alongside the new battery slot is a USB-C port that can be used for data transfer (either to a computer or to a phone — the M11 is actually Made For iPhone (MFi) certified for connecting to iOS and iPadOS devices) or charging. 64GB of storage is built into the camera, and you can choose to save images to it or an SD card in a variety of configurations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KViGIt"&gt;Perhaps the most noticeable difference when using the M11 is how much lighter it is. Leica swapped the brass top plate for an aluminum one on the black model (the silver model retains the brass plate) and cut 20 percent or about 100 grams off its weight. It’s immediately noticeable and makes the black M11 easier to carry around and maneuver than prior M cameras, which were always heavier than most people would expect. Fortunately, Leica’s signature build quality is still here, and the M11 doesn’t feel any less durable than prior models. It likely won’t gain the same &lt;a href="https://www.japancamerahunter.com/tag/brassed-leica/"&gt;brassing or patina as the older models&lt;/a&gt; as it ages, however.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zT10Ry34Q9tHvviipnAyFhSnVME=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23164834/Leica_M11_black_bottom_LoRes_RGB.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Leica&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The lack of a bottom plate provides direct access to the M11’s new battery, plus a new USB-C port for connectivity and charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mFGtfZ"&gt;Despite the lighter weight, the M11 will feel immediately familiar to existing M-system photographers, and its overall shooting experience remains the same. Though the sensor is higher resolution, the processor inside is faster, and it has a couple of new tricks, such as the ability to use multi-field metering even when shooting with the rangefinder, the M11 is still a fully manual camera built for still photography. It does not shoot video of any sort, its burst rate caps out at 4.5 frames per second, and it requires manually focusing and exposing every shot, which makes it less than ideal for a lot of photography disciplines, such as sports (or keeping up with a fast-moving toddler). But those qualities are exactly the reason many Leica owners are willing to pay so much money to have one of these cameras, and it’s smart of Leica to not mess with the experience too much.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/59rL9WEx4kjvHYbpe6HKD9QgH9w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23164839/Leica_M11_HF_Ambient11.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Leica&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M11 can connect directly to an iPhone and transfer images to it using Leica’s latest Fotos app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="irEOUN"&gt;The M11 is the first in the new line of M-series cameras, and though the company is only announcing the one model today, it’ll likely be followed up with other variants in the future. If you are interested in picking one up and have the padding in your bank account to afford it, it is available for purchase through authorized Leica dealers starting today.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to keep your Zoom meetings safe and secure</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KjWD9mMwYCuSifqRf5QaM4RQnZ8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382752/VRG_ILL_4947_Zoom_secure_call.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Samar Haddad / Photo by Becca Farsace&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AkqYwl"&gt;Back in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, people who wanted to get together while staying safe from infection discovered that they could meet with friends, families, and co-workers via videoconferencing software. Maybe because many of them were already using Zoom at work for videoconferencing, that app almost immediately became the flavor of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EL3buM"&gt;There were a few hiccups along the way — possibly because Zoom was meant to be primarily a business app. At first, while Zoom included some methods that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21197090/zoombombing-zoom-stop-how-to-porn-trolls-video-chat-screen-sharing"&gt;could be used to safeguard meetings&lt;/a&gt;, those features could be hard to find, especially if you hadn’t used the app before. Meetings began to be interrupted by unwanted intruders who would purposely cause disruptions, often in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221421/white-supremacist-zoombombers-target-jewish-community-zoom"&gt;extremely nasty ways&lt;/a&gt; (a problem that was soon named “Zoombombing”).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="3HLii3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best free apps for video calling","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21286781/best-video-call-apps-free"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DGsXuc"&gt;Not surprisingly, this led to a considerable backlash, much of it concerning &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202584/zoom-security-privacy-issues-video-conferencing-software-coronavirus-demand-response"&gt;the lack of security for users&lt;/a&gt;. In response, the company put additional safety measures in place. For example, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21207643/zoom-security-privacy-zoombombing-passwords-waiting-rooms-default"&gt;automatically enabled virtual waiting rooms and passwords&lt;/a&gt; for accounts in its free and lowest-paid tiers, and encouraged people to use unique meeting IDs rather than their permanently assigned personal IDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2dcKjI"&gt;Having to deal with passwords and virtual waiting rooms may make for a slightly less friendly interface, but it also means it’s less likely somebody you don’t know will pop into your family get-together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I1OmAZ"&gt;Although there are a number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286781/best-video-call-apps-free"&gt;alternative videoconferencing services&lt;/a&gt; available, Zoom is still a popular choice. So if you’re using the free version of Zoom, here are some ways to keep your meetings secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="rIW2HG"&gt;Use a unique meeting ID and password&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KWAUCG"&gt;Zoom automatically adds passwords to accounts, and those passwords can be embedded in the meeting links. For example, if you schedule a meeting, you’ll see that the link contains your meeting ID and, right after that, the password for the meeting. Anyone you send that link to will be able to immediately gain access to your meeting without having to separately post a password — and if they decide to post that link publicly, it will negate any security the password might have provided. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hX9HTM"&gt;So while everyone who uses Zoom has a personal meeting ID, using that ID for all your meetings means more and more people will know that ID, and that increases the chances someone unwelcome may find their way in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otCFRR"&gt;For this reason, when you schedule a meeting, Zoom now assumes you want to use an automatically generated unique meeting ID rather than your personal meeting ID. In fact, there are few reasons to use that personal ID — even if you have a regularly scheduled conference with friends, you can simply send out a new invitation (with a new meeting ID) for each meeting, just to be safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xVq1rQ"&gt;If you haven’t yet created a meeting, this is the process that you will probably follow:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="7cMcbG"&gt;If you’re using the Zoom app, click on the “Schedule” button. If you’re using the web interface, click on “Schedule a meeting” on the top line. In either case, the “Schedule Meeting” window will appear.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="x1eMaI"&gt;If you wish, you can enter a meeting topic and description. Put in the date, time, and duration of your meeting. (If you’re on the free plan and there will be more than two people in your meeting, you’re limited to 40 minutes.) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="V5nAx5"&gt;Look for “Meeting ID,” and make sure that “Generate Automatically” is selected. This will generate a unique ID for that meeting rather than use your personal meeting ID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="aoZlWo"&gt;Under the Security heading, you will be assigned a passcode; you can change it if you want.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O3eUfyPT6qNu5nUSJDV7Dre_3mE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23148281/Screen_Shot_2022_01_05_at_5.17.12_PM__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CrOGBE"&gt;Below that, it’s strongly recommended that you enable “Waiting Room,” so that you can approve anyone who wants to enter the meeting space. (We’ll discuss it more in a moment.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pAtViS"&gt;Click on “Advanced Options” if you want to allow participants to join without having to use the waiting room (not recommended), mute them upon entry, automatically record the meeting, or approve or block entries from specific geographic areas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ew3d0M"&gt;Click on “Save.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="19bI73"&gt;You will most likely be brought to a page where you will see all of the options for that meeting. Halfway down, you can click “Copy the invitation” to easily save the info so you can send it to your participants. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4tl9zg"&gt;And that’s it. When you’re ready, you can click on the blue “Start this Meeting” button or use the generated meeting link.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lkEGuT"&gt;Use the virtual waiting room&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PsoudW"&gt;As mentioned before, you can approve anyone who wants to join a meeting by using a virtual waiting room, from which you can then either let them in — or not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KSaKvt"&gt;When each participant clicks on their link, they will be asked to wait, while you will get a notification at the top of your screen telling you someone has entered the waiting room. You can either immediately admit them or click on “View.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1UT0Q"&gt;A sidebar will then show you everyone who is waiting to enter the meeting; you can then either admit them, remove them from the waiting room (and from any chance to enter the meeting), or send them a message.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FfXMBpEbU3-u70Hss3ZPTsaoDsc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23150753/Screen_Shot_2022_01_06_at_3.00.11_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use the waiting room to make sure of your participants.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qlhaCl"&gt;Having to approve everyone who wants to join might be a pain to deal with, especially if you’re expecting a lot of people, but it will ensure that anyone who shows up in your meeting actually belongs there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NyU9G1"&gt;Lock down, don’t share, kick ’em out&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kWtJG6"&gt;There are other Zoom security features you can use to protect yourself and other participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bk4zE8"&gt;If you know exactly who belongs in your meeting, and they’re all there, you can lock down the meeting by clicking on the “Security” link at the bottom of the screen and choosing “Lock Meeting.” Once you do that, even somebody who has the meeting ID and password cannot get in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8CLYN"&gt;Using the same menu, it could also be a good idea, especially if you’re holding a meeting with a lot of people, to uncheck the “Share Screen” selection. If by bad luck somebody who means to disrupt the meeting is allowed to share their screen, they can make things extremely uncomfortable for the rest of the participants. (If at some point, a participant has a legitimate need to share their screen, you can re-enable sharing at any time.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmfgyH"&gt;If a participant does start to misbehave but you don’t necessarily want to kick them out (or you want to discuss what you’re going to get them for their birthday), you can put them back in the waiting room. Click on the “Participants” icon at the bottom of your screen, find the name of the participant on the resulting side panel, hover over their name, and then click on “More” &amp;gt; “Put in waiting room.” The participant will no longer have access to the meeting; in effect, they will be back in the waiting room until you decide to let them return.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Security icon leads to several ways you can handle a problem participant." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dUuSX_efrVC4G5rWzbTLmjAAeZ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23150534/Screen_Shot_2022_01_06_at_3.07.16_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Security icon leads to several ways you can handle a problem participant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="46VB0c"&gt;Of course, you can kick somebody out of the meeting entirely by using that same drop-down menu and clicking on “Remove.” If that becomes necessary, by the way, it might be a good idea to then lock the meeting so they can’t try to get back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JB5eMU"&gt;If things get really out of hand, click on the Security icon and select “Suspend Participant Activities.” &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/new-ways-to-combat-zoom-meeting-disruptions/"&gt;According to Zoom&lt;/a&gt;, this will stop “all video, audio, in-meeting chat, annotation, screen sharing, and recording during that time” and as host, you’ll be asked if you want to report any particular user. You will also be able to supply details of the problem, along with screenshots. That person will be removed from the meeting (and reported to Zoom’s “Trust and Safety” team), and you can then re-enable your various features and continue your meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q44dLV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 13th, 2022, 9AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on April 17th, 2020, and has been updated to reflect changes in Zoom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla removes 2022 production date from Cybertruck website</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-AUTOMOBILE-TESLA-CYBERTRUCK" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EHnCt22c8lkRBRGEyw5o56tjyqs=/99x0:5469x3580/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382686/1183828053.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z9xAyc"&gt;Tesla has never been fantastic at meeting deadlines, so it’s not too surprising that the company’s ambitious electric pickup — the Cybertruck — is running a little late. Recently, reference to a 2022 production schedule was scrubbed from its website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOP5XX"&gt;The Cybertruck was originally announced in 2019, with Tesla promising that the vehicle would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975475/tesla-cybertruck-announcement-musk-electric-truck-pickup-features-range-price-release-date"&gt;rolling off production lines&lt;/a&gt; in late 2021. Then, in August that year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615539/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed-2022-elon-musk"&gt;full production was delayed&lt;/a&gt; to some time in 2022. Now, that deadline seems to have been waived, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxWy3O"&gt;As first &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.edmunds.com%2Fcar-news%2Ftesla-cybertruck-delayed-2022.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F13%2F22881646%2Ftesla-cybertruck-production-date-2022-removed-website" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Edmunds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the order page on Tesla’s Cybertruck site previously told buyers: “You will be able to complete your configuration as production nears in 2022.” Now, it just says: “You will be able to complete your configuration as production nears,” with archives of the site showing reference to the year was removed &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20211219200808/https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck/design#payment"&gt;towards the end of December&lt;/a&gt; 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sfuXMn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the chip shortage, pandemic, and design challenges could all have contributed to delays&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jRMyUS"&gt;Lots of factors could contribute to a delay. These include external challenges, like the ongoing pandemic and global chip shortage (which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22423479/semiconductor-shortage-new-car-truck-prices-sales"&gt;affected all automakers&lt;/a&gt;), as well as Cybertruck-specific problems. The vehicle’s angular look is controversial, attracting awe and scorn in equal measure, but it certainly comes with unique design challenges, like the problem of creating a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828220/tesla-cybertruck-prototype-drone-shot-windshield-wiper-elon-musk"&gt;huge windshield wiper&lt;/a&gt; to cover the mammoth front window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UhuzHT"&gt;Ramping up production on the Cybertruck might also be a relatively low priority for Tesla considering its other vehicles have had fantastic years. The Model 3 became the first EV to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744481/tesla-model-3-tops-sales-charts-europe-electric-vehicles"&gt;top monthly sales charts in Europe&lt;/a&gt;, for example, while the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22863751/tesla-delivered-one-million-vehicles-2021"&gt;delivered close to 1 million cars&lt;/a&gt; in 2021 — an impressive 87 percent increase on shipments in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBBMyb"&gt;At the same time, Tesla’s competitors are moving into what could prove to be a very lucrative market for electric trucks. Ford committed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865664/ford-f150-lightning-double-production-150000-annual"&gt;doubling production of its F-150 Lightning&lt;/a&gt;, which it says will start shipping in the first half of 2022; buzzy newcomer Rivian finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2021/9/28/22697309/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-test-drive-off-roading-camp-tested"&gt;started shipping its first R1Ts to customers&lt;/a&gt;; while brands like Hummer and Chevy have their own electric trucks scheduled for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;late 2022&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22863648/chevy-silverado-electric-truck-specs-price"&gt;late 2023&lt;/a&gt; releases respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="einkVk"&gt;Tesla’s Cybertruck can afford to delay a little, but the company risks losing potential customers as it does. We should know more about the vehicle’s future soon, though. Tesla CEO Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1466800941269667841"&gt;promised to share&lt;/a&gt; a “Product roadmap update” for the Cybertruck on the next Tesla earnings call. That’s scheduled for January 26th. Not long to wait.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy S21 FE review: just off the mark</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;You should probably buy the Pixel 6 instead&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="LGdSLx"&gt;There’s a category in the smartphone market that has emerged over the past few years that I’ll call “value flagships.” Buying one feels a little like getting away with something — nearly all the features of a high-end device with a significantly lower price. Phones like the iPhone SE, Pixel A-series, and Samsung’s Galaxy S20 FE are classics of the genre, combining the right features for the right price at the right time. With its second entry in the category — the Galaxy S21 FE — Samsung is just a little off the mark on all the elements that would have made this a great value flagship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yn39O7"&gt;The S21 FE arrives very late in the S21 family’s product cycle, taking some of the shine off of the “this year’s flagship for less” appeal. It also offers just about everything you get from the standard S21, with the exception of a couple fewer gigs of RAM, a lower-quality telephoto camera, and a slightly larger screen. But at $699 it’s also not significantly cheaper than the $799 S21. Considering that the S21 is often discounted and that the S22 is likely to arrive soon, the S21 FE doesn’t look like much of a deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6vhuw"&gt;No doubt, the S21 FE is a good device. Its Snapdragon 888 processor and 6GB of RAM provide seamless, fast performance for most tasks. A 6.4-inch OLED screen offers smooth scrolling with its 120Hz refresh rate. And even with a big, bright, high refresh rate screen, its battery will take you through a full day. It’s just hard to recommend it to anyone when just $100 more will get you the S21 — and $100 less will buy the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;very good Google Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8gsWSA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10974661"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Prj0nwwxLY04hOolUfQvKdyDKFQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142237/ajohnson_220102_4951_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21 FE’s 6.4-inch screen features a 120Hz refresh rate, making animations and scrolling super smooth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ebxaqu"&gt;The S21 FE features a 6.4-inch 1080p OLED screen that’s bright and vibrant with rich blacks — classic Samsung. Bezels are very slim, and that 120Hz refresh rate makes animations and scrolling oh so smooth. There’s Gorilla Glass Victus protecting the front panel and the frame is aluminum. A quick, reliable optical fingerprint scanner is embedded in the display. So far, so flagship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NYmtA"&gt;The back is composite plastic rather than a higher-end glass panel, but such is the case with the S21, too. The S21 FE’s camera bump is plastic rather than the metal finish that bleeds into the chassis on the S21, so that’s a little bit of a value concession. But with the other high-end components and a lovely screen to look at, this feels like a device on the very highest rung of the midrange ladder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="K4bMoF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;this feels like a device on the very highest rung of the midrange ladder&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="77bVrJ"&gt;There’s a 4,500mAh battery on board that easily lasted through a day of moderate use in my testing. Power users may find themselves in the single digit battery percentage at the end of a day, especially with the screen smoothness setting at its 120Hz default. There’s no option for a variable refresh rate, which would help conserve battery life while using the higher refresh rate setting — just standard 60Hz or 120Hz. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBI0QS"&gt;The S21 FE supports 15W fast-ish wireless charging and faster 25W wired charging. A power adapter is not included in the box — just a USB-C cable. The S21 FE doesn’t support fast charging over a computer’s USB port, so if you want the best speeds and don’t have a compatible power brick on hand you’ll need to buy one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Biaoqfwf-uQICSE7ZkUWEE1Njo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142240/ajohnson_220102_4951_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overall performance is excellent with a top-shelf Snapdragon 888 processor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="zJNxzG"&gt;The S21 FE includes the same top-notch Snapdragon 888 processor as the rest of the S21 series, but offers 6GB of RAM as the base model option compared to the S21’s 8GB. I didn’t see this having any significant impact in day-to-day use; the S21 FE opens apps quickly and jumping between them is seamless. The phone got warm playing &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Mobile&lt;/em&gt; but kept up with the action. The only place I notice a bit of lag is in the live preview using portrait mode on the camera, but that’s a processing-intensive mode and I wouldn’t expect seamless rendering. For most purposes, performance is very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y8lCvT"&gt;The S21 FE ships with Android 12-based One UI 4.0 and all of the new system customization options it has to offer. If you set a photo as your wallpaper, the phone will suggest a complementary color palette to apply to buttons and icons. You can also scale and adjust your homescreen and lock screen wallpaper independently. Best of all, the stock weather app no longer features conspicuous ads at the top of the screen — just some links to clickbaity Weather Channel articles toward the bottom, which I can live with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jIOLTVTm2NWjrnGvIuBEYYNbNc8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142239/ajohnson_220102_4951_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21 FE offers the same 12-megapixel rear camera as the S21, but its ultrawide and telephoto modules are different.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="0mkTWc"&gt;The S21 FE features the same main rear camera — a 12-megapixel f/1.8 module with optical stabilization — as the standard S21. The telephoto camera is different, though, with a much smaller 8-megapixel sensor and 3x optical zoom rather than the S21’s 64-megapixel 3x hybrid digital / optical zoom. Still, it’s a stabilized, true optical telephoto camera, and those aren’t exactly guaranteed in the under-$800 class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0uM488"&gt;It is possible to take 30x hybrid zoom images with the S21 FE, but the camera is working with a lot less data than the S21, so photos at that length look (predictably) like watercolors. Photos at the native 3x zoom look much better — even in dim indoor lighting, I managed to get some acceptably sharp portrait mode photos with the zoom lens. That is no small feat for a tiny sensor. Personally, I’d prefer if the main camera was the default for portrait mode rather than the zoom, but that might be just me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="T20DTF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10974713"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6QDwUg"&gt;The S21 FE’s main camera performs well overall. Photos are bright and saturated, as we expect from Samsung, and night mode renders an impressive amount of detail, provided your subject isn’t moving. It can’t quite match the Pixel 6’s camera for detail retention, in either night or standard shooting modes, and the S21 FE’s warmer, more saturated look isn’t my favorite. It’s not the very best camera in its class, but it does a reliably good job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilOpdJ"&gt;There’s an ultrawide camera, too, which is slightly less wide than the S21’s. The 32-megapixel front-facing camera is a fixed-focus affair, whereas the S21’s selfie cam offers autofocus. The first time you use the selfie camera it asks you to choose between “natural” and “bright” color tones. As someone who prefers the natural setting, I appreciate that I didn’t have to dive into the menu to find it. Both the ultrawide and selfie cameras do their jobs just fine, and I don’t suspect that prospective S21 FE owners will care too much about the differences between them and their S21 counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/upwKDy-O6wfAM0xYH8HjK7xtxsQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142236/ajohnson_220102_4951_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The components are right, but the price and timing leave the S21 FE in a strange spot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="kzftDP"&gt;Despite all of those positive qualities I just ran through, the S21 FE is a fine phone that makes sense for very few people. Those who don’t have any particular allegiance to Samsung would probably be very happy with the Pixel 6 for $100 less. It meets or exceeds the S21 FE’s capabilities in just about every way — it has a better camera, is built with premium materials on the front and back, includes a little more RAM, and offers comparable performance from its new Google-designed Tensor chip. True, you don’t get a telephoto camera (that’s reserved for the $899 6 Pro) and its top screen refresh rate is 90Hz, not 120Hz. If those features are worth an extra $100 to you, then consider the S21 FE. All others should proceed to the Pixel 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y3oYv9"&gt;If you are a committed Samsung Fan, then you probably don’t mind paying an extra $100 for the S21 to get an extra couple of bells and whistles. In fact, you probably have already. With its lower cost and composite back panel, the S21 is kind of already the Fan Edition of the S21 series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Gd7HcD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Galaxy S21 FE leaves me with very little to complain about, but not a lot to recommend it above the alternatives&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CCn61A"&gt;Still, there’s something to be said for a phone with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;very good support policy&lt;/a&gt; (three major OS updates and four years of security updates), a decent telephoto camera, and (mostly) top-shelf components that costs well under $1,000. I’d typically steer potential buyers to the Pixel phone for faster software updates, but Samsung appears to be committed to at least getting the major OS updates out earlier than in previous years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="RTjIxP"&gt;The Galaxy S21 FE leaves me with very little to complain about, but not a lot to recommend it above the alternatives. If you’ve held off this long waiting for it and you don’t want to wait another few weeks to see what the S22 might offer, then by all means buy this phone. But if you’re more of a casual observer than a fan, I don’t think this is the device for you.&lt;/p&gt;
