    <title>Amazon and GoPro are suing Chinese sellers over counterfeit tripods and grips</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hCZoQK"&gt;Last June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302114/amazon-counterfeit-crimes-unit-knockoffs-store-online-investigators"&gt;Amazon created a Counterfeit Crimes Unit&lt;/a&gt; to fight the knockoffs plaguing its gigantic storefront, and today, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210809005578/en/Amazon-and-GoPro-File-Joint-Lawsuit-against-Counterfeiters"&gt;announcing its first action&lt;/a&gt; against purveyors of fake gadgets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0C5MNi"&gt;Amazon and GoPro have sued seven Chinese nationals and a pair of businesses for distributing hard-to-detect knockoffs of its “Handler” floating camera hand grip and “3-Way” tripod grip, ones that blatantly use GoPro’s own logo, in an April 2021 lawsuit that’s just now being unsealed — because there’s a parallel criminal investigation in China against these same sellers, the complaint reveals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHKUzw"&gt;While the lawsuit doesn’t say how many people actually bought these counterfeit GoPro accessories, it suggests at least some buyers were fooled by the fake products. One wrote they were “very disappointed it was provided by GOPRO. I will not purchase any more products of this brand from now on.” Others were more skeptical: “[It] can’t be a real GoPro stick because it rusted after two days,” wrote another customer, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Tripod comparison picture shows a smaller button on the fake, and different patterns of dots." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TvRiqD7w8LsxGzHAcH1c_3IayD8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22771922/amazon_gopro_counterfeit_tripods.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon lawsuit&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Many different GoPro fake handles, showing their logos and darker colored foam compare to a legit one" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rvpwnr6MeLGNEli8vgHK_wz8NrQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22771921/amazon_gopro_counterfeit_handles.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon lawsuit&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="This image shows a handle with a clear GoPro logo on it." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ve3qSagbbnxLCeJE7B6GeK2vq2U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22771920/amazon_gopro_counterfeit_handle.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon lawsuit&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LqtClX"&gt;The differences appear to be fairly subtle: counterfeit tripods, for example, might weigh a little bit less, have a rougher surface, a smaller button, and a different number of “dots” in different places on the arm. The foam might be a slightly darker color, too. It’s not clear why Chinese companies would see the need to counterfeit these products, given that GoPro’s camera mount is an exceptionally easy thing to find third-party attachments for, but perhaps they thought an official logo would help them stand out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="stUTxc"&gt;Amazon says it blocked the entire Amazon seller accounts of these defendants after counterfeits were brought to the company’s attention and that it sent samples of their products to GoPro to help the investigation. Referring these cases to law enforcement is part of the standard procedure, Amazon Counterfeit Crimes Unit head Kebharu Smith &lt;a href="https://www.theglobalipcenter.com/fighting-fakes-5-questions-for-amazons-counterfeit-crimes-unit/"&gt;said earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZyojQH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon’s CCU is composed of former federal prosecutors and investigators&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qnyij0"&gt;While it is the first gadget suit from Amazon’s Counterfeit Crimes Unit, it’s not the first suit it’s filed. We covered a previous suit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562758/instagram-influencer-counterfeit-gucci-dior-amazon-fake-listing"&gt;against sellers of fake luxury goods&lt;/a&gt;, and the company says it’s filed joint lawsuits like this GoPro one with other companies, including “apparel manufacturer HanesBrands, Italian luxury brands Valentino and Ferragamo, cosmetics brand KF Beauty, family travel accessory brand JL Childress, cooler manufacturer YETI, family-owned-and-operated card game company Dutch Blitz, and global board game publisher Asmodee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPSdgD"&gt;Amazon has a long-running problem with counterfeit goods, and other companies have sued before: Apple claimed in 2016 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/20/13343682/fake-apple-chargers-amazon-lawsuit"&gt;that 90 percent of Apple chargers sold on Amazon were fake&lt;/a&gt;, and reporters were able to find quite a few counterfeits &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/30/17301714/amazon-counterfeit-goods-crackdown"&gt;even after Amazon’s subsequent crackdown&lt;/a&gt;. We wrote in 2019 about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/29/20837359/amazon-basics-fake-sellers-imposters-third-party-marketplace"&gt;how Amazon’s own AmazonBasics products were getting knocked off&lt;/a&gt;. I remember purchasing a counterfeit SanDisk SD card from Amazon a while back myself. “Welcome to the era of fake products,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/blog/amazon-counterfeit-fake-products/"&gt;wrote &lt;em&gt;Wirecutter &lt;/em&gt;last February&lt;/a&gt;, providing a variety of Amazon examples. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="NCiDto"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon just got Fakespot booted off Apple’s iOS App Store","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580611/fakespot-ios-app-apple-amazon-fake-reviews"},{"title":"Another Amazon-first gadget brand has suspiciously vanished: Choetech","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22567530/amazon-choetech-removed-pulled-aukey-mpow"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JgKnCF"&gt;Amazon suggests that, thanks to its efforts, the problem might not be as big as suspected: &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-brand-protection-report"&gt;it released a Brand Protection Report this May&lt;/a&gt; that states the company seized and destroyed more than 2 million counterfeits before they were sent to customers, that it blocked 10 billion “suspected bad listings” before they appeared on the store, and that “fewer than 0.01% of all products sold on Amazon received a counterfeit complaint from customers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2z0BNo"&gt;Amazon doesn’t publicly say how many products it has on its storefront, though, so it’s impossible to tell how large “0.01%” might be, and thus how many goods might have actually made it through. It’s also not clear how many customers would know they’d been sold fake goods, and think to complain, in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbdJQ6"&gt;GoPro declined to comment for this story.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dish says its will launch wireless 5G service in beta at the end of September</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jj7W-ZCC1g6M24nmInn6CPhDh84=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69700580/acastro_200804_1777_dish_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dish aims to cover 70% of the US population by mid-2023 with wireless service.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ct2cfr"&gt;On an earnings call today, Dish Network execs said that its Las Vegas 5G wireless service is in the final phase of construction and will launch in beta by the end of September. That keeps it just in line with the Q3 deployment goal it gave earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZpGzT"&gt;The beta launch is an important first step toward its commitment to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/8931827/dish-carrier-plans-5g-network-tmobile-sprint-us-confirms"&gt;covering 70 percent of the US population by June 2023&lt;/a&gt;, a target that’s looking more ambitious by the day as the company continues to lose wireless customers. It lost 161,000 subscribers in Q1 of this year, and it just &lt;a href="https://ir.dish.com/news-releases/news-release-details/dish-network-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-results"&gt;reported a net loss of 201,000 wireless subscribers&lt;/a&gt; in Q2. The company stands to lose even more of its remaining 8.9 million wireless subscribers as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598163/t-mobile-metro-5g-prepaid-boost-cricket-switch-promotion"&gt;T-Mobile has unveiled a generous promotion&lt;/a&gt; aimed at the very customers it was required to sell to Dish as part of the Sprint merger deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TuuRe8"&gt;Dish says the Vegas beta will last a minimum of 90 days, during which it plans to gather customer feedback and troubleshoot issues as its technology transitions from the lab to the real world — chairman Charlie Ergen acknowledges that the network won’t work perfectly at first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuO44z"&gt;Dish also recently signed an agreement with AT&amp;amp;T, on which it will rely for the majority of its service as a wireless service reseller (MVNO) while it goes about building its own network. On today’s call, Dish clarified the role that its new partner will play in the beta launch. It says that the majority of network use in its Las Vegas launch will be on its own network, with AT&amp;amp;T and existing partner T-Mobile’s networks providing some roaming support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1POU7"&gt;Curious to try it out yourself? Anyone interested in testing out the network as part of the beta program can sign up for more information through &lt;a href="https://launch.5gmobilegenesis.com/"&gt;Dish’s Project Genesis website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hackers reportedly threaten to leak data from Gigabyte ransomware attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/84dJoGaq9kNEvs3ZI0hQUbmqRqc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69700522/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RSy9MW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/computer-hardware-giant-gigabyte-hit-by-ransomexx-ransomware/"&gt;Gigabyte has been the victim of a cyberattack&lt;/a&gt;, which was reportedly the work of a ransomware outfit called RansomEXX. &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/motherboard-vendor-gigabyte-hit-by-ransomexx-ransomware-gang/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the attack didn’t have an impact on any of the company’s production systems, but it did affect some internal servers. Currently, some parts of Gigabyte’s website, including its support section, are down, giving customers issues when &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/p0ym6x/trying_to_rma_gigabyte_rtx_2080_super/"&gt;trying to access warranty repair information&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gigabyte/comments/p0uu5x/anyone_have_a_copy_of_the_f4_bios_update_for_the/"&gt;updates&lt;/a&gt;. The hackers who claim to have carried out the attack are reportedly threatening to release data from the company, including confidential documents from Intel, AMD, and American Megatrends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUVn3o"&gt;Gigabyte is mainly known for its PC components such as motherboards and graphics cards, but it also has a line of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22299226/gigabyte-aorus-15g-review-gaming-laptop-price-specs-features"&gt;laptops&lt;/a&gt; and peripherals like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382201/gigabyte-aorus-4k-gaming-monitor-tv-oled"&gt;gaming monitors&lt;/a&gt;, which are often branded with the Aorus name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u0DRNn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hackers included screenshots of documents under NDAs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hnqs2B"&gt;According to a ransom note and dark web webpage, seen by &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/computer-hardware-giant-gigabyte-hit-by-ransomexx-ransomware/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/motherboard-vendor-gigabyte-hit-by-ransomexx-ransomware-gang/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, RansomEXX threatens to publish 112GB of data it got from Gigabyte and an American Megatrends Git repo. &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt; reports that the hackers also include screenshots of documents from Intel, AMD, and American Megatrends that are under an NDA. American Megatrends creates firmware for motherboard and computer manufacturers as well as for &lt;a href="https://www.ami.com/products/bios-uefi-firmware/chromebook-firmware/"&gt;certain Chromebook manufacturers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_RtCQ0SfpmrE3fsYdb37MG8LLok=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22771758/Screen_Shot_2021_08_09_at_11.05.07_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Various parts of Gigabyte’s website are nonfunctional.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M07l9j"&gt;PC manufacturers aren’t an uncommon target for hackers: earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/20/22341642/acer-ransomware-microsoft-exchange-revil-security"&gt;Acer was reportedly hit with an attack&lt;/a&gt; by the REvil group, which would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396283/apple-schematics-leak-ransomware-quanta-supplier-leak"&gt;later go on to target one&lt;/a&gt; of Apple’s suppliers. In both cases, hackers threatened to release valuable data if the companies didn’t pay exorbitantly high ransoms of $50 million. The scourge of ransomware has also gone beyond traditional tech companies, affecting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/17/21443851/death-ransomware-attack-hospital-germany-cybersecurity"&gt;hospitals&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/8/22426158/cyberattack-forces-shutdown-major-us-fuel-colonial-pipeline"&gt;fuel pipelines&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22446388/cna-insurance-ransomware-attack-40-million-dollar-ransom"&gt;insurance companies&lt;/a&gt;, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4CzVXP"&gt;In Gigabyte’s case, the sum that the hackers are seeking doesn’t yet appear to be public. &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer&lt;/em&gt; reports, however, that RansomEXX’s ransom notes direct companies to contact an email address to start negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8THiA"&gt;Gigabyte didn’t respond to a request for comment, but it &lt;a href="https://therecord.media/motherboard-vendor-gigabyte-hit-by-ransomexx-ransomware-gang/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Record&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the company has isolated the affected servers, notified law enforcement, and is beginning an investigation. Gigabyte hasn't publicly named RansomEXX as the responsible party.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is now testing ads in the Shop tab</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qm316OkjmIHz_wwn3lB3QyRRMTM=/0x0:1224x816/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69700385/instahomescreen.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X6DUy2"&gt;If you thought Instagram had run out of ad real estate, think again. The company confirmed to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/09/instagram-tests-ads-in-its-shop-tab/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s starting a new test that’ll involve putting ads on its Shop tab. Ads will involve either a single image or carousel of them, and of course, will be shoppable. Only certain advertisers will have access at first, but there are plans to expand the product in the future. (Initial US-based partners include Away, Fenty Beauty, and Clare paint.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ShVqc"&gt;Of course, it’s no surprise Instagram is trying more ads in more places — that’s Instagram and its parent company Facebook’s main revenue driver. Earlier this year, Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22537297/instagram-reels-ads-launch-globally"&gt;officially rolled out&lt;/a&gt; ads in Reels, another new format that debuted only last year. The company also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396841/instagram-reels-ads-stickers-video-facebook"&gt;began testing&lt;/a&gt; sticker ads, which would allow people to include stickers in their stories advertising a product. Users will receive a cut of any revenue made through people tapping on the sticker and buying a product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuDtf8"&gt;Basically, if there’s unused space on Instagram, you should expect ads to show up there soon enough. It’s unclear how successful these ads are in driving purchases, but brands presumably will want to try it out regardless, if only to ensure their products are seen by Instagram’s billion users.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Substack is getting into comics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A drawing of a person in a suit pointing toward a UFO in the sky" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jD9HjbAdsDsxxS3mFDLwQFAFgIQ=/0x133:1430x1086/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69700345/7dad39ad_a226_4caa_8c3b_9bde1b853163_1430x1217.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: A teaser for one of James Tynion IV’s Substack projects | Michael Avon Oeming&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i1tAmT"&gt;Substack is trying to put a new spin on webcomics. The newsletter platform announced today that it’s signed a number of comics creators up to use its platform. They’ll email comics out to readers and use Substack’s subscription tools to charge directly for access to their work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqLrBm"&gt;It’s a new type of content for Substack, which has predominantly been focused on (written) newsletters covering topics like politics, tech, and culture. But the expansion to comics makes plenty of sense. Comics have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18295369/webcomics-xkcd-questionable-content-dinosaur-comics-90s-internet-social-media"&gt;long been successful online&lt;/a&gt;, but they’ve largely been supported by ads and merch sales. Substack offers comics creators a chance at something a little closer to selling readers a new issue at the store each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FeIRoD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Substack has started funding podcasters, too&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k9qSlS"&gt;Among the creators signed up is &lt;a href="https://jamestynioniv.substack.com/p/a-whole-new-era"&gt;James Tynion IV&lt;/a&gt;, who until now was the head writer of DC’s flagship &lt;em&gt;Batman &lt;/em&gt;title. Tynion wrote in a blog post that he will be using Substack to “create a new slate of original comic book properties” and build “a bunch of really cool stuff on my own terms.” Substack has also signed up &lt;a href="https://www.copperbottle.net/p/welcome-to-copper-bottle?showWelcome=true"&gt;Saladin Ahmed&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://ostertag.substack.com/welcome"&gt;Molly Knox Ostertag&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://bestjackettpress.substack.com/"&gt;Scott Snyder&lt;/a&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sRRC4z"&gt;Substack is available for anyone to use for free, but it’s been signing writers to a program called Substack Pro that offers them upfront payments and support, so they can try going independent without being entirely reliant on subscribers (who may not materialize) during their first year or so on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wyp3Bs"&gt;The people Substack signs up can also speak to where the platform wants to attract more writers, so today’s announcement can be seen as a sign to other comics artists that they may want to consider the newsletter format. If it continues to focus on comics — and who knows just how good of a reading experience Substack will be for visuals — the platform could pull some users away from Patreon, which has been big with artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRub3c"&gt;Substack has also been trying to expand into podcasts. The service has its own podcast player and publishing tool, and it just backed &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/substack-funding-podcasts-investment-04b70b34-dc02-4f68-af89-196390f7dd63.html"&gt;the launch of a new podcast network&lt;/a&gt; last month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s updated data transfer tool can port events to Google Calendar</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wbnspc"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/improving-user-experience-in-our-transfer-your-information-tool/"&gt;has updated&lt;/a&gt; its data transfer tool, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/tyi/"&gt;Transfer Your Information&lt;/a&gt;, with two new destinations for information associated with your Facebook account: Photobucket and Google Calendar (&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/facebook-data-transfer-photobucket-google-calendar-105303219.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Facebook allowed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280583/facebook-google-photos-transfer-tool-data-sharing-project-images-video"&gt;photo transfers to services like Google Photos&lt;/a&gt; in the past, but the company says Facebook Events are a new data type for the tool it created as part of &lt;a href="https://datatransferproject.dev/"&gt;the Data Transfer Project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8j63X"&gt;Support for Photobucket and Google Calendar comes alongside a larger redesign of Transfer Your Information, which Facebook claims makes the service “simpler and more intuitive.” Among the improvements, it should be easier to see the status of each transfer, start multiple transfers to the same location, and filter through and select what data you actually want to move.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZH5VU9"&gt;Transfer Your Information has expanded since &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2019/12/data-portability-photo-transfer-tool/"&gt;Facebook launched the service in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of Facebook’s tool and its participation in the Data Transfer Project &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17589246/data-transfer-project-google-facebook-microsoft-twitter"&gt;with Microsoft, Google, Twitter, and Apple&lt;/a&gt; is to allow users to transfer their information between platforms and services without having to download it first. Members of the project develop “adapters” between their various proprietary APIs, so for example, Facebook Photos can transfer over to Google Photos without confusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="OCvkBS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook’s tool for transferring media to Google Photos is now available for everyone ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280583/facebook-google-photos-transfer-tool-data-sharing-project-images-video"},{"title":"Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Twitter partner for ambitious new data project ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/20/17589246/data-transfer-project-google-facebook-microsoft-twitter"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="GGZgQZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senators reach deal over cryptocurrency tax reporting in infrastructure package</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cynthia Lummis and Pat Toomey" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/siBB3NzTyAox9VW1bIxyuhLQxOU=/0x0:5414x3609/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69700277/1234592087.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xeJ6Ss"&gt;A bipartisan group of senators reached an agreement Monday on a cryptocurrency tax reporting requirement that complicated passage of the $550 billion infrastructure package late last week. Still, it’s unclear if the amendment will receive a vote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9OKLeX"&gt;Last week, the Senate released an over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605917/senate-negotiators-bipartisan-infrastructure-broadband-electric-vehicles-cryptocurrency"&gt;$1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; package that included over $550 billion in new spending to strengthen roads, bridges, and other physical infrastructure like high-speed broadband. The bill also sought to institute new tax reporting requirements for cryptocurrency transactions, a provision that would raise an estimated $28 billion to offset some infrastructure costs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lzyPv9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re not proposing anything sweeping or anything radical”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KxiF8g"&gt;But the digital assets community and lawmakers like Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) argued that the proposed definition of “broker” was too vague and could extend reporting requirements to wallet developers and miners. Over the following days, dueling bipartisan groups of senators worked to remedy the problem, ending in today’s agreement. Sens. Pat Toomey (R-PA) and Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) announced the change Monday in an amendment that would clarify who would be considered a broker for cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1M89Q"&gt;“We came together to provide greater clarity on the rules for who are the actual brokers of a cryptocurrency,” Toomey said at a press conference Monday. “We’re not proposing anything sweeping or anything radical.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EBgPHa"&gt;Notably, Wyden was not signed on to Monday’s amendment clarifying the language. A source familiar told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the senator did not put his name on the amendment because he feared that future administrations could read the proposed language and interpret it as including miners and developers. The amendment text has yet to be released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LY6p0r"&gt;“We’ve been working hard to get a deal,” Wyden said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/1424731514147938304"&gt;in a tweet Monday&lt;/a&gt;. “I don’t believe the cryptocurrency amendment language on offer is good enough to protect privacy and security, but it’s certainly better than the underlying bill.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QZBWCy"&gt;The announcement comes after the Senate held a series of procedural votes late Sunday to advance the original bill, including the controversial cryptocurrency language. If the Senate does not approve the amendment unanimously before Tuesday, the original language could ensnare software developers as brokers. According to Wyden, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said he would not block a vote on the amendment. Still, a unanimous consent vote would require all senators to vote to approve the amendment, and it’s not clear if any lawmakers plan to object, as of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1pZx4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fantasian wraps up with part two release on August 13th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lgUQhIj0UdrbC5vIpukvmAVQBFQ=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69700059/ss007.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cxtx4f"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22383403/fantasian-review-apple-arcade-rpg-iphone-ipad"&gt;a beautiful roleplaying game from &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; creator Hironobu Sakaguchi&lt;/a&gt;, first debuted on Apple Arcade, it wasn’t actually the full game. Instead, it was described as the first part of a longer story. Now the conclusion to that story is almost upon us: part two of &lt;em&gt;Fantasian &lt;/em&gt;is launching this Friday, August 13th as part of Arcade’s weekly update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wXOEht"&gt;According to developer Mistwalker, the second half features “anywhere between 40 to 60 hours for players to experience.” It also introduces 50 new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2021/3/2/22309074/fantasian-diorama-rpg-apple-arcade-hironobu-sakaguchi"&gt;handcrafted vistas to explore&lt;/a&gt;, along with 34 new songs from famed composer Nobuo Uematsu. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586744/fantasian-soundtrack-apple-music-nobuo-uematsu"&gt;His work on the game is also currently streaming on Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="45GpQa"&gt;In a statement, Sakaguchi said that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Mjgbo8"&gt;The release of Part 2 of &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt; marks the completion of the saga. It ended up being, rather unexpectedly, about twice the volume of Part 1 and is more quest-driven, giving players the ability to progress through the world at their own pace. Boss encounters are even more unique than before. On behalf of all the dev team members, diorama artisans, and musical talent including Uematsu-san — I think we can safely say that we left nothing on the table. We have carefully sculpted the experience preserving the ‘warmth’ of the dioramas with every attention to detail. I encourage everyone to experience this mysterious ‘emotional’ energy, which is at the very heart of &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="JQ76c1"&gt;Alongside &lt;em&gt;Fantasian&lt;/em&gt;’s big update, Apple’s gaming service will also get a brand-new game on Friday called &lt;em&gt;Wurdweb&lt;/em&gt;. It’s described as a “relaxing word puzzle game,” and it was co-developed by Aran Koning (part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/2/18287223/sokpop-collective-patreon-experimental-games-subscription-crowdfunding-creators"&gt;the Sokpop Collective&lt;/a&gt;) and Adriaan de Jongh (best-known for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/20/15837528/hidden-folks-iphone-steam-factory-update"&gt;his work on &lt;em&gt;Hidden Folks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ariana Grande’s Fortnite tour was a moment years in the making</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xrR0eTo1s8qhtFkB9fWN_KDX9ro=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69700007/Fortnite_20210807141447.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M2Sqt7"&gt;It’s hard to overstate just how weird &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is. At one point, while I was waiting for the game’s virtual Ariana Grande concert this weekend, three identical versions of Rick from &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt; surrounded me and started dancing. Later, I walked by a pair of Marshmellos lounging in identical yellow beanbag chairs. The first show I went to I dressed as Travis Scott; later, I wore a Toronto Raptors jersey and had a dancing baby Groot strapped to my back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v0ywGd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s crash commercialism, where seemingly every fictional world collides with real-world celebrities in a battle royale game, can definitely be off-putting at times. But it also leads to some extremely cool moments, particularly when it comes to live events. And the Ariana Grande concert wasn’t just another exciting live music experience — it also built on &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s history in fascinating ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0tdpwi"&gt;For a game about dropping onto a colorful island with the intent of killing people, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18537469/fortnite-map-island-history-neo-tilted-volcano"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has a surprising amount of history&lt;/a&gt;, due largely to the fact that developer Epic is constantly experimenting. Players who have stuck around for a while will remember key, game-shaping moments like when a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/27/17785756/fortnite-mystery-cube-obsession"&gt;mysterious cube rolled around the island&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/30/17521122/fortnite-rocket-launch-epic-games-dimensional-rift"&gt;when a rocket launched and cracked the sky&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913541/fortnite-game-shutdown-black-hole-event-storytelling"&gt;that time a black hole birthed an entirely new map&lt;/a&gt;. These moments can even make all of the heavy-handed licensed aspects of the game feel strangely natural, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402707/fortnite-chapter-2-season-4-marvel-nexus-war-thor-iron-man"&gt;like when the island was inundated with iconic Marvel locations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gwhG6T"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gGYElBtjytU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gRnxGY"&gt;The Ariana Grande tour felt like the culmination of this kind of integrated storytelling. Whereas previous concerts, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/2/18208223/fortnite-epic-games-marshmello-concert-exciting-bizarre-future-music"&gt;Marshmello&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt;, were one-off experiences, the Grande event tied into multiple aspects of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Right now, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22519431/fortnite-season-7-superman-flying-saucers-aliens"&gt;the game is in the midst of an alien invasion&lt;/a&gt;. There are new sci-fi weapons to play with, flying saucers that suck up players, and an imposing mothership that floats above the island. Before players even knew a concert was happening, one of those saucers parked right above the center of the map and projected a holographic countdown clock &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595880/fortnite-alien-event-date-chapter-2-season-7"&gt;teasing something big on August 6th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="rxITML"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10462338"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zqcyc8"&gt;Once things started, the event was different from past &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; concerts, as it was about more than just music. Before Ariana Grande even appeared, players were ushered through a portal, where they saw glimpses of some of those big in-game events, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/4/18529463/fortnite-unvaulting-volcano-eruption-tilted-towers-destroyed-season-9"&gt;like the erupting volcano&lt;/a&gt;. What followed was a series of mini-game-style experiences: players slid along a paint-covered slide, bounced around a fluffy world straight out of &lt;em&gt;The Lorax&lt;/em&gt;, and piloted a plane to take down former &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; raid boss the Storm King.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lYwT1U"&gt;Finally, in a black room lit by stars, a towering Grande appeared, taking players through an extremely surreal world. There were giant floating bubbles in the sky, a ride on a glittering llama, an M.C. Escher-style castle, and finally the pop star emerging from a crack in the ground to smash all of her fans with a bejeweled hammer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FegCng"&gt;It was a lot of fun. But more importantly, it felt intrinsically &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. From the way the tour was announced, to the tie-ins with aliens and iconic &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; moments and imagery, it was another part of the game’s ever-growing mythos. Only this time with a pop star involved. Grande even looked like a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; character, with glowing white eyes and a dress made of shimmering shards of glass. (You can, of course, buy a skin so you can play as her in-game.) And now that the tour is over, there are still a series of in-game quests for players to dig through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAfzfx"&gt;Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games"&gt;Epic’s chief creative officer Donald Mustard described &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; as&lt;/a&gt; “an opportunity to almost create a new medium.” He meant that the game and its scale offered a chance to tell stories in a novel way; &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t have a traditional plot or characters, but instead uses live events and its ever-changing world as tools to create a long-running narrative. Steadily, nearly every aspect of the game has been pulled into this focus on storytelling, even the copious licensed tie-ins. In &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, there’s little difference between &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;Galactus attacking the island&lt;/a&gt; and Ariana Grande showing up to perform. In this game, a concert is no longer just a concert: it’s lore.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rocket League’s next season brings changes to tournaments and a new cowboy-themed car</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bDnKUN85szKFwQ4l-03AduePISs=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69699886/VVlyZVbU.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new car available in &lt;/em&gt;Rocket League’s&lt;em&gt; fourth season.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Psyonix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jRaANz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;’s fourth season kicks off on Wednesday, bringing some big changes to tournaments, a setting to turn off copyrighted music, and a new cowboy-themed car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EspxBT"&gt;The changes to tournaments, which developer Psyonix &lt;a href="https://www.rocketleague.com/news/2v2-tournaments-and-more-coming-in-season-4/"&gt;first revealed on August 5th&lt;/a&gt;, include a new 2v2 mode, giving you an option to team up with just one other friend in competitive play. Psyonix is also adding many more tournaments — there will be “between eight and 13” more tournaments in each region, Psyonix said. And in addition to the new 2v2 and current 3v3 mode, the studio will host Extra Mode tournaments that will cycle between modes like Rumble (which has randomized power-ups), Hoops (a basketball-like mode), and Snow Day (&lt;em&gt;Rocket League’s &lt;/em&gt;take on hockey).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6uiyns"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Get the Outlaw car in the Rocket Pass&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DZiuzO"&gt;Season 4 will also add a new setting that allows players to turn off copyright-protected music in the game, which could help streamers avoid getting DMCA takedown notifications. If you flip on this setting, copyrighted audio will be “muted or replaced by music that is free to use,” Psyonix says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GalEjZ"&gt;The cowboy-themed Outlaw car will be available as part of the season four Rocket Pass, which is the game’s take on a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-style battle pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFVdow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; season 4 will kick off on Wednesday at 11AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
