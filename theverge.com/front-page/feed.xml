    <title>Unannounced Beats Studio Buds appear in Apple’s latest beta software</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YVUMMi"&gt;Aside from churning out some limited edition colors, Beats has been in a bit of a quiet period since the release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522700/beats-flex-wireless-earbuds-review"&gt;the Beats Flex last October&lt;/a&gt;. But it seems that the Apple-owned brand is preparing to launch some new, high-end earbuds. As spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/beats-studio-buds/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, there are images of “Beats Studio Buds” in the latest beta releases of iOS and tvOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0cddl"&gt;The unannounced earbuds look much different than the Powerbeats Pro, which have become a popular pick among the fitness crowd. These don’t have any ear hooks whatsoever, and they seem to have a diagonal steam that extends slightly upward. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cRM2SAivqimLhJi-GGG5tQc_CXs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520853/beats.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/05/17/beats-studio-buds/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gwUzHB"&gt;These images being included in “release candidate” builds of Apple’s software could mean that the Beats Studio Buds are due to be announced in the near future. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Beats for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nnnNfQ"&gt;Apple is also expected to update its main AirPods earbuds sometime this year with a revamped design featuring shortened stems and other aesthetic details borrowed from the AirPods Pro. But they’re likely to retain the hard plastic, one-size-fits-most fit. Beats, however, seems to be sticking with silicone tips for an in-ear seal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GisLML"&gt;Beats has been going through a transition period after former president Luke Wood departed Apple last year. &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/05/14/apple-beats-isnt-dead-yet-with-new-designer-reportedly-designing-new-products"&gt;Recently, it’s been rumored&lt;/a&gt; that Scott Croyle, formerly of HTC, is playing a significant role in Beats hardware design. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vaccine waivers alone can’t solve India’s vaccine crisis  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Covid-19 Disaster Reaches Deep Into Indian Towns And Villages" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MYPOsTsLreB8idhUuRwdI3XBWWI=/0x0:7941x5294/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69300154/1318463734.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;But they might help&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ocULQX"&gt;India never should have been in this position. The government is currently engaged in international disputes over vaccine waivers and intellectual property rights, while a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/india-covid-crisis-who-says-it-accounts-for-50percent-of-reported-cases-last-week.html"&gt;horrific and record-setting surge of COVID-19 cases&lt;/a&gt; continues to devastate its population. The country’s recent vaccine policies — opening vaccination for all above the age of 18 while reeling under severe shortage, allowing the private sectors to sell the vaccine at market prices, and leaving the states to procure vaccines themselves — have been strongly criticized by &lt;a href="https://www.article-14.com/post/covid-19-vaccines-not-a-luxury-former-health-secy-criticises-modi-govt-policy"&gt;public health&lt;/a&gt; experts and its &lt;a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/india/supreme-court-directs-centre-to-revisit-current-vaccine-policy-says-it-may-create-disparity/articleshow/82366043.cms"&gt;Supreme Court&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P2A2YX"&gt;It’s a bizarre predicament for one of the largest suppliers of vaccines in the world, a country that was ideally positioned to quickly ramp up vaccine manufacturing. But while some nations invested in domestic development of vaccines and others secured supplies from manufacturers, India showed no &lt;a href="https://www.theindiaforum.in/article/what-gone-wrong-india-s-vaccination-programme"&gt;initiative&lt;/a&gt; to increase its vaccine-manufacturing capacity. Instead, it prematurely declared a victory over the virus and grossly underestimated the quantity of vaccines it would need. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHbV0w"&gt;“We are basically suffering the adverse consequences of the poor policy actions of last year,” said R. Ramakumar, an economist and professor at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai who writes on issues related to access to vaccines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L0igdZ"&gt;India scored a small victory on May 5th, when the US announced its support for an intellectual property rights waiver on vaccines and agreed to participate in its negotiations. But while many celebrated the decision, others were circumspect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NfREbZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are basically suffering the adverse consequences of the poor policy actions of last year.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RW48rB"&gt;“I was surprised [at the decision] but then I read the fine print,” Ramakumar said. He said by the language of its &lt;a href="https://ustr.gov/about-us/policy-offices/press-office/press-releases/2021/may/statement-ambassador-katherine-tai-covid-19-trips-waiver"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;, the US seemed to be in no hurry to waive intellectual rights, anticipating negotiations at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to be hard and long. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpH60O"&gt;That lack of urgency is something that vaccine-hungry countries like India can ill afford. India is looking to vaccinate over 900 million adults, but it has only managed to fully vaccinate just &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/covid-vaccine-tracker-global-distribution/#global"&gt;2.8 percent of the population&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sI4Bth"&gt;Waiving intellectual property rights could give vaccine manufacturers the information they need to ramp up vaccine production so that more people in the world get their jabs. However, some experts like Ramakumar believe it will take months for the international community to reach consensus, and other experts believe that waivers alone won’t help — not without adequate infrastructure and support to make the vaccines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="M5L5kA"&gt;India’s proposal to waive COVID-19 patents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="clTqtm"&gt;For months, as COVID-19 cases and death tolls rose, the world hoped that the introduction of vaccines would bring the pandemic to an end. This didn’t happen. Out of the approximately 1 billion COVID-19 vaccines administered, only 0.3 percent &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/22/opinion/who-covid-vaccines.html"&gt;went&lt;/a&gt; to low-income countries. Many rich Western countries like the US bought enough vaccines to inoculate their population many times over while countries like &lt;a href="https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/vaccine-deserts-some-countries-have-no-covid-19-jabs-at-all/articleshow/82494691.cms"&gt;Chad&lt;/a&gt;, in sub-Saharan Africa, had none. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgFcpC"&gt;In October 2020, India and South Africa &lt;a href="https://docs.wto.org/dol2fe/Pages/SS/directdoc.aspx?filename=q:/IP/C/W669.pdf&amp;amp;Open=True"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; a temporary waiver of intellectual property and patent rights over products that could prevent, contain, and treat COVID-19. This would ensure that COVID-19 vaccines and drugs could be manufactured in facilities across the world — and not just in a small number of factories that hold coveted licenses.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PgNXcT"&gt;First, the WTO would have to agree to waive intellectual property rights currently protected under an agreement called the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (&lt;a href="https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/trips_e/trips_e.htm"&gt;TRIPS&lt;/a&gt;). There are provisions in the agreement — called TRIPS flexibilities — that could allow countries to waive patent rights to ensure access to essential medicines. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="COVID-19 Vaccination Drive" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5-Z9zb4bNdsWtRSoCe8LoDVob4k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520567/1232946348.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A vaccine site in New Delhi, India.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BphhFd"&gt;The waiver proposed by India and South Africa goes beyond the TRIPS flexibilities and asks pharmaceutical companies to hand over copyright material, trade secrets and data submitted to regulatory authorities. This is because vaccine manufacturing is complex. Without this additional technical information it won’t be possible for other manufacturers to produce vaccines quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2aNmn"&gt;India and South Africa’s proposal was backed by over 100 developing countries but was initially opposed by the US, UK, Canada, EU and other western countries who claimed that the intellectual property system was required to incentivize new inventions of vaccines, diagnostics and treatment. At one point, billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates, billionaire philanthropist argued the same,&lt;a href="https://www.devex.com/news/gates-foundation-reverses-course-on-covid-19-vaccine-patents-99810"&gt; claiming&lt;/a&gt; that intellectual property rights underpin innovation and waiving the laws will not make vaccines accessible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWjwT9"&gt;After the US stated support for IP waivers, The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation&lt;a href="https://www.devex.com/news/gates-foundation-reverses-course-on-covid-19-vaccine-patents-99810"&gt; changed&lt;/a&gt; its position. The US’ decision also convinced the EU, France, Ireland and UK to agree to participate in the WTO negotiations. However Germany remains opposed to the idea of a waiver, and the WTO requires all 164 member countries to come to a consensus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yv2QPI"&gt;“We are expecting countries led by big pharma to use delay tactics even before negotiations begin,” said Leena Menghaney, South Asia head of Access Campaign, Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors without Borders). She also added that the world needs more than COVID-19 vaccines. It also needs more COVID-19 drugs and treatments, but the US does not currently support waivers for these products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OP199c"&gt;Considering it took the WTO five years to negotiate the 2001 Doha declaration — which only clarified TRIPS flexibilities — the fight over the current waiver is likely to be fierce, and enduring. “If the world does what it did for HIV/AIDS, it would take 20 years before COVID-19 treatment and vaccines reach those who need them,” Menghaney said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wKTJSf"&gt;Can India move ahead without vaccine waivers?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mSXBDd"&gt;India doesn’t &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to wait for a WTO agreement to move ahead. Through something called compulsory licensing it could allow generic manufacturers to produce a patented drug without the license owner’s consent.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCjrML"&gt;“Even without WTO approval, India can issue a compulsory license for Covishield so that other Indian manufacturers can produce it”, said Mengahney. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqrGL2"&gt;Covishield is what the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is known as in India. Pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca gave permission to the Serum Institute of India (SII) to produce the vaccine. SII is the &lt;a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/media-centre/press-releases/2021/serum-institute-of-india-obtains-emergency-use-authorisation-in-india-for-astrazenecas-covid-19-vaccine.html"&gt;largest manufacturer of vaccines in the world&lt;/a&gt;, and can produce 70 million doses of the vaccine per month. But India needs at least 170 million doses monthly in order to&lt;a href="https://www.firstpost.com/india/covid-19-vaccine-data-analysis-at-current-rate-of-2-2mn-doses-per-day-india-can-only-cover-30-population-by-end-2021-9562811.html"&gt; vaccinate&lt;/a&gt; 80% of the country by the end of the year. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="India Starts World’s Largest Vaccination Against COVID-19" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LbzlDM6D3vLC5g3BK1lOK7j9cro=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520346/1230620964.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A vaccinator holds a vial of Serum Institute of India’s (SII) COVID-19 vaccine called “Covishield.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UNO6cH"&gt;While it may be possible for India to override the intellectual property rights, essentially bypassing the pharma companies and granting other factories permission to manufacture vaccines, it is unlikely to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8XqrnX"&gt;For vaccines, compulsory licensing can be tricky. Lifting patents does not give the manufacturers all they need to know to produce the vaccines, “There needs to be a transfer of technology and know-how, along with the lifting of patent rights,” said Ramakumar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlLp7w"&gt;Along with legal rights, a technology transfer, where companies help provide technical support to the companies receiving the technology, is required. This is why countries, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/vietnam-seeks-mrna-tech-transfer-amid-covid-19-vaccine-supply-issues-2021-05-11/"&gt;including Vietnam&lt;/a&gt;, have been prodding pharmaceutical companies to collaborate and issue more voluntary licenses — like the one already issued by AstraZeneca to SII. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QEnjy"&gt;Even when there is support, vaccine production takes time. India’s indigenously produced Covaxin vaccine has been licensed to three public sector vaccine manufacturers in India, but production still hasn’t started yet and will take another three to six months to get going. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5aaFP"&gt;Some vaccines are also more complex to produce than others. mRNA vaccines, like the ones developed by Pfizer and Moderna, &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html"&gt;are newcomers&lt;/a&gt; to the pharmaceutical world. There are already global shortages of raw materials for mRNA vaccines, including everything from &lt;a href="https://theconversation.com/the-world-is-hungry-for-mrna-covid-vaccines-like-pfizers-but-were-short-of-vital-components-159143"&gt;plastic bags to nanoparticles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nG4WSU"&gt;That’s because before the pandemic, these kinds of vaccines were mostly produced in tiny batches — enough for academic research but not a global vaccination campaign. The newness of these vaccines also means that manufacturing facilities and expertise needed to safely make these vaccines are in extremely short supply. Those problems aren’t something that a waiver alone can solve.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="b1iqV3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There needs to be a transfer of technology and know-how, along with the lifting of patent rights.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U3L0BH"&gt;“It takes a significant amount of time, a couple of months, for vaccine manufacturers to put in place infrastructure, raw materials, skilled workers and arrangements with vendors to start making the vaccines,” said Shivangi Mittal, senior associate at Koan Advisory Group, a technology policy consulting firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8LcvfZ"&gt;This process will be slower for intellectual property from other countries or from other innovators who are not closely working with manufacturers under existing commercial arrangements, said Mittal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rHOiok"&gt;Beyond the technical issues, there are diplomatic repercussions to going it alone. Any country that has used compulsory licensing in the past has attracted severe censure from regions that are pharma hubs, such as the European Union, US,  and Japan, which have responded with threats of sanctions and cutting off of trade privileges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zTMl4C"&gt;“While this [overriding of patent rights] is legally possible, it has rarely been used, even in strong developing countries like India or Brazil or South Africa,” said Achal Prabhala, coordinator of the AccessIBSA project, which campaigns for access to medicines in those countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cz6n7v"&gt;Prabhala said that smaller developing countries have almost never used these provisions because they are even more vulnerable to diplomatic pressure from economic heavyweights like the US and EU. That’s why waivers remain a slower but still more diplomatically palatable option for most countries, including India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tc5d9h"&gt;Waivers are a start. They can theoretically help increase vaccine supplies, but to actually get shots into the arms of people, India’s government will still need to enact good policies to help manufacture and distribute vaccines. Globally, it would mean more collaborations and technology transfers from Western to non-Western pharmaceutical companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3R74rz"&gt;“For India, that would mean declaring vaccines as public good, procuring them centrally and providing them free,” said Ramakumar.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Server glitch allowed Eufy owners to see through other homes’ cameras </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CM2d1sAUqObuTp1q-fCWuu-oUrI=/60x0:675x410/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69299620/evercam_eufy_4.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Eufy’s home security camera | Image: Anker / Eufy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NHzHSV"&gt;Last night, a number of Eufy home security camera owners discovered they were able to access smart camera feeds and saved videos from users they had never met, due to an apparent security glitch. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/17/huge-eufy-privacy-breach/"&gt;First reported by &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the issue came to light in &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/neayuo/access_to_random_cameras_in_another_country/"&gt;an extended Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt;, in which users from around the world detailed their experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H76KJQ"&gt;“Basically I could see every camera, their front door and backdoor bells, master bedroom, living room, garage, kitchen, their motion recordings, everything,” one Eufy owner noted. “I was wondering what was going on as it still had my email and name as signed in and noticed that some unknown email, I’m guessing of the Hawaii owner, was in my shared guest account.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zcpiqH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“For a security product to become completely unsecure, it’s pretty worrying”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K2aABH"&gt;Some reported that signing out of their account and signing back in resolved the behavior; by now, whatever problem caused the behavior appears to have been fixed. Still, many users are left concerned that their own cameras and feeds might have been exposed without their knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDLpEV"&gt;“For a security product to become completely unsecure, it’s pretty worrying,” the users continued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3igQsA"&gt;Eufy did not respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/journeydan/status/1394342460394987522"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the problem lasted only an hour and did not affect baby monitor products. On Reddit, users higlighted a message sent to customers attributing the issue to a server error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="nOEmmZ"&gt;Dear user, &lt;br&gt;The issue was due to a bug in one of our servers. This was quickly resolved by our engineering team and our customer service team will continue to assist those affected. We recommend all users to: &lt;br&gt;1.Please unplug and then reconnect the home base. &lt;br&gt;2.Log out of the eufy security app and log in again. &lt;br&gt;Contact &lt;a href="mailto:support@eufylife.com"&gt;support@eufylife.com&lt;/a&gt; for enquiries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3noul8"&gt;There’s no indication that specific individuals were targeted as part of the bug, but it’s still a troubling behavior for a service that often monitors private homes. Eufy also makes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/15/16308470/eufy-genie-amazon-alexa-review"&gt;an Echo Dot-style voice assistant called the Genie&lt;/a&gt;, although Genie products appear to have been unaffected by the bug.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aAfroF"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 1:54PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added Eufy statement to &lt;/em&gt;Android Police&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="7banju"&gt;Google is rolling out a new feature for the Google Phone app that announces who’s calling when the phone rings, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/17/google-phone-gains-caller-id-announcement-feature-to-help-you-manually-screen-calls/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If it’s rolled out to you, you can set whether you want the app to announce caller ID every time the phone rings, only when you’re wearing a headset, or never, &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AyJmwN"&gt;iOS has had a feature like this for some time, and it seems like Google’s version for the Phone app works similarly to Apple’s implementation. On my iPhone, I find caller ID announcements to be really useful — it’s very handy to know who’s calling before I even look at my phone. Caller ID announcements are also a great accessibility feature, allowing people with visual disabilities to more easily know who is calling them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4lDqf3"&gt;Sadly, most of the call announcements I hear are for spam calls or numbers I don’t recognize. I really wish that Apple offered something like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21122390/google-assistant-screen-call-robocalls-spam-phone-pixel"&gt;Google’s automatic call screening&lt;/a&gt;, which is available for &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/phoneapp/answer/9118387?hl=en"&gt;all Pixel users in the US&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk impersonators have stolen more than $2 million in cryptocurrency since October</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Billionaire Elon Musk Receives Axel Springer Award" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/34UJVTL74XMCJ50p94qm6ivMIgk=/0x58:4000x2725/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69299408/1229901686.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JDychf"&gt;Consumers lost over $2 million in cryptocurrency to scammers impersonating Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk over the last six months, &lt;a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2021/05/spotting-cryptocurrency-investment-scams"&gt;the Federal Trade Commission reported Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9BmjA9"&gt;“Promises of guaranteed huge returns or claims that your cryptocurrency will be multiplied are always scams,” the commission said in its Monday report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z6oJai"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Promises of guaranteed huge returns or claims that your cryptocurrency will be multiplied are always scams”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="561eGT"&gt;For years, scammers have posed as Musk in order to fraud social media users out of cryptocurrency. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/8/17096128/twitter-vitalik-buterin-elon-musk-cryptocurrency-scams"&gt;They use deceptive tactics on sites like Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, often using the same avatar images as Musk’s own account and slightly misspelling his username. Pretending to be Musk, the scammers will ask victims to send currency to a specific wallet address in exchange for receiving a larger payment in return. The scams violate &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/platform-manipulation#:~:text=You%20can't%20mislead%20others,we%20take%20into%20consideration%20include%3A&amp;amp;text=use%20of%20intentionally%20misleading%20profile%20information%2C%20including%20profile%20location."&gt;Twitter’s policy against deceptive accounts&lt;/a&gt;, but moderators have struggled to rein in the activity, and it remains prevalent on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDhtIW"&gt;The $2 million figure was revealed in a larger report on cryptocurrency published by the FTC on Monday. Since last October, consumers reported losing more than $80 million in cryptocurrency scams, increasing “more than ten-fold year-over-year,” the commission said. Consumers lose around $1,900 through these scams on average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQoqa0"&gt;Musk himself was a target in one of the largest Twitter bitcoin scams last summer. In one of the largest breaches in Twitter history, attackers compromised accounts belonging to Musk, President Barack Obama, President Joe Biden, Bill Gates, and even Apple to promote a bitcoin scam. The attackers received nearly $120,000 from the scam &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21326200/elon-musk-bill-gates-twitter-hack-bitcoin-scam-compromised"&gt;that forced Twitter to block&lt;/a&gt; all verified users from posting new tweets for several hours. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Focusing on personal responsibility still isn’t a good way to manage public health</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9uRNMmUG4j3ELlWGnLrsN2NKBLk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69299361/acastro_200512_1777_faceMask_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wAnQyn"&gt;Public health experts and communities around the country are still struggling to make sense of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s new mask guidelines. Last week, the CDC said it no longer thinks people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 need to wear masks in most situations. But cases of COVID-19 are still high in many places, and &lt;a href="https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#vaccinations"&gt;less than 40 percent of people&lt;/a&gt; in the United States are fully vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZTQaG"&gt;In efforts to clarify and explain the agency’s thinking, CDC director Rochelle Walensky focused on the risk COVID-19 poses to each individual person who decides to wear a mask or not wear a mask. People who are vaccinated can decide to skip a mask knowing that they’re safer, and people who aren’t vaccinated should keep them on or sign up for a shot. If they don’t wear a mask, they could be more at risk of catching COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbIQxL"&gt;“I might say people are responsible for their own health,” Walensky told &lt;em&gt;PBS NewsHour&lt;/em&gt;. “If you’re not vaccinated, that, again, is taking your responsibility for your own health into your own hands.” She posted similar language &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CDCDirector/status/1393312416373645317"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;: “Your health is in your hands.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlPctv"&gt;But over a year into the COVID-19 pandemic, if we’ve learned one thing about infectious diseases, it’s that our health is never just in our hands. It’s a core idea of public health: even if people make the best possible effort to stay well, they can still get sick. If there’s more virus around in a community, everyone is more at risk, regardless of what precautions they take. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Hj4Ama"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It is a fundamental tenet of public health that no one’s health is completely in their own hands.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In addition to transmission of infections, many societal, environmental, and political forces override our best attempts at staying safe &amp;amp; healthy. &lt;a href="https://t.co/N2Y3ZknlW7"&gt;https://t.co/N2Y3ZknlW7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dr Ellie Murray (@EpiEllie) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EpiEllie/status/1393645496691052550?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VTynVN"&gt;Easing up on mask-wearing recommendations could still be a good call — or at the very least, a reasonable one. The new guidelines might encourage more people to get vaccinated. COVID-19 vaccines also work extremely well: people who are fully vaccinated are at very low risk of catching and getting sick from the disease, so they may not need the extra protection from a mask. They’re also not a major danger to others: there’s a very low chance they’ll have COVID-19, and if they do catch the virus, they probably won’t have enough of it in their bodies that they can pass it to someone else. So they don’t need a mask to block potentially infectious particles from spraying into a room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bazVDN"&gt;But it’s frustrating that Walensky chose to stress a shift to personal responsibility as the rationale — only &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2021/04/06/984745020/biden-will-direct-states-to-make-all-adults-vaccine-eligible-by-april-19"&gt;four weeks&lt;/a&gt; after vaccine eligibility opened up to all adults (and just days after 12- to 15-year-olds became eligible). People who got their shots recently still aren’t fully vaccinated. Others may not have found the time to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ddiamond/status/1394055840865337344"&gt;schedule a shot&lt;/a&gt; around their &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/12/us/covid-vaccines-vulnerable.html?searchResultPosition=1"&gt;work hours&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmtA0w"&gt;With those limitations, pushing the burden of staying safe onto individuals makes things hard on everyone. In response to the CDC announcement, for example, &lt;a href="https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/05/walmart-trader-joes-costco-no-masks-customers.html"&gt;stores like Walmart and Costco&lt;/a&gt; are no longer requiring customers to wear masks. Most say unvaccinated people still need to wear masks, but they’re not going to ask for evidence that someone is vaccinated before they go into the stores. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KknNRu"&gt;Someone who isn’t vaccinated could easily decide to not wear a mask in Walmart. In an indoor space like a crowded store, they’d be more at risk of contracting COVID-19, especially in an area where the virus is still circulating. That person is taking their health into their own hands — but they’re also putting the people around them at risk.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wn0lZ"&gt;Kids under 12 can’t get vaccinated yet, and even with a mask on, they could catch the disease from a maskless unvaccinated adult. Even people who &lt;em&gt;are &lt;/em&gt;vaccinated are at increased risk. The shots aren’t perfect, and some vaccinated, otherwise healthy people still end up catching COVID-19. The situation is worse for people who are &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/15/health/coronavirus-vaccine-immune-system.html"&gt;immunocompromised&lt;/a&gt;, like people who have had organ transplants. For them, even if they are able to get a shot, their vaccine might not work as well as someone else’s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nArTKw"&gt;The amount of risk that comes with taking a mask off isn’t just determined by the vaccination status of the person who decides to remove it. It’s also affected by the decisions of the people around them — whether they decide to take their masks off and whether they’re vaccinated. Health is, as always, collective. The way the CDC talks about its decisions should reflect that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhHql3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canoo’s electric van will start at $34,750</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/24C17SWG3VhE7wY-Ww0VsE-VYtk=/0x84:2000x1417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69299197/1_midlander_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LHUt3R"&gt;California EV startup Canoo has finally &lt;a href="https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/56/promises-kept---canoo-pricing-for-lifestyle-vehicle-is"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; pricing for the electric van it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20882538/canoo-evelozcity-ev-subsicrption-electric-vehicle"&gt;announced back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. The “lifestyle” van, as Canoo calls it, will start at $34,750 and cost as much as $49,950 for the most capable model, before additional equipment or tax incentives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wxnMkS"&gt;Canoo has also started accepting $100 deposits for the van as well as for the electric pickup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22324096/canoo-goev-ev-pickup-truck-specs-photos-revealed"&gt;truck it revealed in March&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;delivery van it debuted late last year&lt;/a&gt;. Pricing was not given for the pickup, though Canoo has said the base price for the delivery van will be $33,000. Canoo’s lifestyle van is slated to go into production sometime in 2022, though it won’t start production on the other two vehicles until at least 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJ5diH"&gt;All three vehicles are built on the same modular electric vehicle platform that Canoo has been developing for a few years. In the largest configuration, with an 80kWh battery pack, the lifestyle van should get around 250 miles of range. Canoo also says it will sell the van in four different trims, including an “adventure” version with more ground clearance and “a more muscular profile.” Exactly who will build the van remains a mystery; Canoo has said it will tap a contract manufacturer, but it has not formally announced one yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kSp7JR"&gt;Originally called Evelozcity, Canoo was founded in late 2017 by a group of executives and engineers who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/13/17111026/evelozcity-stefan-krause-interview-electric-cars"&gt;split off from EV startup Faraday Future&lt;/a&gt;, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;struggling mightily at the time&lt;/a&gt;. They created the van but also tried to license out the platform it’s built on to other automakers and companies looking for a quick solution to bringing an electric vehicle to market. Canoo signed a deal with Hyundai to build vehicles on the platform in 2020 and to provide some engineering services to the automaker. And as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; first reported in January, Canoo even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev"&gt;held talks with Apple about using its electric vehicle platform&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fxe59n"&gt;That founding group’s original goal was to offer the electric van on a subscription-only basis, but a lot has changed at Canoo in the last year. The startup merged with a special purpose acquisition company (or SPAC) and is now publicly traded on the Nasdaq stock exchange, raising some $600 million in the process. Canoo’s leadership has also been overhauled. Tony Aquila, a businessman who came in as an investor near the start of the SPAC merger process last year, became Canoo’s executive chairman and is now also its CEO after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397356/canoo-cofounder-ulrich-kranz-resign-new-ceo-tony-aquila"&gt;one of the startup’s founding executives resigned in April&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9pC4v"&gt;Aquila has focused Canoo more on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;commercial market for electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt; since taking power at the startup. He downplayed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev"&gt;the subscription model in March&lt;/a&gt;, though Canoo does still plan to offer it in some capacity. And he pivoted Canoo away from providing engineering work to other companies, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22357318/canoo-hyundai-deal-dead-electric-vehicles-goev"&gt;apparently killing the deal with Hyundai&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e9J7IF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic Games sues AR company Nreal for sounding too much like ‘Unreal’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nreal Light glasses on LG Uplus" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jPH4x6ANRq9jqFEXQtanIQ6ESWU=/0x0:1920x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69299044/Nreal_with_U_5G_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nreal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pgdadR"&gt;Epic Games has sued smart glasses maker Nreal for infringing on its Unreal Engine trademark. Epic, which &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nced.187547/gov.uscourts.nced.187547.1.0.pdf"&gt;filed the case late last week&lt;/a&gt;, claims it’s “no coincidence” that Nreal’s name “looks and sounds virtually identical” to Unreal’s branding. As Nreal plans a US launch later this year, Epic wants to recoup damages and scuttle its application for a trademark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q71JJv"&gt;Epic argues that on top of “Nreal” sounding a lot like “Unreal,” both companies are competing in the same space. The China-based Nreal makes an augmented reality headset known as the Nreal Light, which projects 3D objects into real space, and it’s developed &lt;a href="https://developer.nreal.ai/nreal-tower"&gt;a demo game&lt;/a&gt; called &lt;em&gt;Nreal Tower. &lt;/em&gt;Its glasses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/10/21362407/nreal-light-ar-glasses-lg-uplus-samsung-galaxy-note-retail-launch-availability-price"&gt;shipped in Korea&lt;/a&gt; last year, and Nreal has gradually expanded their availability, announcing &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/22/nreal-unveils-enterprise-edition-of-mixed-reality-glasses/"&gt;plans for a US launch&lt;/a&gt; in the second quarter of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dG6QM8"&gt;Meanwhile, Epic’s Unreal Engine is a ubiquitous game-making tool that’s also used for films and general purpose 3D design. Epic has &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/03/epic-games-ceo-ar-glasses-will-eventually-replace-smartphones/"&gt;signaled interest&lt;/a&gt; in augmented reality, although it hasn’t indicated that it’s building hardware. And the lawsuit notes that “Epic expects Unreal Engine to feature prominently in the creation of a virtual metaverse, a real time three-dimensional social platform where friends meet to interact and have enjoyable experiences.” Nreal’s glasses even support the Unreal Engine. Epic claims that all this potential crossover could confuse customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uds28J"&gt;Epic and Nreal have been quietly fighting over the “Unreal” trademark for years. Epic filed to block Nreal’s trademark in 2018, and the companies &lt;a href="https://next.reality.news/news/epic-games-enters-settlement-talks-with-nreal-over-trademark-naming-dispute-0213689/"&gt;discussed a settlement&lt;/a&gt; after that. But Epic’s suit claims the discussion was “fruitless.” And Nreal recently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Nreal/status/1392811921473216521"&gt;tweeted a promise&lt;/a&gt; of “big news” on May 20th, saying that “something you’ve all been waiting for is on its way.” Epic sued the day after that tweet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to make an AirTag holder for your pet’s collar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GzttfcZZg-DE7iVzlfQ8d3zQmGM=/0x88:2040x1448/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298626/verge_IMG_7566_2040pxl.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hank being a good boy with an AirTag sleeve fitted to his existing dog collar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ocCNe3"&gt;One seemingly obvious use for Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/482924/435031/7613?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fbuy-airtag%2Fairtag&amp;amp;sharedid=vergeairtagholderpet" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$29 AirTag tracker&lt;/a&gt; is for pets. As a new dog owner, I wanted to add an AirTag to my dog’s existing leather collar, but the options currently available are lousy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjrJAr"&gt;AirTags are small, but they’re not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; small. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Faccessories%2Fall%2Fairtag&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22439970%2Fpet-airtag-holder-dog-cat-collar-how-to-diy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Most AirTag holders&lt;/a&gt; currently available from Apple and its partners assume I’m okay with dangling a 0.39-ounce (11-gram) pendant off my medium-sized beagle’s neck. I’m not, which is how I came up with the idea for a DIY neoprene sleeve that keeps the IP67 water- and dust-resistant AirTag snuggly attached to Hank’s existing collar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mE3gf7"&gt;I’m not going to suggest that AirTags are the best way to track your pets — they’re not. But they’re relatively cheap, unlike &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-gps-pet-trackers/"&gt;dedicated GPS / GSM pet trackers&lt;/a&gt; that require monthly subscriptions. Apple’s Find My network coverage is also more limited. Nevertheless, an AirTag is better than nothing, especially in populated areas where any nearby iPhone can alert you to your missing pet’s location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="K7nISO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"AirTag location trackers are smart, capable, and very Apple","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396693/apple-airtag-location-tracker-hands-on-find-my-privacy-safety"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kZy_FBQ2NrPfmtHmQwYAGs9D_ro=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22519991/verge_IMG_7489_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A sewn version of the AirTag sleeve and the dog collar it was designed for.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F26NeP"&gt;Why not buy?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6OfWYP"&gt;A few companies have already announced AirTag accessories designed specifically for pets. The problem is that none of them are currently shipping, and most are downright expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ldl1as"&gt;There’s the &lt;a href="https://www.pntrs.com/t/8-10090-88849-119386?sid=VergeAirpodPetTags&amp;amp;website=309942&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fnomadgoods.com%2Fproducts%2Frugged-pet-tag-airtag-black" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$29.95 Nomad Rugged Pet Tag&lt;/a&gt; case, which can be engraved with your phone number for an extra $19.95. But it’s still just a pendant and doesn’t ship until August. There’s the &lt;a href="https://www.studioproper.com.au/products/dogtag"&gt;€19.95AUD Studio Proper DogTag&lt;/a&gt; that fits snuggly to existing collars but doesn’t ship until the end of July. And finally, there’s the expensive &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.followpaw.com%2Fproducts%2Ffollowpaw-dog-collar&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22439970%2Fpet-airtag-holder-dog-cat-collar-how-to-diy" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$47.95 FollowPaw collar&lt;/a&gt; with built-in AirTag pocket, which doesn’t ship until June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGyXkk"&gt;One day, I’ll probably buy a dedicated AirTag holder for my dog — one that fits snuggly to his existing collar and comes engraved with his name and my phone number so that I can remove his redundant dog tag. Until then, DIY seems like the best solution.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JtE_EAbr5Un32piTYC01K4HwHtY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22519973/verge_IMG_7515_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll need scissors, neoprene fabric, and either neoprene glue (easy!) or the ability to sew (easy for some!).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YkkKlo"&gt;Materials needed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IH6UIl"&gt;My AirTag sleeve is built from neoprene, a durable and stretchy material that’s easy to find. I’d suggest buying it from a local crafts or fabric store so you can check out the colors, thicknesses, and stretchiness in person. You might even be able to haggle for a few free scraps instead of buying in bulk as required by most Amazon sellers. The neoprene I used is 2mm thick and lacks any additional waterproofing, allowing it to be soft and stretchy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3H7Irx"&gt;If sewing isn’t an option, then you’ll need some neoprene glue. As an avid surfer, I had easy access to scraps of neoprene, which I could assemble into a tube with the neoprene glue in my wetsuit repair kit. For everyone else, you can expect the glue and neoprene to cost no more than $10 in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EKn0AK"&gt;Steps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="bmAvKk"&gt;Cut the neoprene into a rectangle about 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm) in length and wide enough to wrap snugly around your pet’s existing collar with enough overlapping material to either glue or sew it into place. A longer tube might help prevent the AirTag from popping out over time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="Xf6DhZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10504284"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="KsQjok"&gt;Shape into a tube that just fits the width of the pet collar and then glue or sew the neoprene into shape.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="Njzclo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10504291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rVM5Yu"&gt;Slide the collar through the tube, then slowly work the AirTag into one end of the neoprene sleeve until it is centered. It helps to rotate the AirTag as you go.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FNNAjX"&gt;Attach to dog.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>You can now explore a surreal Gucci garden inside Roblox</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pgpRta3TQ9-eomcvltUbDco4TXQ=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69298531/Come_as_You_Are_RSVP_Gucci_Garden_on_Roblox.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NuOkjI"&gt;For the next two weeks, the virtual realm of &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is getting a dose of high fashion. Currently, fashion house Gucci is hosting an artsy garden space, &lt;a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2021/05/gucci-garden-experience/"&gt;which will be available for &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; users to explore starting today through to May 31st&lt;/a&gt;. The space was conceived as a virtual counterpart to a real-world installation called the Gucci Garden Archetypes, which is taking place in Florence, Italy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4FOyMd"&gt;Both the virtual and IRL spaces are described as multimedia experiences, which are divided into a series of themed rooms with names like “urban romanticism” and “Tokyo tribe.” It all sounds pretty surreal. Here’s the official description of what you’ll be doing in the digital version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="aI3qdw"&gt;As they enter the Gucci Garden experience, visitors will shed their avatars becoming a neutral mannequin. Without gender or age, the mannequin symbolizes that we all begin our journeys through life as a blank canvas. Wandering through the different rooms, visitors’ mannequins absorb elements of the exhibition. With every person experiencing the rooms in a different order and retaining different fragments of the spaces, they will emerge at the end of their journey as one-of-a-kind creations, reflecting the idea of individuals as one among many, yet wholly unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;aside id="Vw2bjX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The latest modern art installation is inside Fortnite","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21308391/fortnite-creative-manchester-international-festival-art-exhibition-laturbo-avedon"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Roblox" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EchAEqIEazWTV726-7yNGSZ63cE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520042/In_Bloom_room_Gucci_Garden_on_Roblox.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Roblox" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L-ASMYD12TUlob9vXV110_g8VZc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520058/The_Collectors_Room_1__Gucci_Garden_on_Roblox.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Roblox" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/of3NgwnFmYVj-OyfGQF8Dkj2OGU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520063/Tokyo_Tribe_room_Gucci_Garden_on_Roblox.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1VLZKw"&gt;It may sound like a strange combination, but over the last year, fashion and gaming have become much more closely connected. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22340775/honor-of-kings-burberry-skin-fashion-video-games"&gt;Burberry launched in-game outfits for a Chinese strategy game&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/26/21721371/balenciaga-afterworld-the-age-of-tomorrow-fashion-launch-video-game"&gt;Balenciaga made a post-apocalyptic world in place of a traditional runway show&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937187/league-of-legends-true-damage-hip-hop-group-kda-louis-vuitton"&gt;Louis Vuitton dressed up a virtual hip-hop group made up of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; characters&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, this isn’t even Gucci’s first foray into the space; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22340621/gucci-virtual-25-sneaker-ar-vrchat-roblox"&gt;the company previously made a pair of virtual sneakers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hqt1Nf"&gt;Just remember: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22340621/gucci-virtual-25-sneaker-ar-vrchat-roblox"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is definitely not a video game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
