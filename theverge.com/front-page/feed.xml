    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lHzUjO"&gt;Facebook, Twitter, and Snap are among the companies that will assist with the Biden administration's promotional campaign for vaccine eligibility, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/biden-vaccine-eligibility-push-e438587b-9b34-4b75-9132-7395c2768ed7.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The White House had set a date of May 1st for states to open coronavirus vaccine eligibility to all adults, but later pushed it to April 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGoEoE"&gt;The White House is hoping to reach populations who may have higher rates of vaccine hesitancy with the effort. Anthony Fauci, the president’s chief medical adviser, will do video clips on Snapchat, according to &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt;, and Facebook and Twitter will send out push alerts to notify users that they’re eligible to receive the vaccine. Vice President Kamala Harris will also be involved with the social media push.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qAkKnu"&gt;Half of all US adults have &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/politics-anthony-fauci-coronavirus-pandemic-infectious-diseases-coronavirus-vaccine-6e3b18b44a05d1e49ed35337ec7ce969"&gt;received at least one COVID-19 vaccination&lt;/a&gt;, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), But the administration appears concerned that last week’s decision to pause the use of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine may have made people already hesitant to receive a vaccine even more wary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pYg4Q"&gt;The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CDC recommended last week that the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381469/covid-vaccine-pause-blood-clots-johnson-fda-cdc"&gt;pause the use&lt;/a&gt; of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine after six people who received the shot experienced unusual blood clots. The agencies wanted time to investigate whether there’s a connection between the clots and the vaccine. &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/04/18/politics/fauci-jj-vaccine-friday/index.html"&gt;Fauci said on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; that he believes the pause will be lifted by Friday, perhaps under some kind of restriction or warning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2JL7h"&gt;“We can confirm that Snap has been in touch with the White House regarding efforts to spread awareness of vaccine eligibility among Snapchatters,” a spokesperson said in an email to The Verge, “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21187176/snap-mental-health-coronavirus-anxiety-stress"&gt;building on our continued efforts&lt;/a&gt; to support our community during the COVID-19 pandemic.” The spokesperson did not elaborate on details of the efforts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKb9x8"&gt;Likewise, a Twitter spokesperson confirmed in an email to The Verge that the company was “working in partnership with the White House to elevate authoritative information in regard to COVID-19,” but did not share further details. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dduq6p"&gt;Facebook and the White House did not reply to requests for comment on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l4fy0l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 18th 8:32PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added comments from Twitter and Snap &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch NASA’s mission control track the first flight on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/icW-WuYceTNDBgSNe1fh5NCw75k=/0x61:1591x1122/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69146578/Mars_Perseverance_ZL0_0048_0671199786_638ECM_N0031708ZCAM05012_110085J.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter stands prepped and set for its debut flight on Mars. | NASA/JPL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S4dNJU"&gt;NASA’s Ingenuity helicopter is slated to attempt the first-ever powered flight on another world at 3:30AM ET on Monday. The twin-blade rotorcraft will try to ascend 10 feet above ground and hover in place for 30 seconds while cameras on NASA’s Perseverance rover record the historic attempt from a distance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLekK0"&gt;The four-pound Ingenuity copter landed on Mars February 18th attached to the underbelly of Perseverance, NASA’s latest Mars rover whose main mission is to search for signs of ancient Martian life. Perseverance has set aside time to witness Ingenuity’s flight attempt and report the results back to Earth. Ingenuity’s Monday flight test is the first of five planned within a 31-day window that kicked off last week. If all goes well, engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California will start planning for the next four, which could see the craft soar higher and travel farther, depending the results of its first attempt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ahAw1M"&gt;JPL engineers have sought to set expectations for the test flight during recent press conferences: “This is really hard,” said Elsa Jensen, an operations lead for one of the cameras aboard Perseverance that’ll be fixed on Ingenuity. Tests have gone well over the last week, Jansen added. “But we know there’ll be surprises.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TmwxrF"&gt;How to watch&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="5NV9qE"&gt;If the flight takes off as planned on Monday, NASA will have livestreams beginning around 6:15AM ET on Monday hosted on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21X5lGlDOfg&amp;amp;ab_channel=NASA"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, its &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/nasalive"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJPL"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/NASA/videos/891028594799991"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nasa"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nwQ9Sh"&gt;Because of the long data delay between Mars and Earth, we won’t see live video of the flight attempt — it will probably take a few days to get that footage. Instead, NASA’s livestreams will show engineers gradually analyzing data from Mars that will confirm whether or not Ingenuity survived its attempt. Did it fly as expected, or did it get swept away by a gust of wind? Did an alien steal it? We’ll know as soon as engineers find out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IIjXD4"&gt;Tune in early on Monday to see how the historic flight goes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QXTFHC"&gt;What Happens Next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="fG3Q9o"&gt;Ingenuity’s power supply will be exhausted upon landing, so it needs to beam data to Perseverance in the most efficient way possible. That landing data dump will include a few low-resolution black-and-white images captured by its down-facing navigation camera under its tissue box-sized body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e9Rx7C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is definitely a high-risk, high-reward experiment”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kbRE96"&gt;Sometime Monday, engineers will get other images captured by two cameras on Perseverance — Navcam and Mastcam-Z — with much higher resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PrTfmX"&gt;The images from Ingenuity, along with troves of summary data, will radio signals to a so-called Mars Base Station situated on Perseverance’s body, which will relay those signals to a satellite orbiting Mars, which will then shoot the data through NASA’s Deep Space Network all the way back to Earth. Ingenuity will go into sleep mode and re-charge its batteries for the rest of the day using the small cutting board-sized solar panel above its little rotor wings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLhBsT"&gt;On the next Mars day, or sol, engineers will wake Ingenuity back up and retrieve the first 13-megapixel color images taken by its other, horizon-facing camera. More flight data will be sent throughout the following day — “that’s kind of the prize of this project,” Tim Canham, Ingenuity’s operations lead, said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U51c8e"&gt;“This is definitely a high-risk, high-reward experiment,” MiMi Aung, Ingenuity project manager at NASA JPL, said Friday during a press conference. Based on several hours of tests, simulations and Martian weather analyses, Aung said “confidence is high” among the engineering team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eZAetk"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle   &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With just a little bit of swing, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarsHelicopter?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MarsHelicopter&lt;/a&gt; has moved its blades &amp;amp; spun to 50 rpm in preparation for first flight! Takeoff is slated for April 11, with confirmation expected overnight into April 12 for us Earthlings. &lt;a href="https://t.co/TNCdXWcKWE"&gt;https://t.co/TNCdXWcKWE&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/EpDZymjP13"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EpDZymjP13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA JPL (@NASAJPL) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJPL/status/1380404668069650437?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P9Gf5W"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22368208/nasa-helicopter-mars-perseverance-ingenuity-pre-flight-test"&gt;Ingenuity’s&lt;/a&gt; four-foot-long carbon fiber blades successfully unlocked last week after it planted its feet on the surface, and engineers were able to conduct a brief spin test at 50 rpm. For the craft’s actual flight, those blades will be spinning as quickly as 2,400 rpm — fast enough to achieve lift in Mars’ ultra-thin atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7iFoDG"&gt;How Ingenuity does on its first flight test will determine the parameters of its upcoming flight tests. Aung said the helicopter’s “lifetime will be determined by how well it lands,” suggesting engineers could be able to carry out more flight tests within the 31-day window if things are successful. After that window, however, it’s likely Ingenuity will retire. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: Army of the Dead, The Underground Railroad, Resident Evil, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QpZ-XEcuhDeJuLGskH1tty9pbIw=/200x0:1549x899/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69146155/army_of_the_dead.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Here come the zombies in &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tI1JGPhYBS8&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8XwaEA"&gt;I finished &lt;em&gt;This is a Robbery&lt;/em&gt;, and I won’t spoil the ending but if you’re thinking there will be a huge reveal at the end, well, you might be disappointed. What I found interesting throughout the four-part series was how the storyline relied on the voices of newspaper reporters who have covered the heist —and its aftermath —over the years. Considering the filmmakers are Colin and Nick Barnicle, sons of longtime &lt;em&gt;Boston Globe&lt;/em&gt; columnist and current MSNBC contributor Mike Barnicle, it makes sense they’d center journalists in the story. Go watch it, Boston looks absolutely beautiful and the Boston accents are more authentic than anything else you’ll watch this year. Plus, if you can figure out the central mystery of the series there’s a $10 million reward in it for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7yFtq"&gt;Here are this week’s trailers (which are heavier on the zombie content than usual): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9wV3u5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tI1JGPhYBS8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0sMBWf"&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="8HIzxL"&gt;We got a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22300924/army-of-the-dead-trailer-zack-snyder-netflix-vegas-heist-movie"&gt;teaser&lt;/a&gt; a couple of months ago but this is the first official full-length trailer for Zack Snyder’s big-budget heist flick. A group of mercenaries shoot their way into Las Vegas to get $200 million buried underneath the Sunset Strip before the government nukes the entire city. Plot twist: Vegas has been overrun by zombies— not the shambling, mindless creepers from &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt;, mind you; these zombies are organized and smart. And fast, like the &lt;em&gt;World War Z&lt;/em&gt; zombies.  (Side note: Kenny Rogers’ &lt;em&gt;The Gambler &lt;/em&gt;is the perfect music for this trailer: “you got to know when to hold ‘em/Know when to fold ‘em/Know when to walk away/ Know when to run.”) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvvKQs"&gt;Dave Bautista plays the zombie war hero who leads the ragtag group into battle. &lt;em&gt;Army of the Dead&lt;/em&gt; hits Netflix May 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4ENAji"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Pq5Usc_JDA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Bd2Vhw"&gt;The Underground Railroad&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XPW0zc"&gt;Based on the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Colson Whitehead, &lt;em&gt;The Underground Railroad &lt;/em&gt;is set in the novel’s alternate history, making the railroad of the title an actual 19th-century railroad that helps slaves escape the South. Thuso Mbedu plays Cora Randall, who is fleeing a Georgia plantation and being pursued by a bounty hunter (Joel Edgerton). Directed by Barry Jenkins, all episodes of &lt;em&gt;The Underground Railroad— &lt;/em&gt;a sure Emmy contender that looks hauntingly beautiful— will premiere on Amazon Prime Video on May 14th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6XGYVK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KTnMDg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Di_PJyDGIg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="T5PlKd"&gt;Fast &amp;amp; Furious 9 &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KHYtsf"&gt;This is one of many movies delayed by the coronavirus pandemic (the last trailer was in January 2020 and the movie was supposed to come out last May) but is finally back on the schedule with a new release date. Many familiar faces will return for &lt;em&gt;F9&lt;/em&gt;, including (of course) Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, John Cena and Helen Mirren. The latest installment in the &lt;em&gt;Furious &lt;/em&gt;franchise hits theaters June 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="e469fM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_mOAXaPVtD0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="58Rf7m"&gt;Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bPDZrN"&gt;Don’t you hate when zombies invade the White House and you have to go in and save the day? This teaser trailer gives some more clues into Netflix’s new anime series set two years after the events of &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 4. &lt;/em&gt;While an earlier teaser showed Claire walking around in what appeared to be a haunted house, this latest teaser shows that she and Leon are in the White House for separate reasons, and then: zombies.&lt;em&gt; Resident Evil: Infinite Darkness &lt;/em&gt;hits Netflix in July.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFKyOf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tg6otB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Two people killed in fiery Tesla crash with no one driving</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3fpKWaJZoJGkEyXEGEnP19xLCRc=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69146086/fatal_crash_tesla.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/KPRC2/status/1383787158297726985?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;KPRC2 Houston&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iOUhuo"&gt;Authorities in Texas say two people were killed when a Tesla with no one in the driver’s seat crashed into a tree and burst into flames, Houston television station &lt;a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2021/04/18/2-men-dead-after-fiery-tesla-crash-in-spring-officials-say/"&gt;KPRC 2 reported&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Q5kIV"&gt;The cause of the crash, which happened at about 9PM local time in Spring, Texas (near Houston), is under investigation. &lt;a href="https://www.khou.com/article/news/local/tesla-spring-crash-fire/285-c28a4993-5b5f-43f4-a924-e39638390647"&gt;According to KHOU&lt;/a&gt; in Houston, first responders had to use 30,000 gallons of water over four hours to put out the fire, as the Tesla’s battery kept reigniting. Authorities tried to contact Tesla for advice on putting out the fire; it’s not clear whether they received any response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0G6nVX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Two men dead after fiery crash in Tesla Model S.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“[Investigators] are 100-percent certain that no one was in the driver seat driving that vehicle at the time of impact,” Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman said. “They are positive.” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/KHOU11?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#KHOU11&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/q57qfIXT4f"&gt;https://t.co/q57qfIXT4f&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/eQMwpSMLt2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/eQMwpSMLt2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Matt Dougherty (@MattKHOU) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MattKHOU/status/1383821809053683721?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="okQBN4"&gt;Preliminary reports suggest the car was traveling at a high rate of speed and failed to make a turn, then drove off the road into a tree. One of the men killed was in the front passenger seat of the car, the other was in the back seat, according to KHOU. Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman told KPRC  that “no one was driving” the fully-electric 2019 Tesla at the time of the crash. It’s not yet clear whether the car had its Autopilot driver assist system activated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8fWBj"&gt;Tesla didn’t respond to a request for comment on Sunday. The company dissolved its press office and doesn’t usually respond to media inquiries, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3ZhXs"&gt;There have been at least &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-crash-idUSKBN2BA2ML"&gt;23 Autopilot related crashes&lt;/a&gt; under investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, but this appears to be the first fatal crash where there was no driver in the driver’s seat. Tesla has previously cautioned its customers that Autopilot is not an autonomous driving system and still requires constant attention to the road while in use. The company’s cars only check that attention with a sensor that measures torque in the steering wheel, though, leaving room for misuse — something the National Transportation Safety Board &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/25/21153320/tesla-autopilot-walter-huang-death-ntsb-probable-cause"&gt;admonished Tesla for last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YbIiEg"&gt;Tesla has previously provided &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/firstresponders"&gt;guidance for first responders&lt;/a&gt; who encounter fires involving its EV batteries. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/3/17530646/tesla-battery-fire-electric-vehicles-transportation-science"&gt;Reignition of the battery &lt;/a&gt;can be a problem, because unlike gas-powered vehicles, even if the fire is extinguished, an EV battery still has stored energy. Tesla’s guidance suggests it’s better to let the fire burn out than continuing to try to put it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kMwP6Y"&gt;In the past, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/14/17352814/elon-musk-tesla-autopilot-face-tracking-gm"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk has rejected&lt;/a&gt; calls from Tesla engineers to add better safety monitoring when a vehicle is in Autopilot, such as eye-tracking cameras or additional sensors on the steering wheel, saying the tech is “ineffective.” He said in 2018 that Tesla would regularly release safety data about its Autopilot feature, but added that “negative” press coverage about it might persuade customers not to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WYqgFU"&gt;“When there is a serious accident it is almost always, in fact maybe always, the case that it is an experienced user, and the issue is more one of complacency,”&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/2/17313324/tesla-autopilot-safety-statistics-elon-musk-q1-earnings"&gt; Musk said on a May 2018 call with investors&lt;/a&gt;. “They just get too used to it. That tends to be more of an issue. It’s not a lack of understanding of what Autopilot can do. It’s [drivers] thinking they know more about Autopilot than they do.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Charles Geschke, co-founder of Adobe and co-inventor of the PDF, has died at 81</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Vice President of Adobe Software" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cGKUeM-VojZv0XTgHUQ4Q9kp5wA=/0x490:3004x2493/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69145600/635239745.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VwiPcv"&gt;Charles “Chuck” Geschke, a co-founder of Adobe who helped develop the PDF, has died at age 81, the company said in a &lt;a href="https://news.adobe.com/news/news-details/2021/Adobe-Co-Founder-Dr.-Geschke-Passes-at-81/default.aspx"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxfoFt"&gt;“This is a huge loss for the entire Adobe community and the technology industry, for whom he has been a guide and hero for decades,” Adobe CEO Shantanu Narayen said in an email to Adobe employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovBaB1"&gt;”As co-founders of Adobe, Chuck and John Warnock developed groundbreaking software that has revolutionized how people create and communicate,” Narayen said. “Chuck instilled a relentless drive for innovation in the company, resulting in some of the most transformative software inventions, including the ubiquitous PDF, Acrobat, Illustrator, Premiere Pro and Photoshop.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OC2Doi"&gt;Geschke earned a doctorate from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, and then took a job at Xerox Palo Alto Research Center where he met Warnock. The pair left Xerox in 1982 and founded Adobe. Their first product was Adobe PostScript, the programming language that helped boost the desktop publishing industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KyfgWQ"&gt;Geschke was chief operating officer of Adobe from December 1986 to July 1994 and president from April 1989 until his retirement in April 2000. He served as chairman of the board with Warnock from September 1997 to January 2017 and was a member of the board until April 2020, when became emeritus board member.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="po4biz"&gt;“I could never have imagined having a better, more likable, or more capable business partner,” Warnock said in a statement. “Not having Chuck in our lives will leave a huge hole and those who knew him will all agree.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Edmzlp"&gt;In addition to his contributions to the technology industry, Geschke was also known for &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/8a22e47c0a3f078f7b1df0dda117d634"&gt;surviving a 1992 kidnapping attempt&lt;/a&gt;. Two men snatched him as he arrived at work one morning and held him for four days, demanding ransom. He was eventually rescued by the FBI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6kF8f3"&gt;President Obama awarded Warnock and Geschke the &lt;a href="https://nationalmedals.org/laureate/charles-geschke/"&gt;National Medal of Technology&lt;/a&gt; in 2009. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVM5Iu"&gt;“He was a famous businessman, the founder of a major company in the U.S. and the world, and of course he was very, very proud of that and it was huge achievement in his life, but it wasn’t his focus — really, his family was,” his wife Nancy Geschke, 78, &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/04/17/adobe-co-founder-charles-geschke-dies-at-81/"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;Mercury News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “He always called himself the luckiest man in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGPkik"&gt;Geschke is survived by his wife Nancy, who he was married to for 56 years, three children and seven grandchildren. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sl10U2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Federal investigators looking into breach at software code testing company Codecov</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/viC09Q_VPWoKRM3g3UMuelnU0FE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69145367/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QHEMKO"&gt;Federal officials are investigating a security breach at software auditing company Codecov, which apparently went undetected for months, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/us-investigators-probing-breach-san-francisco-code-testing-company-firm-2021-04-16/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;.  Codecov’s platform is used to test software code for vulnerabilities, and its 29,000 clients include Atlassian, Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble, GoDaddy, and the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mpe8q3"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://about.codecov.io/security-update/"&gt;statement on the company’s website&lt;/a&gt;, Codecov CEO Jerrod Engelberg acknowledged the breach and the federal investigation, saying someone had gained access to its Bash Uploader script and modified it without the company’s permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abORal"&gt;“Our investigation has determined that beginning January 31, 2021, there were periodic, unauthorized alterations of our Bash Uploader script by a third party, which enabled them to potentially export information stored in our users’ continuous integration (CI) environments,” Engelberg wrote. “This information was then sent to a third-party server outside of Codecov’s infrastructure.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h8zxiX"&gt;According to Engelberg’s post, the modified version of the tool could have affected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="z4l5g2"&gt;Any credentials, tokens, or keys that our customers were passing through their CI runner that would be accessible when the Bash Uploader script was executed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OFJMsV"&gt;Any services, datastores, and application code that could be accessed with these credentials, tokens, or keys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oydZff"&gt;The git remote information (URL of the origin repository) of repositories using the Bash Uploaders to upload coverage to Codecov in CI.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="koXEdB"&gt;Although the breach occurred in January, it was not discovered until April 1st, when a customer noticed something was wrong with the tool. “Immediately upon becoming aware of the issue, Codecov secured and remediated the potentially affected script and began investigating the extent to which users may have been impacted,” Engelberg wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0m8MWU"&gt;Codecov does not know who was responsible for the hack, but has hired a third-party forensics company to help it determine how users were affected, and reported the matter to law enforcement. The company emailed affected users, who Codecov did not name, to notify them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFx6J8"&gt;“We strongly recommend affected users immediately re-roll all of their credentials, tokens, or keys located in the environment variables in their CI processes that used one of Codecov’s Bash Uploaders,” Engelberg added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8osBIU"&gt;While the breadth of the Codecov breach remains unclear, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; notes that it could potentially have a similar, far-reaching impact as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188060/microsoft-president-solarwinds-orion-hack-breach-brad-smith"&gt;SolarWinds hack of late last year&lt;/a&gt;. In that breach, hackers associated with the Russian government compromised SolarWinds’ monitoring and management software. Some 250 entities are believed to have been affected by the SolarWinds breach including Nvidia, Cisco, and Belkin. The US Treasury, Commerce, State, Energy, and Homeland Security agencies were also affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8wLYf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xS3CMS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roblox to introduce content ratings for games to better restrict age-inappropriate content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Roblox logo on a smartphone" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oIiMf4Dx4vm3ChXjzIfSXT8sg7g=/0x0:4971x3314/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69143585/1232034013.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Rafael Henrique/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qohKIu"&gt;Virtual gaming platform Roblox is developing content ratings for games and easier-to-use parental controls, the company’s chief privacy officer Remy Malan told &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/roblox-struggles-with-sexual-content-it-hopes-a-ratings-system-will-address-the-problem-11618660801"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjUe7F"&gt;Half of Roblox’s audience of more than 30 million daily users are kids under 13, but the platform has struggled at times to contain sexually explicit content. Age-inappropriate games sometimes surface up on kids’ “recommended for you” lists, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdybR0"&gt;The platform’s current system restricts kids to specific games, but under the new system, parents would have more information about what kids might find in a given game; until you play a game, it’s not always clear that it might have explicit or inappropriate content in it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8mWaEs"&gt;Malan did not indicate when the new ratings system would be available, but said Roblox has a team of more than 2,300 people monitoring games for safety, and uses a mix of human moderators and AI. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8CfrPz"&gt;Roblox, which launched in 2006, has been a runaway hit during the pandemic, giving socially-distanced kids a social space to gather online. The company reported revenue of $588.7 million during the first nine months of 2020, a 68 percent increase over the same period in 2019. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/roblox-shares-jump-in-public-markets-debut-11615402033?page=1&amp;amp;mod=article_inline"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; went public&lt;/a&gt; via direct listing in March, and said in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm"&gt;its prospectus&lt;/a&gt; that its users spent an average of 2.6 hours daily on the platform over the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wwg6n0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google introducing a feature in Chrome 90 to create links to highlighted text on a webpage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cUclObS02E-f6lIvl6OO_Z-EiGE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69143488/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1h5rqm"&gt;An upcoming feature in Chrome 90 will allow users to create a link to a section of a website that they’ve highlighted. First &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295300/google-link-to-text-fragment-chrome-extension-chromium-highlight-scroll-down"&gt;launched as a browser extension&lt;/a&gt; called Link to Text Fragment last year, Google has now added the feature within Chrome itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDkFv7"&gt;The new feature is still rolling out to users; I wasn’t able to get it to work even after I updated to Chrome 90. But the feature works just like the browser extension did, according to a &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/more-helpful-chrome-throughout-your-workday/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; from Google product manager Kayce Hawkins: Visit a web page, highlight the text you want to create a link to, right click, and select “copy link to highlight.” A URL ending in a pound sign (#) is generated, which you can then share with others. When they open the link, they’ll be sent to the specific highlighted section instead of the beginning of the page.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rIW4W4nVsYNQKL1impKBHfGva5k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22451590/keyword_highlight.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/more-helpful-chrome-throughout-your-workday/" target="_blank"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RmLbjN"&gt;An example of what the end result looked like using the browser extension can be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21288970/sony-ps5-playstation-5-announcement-analysis-graphics-games#GNaFeX:~:text=And%20that%E2%80%99s%20completely%20fine.%20Sony%E2%80%99s%20presentation,the%20PS5%20to%20be%20any%20different."&gt;found here&lt;/a&gt; (but only in Chrome and Edge browsers). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a7jzpT"&gt;Google said the “copy link to highlight” feature is already available on desktop and Android devices for some users. The feature is “coming soon” to iOS, the company added. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon has canceled its Lord of the Rings MMO game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/me-JBnz9kQj6mucoUGuDlYy9IXw=/65x0:761x464/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69143386/DOiAi2WUEAE3A1Y.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OkE29Z"&gt;Amazon Game Studios has canceled a &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; online role-playing game, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-17/amazon-cancels-lord-of-the-rings-game-announced-two-years-ago?srnd=technology-vp&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/10/20688736/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-athlon-games-leyou-free-to-play-tolkien"&gt;announced the project&lt;/a&gt; with Leyou-owned Athlon Games back in 2019, and planned it to be a free-to-play game for PC and consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsMYkR"&gt;The game was to be set “at a time long before the events of &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;, exploring lands, people and creatures never seen before by fans of the Tolkien universe,” according to an announcement from Athlon at the time. But &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-12-14-leyou-shareholders-approve-tencent-takeover"&gt;Leyou was acquired&lt;/a&gt; by Tencent Holdings in December, and an Amazon spokesperson said in an email to The Verge that the company was “unable to secure terms to proceed with this title at this time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m473iG"&gt;The team from the LOTR project will work on other games for the company, the spokesperson added. “We love the Lord of the Rings IP, and are disappointed that we won’t be bringing this game to customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NWInE"&gt;Since its launch in 2014, Amazon Game Studios has yet to release a successful video game, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21510190/amazon-crucible-canceled-game-studios-closed-beta"&gt;canceling some&lt;/a&gt; previously announced games and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320325/amazon-new-world-delayed-spring-2021-crucible"&gt;delaying others&lt;/a&gt;. Its video game adaptation of &lt;em&gt;The Grand Tour&lt;/em&gt; in 2019 got such bad reviews that the game was pulled&lt;a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/support/the-grand-tour-game/contact-us?selectedCategory=knvoHwbjb7jhI9UTc7Bwc&amp;amp;selectedIssue=6mv76MwH3RghqKo988Cl14"&gt; from storefronts&lt;/a&gt;. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-29/amazon-game-studios-struggles-to-find-a-hit?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that the games studio had internal problems, including a culture that didn’t provide equal opportunities to men and women, and an in-house game engine that was “painfully slow.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iuRF67"&gt;But Amazon’s incoming CEO Andy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22265932/amazon-ceo-game-studios-andy-jassy-commitment-struggling-video-game-division"&gt;Jassy said in response&lt;/a&gt; that he’s committed to the video games division, which launched under outgoing CEO and Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, who is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22263039/amazon-new-ceo-jeff-bezos-andy-jassy-executive-chair-board-q3-2021"&gt;stepping down as CEO&lt;/a&gt; later this year. “I believe this team will get there if we stay focused on what matters most,” Jassy said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKDj2C"&gt;In the meanwhile, Amazon still reportedly plans to spend a breathtaking sum on a different &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; property: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388035/amazon-lord-of-the-rings-lotr-tv-series-production-cost-season-1"&gt;it’s said to be paying $465 million for the first season of its &lt;em&gt;LotR&lt;/em&gt; TV show&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CWXxxP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 17th, 6:45PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement from Amazon spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZarA9f"&gt;NASA has rescheduled the first flight of its Ingenuity Mars helicopter to April 19th at 3:30AM ET, the&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-to-attempt-first-controlled-flight-on-mars-as-soon-as-monday"&gt; agency announced&lt;/a&gt; Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KY26kL"&gt;The four-pound helicopter that arrived on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;Mars on February 18th with its parent rover Perseverance&lt;/a&gt; has seen its first flight delayed a few times. It touched the surface of Mars on April 4th, and has been undergoing tests and checkouts. It survived its first night alone on Mars’ frigid surface, passing a first test of its independence from Perseverance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijL8wR"&gt;The craft was scheduled to take flight April 11th, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/10/22377299/nasa-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-flight-delayed-wednesday"&gt;last weekend NASA said&lt;/a&gt; data from a high-speed rotor test showed the test sequence ended early, as Ingenuity’s computer tried to switch from pre-flight to flight mode The date was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381554/ingenuity-mars-first-flight-delayed-nasa-fixes-software-bug"&gt;pushed back again&lt;/a&gt; after Ingenuity experienced a minor software glitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LS99Vh"&gt;Engineers at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory &lt;a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/status/290/work-progresses-toward-ingenuity-s-first-flight-on-mars/"&gt;decided to modify and reinstall&lt;/a&gt; Ingenuity’s flight control software, a process that took several days. NASA &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASA/status/1383221042504638464?s=20"&gt;tweeted Friday night&lt;/a&gt; that Ingenuity had completed a full-speed spin test and a decision about the next flight date was forthcoming. The little helicopter has been waiting on the surface of Mars’ Jezero Crater as NASA engineers tested and reinstalled the flight software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdiOyt"&gt;While Ingenuity is not the main focus of Perseverance’s mission on Mars— which is to look for signs of life and take dirt samples— the little helicopter could provide a leap forward in human exploration of Mars and other celestial bodies. Rovers like Perseverance can only move so far and don’t have details about what may lie ahead in their paths. But a small craft like Ingenuity can become like a scout, flying ahead to help the rover navigate Mars’ surface, and get to areas that other vehicles may not be able to reach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4axju"&gt;Once it does take off, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346773/nasa-mars-ingenuity-helicopter-perseverance-rover-flight-zone"&gt;Ingenuity will climb&lt;/a&gt; about 10 feet (3 meters), then hover in place for 30 seconds before turning in midair and descending back to the surface. The camera on its underside will take 30 photos per second of the ground. A larger camera will face the horizon and snap photos while in flight, and at the same time Perseverance’s cameras will take pictures of Ingenuity flying. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhGyUm"&gt;If you’re up for an early morning Monday (or late night, depending where you are), you can watch the live stream of Ingenuity’s flight starting at 6:15AM ET/3:15AM PT, on NASA Television, the agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/live"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, and social media platforms, including &lt;a href="https://youtube.com/NASAJPL"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://facebook.com/NASAJPL"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
