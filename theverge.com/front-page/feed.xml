    <title>Google releases first Android 12L beta for large-screen devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hl2nMx9xoOltgiai1zhOzPV5JaI=/164x0:1436x848/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70245382/Untitled_3.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of Android 12L’s biggest features is a two-column UI for things like the notification shade and lock screen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j1QSJX"&gt;Google has announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/27/22746599/android-12l-feature-drop-big-screens"&gt;its Android 12L update&lt;/a&gt; — the one designed to give its OS a better experience on tablets and large folding phones — is getting its first beta release today. While Beta 1 still seems very much pointed toward developers, it could be a chance to see what Google’s working on in a (slightly) more polished state than the developer preview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8H6vAt"&gt;With Android 12L, Google is adding a two-column layout for devices with larger screens, which will let you get at more information at once. For example, your quick settings and notifications can display side by side. Google’s also working to improve multitasking, letting you drag an app into split-screen mode from the taskbar (which you can also use to quickly switch between apps).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="12L multitasking" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FD3D0_mO4f485sllpdRAZ3BUjzY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22959161/12L_multitasking.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google says 12L should make it easier to multitask.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n74WU5"&gt;As with the developer preview, Google says you should be able to run the beta on an actual large-screen device if you have a Lenovo Tab P12 Pro, though it does say that the beta won’t be available until “a later date.” If you don’t have one of those lying around or don’t feel like waiting, you can also run the 12L beta &lt;a href="https://developer.android.com/about/versions/12/12L/get#resizable-emulator"&gt;in an emulator&lt;/a&gt; to get a feel for how it’ll look when it becomes more widely available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUCadF"&gt;Google also says you’ll be able to install 12L on your “supported Pixel device,” a &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/android/beta#faq"&gt;list that currently includes&lt;/a&gt; the Pixel 3A through the Pixel 5A, though you won’t be able to test out the large screen UI. If you really just want to be on the bleeding edge, though, or are testing out apps that make use of 12L’s new APIs, you can &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/android/beta#devices"&gt;enroll your Pixel here&lt;/a&gt;. Keep in mind that as the first beta, it’s probably a little rough around the edges. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best wired or wireless gaming mouse you can buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emGA8ro9D4lNLBPQkh0oh092_xQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66870539/acastro_200323_1777_gamingMouse_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Whatever your budget or grip style is, we’ve found the best gaming mouse for you.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Multiple picks for all budgets&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="eiRucN"&gt;Finding the right gaming mouse amid all the options available can be a struggle. There are a lot of factors to consider, like how it looks, how it feels in the hand, the button selection and arrangement, the quality of its sensor, and whether you want a mouse that’s wireless or wired. These details, minor as they may seem, can have a major impact on your experience with the mouse you choose to buy. On the other hand, sometimes mice have features that get overblown and aren’t really worth the extra cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MOD0oD"&gt;If you’re looking for a wireless gaming mouse, you’ll want the best that your budget allows for. We’re going to make this decision easy for you. The best wireless gaming mouse is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07L4BM851?&amp;amp;linkCode=sl1&amp;amp;tag=vergereviews-20&amp;amp;linkId=0e8456acb6ff5049a8ca9a3010f859d7&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech’s G502 Lightspeed&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the most well-rounded choice if you want comfort, a long-lasting battery, and the best selection and arrangement of buttons. But if you want some alternatives, there are some new, solid contenders below that offer different designs and features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bbAxZF"&gt;If you are looking for the best wired gaming mouse, we’ve recently made some major changes to this section. The Razer DeathAdder V2 has been dethroned by the more feature-dense &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Frazer-basilisk-v3-wired-optical-gaming-mouse-with-chroma-rbg-lighting-black%2F6475703.p%3FskuId%3D6475703&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer Basilisk V3&lt;/a&gt;. And for people who don’t want to spend $70, there’s a cheaper alternative that you might enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBKPjC"&gt;Like our guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"&gt;best gaming headset&lt;/a&gt;, what follows focuses mostly on newer models that you’re more likely to see on store shelves as opposed to older models, which may be tougher to find in stock — even if they might still be worth your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="OI1GuQ"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3lO4oA"&gt;The best wireless gaming mouse: Logitech G502 Lightspeed ($120)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Best gaming mouse: Logitech G502 Lightspeed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KjQweePnmr6NqW900etrvOctA34=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16219644/akrales_190507_3407_0017.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Logitech G502 Lightspeed  &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GenFNF"&gt;The Logitech G502 Lightspeed is a great gaming mouse for discerning gamers who don’t want to compromise on much of anything — or for casual users who just want a good, solid mouse. It’s comfortable and feature-packed, and even though it’s wireless, it’s a fast and accurate performer that doesn’t feel at a disadvantage against wired mice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJdIHm"&gt;At $150, the best doesn’t come cheap (though you can sometimes find it for around $100 these days). But if you’ve tossed around the idea of making an investment in a high-end wireless mouse, no other model that I tested for this buying guide justified its price so easily. The G502 Lightspeed has the best features of Logitech’s gaming and general-use mice all rolled into one. The main buttons deliver a satisfying bounce response when you tap them, and unlike some other popular models, they click easily no matter how you grip your hand on the mouse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIq7sZ"&gt;This mouse also features a quick-release button, a feature borrowed from other Logitech consumer-focused and gaming mice. By default, the scroll wheel staggers down a single webpage with each step, which is how you expect a scroll wheel to work. Tapping the button releases the mechanism gripping the wheel, allowing it to freely sail to the bottom of a long page. It’s a small feature, but one that gives the mouse more versatility in certain situations, like being able to quickly scroll through your inventory when in a game.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech G502 Lightspeed" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tRLAe6Nq6SE9DoYoV5sxbZJTxrk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/16219645/akrales_190507_3407_0026.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G502 Lightspeed may not have the most inviting design, but it’s incredibly comfortable to use.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1Q3DLU"&gt;Another nice feature is the inclusion of 16 grams of weights you can insert into the mouse to give it more resistance. A mouse’s weight comes down to personal preference, and that could vary from game to game. This mouse is among the few modern wireless devices to give you the flexibility to change up the weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2V6RE"&gt;The fact that the G502 Lightspeed is wireless makes it that much easier to bring along with you wherever you go. But if you just can’t swing the $150 price, I suggest that you check out the $50 &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07GBZ4Q68/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech G502 Hero&lt;/a&gt;, which is the wired version of this mouse. It has almost every feature that you’ll find in the wireless model — except, you know, wireless capability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UBe8su"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9550529" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1K4jR3"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="I7xlEt"&gt;The runner-up: Corsair M65 Ultra Wireless ($130)&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Corsair M65 Ultra Wireless" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i2jkT3Tx63B1LBX33LDCe53SJcc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067610/cfaulkner_141231_4910_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In terms of fit and finish, the M65 Ultra Wireless is identical to its wired counterpart.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OxTTkG"&gt;Corsair’s M65 has long been one of my favorite mouse designs. It’s hefty, bulky, and each of its buttons are big enough that I never whiff on hitting them. That all might sound like it amounts to an unwieldy mouse to some (and it will be, if you prefer lighter mice that have a lower profile), yet it always makes me feel like I have total control over every aspect of the mouse. So it wasn’t a surprise that I enjoyed using the new M65 Ultra Wireless, which keeps the same design (including the ability to add up to 18g of weights), but lops off the cable, adding Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvkqcx"&gt;Just like the wired version, this one comes with extra weights, letting you boost it from 110g (its default weight) to 128g after you add three weights. As several wireless mice are gunning to be a featherweight, averaging at around 65g, this one’s a monster comparatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bnxVKm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10909065" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IcMvHo"&gt;I enjoy using the M65 Ultra Wireless as much as the G502 Lightspeed in-game, though there was one experimental feature on Corsair’s mouse that gave it the edge: its gyroscope that can trigger preset actions when you tilt the mouse. After you customize this setting in Corsair’s iCue companion software, you can do things like reload or anything else by giving the mouse a tilt. It’s satisfying to use and undeniably clever, though this never became second nature to me. That said, I could see this being the kind of feature that earns this mouse some die-hard fans. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Corsair M65 Ultra Wireless" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2TrjyALbhq-keuEuKwwSzEbDs2c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067603/cfaulkner_141231_4910_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M65 Ultra Wireless’ side buttons are delightfully big, making them easy to feel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gpY31v"&gt;The fit and finish of the M65 Ultra Wireless is on par with some of the best mice out there, though I missed one too many features to make this my main mouse. Namely, the G502 Lightspeed’s button that lets the scroll wheel spin freely when pressed is essential because it makes the mouse more useful in both games and non-play time when I’m working. I like that the Corsair’s mouse charges via USB-C, while the G502 Lightspeed is using Micro USB. If these differences don’t irk you, and you’re alright with a heavy mouse, you might really like the M65 Ultra Wireless. As for me, it’s one that I want to keep on my desk for some games, but not for nonstop use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="vOoCiS"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WRps16"&gt;Other good wireless options&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech G303 Shroud" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-tXZtDJOTsSPvJgWBDrdJ3OsLrI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067611/cfaulkner_141231_4910_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G303 Shroud makes for an understated addition to your desk.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5bmll"&gt;Logitech recently released a wireless take on its G303 Daedalus mouse in partnership with pro gamer and streamer Shroud. It’s called the G303 Shroud. And while this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Lightspeed-Wireless-tunable-Weights/dp/B08L9HPLP1/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$129.99 mouse&lt;/a&gt; is relatively light on features (and mostly identical to its wired counterpart, with two side buttons and a DPI switcher being its only supplemental buttons), it’s a comfortable, long-lasting option that seems particularly well suited to first-person shooters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFUrM5"&gt;Compared to the G502 Lightspeed above, the G303 Shroud doesn’t exactly cradle your hand, though gamers who don’t want to smother a mouse with their grip might prefer how this one feels. It has an ambidextrous shape (though its thumb buttons suit right-handed mouse users), and the translucent plastic sides jut out a bit to fit within your thumb joint and serve as a stopper for your pinky on the other side. The thumb buttons here are easy to reach for, though I wish they were thicker to minimize the chance of misfiring during a heated match. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech G303 Shroud" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qzVEV0SDPTmtLDwrwCtMFuXJEBI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067609/cfaulkner_141231_4910_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wish the G303’s side buttons were thicker, but they’re more than serviceable as is.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DJ4z1H"&gt;The G303 Shroud is a simplistic gaming mouse that some minimalists will take to for its distinct lack of flair — the only LED is its battery indicator near the scroll wheel. The G303 didn’t blow me away with its design or with how it feels in the hand, but it’s a solid option if you want a no-frills wireless gaming mouse — if you can swallow the cost.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Corsair Dark Core RGB Pro SE" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/34H4GpKR93Xz1ejL3_3XCarRxQw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19984098/cfaulkner_200513_4020_0001.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LxusJS"&gt;Corsair’s Dark Core RGB Pro SE (&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1726258737981131320" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$89&lt;/a&gt;) is a good pick if you want oodles of features. It offers USB-C charging and supports Qi wireless charging. This mouse can switch between 2.4GHz wireless mode via its included USB dongle (cleverly tucked under its removable, magnetic wing) or Bluetooth. Of course, you’ll get better results by using the dongle, but it’s great to have options. I found that the battery life, while decent, wasn’t quite as long lasting as the G502 Lightspeed or the Kone Pro Air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOpEA3"&gt;Some smaller, but equally welcome, features here come in the form of that removable magnetic wing I just mentioned, which snaps onto its right side to let me comfortably rest my ring and pinky fingers. You might appreciate this most customizable design like I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="9tGmNh"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OXztCs"&gt;The best wired gaming mouse: Razer Basilisk V3 ($70)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KJMcde"&gt;Razer’s DeathAdder V2 has been my favorite wired gaming mouse for a while, mainly because it’s just so comfortable to use. But one of Razer’s newer mice, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Basilisk-Customizable-Ergonomic-Gaming/dp/B09C13PZX7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$70 Basilisk V3&lt;/a&gt;, delivers the comfort that I’m looking for, along with several more features. One feature that I personally have a tough time living without is its new scroll wheel tech that can automatically alternate between ridged scrolling and free-spin modes depending on the intensity of your scrolling. This is a feature that comes in handy in and out of gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Basilisk V3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rkAF9GigtoFNF7N99FqpSZ6qzcA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067607/cfaulkner_141231_4910_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The DPI clutch (also known as the sniper button) is now fixed to the Basilisk V3. It was removable in the previous iteration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="25cJZk"&gt;The Basilisk V3 is, in many ways, identical to its predecessor, with a familiar, ergonomic design that’s similar to the G502 Lightspeed wireless gaming mouse. There’s a large, grippy thumb rest on its site, sharing that space with two generously sized thumb buttons and a DPI clutch that can make sniping easier (unlike the V2, where this clutch was optional, it’s fastened to the V3). This mouse has some other niceties, like a tilting scroll wheel and support for multiple profiles saved to its onboard storage. If you’re inclined to customize your RGB LEDs, this mouse has a section around its entire body that can let LEDs shine onto your mousepad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAzpUr"&gt;The $69.99 Basilisk V3 costs the same amount as the DeathAdder V2 at many retailers, and for the price, you’ll be hard-pressed to find a mouse that can offer more features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WDXFps"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10909072" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zVjY6B"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whOXje"&gt;The runner-up: Cooler Master MM720 (starts at $30)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7fF8B"&gt;During the latest update to this guide, no mouse that I went hands-on with surprised me as much as Cooler Master’s MM720, a $50 model that, as it turns out, has a bit of a cult following for a good reason. It’s one of the most comfortable mice that I’ve used, with a design that’s equally suited to people who want a cozy grip during work hours and those who have a claw grip while gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TuxwdM"&gt;The MM720’s design is undeniably divisive (and goofy) at first blush, with a large section jutting out of its right side to give your ring or pinky fingers a cozy place to rest. There’s much about this mouse’s design that one person may love, while another might curse its existence. Like all mice, it comes down to personal preference, grip style, and the games that you like to play. As for me, it feels great to use, despite the fact that I don’t tend to use a claw-style grip. Instead, my medium-sized hand fits over the mouse’s barely curved surface, with my fingertips hanging off the edge of the mouse slightly. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Cooler Master MM720" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3TJ5NxN5-npgqFMakX5vW9nWop8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23067605/cfaulkner_141231_4910_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MM720 is one of the lightest wired mice around at 49 grams. Yet, it doesn’t feel like a toy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hGIqmg"&gt;The MM720 is the lightest mouse that I’ve tested yet, coming in at 49 grams. Despite that ultra lightweight build, it doesn’t feel hollow or cheap — not that this mouse has much to prove at its $29.99 price. It features two main mouse buttons, an LED-lit scroll wheel that indicates the DPI sensitivity when you press its bottom-located DPI-switching button. Its two thumb buttons on the side are slightly bulbous, as to make them easier to feel. There are just a lot of smart design choices here considering the low price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nXD6D5"&gt;If you’re shopping for a wired mouse on a budget, and you know you don’t want oodles of features, consider picking up Cooler Master’s MM720. There’s less at stake with the cost compared to pricier mice, and if your taste in mice and grip style sound anything like mine, you stand to be impressed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="d6EsI3"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="opSJY5"&gt;Other good wired options&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="QqAQPG"&gt;Razer’s DeathAdder V2 is proof that a wired mouse doesn’t need countless features to be worth the money. It just needs to be extremely good at the fundamentals, including being comfy enough to use for hours at a time with games that require quick reflexes, having a simple assortment of buttons that take little to no time to master, and, of course, great performance. If this matches what you want in a mouse, the &lt;s&gt;$70&lt;/s&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-DeathAdder-Gaming-Mouse-Programmable/dp/B082G5SPR5/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=TVFJWP3TYAQJ&amp;amp;keywords=deathadder%2Bv2&amp;amp;qid=1638979126&amp;amp;s=electronics&amp;amp;sprefix=deathadder%2Celectronics%2C155&amp;amp;sr=1-1-spons&amp;amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzTkU4SUdXNzgyS1hZJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDQ4OTYwMVBRNVhIQTNYWTZINCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwODcxNzA3TldVQVBLVjZEMVU2JndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$43 Razer DeathAdder V2 is the one to get&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="SteelSeries Prime Plus" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CU-ZSEdoLEZdTXD28DuCS5oJ31g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22528993/primeplus.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UMPQwJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743526088835385586" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The &lt;s&gt;$80&lt;/s&gt; $40 Prime Plus&lt;/a&gt; is the middle child in SteelSeries’ new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22445746/steelseries-prime-arctis-headset-wireless-plus-gaming-mouse-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;made-for-esports Prime lineup&lt;/a&gt; of mice, yet it’s the most interesting and value-packed. It feels just like the others in that lineup, both in the way it fits your hand with a high arch that slopes to the right, as well as with what SteelSeries aptly calls “crispy” clicks. They’re a little louder than your average gaming mouse, and they have a more tactile feel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLVmkp"&gt;What sets the Prime Plus apart from the others in the Prime lineup (as well as the other options below) is the OLED screen and controls built into its underside. There’s no driver required to change in-depth settings. You hold the bottom button once it’s plugged in and use the scroll wheel to navigate a menu that lets you change things like the brightness of the OLED and the LED illuminating the scroll wheel. More importantly, you can adjust sensitivity, polling rate (125Hz to 1000Hz), and liftoff distance right from this display. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TeVjwP"&gt;As I mentioned near the top of this article, if $150 for Logitech’s wireless G502 Lightspeed is too much for you to spend, you might want to consider this wired version, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-G502-Performance-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B07GBZ4Q68?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the &lt;s&gt;$50&lt;/s&gt; $40 G502 Hero&lt;/a&gt;. It has the same design as our pick for the best wireless gaming mouse — actually, it’s basically the same in almost every way, down to the kind of sensor it uses and its adjustable weights. That makes it almost as good, though some might take issue with its thick braided cable and the somewhat slippery plastic used on the scroll wheel that isn’t on the Lightspeed model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsB5ht"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="KPe1W2"&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

    <title>The best budget laptop of 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Cheap Laptop 2021: HP Envy x360 13" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/91Ojp27YU24CRpqeGNGMFxMlSuQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807794/mchin_200705_4086_0001.0.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best cheap laptops under $800 from HP, Lenovo, and more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="ItC6sO"&gt;The best cheap laptops are getting better and better for less than $800. The question to ask is: what’s most important, and what are you willing to sacrifice? Even the best cheap laptops aren’t perfect in every area — they have some strengths but cut corners to achieve their price tags. You can almost certainly find a budget laptop with a touchscreen, a premium-looking chassis, an HDMI port, a backlit keyboard, or stylus support, but you may need to consider which of those features you want the most, and which you can go without.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqLems"&gt;Our pick for the best cheap laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;, running Windows 10. We feel that the Envy has build quality, performance, and battery life that surpass those of many premium laptops, as well as those priced under $800. But we’ve tested dozens of systems below $800, and we’ve got a number of additional models on this list from Lenovo, Acer, Samsung, HP, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVG16P"&gt;Other best cheap laptops of 2021 include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;. Many of these laptops also appear on our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296102/best-chromebooks"&gt;best Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptop&lt;/a&gt; lists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sPoJxi"&gt;Many of our picks for the best cheap laptop of 2021 are currently Chromebooks. We believe that Chromebooks are, in many cases, the best-value option for shoppers seeking a laptop under $500 and tend to offer better specs, features, and build quality than most Windows laptops at that price point. We hope to add more Windows laptops under $500 to this page in the future and are keeping a close eye on those releases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best cheap laptop ofof 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="r62WQ4"&gt;HP’s Envy x360 13, &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=7168&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeBestLaptop101521&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fhp-envy-x360-laptop-13z-ay000-8lz58av-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available for $860&lt;/a&gt; is the best budget laptop you can buy under $800. With a high-quality and sturdy convertible build, it looks like a device that should cost twice its price. It has plenty of other great features as well, including a really excellent keyboard and a bright, colorful screen. It’s also exceptional on the inside. Thanks to its AMD Ryzen processor, the system delivers all-day battery life and very smooth performance — it can even handle some light gaming. (Intel options are available as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ox216u"&gt;We have some minor complaints about the Envy, of course. The screen is 16:9, which is a cramped aspect ratio for multitasking. Our test unit had a somewhat limited port selection (notably, missing Thunderbolt and HDMI support) and came with some bloatware preinstalled. But none of these are deal-breakers at the Envy’s price point. Overall, budget shoppers will want for very little with this machine. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best laptop under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hyeIry"&gt;If you’re looking for an absurdly cheap Chromebook that absolutely gets the job done, you should definitely be looking at the $260 Lenovo Chromebook Duet. The Duet is a 10-inch aluminum alloy Chrome OS tablet that comes with a kickstand and keyboard cover. It looks sturdy and classy, and it can easily function as either a tablet or a PC. But you’re not compromising &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;much on performance for this device’s tiny size; as long as you’re not running dozens of tabs and apps, you should be fine. And we got over 11 hours of battery life in our testing, making it one of the longest-lasting Chromebooks we’ve seen in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kHlVCe"&gt;The main thing to know about the Chromebook Duet is that the screen is quite small — just 10.1 inches. That’s a fine size for a young student (especially with the touch capability) and for an adult’s secondary device for note-taking, Netflixing, and the like, but it’s not an ideal size for a primary work device unless you’re fine with quite a bit of squinting. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the clamshell Chromebook to buy, and one of the best cheap laptops under $800.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best budget laptop with Chrome OS &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="N34v09"&gt;If you’d prefer a more traditional Chromebook with a clamshell form factor, the $329 Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is an affordable option that’s all-around excellent. It has a gorgeous 3:2 display that delivers a sharp picture and bright, vibrant colors with plenty of vertical space. The screen alone would make the Chromebook Spin 713 a standout, but it has a number of other strengths as well, including a great keyboard, all-day battery life, and a comprehensive port selection, including an HDMI, in addition to USB-C, USB-A, and a microSD slot. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 is the best cheap laptop with a built-in stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IOuDKK"&gt;The best cheap laptop with a stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iQA7Ph"&gt;If you like the Duet’s size and detachable form factor but are willing to spend on something a bit more upscale, you may find the Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3 to be a better choice. Like the Duet, the CM3 is a 10.5-inch 16:10 Chrome OS tablet with a fabric cover, kickstand, and detachable screen. But the CM3’s kickstand folds multiple ways: you can crease it lengthwise to stand the tablet up like a laptop or fold it the short way and stand the tablet up horizontally. Plus, it comes with a built-in USI stylus and roomy keys with a surprising amount of travel. Battery life was also quite impressive: we averaged close to 13 hours of continuous work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oUYikQ"&gt;Where the CM3 lags a bit behind the Duet (and other cheap laptops you may try) is the power. Its MediaTek processor can be a bit sluggish compared to more pricier offerings. But the CM3 still offers a surprising number of perks for its sub-$400 price and makes a great student driver or secondary device. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best laptop under $800&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="o8zBHM"&gt;If you’re looking for a budget Windows laptop that’s thinner and lighter than the Envy x360 while delivering similar category-topping performance, the $669 HP Pavilion Aero 13 is a good choice for you. It has a powerful eight-core Ryzen processor, which is one of the fastest processors for thin and light laptops that you can get. Not only does it perform well, but it’s also unbelievably light at just 2.1 pounds, and it comes with a blindingly bright 16:10 screen. It’s a standout in battery life, too — I averaged almost 11 hours of continuous work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOWROI"&gt;HP did have to cut a few corners to achieve those benefits at this price point. The audio on our model wasn’t great, and the device shipped with some cheap bloatware installed. But the Pavilion Aero 13 is excellent in almost every other way, and it won’t disappoint if you’re looking for a functional, cheap Windows PC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="pT23AG"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable Chromebook that stands out from the crowd, the $549 Galaxy Chromebook 2 should be on your list. It comes in a bold “fiesta red” color (as well as a regular gray, if you prefer to blend in). It’s a touchscreen convertible with stylus support (though the stylus isn’t included). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7QIDME"&gt;On top of the design, the Galaxy Chromebook 2 includes an excellent QLED panel, which is one of the best displays we’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. You also get a solid keyboard, decent battery life (we averaged 7 hours and 21 minutes of continuous work), and a port selection that includes two USB-C ports, a microSD slot, and a headphone jack. It’s easily one of the best Chromebooks you can buy and one of the best cheap laptops as well. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best cheap laptop for Surface fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9t4Ji3"&gt;The $399 Surface Go 2 is a 10.5-inch tablet that’s about the size of a regular iPad. You’ll have to buy the keyboard cover separately, but the overall package is still quite affordable if you’re buying a lower-priced model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hPLGr"&gt;You can configure the Surface Go 2 with a Pentium Gold or Core m3 processor. Those aren’t the fanciest or most powerful processors, but the system should still be adequate for your streaming and browsing needs, especially if you only need it to do one task at a time. It can run any Windows app, it’s easy to carry around, and it makes a solid secondary computer. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Swift 3 is one of the best college laptops you can buy, and one of the best cheap laptops under $800.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cIbAld"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21377208/acer-swift-3-review-2020-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Acer Swift 3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;The best student laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="DeUYiZ"&gt;Many of the best cheap laptops might be good choices for high school and college students, but the Acer Swift 3’s exceptionally durable build makes it an excellent choice for backpack-battering and dining hall spills. Its 14-inch screen also gives you more room for homework multitasking than some of the 13-inch machines here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVxnSd"&gt;But the highlight of the Swift 3 is its Ryzen 4000 processors. We tested a model with a Ryzen 7 4700U, which did an excellent job handling our daily multitasking workload, and delivered seven-hour battery life as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWSkuR"&gt;On the outside, the Swift 3 isn’t the thinnest or most beautiful laptop you can buy, but it’s a solid performer in most areas. It has all kinds of ports, including USB-C, USB-A, and an HDMI. The backlit keyboard has a nice click to it and has a reliable integrated fingerprint reader as well.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lenovo Yoga C740 is a sturdy aluminum laptop for any use case, making it one of the best cheap laptops under $800.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="m9IrEq"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/11/21174917/lenovo-yoga-c740-review-laptop-specs-features-price-2-in-1-convertible"&gt;Lenovo Yoga C740&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TA1Mem"&gt;A cheap laptop with standout build&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HqEdaD"&gt;The Yoga C740 is as straightforward as a laptop can get. It has a sturdy aluminum build and perfectly fine 10th Gen Intel processors. We were pleasantly surprised by the device’s audio — the upward-firing speakers on the sides of the keyboard deliver a nice surround-sound experience. The keyboard and touchpad are both quite comfortable to use. There’s not much to complain about and not much to enthusiastically praise — if you’re looking for a sub-$800 Windows laptop with a well-made aluminum chassis and a sturdy frame, you’re looking for the Yoga. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGHm6c"&gt;The C740 is a year old now, but that means you can get it at very affordable prices. We’re looking forward to reviewing its successor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21373719/lenovo-yoga-7i-6-convertible-laptops-intel-amd-processors-windows"&gt;Yoga 7i&lt;/a&gt;, shortly in the future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is testing a new way to let you add content warnings to posts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wpaqYLTl_l4g7qo4x90OsZxBt8Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70245150/acastro_180827_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NvgzEB"&gt;Twitter is piloting a new feature that will let users add specific content warnings to individual photos and videos sent out in tweets. The platform noted that the feature would be available to “some” users during the test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EvFNz1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;People use Twitter to discuss what’s happening in the world, which sometimes means sharing unsettling or sensitive content. We’re testing an option for some of you to add one-time warnings to photos and videos you Tweet out, to help those who might want the warning. &lt;a href="https://t.co/LCUA5QCoOV"&gt;pic.twitter.com/LCUA5QCoOV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSafety/status/1468317145423511554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Scf8iu"&gt;Although Twitter currently has a way to add content warnings to tweets, the only way to do it is to &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/media-settings"&gt;add the warning to &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; your tweets&lt;/a&gt;. In other words, every photo or video you post will have a content warning, regardless of whether it contains sensitive material or not. The new feature it’s testing lets you add the warning to single tweets and apply specific categories to that warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHB3Fv"&gt;As shown in the video that Twitter posted, it appears that when you’re editing an image or video, tapping the flag icon on the bottom right corner of the toolbar lets you add a content warning. The next screen lets you categorize the warning, with choices including “nudity,” “violence,” or “sensitive.” Once you post the tweet, the image or video will appear blurred out, and it’s overlaid with a content warning that explains why you flagged it. Users can click through the warning if they want to view the content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCqHpp"&gt;If you fail to flag content when you post sensitive material, Twitter will — as it has already been doing — rely on user reports to decide whether or not your content should have a warning. In addition to its content warning experiment, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822878/twitter-testing-changes-report-tweet-abuse-suspicious-behavior"&gt;Twitter announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that it’s trying out a “human-first” way to handle the reporting process. Instead of asking the user what rules the tweet is breaking, it will give the user the chance to describe what exactly happened, and based on that response, it will determine a specific violation.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Over 40 million people had health information leaked this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X4mdRqzqJfSSnUMGFBmkBTc5NuU=/0x0:2130x1420/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244745/VRG_ILLO_1777_AK_body_data.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aSY4OY"&gt;Over 40 million people in the United States had their personal health information exposed in data breaches this year, a significant jump from 2020 and a continuation of a trend toward more and more health data hacks and leaks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mf8SHn"&gt;Health organizations are required to report any health data breaches that impact 500 or more people to the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services, which &lt;a href="https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf"&gt;makes the breaches public&lt;/a&gt;. So far this year, the office has received reports of 578 breaches, &lt;a href="https://ocrportal.hhs.gov/ocr/breach/breach_report.jsf"&gt;according to its database&lt;/a&gt;. That’s fewer than the 599 breaches reported &lt;a href="https://pages.bitglass.com/rs/418-ZAL-815/images/CDFY21Q1HealthcareBreachReport2021.pdf?aliId=eyJpIjoiOE54NGRRTkhCZDY3aUxGMiIsInQiOiJ0RTZ1QVZXbnFPUGRhZXhVbmhyMmVnPT0ifQ%253D%253D"&gt;in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, but last year’s breaches only affected about 26 million people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PF8S7Q"&gt;Since 2015, hacks or other IT incidents have been the leading reason people have their health records exposed, according to &lt;a href="https://pages.bitglass.com/rs/418-ZAL-815/images/CDFY21Q1HealthcareBreachReport2021.pdf?aliId=eyJpIjoiOE54NGRRTkhCZDY3aUxGMiIsInQiOiJ0RTZ1QVZXbnFPUGRhZXhVbmhyMmVnPT0ifQ%253D%253D"&gt;a report&lt;/a&gt; from security company Bitglass. Before then, lost or stolen devices led to the most data breaches. The transition coincided with federal rules in the US requiring that healthcare organizations use electronic medical records and the broader switch toward digital tools like internet-connected monitors in healthcare. Medical records are &lt;a href="https://www.accountablehq.com/post/why-is-phi-valuable-to-hackers"&gt;valuable&lt;/a&gt; on the black market — they have information that’s harder to change than a credit card and can be used to make fake medical claims or purchase medications. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zhk0l"&gt;There are a few ways these types of breaches can harm patients: people can have private information exposed and could have to deal with the financial repercussions of having their medical identity stolen. Hacks and attacks on healthcare institutions that shut down hospital computer systems can make it harder for them to deliver quality care, and that can be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696097/hospital-ransomware-cyberattack-death-rates-patients"&gt;harmful to the people treated there&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02058"&gt;Research shows&lt;/a&gt; that more people die in hospitals suffering from data breaches, even those that don’t result in a computer system shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sOs2Xl"&gt;Many healthcare organizations haven’t prioritized investment in cybersecurity, even as the risk of cyberattacks continues to go up. The biggest breach in 2021, for instance, was from a cyberattack of the Florida Healthy Kids Corporation health plan, which exposed the information of 3.5 million people. An analysis after the attack found that the plan’s website had “significant vulnerabilities,” &lt;a href="https://health.wusf.usf.edu/health-news-florida/2021-01-29/florida-healthy-kids-website-breached"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Health News Florida&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWd10Y"&gt;Experts say, though, that the spikes in attacks over 2020 and 2021 — particularly in ransomware attacks — are pushing organizations to take the threat &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22776561/hosptial-cyberattack-ransomware-risk"&gt;more seriously&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Both the disc-based model and the Digital Edition will be available.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n38PYV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12:55PM ET, December 8th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Walmart has cleared through its stock of consoles reserved for its Walmart Plus subscribers. I hope that you lucked out today!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DPPCAj"&gt;Ready. Steady. Go. If you’re still looking for a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X, Walmart Plus members will be able to queue up for the console beginning at 12PM EST on Wednesday, December 8th. Walmart will open the digital queue for the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420%3F&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restock120521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;standard PlayStation 5 ($500&lt;/a&gt;), the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F987823383&amp;amp;subid1=VergePS5Restock120521" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;disc-less, digital-only version ($400)&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;sharedid=Vergerestock12082021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X ($500)&lt;/a&gt;. This paywall doesn’t guarantee that you’ll have success in snagging a console, but it’s currently the only way to be in the running at this particular retailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DjPdLk"&gt;You have to be logged into your Walmart Plus account to even attempt to add a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X to your cart, so if you haven’t done so already, make sure you log in ahead of time and have your credentials saved to keep things moving along. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6lICTr"&gt;If you aren’t already a Walmart Plus member, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fplus%2Fplans%3Fdirect%3Dtrue%26returnurl%3D%25252Fip%25252FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%25252F987823383" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you’ll need to sign up for this $13 / month subscription service&lt;/a&gt; in order to be eligible for this restock. Unfortunately, you can’t simply exploit the 15-day free trial it offers, but subscribing to the service will make you eligible for benefits like free shipping and early access to sales and restock events.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DeepMind tests the limits of large AI language systems with 280-billion-parameter model</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xV9oGpw1PY-UCk-U2KNM7nNnkqo=/170x217:1871x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244594/acastro_200730_1777_ai_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YCGXgS"&gt;Language generation is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22734662/ai-language-artificial-intelligence-future-models-gpt-3-limitations-bias"&gt;hottest thing in AI&lt;/a&gt; right now, with a class of systems known as “large language models” (or LLMs) being used for everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443441/google-ai-language-models-dangers-risk-io-timnit-gebru-margaret-mitchell-firing"&gt;improving Google’s search engine&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/30/21042942/ai-dungeon-nick-walton-openai-gpt2-text-adventure-game-web-version-launch"&gt;creating text-based fantasy games&lt;/a&gt;. But these programs also have serious problems, including regurgitating sexist and racist language and failing tests of logical reasoning. One big question is: can these weaknesses be improved by simply adding more data and computing power, or are we reaching the limits of this technological paradigm? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0ztqP"&gt;This is one of the topics that Alphabet’s AI lab DeepMind is tackling in a trio of research papers &lt;a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/language-modelling-at-scale"&gt;published today&lt;/a&gt;. The company’s conclusion is that scaling up these systems further should deliver plenty of improvements. “One key finding of the paper is that the progress and capabilities of large language models is still increasing. This is not an area that has plateaued,” DeepMind research scientist Jack Rae told reporters in a briefing call. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="b36D63"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is not an area that has plateaued.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G5zmBg"&gt;DeepMind, which regularly feeds its work into Google products, has probed the capabilities of this LLMs by building a &lt;a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/research/language-research/Training%20Gopher.pdf"&gt;language model with 280 billion parameters&lt;/a&gt; named Gopher. Parameters are a quick measure of a language’s models size and complexity, meaning that Gopher is larger than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential"&gt;OpenAI’s GPT-3 &lt;/a&gt;(175 billion parameters) but not as big as some more experimental systems, like Microsoft and Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/12/nvidia_microsoft_mtnlg/"&gt;Megatron model&lt;/a&gt; (530 billion parameters). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQq635"&gt;It’s generally true in the AI world that bigger is better, with larger models usually offering higher performance. DeepMind’s research confirms this trend and suggests that scaling up LLMs does offer improved performance on the most common benchmarks testing things like sentiment analysis and summarization. However, researchers also cautioned that some issues inherent to language models will need more than just data and compute to fix.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Fgfks"&gt;“I think right now it really looks like the model can fail in variety of ways,” said Rae. “Some subset of those ways are because the model just doesn’t have sufficiently good comprehension of what it’s reading, and I feel like, for those class of problems, we are just going to see improved performance with more data and scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sawSU4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Not all problems with AI language systems can be solved with scale&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IQDwRG"&gt;But, he added, there are “other categories of problems, like the model perpetuating stereotypical biases or the model being coaxed into giving mistruths, that [...] no one at DeepMind thinks scale will be the solution [to].” In these cases, language models will need “additional training routines” like feedback from human users, he noted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rstqKE"&gt;To come to these conclusions, DeepMind’s researchers evaluated a range of different-sized language models on 152 language tasks or benchmarks. They found that larger models generally delivered improved results, with Gopher itself offering state-of-the-art performance on roughly 80 percent of the tests selected by the scientists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMbaKN"&gt;In another paper, the company also &lt;a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/research/language-research/Ethical%20and%20social%20risks.pdf"&gt;surveyed the wide range of potential harms&lt;/a&gt; involved with deploying LLMs. These include the systems’ use of toxic language, their capacity to share misinformation, and their potential to be used for malicious purposes, like sharing spam or propaganda. All these issues will become increasingly important as AI language models become more widely deployed — as chatbots and sales agents, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oblXC6"&gt;However, it’s worth remembering that performance on benchmarks is not the be-all and end-all in evaluating machine learning systems. In a &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.15366.pdf"&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt;, a number of AI researchers (including two from Google) explored the limitations of benchmarks, noting that these datasets will always be limited in scope and unable to match the complexity of the real world. As is often the case with new technology, the only reliable way to test these systems is to see how they perform in reality. With large language models, we will be seeing more of these applications very soon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s new professional profiles let creators unlock audience-growing tools</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nJynu9pdQzLJao09Ky3OdWj8LAQ=/0x0:1302x868/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244554/professional_mode_facebook.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Turning on professional mode lets creators earn money for their Reels. | Photo by Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yD2OPi"&gt;Facebook is &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/professional-mode-for-profiles"&gt;rolling out professional mode for profiles&lt;/a&gt;, letting creators take advantage of additional monetization tools. The new mode also gives creators access to features that help track the growth of their audience, something that was previously only available with Pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Xn5JAY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Professional mode lets creators partake in the Reels Play bonus program&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N1iLCt"&gt;Turning on professional mode allows creators to partake in the &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/programs/bonuses"&gt;Reels Play bonus program&lt;/a&gt;. Reels, Instagram’s short-term video feature, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700289/facebook-reels-instagram-play-bonus-tiktok"&gt;became available on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; in September. The bonus program lets creators earn up to $35,000 / month, all depending on how many views their Reels rack up. However, all creators aren’t eligible for the program — it’s currently invite-only, and creators must comply with Meta’s &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/169845596919485?id=2520940424820218"&gt;Partner Monetization Policies&lt;/a&gt; to qualify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mEiHJs"&gt;Additionally, Facebook says it’s working on more advanced editing features for Reels, such as an easier way to create a Reel comprised of multiple clips, as well as the ability to save your Reel as a draft while you’re in the process of editing it. The platform is also considering extending the length limit of Reels from 30 seconds to one minute on Facebook, as only &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596530/instagram-reels-60-seconds-time-extension"&gt;Instagram supports one-minute Reels&lt;/a&gt; at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YZpuZfu26U7TTZLNMSCGghOPKx4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23072853/facebook_professional_page_dashboard.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Professional mode unlocks a dashboard for audience insights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gUPDXX"&gt;Outside of Reels, professional mode also unlocks audience, post, and profile insights, which lets creators keep track of any activity on their profile. Creators can review the total number of shares, comments, and reactions that their posts have received and can also see how their follower count has changed over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvLMRu"&gt;Similar to Pages, enabling professional mode makes all the content you post public and means that anyone can view your profile and start following you. Meta says that you can still choose to make certain posts visible to friends only, however. Professional mode is only available in the US for now, but Meta says it’ll be coming to more countries “in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15hCwZ"&gt;Just yesterday, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/creators/stars-fest-is-here"&gt;Facebook introduced&lt;/a&gt; the &lt;a href="http://fb.com/stars"&gt;Stars store&lt;/a&gt;, a dedicated website for purchasing Stars — otherwise known as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687603/facebook-creators-stars-subscriptions-supporter-groups"&gt;the virtual currency&lt;/a&gt; that users can buy with real money and use to tip creators. While Stars are available for purchase within the Facebook app, the Stars on Facebook’s new store are offered at a discounted price. The platform may be trying to entice users to purchase Stars on the web-based Stars store, likely to skirt the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21445923/platform-fees-apps-games-business-marketplace-apple-google"&gt;30 percent commission&lt;/a&gt; that Apple takes for purchases made in third-party apps on iOS.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla allows drivers to play video games in moving cars, raising safety concerns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HwCV64p7GydX-hI2pjeCNmL8oRY=/0x140:3341x2367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244439/IMG_0832.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;You could play Sky Force Reloaded while driving — but you shouldn't. | Image: The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WJxKd8"&gt;Tesla updated its software allowing vehicle occupants to play video games on the center touchscreen while in motion, raising questions about safety and driver distraction. Previously, video games were only playable while the vehicle was in park. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WoGkWt"&gt;But according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/12/07/business/tesla-video-game-driving.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an over-the-air software update was pushed out last summer enabling the ability to launch some games regardless of whether the car was stationary or not, raising serious concerns about safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8v2mEs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; confirmed the ability to play video games while the vehicle is in motion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ddgqmY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; confirmed in a Tesla Model 3 that &lt;em&gt;Sky Force Reloaded&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Solitaire&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Battle of Polytopia&lt;/em&gt; are playable on the center touchscreen while the vehicle is in motion. A notification asks the player to confirm they aren’t the driver before launching the game, but the message is hardly a deterrent. A driver could easily tap “I AM A PASSENGER” and play a complex action game like &lt;em&gt;Sky Force&lt;/em&gt; while in motion.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Tesla center screen is displaying the warning prompt on a black background to confirm you are a passenger, allowing you to tap a button to continue the game." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G4E5Ol-Le2meNHOodGTXhStJrVI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071674/IMG_0834.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Double-check if you’re a passenger﻿&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BUYLPd"&gt;Some interactive apps in the car worked in motion even before the update, including the drawing pad and the Karaoke mode in music — which also warns the driver not to participate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RD8nUn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are aware of driver concerns and are discussing the feature with the manufacturer”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nf9TAl"&gt;A Model 3 owner told the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;that he had filed a complaint to the NHTSA upon discovery of the games being playable while driving in his car. That complaint won’t be a first. Tesla currently has &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/vehicle/2021/TESLA/MODEL%2525203/4%252520DR/AWD"&gt;59 complaints&lt;/a&gt; from owners regarding the Model 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jo6OMY"&gt;A spokesperson for NHTSA &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/us-auto-safety-agency-discussing-video-game-feature-with-tesla-2021-12-08/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it was “discussing” the issue of playable video games in moving cars with the company. “Distraction-affected crashes are a concern, particularly in vehicles equipped with an array of convenience technologies such as entertainment screens,” the spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;. “We are aware of driver concerns and are discussing the feature with the manufacturer.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Tesla center screen is displaying a video game running with a jet craft flying over an ocean, while also displaying the status of the Tesla vehicle in drive and running on autopilot" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lyfET7aS2WUCIt62fHZa8k-RSn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071692/IMG_0828.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sky Force running while on Autopilot. Don’t try this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M9mX3H"&gt;Tesla has a reputation for regularly skirting safety rules and ignoring regulator recommendations for improvements. The company offers a version of its Level 2 advanced driver assist system called “Full Self-Driving,” which does not make its vehicles autonomous and requires drivers to stay vigilant while in use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48Wwdc"&gt;The US government has taken a renewed interest in Tesla, recently announcing that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626819/tesla-autopilot-crash-emergency-vehicle-probe-nhtsa"&gt;investigating incidents involving Tesla cars operating Autopilot that have crashed&lt;/a&gt; into parked emergency vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dSSz0"&gt;NHTSA is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724171/nhtsa-tesla-letters-fsd-beta-autopilot-recall-emergency-vehicles"&gt;seeking more information from Tesla&lt;/a&gt; about the growing public beta test of FSD, the recently launched “Safety Score” evaluation process for entering the program, and the nondisclosure agreements Tesla was making participants sign up until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Tesla center display is showing a list of games in stacked squares that can be selected, and a button to play the game is visible on the screen though cannot be activated." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NmJ1ASdjBz8EeB-dT7O0JKk9OoA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23071721/IMG_0831.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Previously released games like Cat Quest block the ability to launch the game while driving, a better way for Tesla to discourage unsafe behaviors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qw6mGj"&gt;Touchscreens in vehicles are quickly becoming the norm as manufacturers continue to remove tactile buttons and knobs from their vehicles. Many vehicles are becoming more dangerous as a result. According to a &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-seniors-autos/vehicle-infotainment-systems-dangerously-distracting-especially-for-seniors-idUSKCN1UK34F"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt;, drivers can get distracted and look away from the road for up to 40 seconds per task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0HpDh0"&gt;Tesla has pioneered the use of over-the-air software updates in the auto industry, using smartphone-style updates to add features like improved driver assistance to silly Easter eggs like “James Bond mode” to its electric vehicles. The company has also rolled out a whole suite of video games it calls Tesla Arcade (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18684297/tesla-arcade-model-3-hands-on-beach-buggy-racing-2-demo-electric-cars"&gt;we tried it out on a Model 3 back in 2019)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3meHK9"&gt;Tesla has started using an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22457430/tesla-in-car-camera-driver-monitoring-system"&gt;interior camera&lt;/a&gt; to monitor drivers for its Full Self-Driving beta program, which allows drivers to use automatic steering, lane-keeping, and adaptive cruise control on local, non-highway streets. But the vast majority of Tesla vehicles do not use any cameras to track driver eye movements to ensure they are keeping their attention on the road.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Masahiro Sakurai on the future of Smash: ‘I’ve been doing too much of the work myself’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iG8jRTHYwWLgzAJGWcPHz1hllNU=/0x118:1339x1011/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70244366/Sakurai_pic.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VZsja8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; is finally complete. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18128015/super-smash-bros-ultimate-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;launching in 2018&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17453214/super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch-masahiro-sakurai-e3"&gt;a roster that included every single character from the series’ long history&lt;/a&gt;, it has since been steadily updated with new fighters, culminating in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22690440/sora-kingdom-hearts-final-smash-ultimate-character-nintendo-switch"&gt;the addition of Sora from &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in October&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The game’s last major update &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoVS/status/1466218355262697472"&gt;came on December 1st&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIDzTg"&gt;Three years and countless charming video presentations later, series creator Masahiro Sakurai — &lt;a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/sakurai-on-smash-bros-ultimate-his-health-choosing-bosses-and-spirits-new-stages-much-more/"&gt;an infamous workaholic&lt;/a&gt; — seems to finally be taking it easy. “I have more free time now than I’ve probably ever had since I started working in game development,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; over email. That career has been tightly intertwined with &lt;em&gt;Smash, &lt;/em&gt;a series he has not only led but also been a key developer on for more than two decades.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“I have no regrets because &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; is like none other,” he says of his time working on the series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fni5Sw"&gt;With development on &lt;em&gt;Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; wrapping up, there’s been much discussion on the future of the franchise — and particularly whether Sakurai would still be involved. I had the chance to ask the director a few questions over email, and we talked about working on new fighters, taking time off, and where &lt;em&gt;Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; goes from here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f5n7Dg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qxlw7L"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the game was first announced at E3 2018, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17453214/super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch-masahiro-sakurai-e3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;you told me how daunting the prospect of creating such a large roster was&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. How did the post-launch development, and adding all of these new fighters, compare to that initial development process?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62dN6i"&gt;You may have already noticed, but DLC fighters tend to be more uniquely made compared to standard fighters on the roster. Some sort of new in-game system is implemented, their Final Smash is accompanied by a visual sequence, they have a relatively elaborate stage setup and guests, and their battle tactics and in-game systems clearly set them apart from other existing fighters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xl8sKW"&gt;Fans are paying extra for these additional characters, so we tell ourselves that we need to strive and do our best to deliver content that is more than worthy. Given that, adding one piece of DLC fighter and their accompanying stages, music, and other content proved to be a greater challenge than adding one piece of content in the base game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cov4Lp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now that it’s finished, how does the final product compare to what you originally envisioned for the game? Are there elements you are particularly proud of?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxpwj1"&gt;We envision the finished product and aim for that as we work on the game, so where we landed is certainly not too far from that initial vision. Even so, I feel that there are still some shortcomings, which I took as lessons learned. I have a feeling the notion of “being proud of” differs between Japanese and English, but I do not wish to boast about what we have accomplished with this project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="29iso0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I knew that as long as we continued to work diligently, it would come to an end one day. “&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3bUAXU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After working on it for so long, was it hard to finally step away from the game? What was it like when you realized work was complete?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8oGLGd"&gt;I knew that as long as we continued to work diligently, it would come to an end one day. This was a large-scale project that spanned many years, but even for a project like this, we still apply the same amount of effort to each step as with any other project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0s1Ehf"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Have you managed to take any time off since Sora launched? What does a break for you look like (&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1459390846709551112"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;aside from riding horses&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rx26dx"&gt;Usually, I like to go on drives. I have more free time now than I’ve probably ever had since I started working in game development, so I occasionally go on short trips, overnight or just a day trip. My itinerary gets fairly packed since I like to make stops here and there. Also, it is fortunate that the COVID-19 situation in Japan has improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rKXxC9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you ever have regrets about not being able to work on projects outside of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; over the last few years?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ydSwd"&gt;I do sometimes look back and think about the fact that there may have been other opportunities had I not been working on &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; However, I have no regrets because &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; is like none other, and this was an opportunity that I could not have gained with any other project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="32Moks"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What would convince you to come back to make another &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Smash&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;? Do you think, if you did return, your role would be different or reduced?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4XXd7m"&gt;I think we’ve reached the limit, at least in terms of volume of content and fighters. Basically, if I were to have the opportunity to work on another &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; game, that means we would have to shrink the roster, but we need to think about whether fans would be pleased about that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EVOTnx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The current ‘Super Smash Bros.’ has too much of my personality poured into it.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bo6vO1"&gt;Also, I’ve been doing too much of the work myself, so I’d need to resolve that, too. The current &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; has too much of my personality poured into it. In order for a long-time series to continue thriving today, we need to think about eliminating the series’ dependence on just one person’s vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WxXQHy"&gt;Of course, this is the way it is now because we weren’t successful in splitting the vision between multiple people before. This would be a challenge for the future and something that needs to be discussed with Nintendo, if there were to be a next installment in the &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros.&lt;/em&gt; series.&lt;/p&gt;
