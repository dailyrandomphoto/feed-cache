    <title>All the smart home gadgets worth knowing about from CES 2022 </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The devices that will be vying for a spot in your home this year&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="a0FujX"&gt;The smart home kicked into high gear at CES 2022 this week, with new products for every corner of the home making their way onto the show floor (virtually in most cases). We’ve covered the most promising products in separate articles, but we’ve collated those here, and added in a few other noteworthy launches and announcements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uIDoox"&gt;The dominant theme was interoperability. Yes, 2022 could be the year the smart home finally grows up, moving from a collection of shiny gadgets that provide mostly single-point solutions towards the whole home interoperability that has long been its promise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xtHH9S"&gt;Case in point, we barely saw any &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22858402/home-robot-labrador-caddie-retriever-smart-self-driving-shelf"&gt;robots&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22858262/moen-smart-faucet-motion-control-smart-water-network-ces2022"&gt;Moen&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22858256/masonite-smart-door-ring-yales-ces-2022"&gt;Masonite&lt;/a&gt; debuted solutions that marry disparate products and services to create a smarter home rather than just a connected one. As Mitchell Klein of the Z-Wave Alliance said during the show, “Right now, we have a connected home. In five years, we will have truly smart homes due to the introduction of contextual awareness.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YAHUJd"&gt;A key part of that burgeoning awareness is Matter, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;new smart home standard&lt;/a&gt; that wants to make all connected devices in the smart home talk to each other, regardless of who made them. Matter was undoubtedly the wind beneath the wings of many companies’ announcements this week, and we’ll have a deeper dive on what’s new there and why it &lt;em&gt;matters &lt;/em&gt;(sorry!) later this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gRX07N"&gt;But for now, let’s get to the good part: all the new smart home gadgets and gizmos worth knowing about from CES 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OrjEmR-uq_JYE-aK9I_Ir2o4RrY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23149507/Wemo_Doorbell_environmental_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Belkin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The video doorbell is still the hottest security camera, with at least three announced this week — including this Belkin WeMo option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="PTQKQJ"&gt;Lights, camera ... and more cameras&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="34fPNx"&gt;Smart light bulbs and connected security cameras have long been the darlings of the smart home. That shows no sign of slowing down, with a slew of new products in both categories being announced this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lefQLIhHlbNM2XIqhSygIg_qtAA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23149541/Eve_Outdoor_Cam_Solutionshot_wo_Badges.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eve Outdoor Cam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3UJ4P5"&gt;Eve’s latest security camera &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22858260/eve-ces2022-homekit-floodlight-camera-matter-smart-shades"&gt;the $250 Eve Outdoor Cam&lt;/a&gt; launches April 5th, 2022. A floodlight camera designed for Apple HomeKit Secure Video, it features 1080p video, a 157-degree field of view, infrared night vision, and infrared motion detection covering 100 degrees at distances of up to 30 feet. Read more about it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22858260/eve-ces2022-homekit-floodlight-camera-matter-smart-shades"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiL98f"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22860472/cync-gelighting-smart-bulbs-thermostat-camera-ces2022"&gt;Cync by Savant, GE Lighting’s new face&lt;/a&gt;, launched a plethora of new smart bulbs, plus a new thermostat with room sensors, and a new outdoor camera. The lighting line starts at just $12 and arrives in March. Cync’s outdoor camera arrives in February starting at $100, and the thermostat ($120) with room sensors ($30 each) is available in January. It seems the lighting company, now owned by high-end custom smart home company Savant, is angling to be a bigger player in the space. Get the details &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22860472/cync-gelighting-smart-bulbs-thermostat-camera-ces2022"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGr9Nx"&gt;TP-Link has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865369/tp-link-tapo-smart-home-products-homekit"&gt;new line of smart home products under its Tapo brand&lt;/a&gt;. These include HomeKit-enabled smart lights, plugs, and a smart switch. The products arrive this year, starting with the Mini Plug. The company also announced four new Tapo cloud-connected security cameras — some of which can record to a microSD card. See the full lineup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865369/tp-link-tapo-smart-home-products-homekit"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Abode&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The $80 Abode doorbell has impressive specs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lmfcIl"&gt;Smart home security company Abode announced a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoabode.com%2Fproduct%2Fwireless-video-doorbell&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22870187%2Fsmart-home-gadget-ces-2022-roundup-samsung-wemo-eve" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new wireless video doorbell&lt;/a&gt; and its first foray into smart home lighting with the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgoabode.com%2Fproduct%2Fabode-color-bulb&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22870187%2Fsmart-home-gadget-ces-2022-roundup-samsung-wemo-eve" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Abode Color Bulbs&lt;/a&gt;. Neither of these require a connection to an Abode smart home security hub, but they are compatible with it. The $80 Abode Wireless Video Doorbell is battery-powered and features 2K HD video with a 160-degree field of view. It has full-color night vision and works over 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi or can be ethernet-connected. Battery life is six months, and the camera includes person detection. Recorded video requires an Abode subscription plan starting at $6 a month, which also opens up automations with Abode’s Cue automation engine. It comes with an Abode Chime, which is a Wi-Fi extender and doorbell chime in one, and launches in April. The Abode bulbs are full-color, Wi-Fi smart bulbs emitting 800 lumens with a 90 plus CRI and cost $30 for a two-pack. They’re available now from Abode.com. Abode’s products work with Alexa, Google, and IFTTT, and the doorbell can stream live video to a compatible smart display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eRhDA20-jzIUPwTJbFOCLE7SdfI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23149569/eufy_Video_Doorbell_Dual___product_image.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eufy&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Eufy Dual. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="219aB4"&gt;Eufy showed off a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865803/eufy-video-doorbell-dual-garage-control-cam-specs-release-date-price"&gt;new dual-camera video doorbell&lt;/a&gt;, an intriguing solution for your porch pirate problems. The $260 buzzer arriving next month comes with a hub for local storage, and its downward-facing 1080p camera has a 120-degree field of view, while the main 2K camera can see as wide as 160 degrees. Another new Eufy product is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865803/eufy-video-doorbell-dual-garage-control-cam-specs-release-date-price"&gt;Eufy Garage-Control Cam&lt;/a&gt; that can keep an eye on your garage in 1080p or 2K video and also control the door. Pricing starts at $99, and two versions will launch in March of this year. More details are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865803/eufy-video-doorbell-dual-garage-control-cam-specs-release-date-price"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcAFPy"&gt;Belkin WeMo launched its first smart doorbell camera. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865546/wemo-homekit-video-doorbell-price-specs"&gt;$250 Wemo Smart Video Doorbell&lt;/a&gt; is a wired doorbell with a 178-degree vertical field of view and 4MP high-resolution camera designed exclusively for Apple’s HomeKit and is available now. Go &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865546/wemo-homekit-video-doorbell-price-specs"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sengled Health Monitoring bulb.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2dLY3D"&gt;Sengled announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22864783/sengled-smart-health-monitoring-smart-bulb-ces2022"&gt;a slew of new smart lighting products&lt;/a&gt;, including an intriguing Smart Health Monitoring bulb that can track your sleep, heart rate, and other biometric measurements using radar. It also has new Wi-Fi Video-Sync TV light strips ($120), Wi-Fi Outdoor String Lights ($80 to $90), a Wi-Fi- and Bluetooth-connected portable LED Lamp ($60 to $70), Wi-Fi LED Essential Oil Diffuser Light, a Zigbee window and door sensor, and a motion sensor for controlling all those smart lights. Lots more details are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22864783/sengled-smart-health-monitoring-smart-bulb-ces2022"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T6asQAXo1zOaXOoAK5jhnOHuhuY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23149572/Arlo_CES_Keypad_Sensor_03_2__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Arlo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arlo’s new security system uses all-in-one sensors to monitor your home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="rMexIs"&gt;Smart home security steps it up &lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="LypQgU"&gt;Another huge space for the smart home in 2021 that is getting even more crowded in 2022 is home security. And we’ve got some new, innovative security systems and safety gadgets to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IWQ5Cv"&gt;Arlo’s newest product isn’t a camera. The smart home camera company revealed its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22865040/arlo-smart-home-security-system-price-availability-ces2022"&gt;Arlo Security System&lt;/a&gt;, a DIY smart home security system featuring all-in-one multi-sensors with eight different functions, plus NFC integrated into the hub so users can tap their phone to disarm the system. Arlo says the system will be available to buy in the first half of 2022. More details &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22865040/arlo-smart-home-security-system-price-availability-ces2022"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z1W2A7byMszdSOj_KmKK6x7sRJw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23149518/website_dreieck_mitbild_16_9_res_400x225.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bosch&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smart security gets cute with this teeny, portable solution from Bosch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z2WwKP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.spexor-bosch.com/en/"&gt;Bosch’s Spexor&lt;/a&gt; is a mobile security “assistant” that can monitor for break-ins as well as measure air quality and temperature. A tiny, 4.7-inch high device, the Spexor uses air pressure, noise, and motion sensors to detect an intrusion and alert you to changes in air quality. It can run on battery power for up to three weeks and can work with an eSIM card as well as over Wi-Fi. This could be a handy device for camping or RVs, or for monitoring a hotel room or other place you’re staying temporarily. We also like that it doubles as an air quality monitor, giving it usefulness beyond just when something nefarious is going on. It’s currently available in Germany for €250, but there’s no information on when it might come to other markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/luK1cvUJ2Ahkv4HRg9ApythI6lg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23149462/20211103_lifestyle_glassbreaksensor_table_sidedoor_rgb_done_715x883.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Glass Break Sensor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hLCz4W"&gt;Ring has finally caved and introduced a glass break sensor to its Ring Alarm smart home security system. While Ring Alarm owners have been able to call on the power of Alexa using an Echo speaker for this key security feature (Alexa Guard, when enabled, can listen for the sound of glass breaking), a dedicated device for this purpose is something Ring Alarm users have been clamoring for. A glass break sensor can help detect when someone breaks a window to get into your home, and the &lt;a href="https://ring.com/products/glass-break-sensor"&gt;Ring Alarm Glass Break Sensor&lt;/a&gt; detects the sound of glass breaking up to 25 feet away. It costs $40, is available for preorder now, and starts shipping February 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXrzDW"&gt;There is now another smart smoke alarm option, although it’s not all we hoped it would be. &lt;a href="https://www.kidde.com/home-safety/en/us/products/kidde-smoke-carbon-monoxide-alarm-with-smart-features"&gt;Kidde’s new Smoke + CO Alarm with smart features&lt;/a&gt; costs $90 and is available now at Home Depot and &lt;a href="https://www.kidde.com/home-safety/en/us/products/kidde-smoke-carbon-monoxide-alarm-with-smart-features"&gt;Kidde.com/smart&lt;/a&gt;. It features Wi-Fi connectivity to alert you via the Kidde app to any alarms in your home. You can also use the app to hush nuisance alarms and connect them to Amazon Alexa and Google voice assistants from the app. But there appear to be no other smart home integrations beyond using voice to check on alarm status and connection. And the promised HomeKit integration with Kidde’s RemoteLync system &lt;a href="https://www.thedigitalmediazone.com/2018/01/12/kidde-shows-homekit-compatible-remotelync-bridge/"&gt;that was teased at CES 2018&lt;/a&gt; seems to have fallen by the wayside. The new alarms, which are hardwired with a backup battery, can make existing Kidde alarms smart when you add one to an existing interconnected system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W7InZRb5gHyiTD4-4v13yjDLdSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23149523/EVE_MOTIONBLINDS_Richmond_0100.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Can Thread solve the smart blind connectivity problem? Eve thinks so.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="f7Ikr5"&gt;Can you follow this Thread?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="tY2AnN"&gt;Thread, a key protocol in the upcoming smart home standard Matter, got a lot of airtime this week as companies announced new products that use this low-powered, IP-based smart home mesh networking protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BB2EmD"&gt;Eve’s first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22858260/eve-ces2022-homekit-floodlight-camera-matter-smart-shades"&gt;Thread-enabled smart blinds&lt;/a&gt; went on sale this week for the first time. Announced earlier this year, the MotionBlinds start at just under $400 per shade and can be ordered through any Coulisse reseller, including &lt;a href="https://www.selectblinds.com/eve-motionblinds"&gt;selectblinds.com&lt;/a&gt;. The MotionBlinds will be available first as smart roller shades and are compatible with HomeKit and Siri, Apple’s voice assistant, at launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3F4pI7"&gt;Smart lock makers Schlage have announced the first lock with a Thread radio. Its Schlage Encode Plus Smart WiFi Deadbolt is also the first Apple Home Key lock, and its Thread radio specifically supports HomeKit over Thread. Check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22860197/apple-home-key-schlage-encode-plus-smart-door-lock-thread-ces2022"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7y0WNC"&gt;Wemo revealed its working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865546/wemo-homekit-video-doorbell-price-specs"&gt;Thread versions of the Wemo Smart Plug&lt;/a&gt;, Wemo Smart Light Switch, and Wemo Smart Dimmer to be released later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C9YFT8FdfT_H5j9Two5b4bQPdM8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22968038/jtuohy_211027_4855_0003.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nanoleaf Lines can now be a Thread border router for your HomeKit home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YPuwbW"&gt;Nanoleaf, the makers of seriously fun smart lighting products, announced its Nanoleaf Shapes, Elements, and Lines products will become Thread border routers for all Thread over HomeKit devices. Border routers act as a bridge between Wi-Fi and Thread products. But unlike the traditional white plastic boxes we’re accustomed to, border routers can be cool, useful products like these light panels. The update will come in the first quarter of 2022. Previously, these Nanoleaf light panels were able to act as border routers for Nanoleaf’s own Thread devices, but now that functionality extends to any HomeKit-enabled Thread-based products, such as the Eve Room or Eve Energy smart plug. While you will still need a HomePod Mini or other Apple Home hub for HomeKit control, now you can create a Thread network independently of those hubs, should you wish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hp7541"&gt;Aqara will release a new version of its motion sensor and door and window sensor with Thread technology built-in in the second half of 2022. Aqara’s products work with HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, and Google Home through its Zigbee-based hubs. The company also confirmed it will bring Matter support to its existing Zigbee-based products by pushing an over-the-air update to its M2 and the M1S hubs. This will allow all compatible connected sensors to connect to other Matter-compatible third-party devices when the standard launches later this year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="PPeFvL"&gt;Robot vacuums that can also mop have largely been disappointing. They basically drag a wet rag around your floor, which you then have to clean, dry, and reattach, and then refill the tiny tank. But Roborock and Ecovacs announced two new competing products at CES this week that want to change that. These fully automated cleaning and mopping and vacuuming bots are inching us closer to that Rosie the Robot dream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tEPEug"&gt;The new Roborock S7 MaxV Ultra features sonic mopping (i.e., scrubbing rather than just dragging) plus an automatic mop-lift that raises the pad when going over carpet while still vacuuming. Its compatible Empty Wash Fill dock can also wash the mopping cloth and refill the tank with water, as well as emptying the vacuum and cleaning the dock — taking away almost all the manual maintenance required to keep a mopping robot operating. The S7 MaxV Ultra costs $1,400 and is coming in the second quarter of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ecovacs’ Deebot X1 OMNI can also self-empty and self-clean.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hpSEHW"&gt;Ecovacs has also designed a docking station for its new Deebot X1 OMNI bot vac that can clean the mopping pad and refill the water tank whilst also emptying the bin. The Deebot features carpet avoidance, so it will go around any rugs and miss the carpet. But unlike the Roborock, you’ll have to manually remove the mop to vacuum the rug. But the XI OMNI does have its own onboard voice assistant, so you can tell it what to do without having to use a third-party smart speaker. Called YIKO, it’s a natural language processing technology that takes direct speech commands, so you can tell it to start, stop, and where to clean without getting out a phone or talking to a smart speaker. The Deebot X1 OMNI will be available in March for $1,549 at ecovacs.com and Amazon and at Best Buy in April.&lt;/p&gt;

A collaboration between the door manufacturer, Ring, and Yale, the M-Pwr Smart Door is the first residential exterior door to integrate power, lights, sensors, a video doorbell, and a smart lock into the door system. It’s only available in new home construction initially, and no pricing or release date is available for retrofit applications.

&lt;p id="RpaH9T"&gt;Schlage announced the first Home Key compatible smart lock for North America. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22860197/apple-home-key-schlage-encode-plus-smart-door-lock-thread-ces2022"&gt;The Schlage Encode Plus&lt;/a&gt; Smart WiFi Deadbolt is an updated version of the popular Schlage Encode WiFi smart lock, adding an NFC chip for the Home Key function, as well as a Thread radio to support HomeKit over Thread. It will be available in spring 2022 for $300, and we have more details &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22860197/apple-home-key-schlage-encode-plus-smart-door-lock-thread-ces2022"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oVL7Lo"&gt;Kwikset released its newest Z-Wave lock that is the first to feature the Z-Wave 700 series chip. The Home Connect 620 uses a traditional key and a keypad and can connect to a smart home using Z-Wave. The new 700 series chip adds Z-Wave SmartStart (QR code scanning) and increased wireless security features. It also helps the device to use less power (more than 50 percent less). But the most exciting part about Z-Wave 7000 is the expanded range, 250 percent greater than the Z-Wave Plus 500-Series, according to the company — making this entry-level lock a good option for a garage or shed door. The Home Connect 620 will cost $149 and comes in a traditional and contemporary style.&lt;/p&gt;

PerfectFill consists of a drain kit and digital valve that work together to draw the bath to your preferred temperature and depth. Pricing starts at $2,700. Kohler also debuted a kitchen faucet that’s suspended from the ceiling and controlled by a waterproof, battery-operated Bluetooth puck. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BiBzW2"&gt;Moen’s latest smart faucet — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22858262/moen-smart-faucet-motion-control-smart-water-network-ces2022"&gt;the Moen Smart Faucet with Motion Control&lt;/a&gt; — adds completely handle-free operation to its connected tap. Now, alongside voice control with Alexa or Google and waving to turn it on and off, you can use gestures to control temperature as well. The company also announced integrations between its smart faucet and other smart water products and its new Smart Water Network, a residential smart water ecosystem centered around Moen’s Flo Smart Water Monitor and Shutoff.

It joins Samsung’s Bespoke line —  a selection of modular, configurable appliances with a clean, modern look and customizable colors and finishes. The fridge with a tablet built in also has an updated, bezel-less design for its signature 21.5-inch touchscreen, support for Samsung TV Plus, and upgraded internal camera technology that can scan food labels.

&lt;h1 id="FM4Pmo"&gt;Yes, smart home hubs are still a thing  &lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LzwgSj"&gt;For those who don’t want to default to Amazon, Apple, Samsung or Google to run their smart homes, there’s now another open source option for managing your smart home. The &lt;a href="https://homey.app/en-us/"&gt;Homey Bridge Smart Home Hub&lt;/a&gt; finally arrives in the US this month. Already available in Europe, the Homey Bridge is a smart home hub embedded with Zigbee, Z-Wave Plus, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, 433MHz, and Infrared. It’s controlled by the Homey App for creating automations with devices connected to the bridge, and the app can also be used independently of the bridge. Shipping now, Homey Bridge costs for $69. The app-only solution for Homey has a free version that controls up to five devices and a paid tier for $2.99 a month for unlimited devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxdyOq"&gt;Samsung announced a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865808/samsung-smartthings-smart-home-hub-dashboard-ces2022"&gt;Home Hub controller for its SmartThings platform&lt;/a&gt;. The tablet-like device is designed to be a central place for a household to control and monitor their SmartThings smart home without having to buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/28/22856937/samsung-family-hub-smart-fridge-bespoke-ces-2022"&gt;$4,000 smart fridge&lt;/a&gt;. A portable, 8.4-inch touchscreen tablet with Samsung’s Bixby voice assistant built in, the Home Hub also has AI functions, two microphones and two speakers for hearing notifications and giving voice commands. Its global launch is slated for later this year. More details are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22865808/samsung-smartthings-smart-home-hub-dashboard-ces2022"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Made entirely of wood, the Mui hub works with Amazon’s Alexa and offers both touch and voice control options. Its minimalist look makes it a good option for those who don’t want anything too techy looking in their home but still want the convenience of connected devices. It’s not available to buy yet.

    <title>Googling climate change? You might see fossil fuel ads </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration a Google Ads logo of an online..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8z23rRYCAzaFPB8WsZlwqkxR7p0=/0x10:3858x2582/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70354947/1235804777.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&amp;nbsp;In this photo illustration a Google Ads logo of an online advertising platform developed by Google is seen on a smartphone and a pc screen. | Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Aml6w"&gt;Fossil fuel companies and their close allies are some of the top spenders on Google ads that look similar to search results, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/05/fossil-fuel-firms-among-biggest-spenders-on-google-ads-that-look-like-search-results"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; and climate think tank InfluenceMap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJziPc"&gt;The two groups searched for 78 terms related to climate change on Google and then looked at the ads that popped up on the platform. Of more than 1,600 ads, over one in five were from companies “with significant interests in fossil fuels.” The top twenty advertisers included fossil fuel giants ExxonMobil, Shell, and Aramco. Consulting firm &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/27/business/mckinsey-climate-change.html"&gt;McKinsey&lt;/a&gt; and investment firm &lt;a href="https://capitalmonitor.ai/institution/banks/explaining-goldman-sachs-sustainability-drive/#:~:text=Goldman%20Sachs%20facilitated%20%2418.94bn,it%20calls%20a%20decarbonisation%20service."&gt;Goldman Sachs&lt;/a&gt;, which have been criticized for working with fossil fuel companies, were also big spenders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yi55Ie"&gt;“Google is letting groups with a vested interest in the continued use of fossil fuels pay to influence the resources people receive when they are trying to educate themselves,” InfluenceMap senior data analyst Jake Carbone told &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/05/fossil-fuel-firms-among-biggest-spenders-on-google-ads-that-look-like-search-results"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1LN51A"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Google is letting groups with a vested interest in the continued use of fossil fuels pay to influence the resources people receive when they are trying to educate themselves”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1NWH11"&gt;The ads they analyzed mimic the look of typical search results and often appear at the top of the page. One &lt;a href="https://varn.co.uk/01/31/58-1-of-people-dont-which-links-on-google-are-ads-is-google-making-ads-less-clear/"&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; conducted in 2020 found that 58 percent of people don’t know the difference between those ads and regular links. As a result, Google searches might funnel unsuspecting users to content from groups with a vested interest in promoting the fossil fuels responsible for the climate crisis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kGv3fz"&gt;Many of the ads portray fossil fuel companies as going green, like an ad from Shell that says it’s “a willing and able player in the energy transition.” Another ad from BP says it is “Building and advocating for more renewable capacity &amp;amp; infrastructure.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A screenshot taken of Google Search results for “net zero” on Thursday, January 6." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f3VqAbg0mjjyysFWT5K0nph3nRk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23149634/Screen_Shot_2022_01_06_at_9.55.06_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot taken of Google search results for “net zero” on Thursday, January 6th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UPdBP5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; and InfluenceMap study found 153 ads from Shell that showed up on 86 percent of searches for the term “net zero.” &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; searched for “net zero” on Google this morning and found an ad at the top of the page from oil and gas company BP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rU4Qiz"&gt;“Net zero” has become a popular goal for countries and companies to reach to essentially reduce and cancel out the greenhouse gas emissions they produce by burning fossil fuels. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134843/bp-greenhouse-gas-emissions-net-zero-climate-change"&gt;BP&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-shell-says-new-brazil-sized-forest-would-be-needed-to-meet-1-5c-climate-goal"&gt;Shell&lt;/a&gt; have set goals to reach net zero by 2050, claims that experts have called &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/nov/04/dark-secrets-big-oil-climate-pledges-greenwashing"&gt;greenwashing&lt;/a&gt; because both companies still plan to continue producing fossil fuels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imPfFh"&gt;The entire world needs to reach net zero emissions by 2050 to avoid catastrophic climate change, according to a vast &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;body of research&lt;/a&gt;. To hit that goal, there should be no new oil, gas, or coal development, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050"&gt;roadmap&lt;/a&gt; developed by the International Energy Agency last year. Selling themselves as part of the solution for climate change is one way fossil fuel companies are trying to stay in business despite consensus among scientists that coal, oil, and gas need to be phased out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B8H5eR"&gt;This isn’t the first time Google has come under fire for helping to amplify fossil fuel interests. It came to light last month that Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22838243/google-ads-climate-change-denial"&gt;continued to run ads on content promoting climate denial&lt;/a&gt;, even after it made a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11221321"&gt;pledge&lt;/a&gt; to ban the practice. In response to those findings by the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate, Google said it took down the ads from most of the URLs for violating its policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jVfpk6"&gt;In response to an email from&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Google reiterated its policy banning ads that feature climate denial, and pointed to its efforts to feature ‘information panels’ about climate change on its Search platform. It also insisted that it adequately labels its ads. It did not indicate that it was planning on taking any action based on the new investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gyktLr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>It’s 2022, and the Surface Duo still doesn’t have Android 11</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mX5DZJ"&gt;We are officially in 2022. Know what that means? That’s right: It means Microsoft has failed at its stated goal of bringing Android 11 to the Surface Duo by the end of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="je2iK7"&gt;Attentive readers may recall that Microsoft said the following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690003/microsoft-surface-duo-android-11-update-release-date"&gt;this past September&lt;/a&gt;: “We remain committed to providing updates to Surface Duo, and we’re working to bring Android 11 to existing customers before the end of this year.” Okay, so the company wasn’t exactly &lt;em&gt;promising&lt;/em&gt; Android 11 by the end of 2021 — but that was the heavily implied intention, and it likely gave some Surface Duo users a lot of hope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="leiZWq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re working to bring Android 11 to existing customers before the end of this year.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2pB5Ox"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-fails-deliver-android-11-surface-duo-end-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; first reported, Duo devices still haven’t received Android 11. While this may be disappointing to the owners of those devices, it’s also not without precedent. Update hiccups are par for the course with Android — all kinds of manufacturers consistently fail to get them out in a timely manner. “The story on upgrades is the same today as it was a decade ago: first-party Google devices get updated quickly, everything else takes months or doesn’t get updated at all,” summarized &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;executive editor Dieter Bohn in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/4/20847758/google-android-update-problem-pie-q-treble-mainline"&gt;a 2019 newsletter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xE9SI4"&gt;Microsoft also needs to make Android work with additional controls and functionality in order to accommodate the Duo’s two screens — Android, as an operating system, is “woefully unprepared for devices like the Surface Duo,” Bohn noted in his&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428763/microsoft-surface-duo-review"&gt; review of the device&lt;/a&gt;. One might expect such a product to take a bit to roll out. Still, Duo users haven’t received major software improvements since the device launched 15 months ago — and that’s a long wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e6cMdQ"&gt;According to Kimmo Lehtosalo, Microsoft’s senior director of program management, Surface Duo users can expect an update in the next few weeks. “We’re finalizing the validation and certification for Android 11. We originally planned to deploy Android 11 as an update for Surface Duo in December, but we needed a few more weeks to ensure a great experience for Surface Duo customers. We expect to begin Android 11 rollout in the next few weeks, beginning with unlocked devices,” Lehtosalo told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pz5QNV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, Thursday, January 6th, 11:31 AM: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Added a statement from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1oL5U0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ozvqiJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap suing to trademark the word ‘spectacles’ for its smart glasses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mUuu8xMa02PIFYHQU2uNuwJasG0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70354746/alopez_211129_4909_0011.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snap wants to trademark the word Spectacles for its smart glasses | Photo by Amanda Lopez for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2QbSQz"&gt;Snap is suing the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) for rejecting its application to trademark the word “spectacles” for its digital eyewear camera device. But the USPTO has maintained that “spectacles” is a generic term for smart glasses and that Snap’s version “has not acquired distinctiveness,” as required for a trademark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtNn90"&gt;In its complaint filed Wednesday in US District Court in California, Snap claims that the Spectacles name “evokes an incongruity between an 18th century term for corrective eyewear and Snap’s high-tech 21st century smart glasses. SPECTACLES also is suggestive of the camera’s purpose, to capture and share unusual, notable, or entertaining scenes (i.e., “spectacles”) and while also encouraging users to make ‘spectacles’ of themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmO13j"&gt;Snap first introduced its camera-equipped Spectacles in 2016 (“a wearable digital video camera housed in a pair of fashionable sunglasses,” according to its complaint), which can take photos and videos while the user wears them and connects with the Snap smartphone app. Despite selling them both online and in pop-up vending machines around the world, the first iteration of Spectacles mostly flopped with consumers. In its 2017 third-quarter earnings report, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/7/16620718/snapchat-spectacles-40-million-lost-failure-unsold-inventory"&gt;Snap said it had lost nearly $40 million&lt;/a&gt; on some 300,000 unsold Spectacles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hs9xk7"&gt;In May 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445481/snap-spectacles-ar-augmented-reality-announced"&gt;Snap  CEO Evan Spiegel showed off an augmented reality ver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22819963/snap-ar-spectacles-glasses-hands-on-pictures-design-features"&gt;sion of the Spectacles&lt;/a&gt;, which so far are available only to a small group of creators and reviewers chosen by the company. The &lt;a href="https://www.spectacles.com/new-spectacles"&gt;AR Spectacles aren’t yet available for purchase&lt;/a&gt; by the general public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0oaqz0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Snap’s first AR Spectacles are an ambitious, impractical start","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22819963/snap-ar-spectacles-glasses-hands-on-pictures-design-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="R6k2Zw"&gt;Snap’s new complaint posits that there’s been enough media coverage of Spectacles, bolstered by some industry awards and its own marketing including social media, to support its claim that consumers associate the word “spectacles” with the Snap brand. Snap first filed a trademark application for Spectacles in September 2016, “for use in connection with wearable computer hardware” and other related uses “among consumer electronics devices and displays.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBflqi"&gt;During several rounds of back-and-forth with the company since then, the USPTO has maintained that the word “spectacles” appeared to be “generic in connection with the identified goods,” i.e. the camera glasses. Snap continued to appeal the agency’s decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqRQQX"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23149580/ttabvue_87177292_EXA_13.pdf"&gt;November 2021 opinion, the USPTO’s Trademark Trial and Appeal Board&lt;/a&gt; (pdf) upheld the decision, reiterating that the word “spectacles” was a generic term that applied to all smart glasses, not just Snap’s version. Despite the publicity Snap claimed its Spectacles had received from its marketing and social media, the board noted in its opinion that Spectacles’ “social media accounts have an underwhelming number of followers, and the number of followers is surprisingly small,” which didn’t support the company’s argument that there had been a high enough level of consumer exposure to Snap’s Spectacles to claim that consumers associated the word with Snap’s brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppeMNe"&gt;In its Tuesday complaint, Snap’s attorneys argued that “spectacles is an old-fashioned term popular in the 18th century,” and that it “is not often used today in the United States,” especially by Snapchat’s young audience. “This indicates that modern-day usage of “spectacles” in the United States—especially among a younger demographic of consumers who are the relevant consumers of Snap’s SPECTACLES camera product—is not commonly understood to mean eyeglasses, and certainly not a wireless-enabled video camera product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFpc2M"&gt;But the USPTO appeal board said in November that the evidence didn’t support that argument, and that the word “spectacles” still retains its generic meaning and therefore can’t be trademarked. The board noted that in its own marketing, Snap had demonstrated that its Spectacles “eyeglasses form is a feature, function and characteristic of the camera, not only functionally but aesthetically.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="leTx0D"&gt;Snap’s lawsuit, which names acting USPTO director Drew Hirshfeld, seeks to have the appeal board’s November decision reversed. The company declined to provide a comment on the record to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>HP adds two new Dragonfly models to its business lineup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The HP Eite Dragonfly G3 seen from above on a marble table. The screen displays a multicolor background. To the left is an open notebook with a pen on top. To the right are two cups and a phone." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IGYB3dytoY7uTKoqrx0igeOGKBU=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346712/3.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A pretty fly.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: HP&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A76KBe"&gt;HP will release business laptops of all shapes and sizes this year, but the ones the C-suite will likely have their eyes on are members of the Elite Dragonfly line. If &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675550/hp-elite-dragonfly-max-2021-review-tile-test-specs-price-features"&gt;its predecessors&lt;/a&gt; are anything to go by, the Elite Dragonfly G3 will be a light, powerful, beautiful, and undoubtedly expensive Windows PC. The HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook, more intriguingly, will bring a Chrome OS platform to the line for the first time. That could be the premium, well-built device for which Chrome OS fans in the business sphere have been waiting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFZiFt"&gt;The HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook features a haptic trackpad (the first one we’ve seen on a Chromebook to date), a fingerprint sensor, and a Sure View Reflect privacy screen. For a better conference call experience, the device includes “AI-enhanced video and audio.” These features are all staples of the Dragonfly line but rarities in the Chromebook space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oqVYG"&gt;You can configure the Dragonfly Chromebook with up to 512GB of storage and 32GB of RAM. It includes 12th Gen Intel processors and will be the first Chromebook to support Intel’s vPro platform. The battery is 51Whr, and HP claims it can charge up to 90 percent in 90 minutes, which would be fast for a Chromebook. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A worker uses the HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook in a cafe setting." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KReHQP0c34v83OiirzcgdKLwtao=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144523/2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is the Dragonfly Chromebook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AQsSxi"&gt;The Dragonfly G3 doesn’t look too different from the Dragonfly Gen 2. The most exciting change is that it’s finally abandoned the 16:9 aspect ratio in favor of a 3:2 display. (The Chromebook mentioned above is also 3:2.) More vertical space, hooray! Also interesting to note is that HP appears to have abandoned the convertible form factor — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/9/21247274/hp-elite-dragonfly-2020-review-tile-test-specs-price-features"&gt;the Gen 2 was a 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;, but the Gen 3 is a clamshell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2NE6iO"&gt;Like its Chromebook sibling, the G3 includes AI features for conference calls (including an “appearance filter” to tweak your video feed and noise reduction that’s supposed to help mitigate muffling from a mask) and has been bumped up to 12th Gen Intel processors that support the vPro platform. It includes up to 32GB of RAM and 2TB of storage, as well as a 68Wh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Three workers converse in an office. One uses the HP Elite Dragonfly G3." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gXUwCOP9nje0OOR_R8elhXerrxQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144538/1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: HP&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A fly for the boardroom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Swdvdf"&gt;Last year’s Elite Dragonfly laptops were really the best of the best. The Dragonfly Max was one of the most beautiful devices I tested last year and would absolutely be my laptop of choice — except that it was way too expensive to be a realistic purchase for most people. Hopefully the addition of a Chromebook to the line will help bring the Dragonfly’s exceptional build and state-of-the-art security and AI features to a more accessible price point. It may also be a good option for workers who prefer Chrome OS to Windows but haven’t yet had an option with the security and stability their jobs require. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yf7Hj2"&gt;The HP Elite Dragonfly G3 is expected to be available in March, while the Chromebooks are coming in April. Pricing has not been announced for either — but I think it’s safe to assume they won’t be cheap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gK2JHn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, Thursday, January 6th, 11:23 AM:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; An earlier version of this article misstated the HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook’s aspect ratio. It’s 3:2. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VW sets a date for the reveal of its production-ready electric Microbus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qx85czjAKM3uMa92uR0i5z0CwpE=/162x0:3935x2515/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70354562/id_buzz_concept_6736.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Volkswagen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e5gGvo"&gt;Nearly five years after it first revealed its ID Buzz concept at the Detroit auto show, Volkswagen is finally ready to show off a production-ready version of the beloved vehicle. VW CEO Herbert Diess tweeted that the “legend returns” on March 9th, along with a gif of the automaker’s iconic Microbus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H5whDG"&gt;A staple of coastal California’s towns, the VW Microbus’ reincarnated as an electric vehicle was never a foregone conclusion. It wasn’t until an outpouring of positive feedback that VW decided to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/19/16173938/volkswagen-microbus-i-d-buzz-concept-production-nostalgia"&gt;greenlight the concept for production&lt;/a&gt;. And even then, it won’t be road-ready until 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="du6UAL"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The legend returns on 03/09/22! &lt;a href="https://t.co/Q4hFyCN5mr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Q4hFyCN5mr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Herbert Diess (@Herbert_Diess) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Herbert_Diess/status/1479088727045591041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 6, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QB0lg7"&gt;The vehicle is a clear homage to the iconic vehicle that the company sold in North America between 1950 and 1980. The production version of the concept is expected to deviate little from the blunt-faced original because all of the batteries will be mounted under the floor. Think of a longer, more van-like Chevrolet Bolt, and you can get an idea of what the electric VW might be like to drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5qUSJ"&gt;We’ve already been treated to images of the ID Buzz draped in high-tech sensors and hardware in its role as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/6/22659306/vw-autonomous-id-buzz-reveal-argo-iaa"&gt;an autonomous test vehicle in Germany&lt;/a&gt;. VW has said the autonomous Microbus will serve as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22430813/vw-argo-autonomous-delivery-ride-pooling-germany"&gt;platform for its full-scale commercial ride-hailing and delivery operation&lt;/a&gt; that it plans on launching in Germany in 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ucQRmS"&gt;We still don’t know many details about the upcoming EV, including whether VW plans on sticking with the slightly cheesy ID Buzz name. (It works fine for a concept with play and pause icons for pedals, but I’m not sure it will fly at a dealership.) We do know that the Microbus will stop atop VW’s mass-manufactured modular electric vehicle platform, or “MEB.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X184ir"&gt;It will join other MEB vehicles, including the ID 3 hatchback, ID 4 crossover SUV, and the upcoming ID 5 sporty SUV. VW may have lost confidence from consumers after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/4/16095164/volkswagen-emissions-scandal-schmidt-guilty-diselgate"&gt;diesel emission scandal&lt;/a&gt;; the electric reincarnation of the iconic Microbus may be the best thing to smooth over some of that skepticism.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A chatbot could help prevent eating disorders, new study finds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Employee In Smart Working Due To Coronavirus Emergency" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/thAszSUj-EmBaRn2C6Q1TN7iYec=/0x0:6528x4352/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70354360/1207643191.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by Mairo Cinquetti/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pyJ0cG"&gt;A chatbot may help reduce the likelihood a person develops an eating disorder, according to a &lt;a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/eat.23662"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;. For women at a high risk for an eating disorder, going through a dialogue with a bot developed by researchers&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;reduced concern over body weight and shape — a factor that contributes to their risk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J3fS5D"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25461783/"&gt;Previous research&lt;/a&gt; showed that digital prevention programs are more effective when they’re guided by a human moderator, says study author Ellen Fitzsimmons-Craft, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. But it’s hard to get funding in the United States for programs that prevent mental health conditions. The team thought a chatbot could be a cheaper, more scaleable version of such a program that offers “some aspects of moderation in an automated format,” Fitzsimmons-Craft says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ntMF1u"&gt;The team developed a chatbot-version of the StudentBodies eating disorder prevention program, which is usually delivered through a website and includes informational content, exercises, and journal prompts. Participants could use the chatbot through texts or through Facebook Messenger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VD43V6"&gt;The study recruited female participants through online ads, fliers, and the National Eating Disorder Association online eating disorder screening test, which is available to anyone on the organization’s &lt;a href="https://www.nationaleatingdisorders.org/screening-tool"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. Women who did not have an active eating disorder but had risk factors for one, like negative body image or excessive concern about their weight, were randomly assigned to either engage with the chatbot or sit on a waitlist. The chatbot offered eight conversations about topics around body image and healthy eating, and women who used the bot were encouraged to have two of the conversations each week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHodKf"&gt;At three- and six-month check-ins, women who talked to the chatbot had a bigger drop in concerns on a survey about their weight and body shape — a major risk factor for developing an eating disorder — than women in the waitlist group. The study, published in December in the &lt;em&gt;International Journal of Eating Disorders&lt;/em&gt;, also found some indication that women in the chatbot group were less likely to have developed a clinical eating disorder by the end of the six months than women in the waitlist group. “This could have a great public health impact if we can continue to find ways to disseminate it widely,” Fitzsimmons-Craft says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dtAay8"&gt;This is one of the first studies testing the effectiveness of chatbots in healthcare, even though they’re widely used in medical settings to assist with everything from COVID-19 symptom screening to therapy. Research has lagged behind their use, but there’s a growing body of work highlighting the role they can play in some areas of healthcare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Hwdrh"&gt;Fitzimmons-Craft thinks chatbots like the one her team developed could be integrated with things like the National Eating Disorder Association screening tests, or in places — like colleges — where people are likely to start showing signs of an eating disorder. The chatbot isn’t designed for people who already have a clinical disorder, but people who show risk factors could be directed toward it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5g1Llq"&gt;It’s also possible to identify people who are at risk for an eating disorder through their web search history, Fitzimmons-Craft says, and likely through their behavior on platforms like Facebook and Instagram. Those platforms are linked to body image issues for teen girls, research and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712927/facebook-instagram-teen-mental-health-research"&gt;whistleblower reports&lt;/a&gt; this fall continue to show. Partnering with platforms like Google or Instagram could help flag behaviors that shows someone is at risk, and pair them with the bot. “I think that’s absolutely worth exploring,” she says. “It’s ripe for identifying individuals who could use help with these issues and intervening on the spot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GENBNh"&gt;Chatbots could also be useful for other types of mental health issues where prevention is important, Fitzimmons-Craft says. They’re not going to be right for everyone or for every issue, but they’re a cheap tool and the barriers to entry are low. People who don’t have an active disorder might not want to do an intensive program, and it might be hard to get funding for involved prevention tools. But at-risk groups could still benefit by being nudged away from a potential problem, she says. “For someone who doesn’t really want or maybe even actively need help — in our study folks were high risk, they didn’t have a clinical problem — it might be just the right thing.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s Smart Keyboard for the latest iPad is a great deal at $105</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EtgtrNkzrgN8FWwlJFSGgFuSYlQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70354229/jbareham_170609_1765_0077.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LLPJzw"&gt;If you own Apple’s ninth Gen iPad, or the previous-gen iPad Air (pre-USB-C days), this Smart Keyboard is compatible — and selling for just about its lowest price yet at Woot. Normally $150 or so at most other retailers, you can snag this snap-on keyboard that covers your iPad’s screen when it’s not in use &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDealsRoundup010522/https://computers.woot.com/offers/apple-smart-keyboard-for-ipad-charcoal?ref=w_cnt_wp_2_27" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $104.99&lt;/a&gt;. This accessory also works with the seventh- and eighth-gen iPads, as well as the 10.5-inch iPad Pro from 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uF2tws"&gt;This is a good price, and it comes with a one-year warranty through Apple. Though, it’s possible that you might want a keyboard for your iPad that offers a trackpad, too. Don’t worry, those exist, and buying one won’t cost you much more than this Smart Keyboard. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287000/brydge-pro-plus-ipad-keyboard-new-firmware-native-multitouch"&gt;Brydge’s $129.99 10.2 Max Plus keyboard case&lt;/a&gt; delivers a solid typing experience, along with protection for every side of your iPad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NUK2QJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685149"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="bmJov2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10685165"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mXHOuC"&gt;If you’re looking for a powerful, port-filled USB-C hub, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerExpand-Adapter-Delivery-Ethernet/dp/B087QZVQJX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker’s 555 model is $67.99 right now&lt;/a&gt;, down 15 percent from its usual price. This model delivers eight ports, including an HDMI port (up to 4K at 60Hz refresh rate), USB-C 3.1 Gen 2 port (supporting 10Gbps speeds), USB-C PD for passthrough charging, two USB-A ports, 1Gbps ethernet jack, and  microSD and SD card readers. Notably, this USB-C hub can accept 100W of power, passing 85W of it to your laptop while reserving the rest of the power for any accessories you might want to plug into the Anker 555. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZbqTla"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10964296"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LB1IVy"&gt;This deal has been popular with new and existing Oculus Quest 2 headset owners: the Elite strap that makes wearing the headset more comfortable is $10 off, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Elite-Enhanced-Support-Comfort/dp/B08F5TZW2J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;selling for $39&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon. We saw this deal first pop up right after Christmas, and it’s worth going for if you want a strap that offers more support for your VR marathons (or even just for your quick burst workouts, if that’s your thing). While you’re at it, you may want &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Carrying-Lightweight-Portable-Protection/dp/B08F5VCNCY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this Oculus Quest 2 hard zip-up case&lt;/a&gt; to keep your headset protected while it’s not in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1uhJZe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10298202"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sNyl3w"&gt;When it comes to gaming accessories, opting for a higher-performance piece of kit can make the difference in giving you that slight competitive edge — or it can just make you feel good. Microsoft’s Xbox Elite Series 2 controller perfectly encapsulates that. Maybe most of us are not talented enough to really need a pro-level controller, but tinkering with its swappable sticks, directional pads, optional rear paddles, and fine-tuning is just fun. This premium controller feels great, looks great, and you can tailor it to what fits your proclivities. It’s currently on sale for $139.99 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMicrosoft-Xbox-Elite-Wireless-Controller-Series-2-Black-FST-00001%2F784834522&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals010622" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, matching its all-time low price that knocks $40 off MSRP. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="u74zsD"&gt;Extra deals for extra credit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="I0A8s4"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Luigi’s Mansion 3&lt;/em&gt; for the Nintendo Switch is down to $39.99 ($20 off) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Luigis-Mansion-3-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07SK4W1VJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. That is close to the historical low price for a very good first-party Nintendo game starring everyone’s favorite Italian plumber’s brother (aside from me: Antonio). &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20942003/luigis-mansion-3-review-nintendo-switch-gooigi-comedy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IFEHFF"&gt;The Thrustmaster T.Flight Hotas 4 flight stick for PS5, PS4, and PC is $49.99 ($40 off) at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgmwzgNK6ei" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This is a very affordable way to get into trying out flight sticks without jumping into more elaborate, expensive setups. While it’s built for PlayStation, you can install PC drivers that’ll make it compatible with the likes of &lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="le6tFV"&gt;If you shoot Fuji’s mirrorless X system, you can pick up the X-T30 on closeout sale at &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/51926/1036?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fifjxt30s.html&amp;amp;subid1=vergedailydeals010622" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt; for $799 ($100 off). This camera is a little long in the tooth now, but it’s still a very capable model if you don’t need the newer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/2/22653712/fujifilm-gfx50sii-xt30ii-xf33-xf23-announced-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;X-T30 II&lt;/a&gt; that’s launching later this month. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/12/18306026/fujifilm-xt30-camera-review-fuji-xt3-mirrorless" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

You can pick up the space gray colorway for $459.99 ($90 off) or the pink for $399.99 ($149 off). These are new units from Woot, complete with a one year Apple warranty. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>BMW shows off huge 31-inch in-car screen to keep backseat passengers entertained</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MXjg9Zq7X2rsj9Ie1qYhtmERsX0=/0x0:7941x5294/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70354054/P90448391_highRes_preview_of_the_in_ca.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: BMW&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="osSXBL"&gt;BMW has revealed a &lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0363131EN/bmw-theatre-screen-brings-cinematic-experience-into-the-vehicle"&gt;new in-car technology it’s calling Theatre Screen&lt;/a&gt; at this year’s CES. It’s not clear when or if this massive 31-inch, 32:9 display will be made available to consumers, but BMW suggests it can be fitted somehow into the ceiling of luxury cars, descending to transform the back seats into a “private cinema lounge.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="urvdFq"&gt;The screen itself has an 8K resolution of roughly 8000 x 2000 and can play content with a 16:9, 21:9, or 32:9 aspect ratio. It’s running Amazon’s Fire OS operating system, which means it should have access to most modern video streaming services and other Fire TV apps that can stream over the car’s own 5G connection. It’s a touchscreen display, and there are also small touchpad controls built into the rear doors of the car.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5by3ezboARhW4xnTL9oVx0Yq_QI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23149367/P90448391_highRes_preview_of_the_in_ca.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: BMW&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screen is 31 inches big, with an aspect ratio of 32:9.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UwnCwl"&gt;Theatre Mode includes surround sound, of course, with a system consisting of over 30 speakers from Bowers &amp;amp; Wilkins. BMW describes the sound as being “4D” because it includes speakers built into the rear seats themselves so viewers can feel the audio vibrations in more intense moments. When the screen descends from the ceiling, BMW says “the roller sunblinds for the side windows and the rear window are closed and the ambient lighting in the rear of the vehicle is dimmed.” Honestly, it sounds like an excellent way to watch a film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnTCSM"&gt;BMW has a functioning prototype of the theater screen built into a car on the CES show floor with which &lt;a href="https://www.bmwblog.com/2022/01/06/exclusive-demo-bmw-theater-screen-31-inch-and-8k-resolution/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BMWBlog &lt;/em&gt;had&lt;/a&gt; a hands-on experience. The company attempted to obscure the exact model of the car the system was installed in, and wouldn’t answer questions about its identity, but &lt;em&gt;BMWBlog&lt;/em&gt; notes that it appears to be a part of the company’s luxury 7 Series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FI5eFt"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hNTTXG1mmxc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4WuY1H"&gt;The company has yet to announce when the system might be available to customers or how much it could end up costing. But during the company’s CES presentation, BMW’s presenter said that the features “look quite similar to what will be launched very soon in series production.” That suggests it might appear before BMW’s other big CES tech announcement, its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/5/22867090/bmw-color-changing-paint-electric-car-ces"&gt;color-changing E Ink car&lt;/a&gt;, which it characterized as an “advanced research and design project.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We’re talking about Taco Bell’s new subscription service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tr9cC7EZWHfjRggEAIw5diivEFo=/211x0:2179x1312/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70353958/Screen_Shot_2022_01_05_at_11.15.31.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ten bucks could get you 30 tacos.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Taco Bell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4OFTGl"&gt;Taco Bell has &lt;a href="https://www.tacobell.com/promotions/taco-lovers-pass"&gt;announced a subscription&lt;/a&gt; that lets you redeem one taco per day for 30 days, and it’s called the Taco Lover’s Pass. The way it works is simple: you pay $10 for the pass in Taco Bell’s app and get access to a secret menu that lets you pick which taco you’ll like to redeem at a participating location. You’ll be able to get a single taco per day and can choose from the:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="nCrtVu"&gt;Crunchy Taco&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DL2uHa"&gt;Crunchy Taco Supreme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oPmnNC"&gt;Soft Taco &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gi9oH6"&gt;Soft Taco Supreme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CNXXT1"&gt;Spicy Potato Soft Taco&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FBJxbQ"&gt;Doritos Locos Tacos&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TjRgSw"&gt;Doritos Locos Tacos Supreme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="2D43Eh"&gt;(We at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; had a lot of thoughts about this program, and we’ll get to those shortly. But first, let me just say that I find this a little insulting, economically speaking — the Doritos Locos Taco Supreme costs $2.69 at my local Taco Bell, where the Spicy Potato Soft Taco costs $1. Someone who prefers potatoes is getting way less for their money than someone who’s locos for Doritos. Okay, yes, I could technically still get 30 tacos for $10, but the &lt;em&gt;principle&lt;/em&gt; of it...)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PObFrO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The pass is a one-time purchase, available for “an extended limited time”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DCBEsS"&gt;The program isn’t necessarily a subscription &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; — Taco Bell told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an email that “[the] Taco Lover’s Pass will be available as a one-time purchase but can be re-purchased when the original 30 days is over.” It also said that it’ll be available “for an extended limited time.” Given that you’ll be able to re-up, though, I’d count that as a subscription, albeit one you have to do manually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDUWKd"&gt;As with all good news stories, this story sparked discourse and passion in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Slack room — probably more than Catie Keck expected when she dropped it in the news channel. After we determined that we weren’t experiencing déjà vu (there was &lt;a href="https://people.com/food/taco-bell-taco-lovers-subscription/"&gt;news about this program last year&lt;/a&gt;, when Taco Bell trialed it in Arizona), we had a discussion that was too good to not share.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tGifFX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thomas Ricker:&lt;/strong&gt; what credit cards are to debt, this is to obesity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADwhPm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard Lawler:&lt;/strong&gt; nah thomas taco bell goes right through you. scientifically not fattening at all&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2psUxq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thomas:&lt;/strong&gt; I’m literally loling&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IjlxQF"&gt;(Please note that &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s science team hasn’t vetted Richard’s claims, and you shouldn’t take them as fact without proof. Always consult with a doctor before starting a new diet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBCSzw"&gt;Bravely (and unfortunately at the same time Thomas made a dire prediction), I opened myself up to ridicule by showing that I have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/pizza_suplex/status/824765101295157249"&gt;the live mas mentality&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JDvwtO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thomas:&lt;/strong&gt; fast food subscriptions are end point US capitalism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WCm1Uz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitchell:&lt;/strong&gt; I might... buy this. It’s like &lt;a href="https://www.panerabread.com/en-us/mypanera/mypanera-coffee-subscription.html"&gt;Panera’s coffee thing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3doM83"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catie:&lt;/strong&gt; i dont think ive had taco bell in over a decade&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQT0rW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard:&lt;/strong&gt; you only get one taco a day though&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHllSC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thomas:&lt;/strong&gt; who eats just one taco&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PufltM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitchell:&lt;/strong&gt; YOu will absolutely have to buy one or two more. But that first taco is free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UovVU6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitchell:&lt;/strong&gt; I mean it was only like $1.19 to begin with but&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVdcdu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Catie:&lt;/strong&gt; okay but how often are u rly buying taco bell tho&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="ABega8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“okay but how often are u rly buying taco bell tho”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DaAkWE"&gt;Jay Peters then jumped in to remind Catie that I had revealed my Taco Bell weakness a few minutes earlier, and Dan Seifert chimed in with “taco bell? more like toxic hell, amirite!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDv0qM"&gt;I, of course, was forced to respond with facts and logic to defend my honor and the good name of multi-billion dollar conglomerate Yum! Brands (the company behind Taco Bell, KFC, Pizza Hut, and more).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kowU8U"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mitchell:&lt;/strong&gt; I have one excuse: Vegetarianism&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E5ZOHu"&gt;Okay, so maybe it was more of a mealy-mouthed excuse (as one might expect from someone who dines at the Bell). But I can always count on Richard to have my back:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CfpZg2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard:&lt;/strong&gt; taco bell is ideal for that&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2f7BPL"&gt;Others also chimed in about their Taco Bell habits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r3Q9sy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brandon Widder:&lt;/strong&gt; i go to taco bell maybe once a month, but never before midnight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnGXxy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dan:&lt;/strong&gt; i frequently get the taco bell cravings but then i’m too lazy to go get it. so it’s been years since i’ve had it&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpMhqs"&gt;Finally, of course, came the inevitable discussion of what we call Taco Bell’s food.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QXBbx8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thomas:&lt;/strong&gt; can we put taco in “” since it’s only an approximation? Taco Bell “taco”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyerAY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Richard:&lt;/strong&gt; it’s legitimate taco bell&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Qv06A"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Name redacted for fear of ruining Brand]:&lt;/strong&gt; which is not legitimate “food” or “taco” or “edible”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xV7QqS"&gt;I then shared that my placeholder headline for this story was “Let’s Taco ‘bout the Bell.” Jay reacted with a thumbs down emoji, Dan said “Let’s give em something to Taco ’bout” (which put my idea to shame, so I stole it), and Thomas informed us that he was muting the thread.
