    <title>The challenge of redesigning a classic esports logo</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Motto.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;How Ninjas in Pyjamas created a new identity &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="yWbpXI"&gt;When Sunny Bonnell and her team at branding agency &lt;a href="https://wearemotto.com/"&gt;Motto&lt;/a&gt; started working with &lt;a href="https://nip.gl/"&gt;Ninjas In Pyjamas&lt;/a&gt; (NIP), a 20-year-old esports team in search of a new look, they did a lot of research. The team had never worked in gaming or esports before, and they wanted to understand the space. They talked to fans and people on the team, and sketched out hundreds of possible logo ideas over the course of more than a year. When &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NIPGaming/status/1353764575385149441"&gt;NIP revealed their new visual identity&lt;/a&gt; last month, the reaction was immediate — and much of it was negative. “I don’t think we really knew at the time that the fans would have such a hard time with it,” says Bonnell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T5bt3M"&gt;NIP was founded in 2000, and the Swedish organization currently operates teams in &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;FIFA&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Rainbow Six&lt;/em&gt;, though it’s most famous for its &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike &lt;/em&gt;squad. Its previous logo was a gold shuriken with lots of curves and sharp points. The new iteration maintains the same concept but streamlines it, with neon yellow set against a black backdrop, and an angular shuriken that features a stylized version of the kanji for “nin” inside. It’s brighter, simpler, and more easily recognizable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbaO1G"&gt;Bonnell says that the new logo was necessary for a few reasons. These include the flexibility to scale across different platforms, as well as the lack of contrast between the black-and-brown color scheme. “There were just a lot of technical issues with the existing mark,” she says. The challenge, she adds, was making a logo that not only retained the classic iconography associated with the team but also felt fresh and worked across a variety of mediums. “That mark had to do a whole lot of lifting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ba4UKg1swH0iQKe_6RnkoJ21B2s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22283616/01_old_to_new.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LKqaVV"&gt;When the team started working on the project, they really zoomed in on the ninja part of the NIP name. There’s the kanji, as well as a color scheme inspired by the streets of Tokyo, and even an audio element; the designers came up with a signature blade swooshing sound for the team to use in videos and on social media. “I felt that was something they could truly own,” Bonnell says of the ninja elements. “They were lacking something to say. They had cool apparel and great teams, but they didn’t really have anything else that was giving them a story to tell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yC9BKq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That was something they could truly own.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WTXmhn"&gt;One of the challenges of modern logo design is creating something that can work pretty much anywhere. It’s especially tricky in esports. The NIP logo is used as a Twitter icon, a badge on jerseys, and even a virtual sticker that players can put on in-game guns. When in-person tournaments return, the logo will be blown up on big LCD displays on stage. (Bonnell is particularly excited about the last one. “It’s going to be so cool.”) To make something that works in all of these contexts, designers often resort to something flat and simple. The result is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21163766/bmw-new-flat-logo-design-bad-transparent-background-cars"&gt;logos that tend to look the same&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5DCzC1"&gt;“It gets trickier over time,” Bonnell says of the process. “The more you add, the more complicated it becomes.” The new NIP logo attempts to get around this in a few ways. For one, the shuriken is set on its side to create a sense of motion, as if it was being thrown. And while the logo is relatively simple, it’s imbued with meaning, like the hidden word inside the weapon. Basically, every element is meant to scream “ninja!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-AIQtRI5kCDEu4pf2z8BoV6MHCo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22283624/NIP_In_Game_CSGO_Gun.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Motto&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BbcYwS"&gt;Giving an existing team a new identity is a tricky proposition. Just like in traditional sports, esports fans are attached to teams and their histories. In fact, when &lt;a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2021/01/dignitas-launches-rebrand-revives-historic-logo-with-modern-twist/"&gt;Dignitas&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://esportsinsider.com/2020/05/evil-geniuses-final-rebrand/"&gt;Evil Geniuses&lt;/a&gt;, two long-running organizations, introduced dramatic redesigns, the uproar was so intense they ended up reverting back to their original logos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mULSys"&gt;Despite all of the preparation, Bonnell says she wasn’t completely ready for the amount of blowback the NIP redesign received. “There’s a lot of hate in esports that I don’t know if I was prepared for,” she says. “I had to stop reading the comments, because I was like ‘Oh my god, I want to cry in my cornflakes.’ This is really bad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Cdpkz"&gt;That has mellowed over time, she says. “The first day was rough,” she admits, but says that as time passed and the logo was displayed in more contexts — on jerseys, in actual games — she started to receive positive feedback from fans who changed their minds. While other organizations may have struggled with the initial blowback, Bonnell doesn’t think that will happen with NIP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="eEzVN6"&gt;“First they’ll be ridiculed,” she says, “then they’ll be revered.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super Bowl 2021: how to watch the NFL championship online</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="NFL: FEB 02 Super Bowl LV Preview" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h6TLXzrG12qBAeLJiqBh896JnDI=/0x0:4800x3200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68782808/1230936504.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lmn4vF"&gt;Super Bowl 2021 — the 55th Super Bowl — is happening today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5cAQG"&gt;The championship game pits the Kansas City Chiefs, the defending Super Bowl champs, against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Eric Church and Jazmine Sullivan will sing the national anthem, while The Weeknd will perform in the halftime show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsCAKI"&gt;If you are planning to watch the football game, you have a few options, and many of them are free. Below, we have listed a few ways you can watch this year’s Super Bowl. Keep in mind that, due to production limits imposed by the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242680/super-bowl-lv-4k-hdr-cbs-sports-stream-not-available-2021"&gt;Super Bowl 2021 will not be streaming in 4K resolution&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LokHJ3"&gt;Where is the Super Bowl being played? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pY2edn"&gt;Super Bowl 2021 will take place at Raymond James Stadium in Tampa, Florida, the home field of the Buccaneers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Xr1EeI"&gt;What time will the Super Bowl start? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LNJvoo"&gt;The broadcast will begin at 6:30PM ET / 3:30PM PT. But if you want to tune in ahead of kickoff, CBS will be running coverage throughout the day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5yDCfi"&gt;What network is televising the Super Bowl?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nXH8dO"&gt;Super Bowl 2021 will be televised on CBS, the “official” network on which viewers in the US can watch the big game. Last year, the game was televised on Fox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2oemhC"&gt;How can I watch the Super Bowl? &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="USholr"&gt;While Super Bowl 21 will be televised on CBS, there are a few ways you can view the game. Below is a list of services, streaming and otherwise, you can take advantage of. Some will require a paid subscription, but most of those include a free trial for first-time users.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PSA: Don’t post your coronavirus vaccination card selfie on social media </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pfizer Covid-19 vaccination record card with pharmaceutical beaker, Minnesota." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2wqIPE3qxXteHW8sUh52ZegF6sM=/0x0:5199x3466/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68781080/1299969115.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by: Michael Siluk/Education Images/Universal Images Group via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XKtggZ"&gt;Look I know this pandemic has been a long, depressing slog, and even if you’ve masked up, done the social distancing, and have managed to stay virus-free, we’re all good and frazzled at this point. So it’s understandable that now that we have vaccines available, everyone’s impatient to get one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="axHQNM"&gt;But when you finally get the jab, resist the urge to post a humblebrag on Instagram or any other social media platform, because identity thieves may be watching. And, you don’t want to be the newly-vaccinated person whose selfie provides scammers with a template to make &lt;em&gt;fake&lt;/em&gt; vaccination record cards (because if you think isn’t already happening, you would be mistaken).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1Jrcu"&gt;“Some of you are celebrating your second COVID-19 vaccination with the giddy enthusiasm that’s usually reserved for weddings, new babies, and other life events,” the &lt;a href="https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2021/02/social-media-no-place-covid-19-vaccination-cards"&gt;Federal Trade Commission wrote in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; on Friday. “You’re posting a photo of your vaccination card on social media. Please — don’t do that! You could be inviting identity theft.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9vInj"&gt;Not only does the card have the vaccinated person’s name and birth date on it, it also includes when and where you got the shot. Unless all your social media accounts are set to private, you’re handing out a lot of free data about yourself you may not want randos on the internet to know. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSkZN6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/06/health/covid-vaccination-card.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; talked to some privacy experts&lt;/a&gt; who said a savvy scam artist could pretend to be a healthcare official to trick people who have received the first dose of the vaccine into thinking they need to pay for the second dose, and get the victims’ credit card information. And, someone could use the photo of your vaccination card to recreate the cards and possibly sell counterfeit versions— something that’s apparently &lt;a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/13439089/tiktok-vaccine-covid-card-passport-fakes/"&gt;already happening&lt;/a&gt; in the UK. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CAeFjL"&gt;As part of its &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/covid-19/vaccinate-with-confidence.html"&gt;Vaccinate with Confidence&lt;/a&gt; campaign, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a plan for states to hand out stickers to the newly-vaccinated, an excellent visual to share on social media instead of your vaccination card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PY6rK3"&gt;So if you have been vaccinated against the coronavirus, please accept my congratulations! We’re all happy for you. But we don’t need to see your vital information all over our social feeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnWCmO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Consumer protection agency investigating Venmo’s collection practices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Venmo - Share Payments logo..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aq9v7tofFNilEmtFJ_AR_9cDCAo=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68780256/1227801650.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jFJx8p"&gt;The Consumer Finance Protection Bureau is investigating money transfer app Venmo over the way it handles collections, a &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1633917/000163391721000018/pypl-20201231.htm"&gt;new regulatory filing shows&lt;/a&gt;. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/venmos-debt-collection-practices-probed-by-cfpb-11612537319"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the filing shows Venmo owner PayPal received a Civil Investigative Demand from the CFPB on January 21st, “related to Venmo’s unauthorized funds transfers and collections processes, and related matters.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4trN3"&gt;PayPal said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it was working “productively with the CFPB to provide information, as requested, on our practices and processes.” The statement added that Venmo  “remains deeply committed to its compliance obligations and the company works closely with regulators around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Knn7lk"&gt;A Venmo user’s account may be referred to collections if it becomes overdrawn; while money transfers within the app usually occur immediately, sometimes the funds don’t leave the user’s bank account for more than 24 hours. So Venmo covers the amount of the payment in the interim. But if the user’s account doesn’t have the funds available when their bank processes the payment, Venmo tries to recoup the amount it covered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kbE5ZM"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; has covered &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/venmo-to-users-if-you-owe-us-money-were-coming-for-it-11553518800"&gt;Venmo’s collection practices&lt;/a&gt; in the past, reporting in 2019 that the company even pursued collections against users who may have been the victims of scammers. Last year, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; reported that &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/even-in-a-pandemic-venmo-tells-conned-customers-to-pay-up-11600939826"&gt;Venmo pursued collections&lt;/a&gt; at the same rate during the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZp8SA"&gt;Venmo says its user agreement details its potential use of collections, and that it complies with all applicable laws when it pursues collection activity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVMwQV"&gt;Venmo has seen an increase in users during the coronavirus pandemic, as more people used digital payment systems. Earlier this week, &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/paypal-profit-triples-as-pandemic-drives-continued-surge-in-online-payments-11612387131"&gt;PayPal reported&lt;/a&gt; net income of $1.57 billion for its fourth quarter, up from $507 million a year earlier. Venmo’s active accounts rose 32 percent in 2020 to nearly 70 million, and CEO Dan Schulman said in a &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4403221-paypal-holdings-inc-pypl-ceo-dan-schulman-on-q4-2020-results-earnings-call-transcript"&gt;call with investors&lt;/a&gt; that the company expects Venmo’s revenue to approach $900 million in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h7s1d7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="111E1V"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxvY6h"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3luwS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="maeP8p"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wR38Z6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4 id="bOgRg2"&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="UBHHFl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhwVTJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Myanmar orders internet providers to block Twitter and Instagram in the country</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Myanmar People Stage Protests As Internet Is Cut" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8up0EiPnlkwX-Hy_37vOhfQ7zgg=/0x1:2998x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68779776/1300658954.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rMAj48"&gt;Not long after it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266031/facebook-myanmar-blocked-instagram-whatsapp-military-coup-protest"&gt;blocked Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, Myanmar has now ordered mobile networks and internet service providers to block Twitter and Facebook-owned Instagram in the country as well. The southeast Asian country’s military &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/05/tech/myanmar-blocks-twitter-instagram/index.html"&gt;seized power in a coup&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week, detaining its civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi along with other government officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gCfuFb"&gt;Facebook users had &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/myanmar-blocks-facebook-access-after-coup-11612436184?mod=pls_whats_news_us_business_f"&gt;reportedly been using&lt;/a&gt; the social media platform to protest the coup, sharing photos of themselves giving the three-finger salute that’s become associated with resistance in the area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAaEKX"&gt;“All mobile operators, international gateways and internet service providers in Myanmar received a directive on 5 February 2021 from the Myanmar Ministry of Transport and Communications (MoTC) to, until further notice, block the social media platforms Twitter and Instagram,” Norwegian telecom company &lt;a href="https://www.telenor.com/directive-to-block-social-media-services-twitter-and-instagram-in-myanmar/"&gt;Telenor said in a statement late Friday.&lt;/a&gt; The company provides mobile services in Myanmar. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hAXbia"&gt;Myanmar’s Ministry of Information issued an ominous statement on Tuesday, a day after the military seized power, instructing people not to spread rumors on social media, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/01/asia/myanmar-military-coup-explainer-intl-hnk-scli/index.html"&gt;CNN reported&lt;/a&gt;. “Some media and public are spreading rumors on social media conducting gatherings to incite rowdiness and issuing statements which can cause unrest. We would like to urge the public not to carry out these acts and would like to notify the public to cooperate with the government in accordance with the existing laws,” the statement read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RC1xa5"&gt;Rafael Frankel, Facebook’s director of public policy, APAC emerging countries, said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company was “extremely concerned” by the shutdown orders, and urged authorities to unblock access immediately. “At this critical time, the people of Myanmar need access to important information and to be able to communicate with their loved ones,” Frankel said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBQqPr"&gt;A Twitter spokesperson echoed that concern, saying in an email to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the order “undermines the public conversation and the rights of people to make their voices heard. The Open Internet is increasingly under threat around the world. We will continue to advocate to end destructive government-led shutdowns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ybBNW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 6th, 11:13AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds statements from Facebook and Twitter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why the FDA is taking 22 days to look over J&amp;J’s data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration, a vial and a medical syringe..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsWXUsbI2i5mr2yBPQ5OX1YfPCM=/0x0:4800x3200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68779704/1230084558.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZQpiQS"&gt;A billion years ago last summer, people were getting antsy about vaccines. They wanted things to move faster, maybe skip a few steps in clinical trials to speed things up. This was, at the time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21352706/covid-19-vaccine-steps-process-clinical-trials-speed-moderna"&gt;generally considered a bad idea&lt;/a&gt; that would result in less accurate data and cause people to lose trust in the vaccines. Now, exactly 1.589 trillion years later, recklessly speeding things up for speed’s sake remains a poor choice, but &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NateSilver538/status/1357493589031452679"&gt;some people on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; like journalist Nate Silver, seem to think we should do it anyways. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCwXOS"&gt;They take particular issue with the fact that while Johnson and Johnson submitted their data from their giant clinical trial this week, the Food and Drug Administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22267984/covid-vaccine-johnson-fda-one-dose-review"&gt;will take until February 26th to review the data&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rGZjm"&gt;Three weeks can feel like an eternity during the pandemic, with hospitals crowded and deaths still climbing. It’s easy to be flip about the process and want things to Just. Go. Faster. But the 22 days is not that much longer than the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-announces-advisory-committee-meeting-discuss-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;20 days the agency&lt;/a&gt; took to review data for Pfizer/BioNTech’s vaccine or the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-announces-advisory-committee-meeting-discuss-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;17 days for Moderna&lt;/a&gt;’s candidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="oaUzAb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pMfiqT"&gt;Here’s what’s going to happen during those days. Researchers at the FDA will have to review the data from the 43,783 people who participated in the trial. This will entail looking at the cases across all study sites — here in the US, in Latin America and in South Africa, where a new coronavirus variant is dominant. The typical review process for a vaccine can take months. Instead, it will happen in a few weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ADXeE"&gt;If the process is anything like what the FDA planned for the earlier vaccine candidates, those weeks will be filled with a lot of late nights and workers doing everything that they can to reasonably speed things up. “Groups have been working in shifts, nights and weekends, looking in parallel at issues of clinical effectiveness and safety, and of levels of antibodies to confirm the way the vaccine is working.” the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported in December. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3kDTC"&gt;Why do all that work? Right now, the information that we have about the vaccine comes from the company. That information is promising, and shows that it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/30/22257557/antivirus-johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-results"&gt;probably be a good vaccine&lt;/a&gt;. But there are reasons that the FDA doesn’t just take a company at its word. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trKBd6"&gt;Let’s turn &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KendraWrites/status/1357521813190893572"&gt;to noted scientific historian Billy Joel&lt;/a&gt;, and the “children of thalidomide.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NuYYmu"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eFTLKWw542g?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NYtmhB"&gt;Thalidomide was a sedative that was given&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/health/thalidomide-survivors-usa.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=RelatedLinks&amp;amp;pgtype=Article"&gt; to pregnant people&lt;/a&gt; in the 1960’s as a cure for morning sickness. It caused birth defects in thousands of children across the world. In the US, pregnant women were given the drug in clinical trials, but unlike other countries, it wasn’t approved for sale at the time, thanks to Frances Kelsey. Kelsey was a drug reviewer at the FDA who looked over data from the company trying to sell the drug and found it unconvincing. The incident &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4101807/"&gt;led to new laws&lt;/a&gt; that let the FDA determine a drug’s safety &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;effectiveness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LbV9vH"&gt;Taking the time to review a vaccine during a pandemic might seem like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic — but it’s actually inspecting the lifeboats before you leave port. We have procedures and protocols for a reason. When we launch something big, like a rocket, engineers don’t just push a button and send it soaring. They go through detailed pre-flight checklists, making sure that every bit of a spaceship is sound. We’ve learned the hard way that &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5175151"&gt;disregarding safety procedures can cost lives&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yszDNe"&gt;Pushing out a third vaccine quickly might help save lives, yes. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21266591/covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-fda-authorize-emergency-experimental"&gt;only if people are willing to take it&lt;/a&gt;. Some &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/02/why-arent-more-health-care-workers-getting-vaccinated.html"&gt;healthcare workers&lt;/a&gt; are &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/02/why-arent-more-health-care-workers-getting-vaccinated.html"&gt;already hesitant&lt;/a&gt; to take the vaccine. They worry that the process is rushed. Rushing the process &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; isn’t likely to convince them — people who generally are not opposed to vaccines — that the process is safe and secure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJchl8"&gt;I get it. Waiting sucks. But when you’re injecting people with a new treatment and the trust of billions of people is on the line, sometimes it’s worth taking the time to double-check your work. &lt;/p&gt;

But it’s still unclear whether they can prevent chronic COVID-19 symptoms. (Nicole Wetsman/&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

That statistic got misinterpreted as proof that the vaccine decreased &lt;em&gt;transmission&lt;/em&gt; of the virus. It might, but that hasn’t been proven yet.

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="8qlS27"&gt;I had my espresso with foamed milk, even though coffee is disgusting to me now. I do not enjoy the taste. But I have a cup of coffee almost every morning. It’s like ritual, right? I enjoy the process of making it, and the warmth, and the caffeine. So I keep doing it, and I keep hoping that it will taste good to me at some point. I feel like I’m using my imagination when I eat, trying to use my memory of how things smell and taste to recreate the experience, because otherwise I would not want to eat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="neB2dq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; is coming to PlayStation 5, developer &lt;a href="https://press.na.square-enix.com/SQUARE-ENIX-ANNOUNCES-ENDWALKER-THE-LATEST-EXPANSION-FOR-FINAL-FANTASY"&gt;Square-Enix announced Friday&lt;/a&gt;. An open beta will start April 13th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2HEJj"&gt;A teaser trailer shows the game running in 4K resolution, and the company says it will have significantly improved frame rates and faster load times. If you’re registered in the PS4 version of the game, the new optimized version will be playable at no extra cost during the beta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DYtVt6"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L7ZEkdtTp8o?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4ayJi8"&gt;Final Fantasy XIV also will get a new expansion pack called &lt;em&gt;Endwalker:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6tF9PQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; features the climax of the Hydaelyn and Zodiark story, in which Warriors of Light will encounter an even greater calamity than ever before as they travel to the far reaches of Hydaelyn and even to the moon. In addition to bringing the long-running story arc that began with &lt;em&gt;A Realm Reborn &lt;/em&gt;to its conclusion, &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; will mark a new beginning for the beloved MMO, setting the stage for new adventures that longtime fans and new players can enjoy together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="LDGIHC"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7-bkJ2ZoW6k?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QeK1Zq"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; was originally released in 2010, the game got so much backlash from players and critics that the its original director and producer left the project, and the developer &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/2012/9/11/3318772/final-fantasy-xiv-to-suspend-billing-from-september-29th-until-the"&gt;shut down its servers in 2012&lt;/a&gt;. It relaunched in 2013 as &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are a few of this week’s best deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HwgI1Y0Z0qltJ5jUQBV2inNa9mk=/0x0:1013x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68779474/destruction_all_stars_screenshots_14_disclaimer_ps5_en_15oct20.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screengrab from Destruction All-Stars, a PS5 game you can get for free with a PS Plus subscription&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bSOn1T"&gt;How has the first week of February been for you? Good, I hope. We’re keeping it simple with the weekend deals post by providing a variety of the best discounts we’ve seen this week. Whether you just got a PS5 and want an affordable way to get a PS Plus membership, your home is in desperate need of better Wi-Fi coverage and speed, or you need an affordable Sonos speaker, you might find something you want below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="8oQmf8"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qrPDZX"&gt;Save big on a PS Plus membership&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dYCcjE"&gt;This deal has been very popular with readers, and it’s easy to see why. A one-year subscription to PS Plus, Sony’s online service that allows multiplayer and complimentary titles each month, usually costs $60. But digital key seller Eneba is offering it to &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers for $28 when they put in offer code &lt;strong&gt;VERGE28&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kYxjqb"&gt;Sweetening the value, you can get two years of service (it’ll arrive in the form of two unique codes that you input in the PS Store) for just $56 when you use the offer code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEFEB &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4CamqP"&gt;With PS Plus this month, you can get &lt;em&gt;Destruction AllStars&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Control Ultimate Edition&lt;/em&gt; on PS5 as complimentary perks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xvvq2E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="7LQoQ3"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Eero 6" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ULhFUiPZOoJ20AyiMlZrf4rkjW8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22284101/eero6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eero&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mUEkrt"&gt;Eero’s latest mesh Wi-Fi routers are discounted&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zGymFF"&gt;Whether you’re looking to get a single Wi-Fi router or get set up with a variety bundle that’ll cast a wider blanket of Wi-Fi coverage over your house, there are some good deals happening on Amazon’s Eero products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4NW6nv"&gt;If you want a whole-home solution, Eero’s 6 router (supporting Wi-Fi 6) comes bundled with two Eero 6 extenders for $223 (usually $279). But if you want to get started with a single Eero 6 router, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VM9ZDD?&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=ad859221eb81bb566d28812855d03192&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ref_=as_li_ss_tl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s just $103&lt;/a&gt; (down from $129). (Note that the Eero 6 router has two Ethernet ports, while the extenders are wireless only.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gqeJSP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603441"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ciX0mX"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sonos Play:1 images" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lyy2rsEdOs2u1o8XSLN83tXsfvw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/2786320/sonosplay1-2040-8.1381709930.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OYPRfV"&gt;Snag a refurbished Sonos Play:1 for $99&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="teeTyz"&gt;Sonos is selling refurbished Play:1 Wi-Fi speakers for $99 at its site. This is a solid investment if you want something affordable to build out your collection of Sonos speakers. It’s a little long in the tooth, having originally released in 2013, but it’s still supported by Sonos’ S2 platform and mobile app. These speakers should look and operate as new, and they come with a one-year warranty through Sonos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ShTtJe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10322142"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="0VgxHU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Miami mayor says Elon Musk will tunnel under the city for just $30 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fHo0o3ZmJAlndP_hbMxFV0rY34E=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68778193/Boring_tunnel__2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: The Boring Company&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FpUyES"&gt;Elon Musk told Miami’s mayor Friday that The Boring Company could dig a two-mile tunnel under the city for as little as $30 million — a fraction of the $1 billion price tag once &lt;a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article249037895.html"&gt;quoted by local transit officials&lt;/a&gt;. Musk also told the Mayor that The Boring Company could complete the job in six months, versus the original four year estimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AujKa6"&gt;Mayor Francis Suarez shared these details about his “wonderful call” with Musk in a video posted to Twitter. “He’s focused on trying to deliver a project that will have the maximum utility for our residents for the least amount of money,” Suarez said. “The order of magnitude in terms of savings is significant.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q4TKdH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just had my call w/ &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@elonmusk&lt;/a&gt; regarding &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boringcompany?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@boringcompany&lt;/a&gt; tunnels coming to MIA&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;DETAILS BELOW   &lt;a href="https://t.co/NsJFYcvGeQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NsJFYcvGeQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mayor Francis Suarez (@FrancisSuarez) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FrancisSuarez/status/1357796329263669258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4YVrEd"&gt;Musk first &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1351091106805645312"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; about wanting to tunnel under Miami on January 18th. “Cars &amp;amp; trucks stuck in traffic generate megatons of toxic gases &amp;amp; particulate, but @boringcompany road tunnels under Miami would solve traffic &amp;amp; be an example to the world,” he wrote. Musk said in the tweet that he had already spoken to Florida Governor Ron DeSantis about the idea. “If Governor &amp;amp; Mayor want this done, we will do it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UebnY2"&gt;Suarez said Friday that he will speak to DeSantis and the mayor of Miami-Dade county. “I think we have a unique opportunity to create a signature project not just for Miami, but for the world,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9iw3C"&gt;Tunneling under Miami is not easy because the city is built on limestone, which is spongey. That hurdle is one reason for the sky-high price tag quoted in 2018. It also helped drive up the price of a tunnel under the Port of Miami, which was less than a mile but &lt;a href="https://miami.cbslocal.com/2021/02/05/miami-mayor-francis-suarez-elon-musk-tunnel-transit/"&gt;still cost around $700 million&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Yqm6S0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Miami is built on limestone, which would be hard to tunnel through&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RLzMh4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article249037895.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Miami Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported Friday that the limestone bedrock and the impact of rising sea levels were among the talking points for the call, though it’s unclear to what extent these items were discussed. Musk has previously talked about digging tunnels &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1305901516239273986"&gt;as deep underground as skyscrapers are tall&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHwxRO"&gt;Musk started The Boring Company in 2016, and has started a handful of projects around the country in the years since. The purpose and scope of the tunnels has changed a bit over that time. These days, the company is trying to make a transportation service that uses Teslas traveling through the tunnels. The first commercial service is nearing completion underneath the Las Vegas Convention Center, though The Boring Company recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176596/elon-musk-boring-company-las-vegas-strip-tesla-tunnels"&gt;a massive city-wide expansion that would service the Strip and the airport&lt;/a&gt;. The company is also &lt;a href="https://www.masstransitmag.com/rail/infrastructure/press-release/21208883/san-bernardino-county-transportation-authority-sbcta-sbcta-board-to-begin-negotiating-with-the-boring-company-on-the-ontario-loop-project"&gt;in negotiations for a tunnel in San Bernardino County, California&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GHeXRG"&gt;Other attempts have not gone so well, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18236075/elon-musk-chicago-boring-company-tunnel-politics"&gt;a failed project in Chicago&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/28/elon-musk-underground-tunnel-los-angeles-lawsuit"&gt;a canceled tunnel in West Los Angeles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit stopped rogue r/WallStreetBets mods from taking over the community</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gbqxwpYbBdGWcLC3CFMgG9v6jRw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68778141/acastro_180413_1777_reddit_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m1RETn"&gt;Reddit’s r/WallStreetBets has grown significantly due to the community’s role in driving up the stock prices of companies like GameStop, AMC, and Nokia, and the whole saga has garnered so much attention that there are currently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22268952/gamestop-stock-stonks-reddit-wallstreetbets-movies-tv-shows-hbo-netflix"&gt;many movies and a TV show in the works&lt;/a&gt;. But that increased attention has also put strain on the r/WallStreetBets community itself, forcing Reddit to step in to help sort things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCLIB0"&gt;The trouble started Wednesday night, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/04/technology/wallstreetbets-gamestop-hollywood.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as some r/WallStreetBets moderators talked with each other about trying to get a movie deal. On Thursday morning, “the WallStreetBets moderators who were considering the film deal began booting out other moderators who had questioned them for secretly trying to profit from the forum’s success,” reports &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcvluc/an_update_on_the_wsb_coup_d%C3%A9tat/"&gt;highly upvoted r/WallStreetBets post&lt;/a&gt; called the situation “a coup,” saying the moderators the community “know and love” were being tossed out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hNKvHp"&gt;At some point, Reddit stepped in to stop the takeover, and the company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that it had removed some r/WallStreetBets mods. The company says &lt;a href="https://www.redditinc.com/policies/moderator-guidelines-for-healthy-communities"&gt;they violated rule five of its moderator guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, which reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mYZyWv"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Stable and Active Teams of Moderators:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBIYIX"&gt;Healthy communities have moderators who are around to answer questions of their community and engage with the admins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xDPirS"&gt;The company wouldn’t share how many mods were removed.  As of this writing, there are 28 mods listed on the &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/moderators"&gt;r/WallStreetBets mods page&lt;/a&gt;, and “in recent weeks there have been a few dozen,” according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dhftlg"&gt;Reddit said it had to take action due to the instability the situation created for the community, according to a message sent to the r/WallStreetBets mods by Reddit that was &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/reddit-steps-in-wallstreetbets-subreddit-moderator-bans/"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;Mashable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We understand many will be upset with our decisions today, however it was clear to us an intervention was necessary for the continued health of the r/wallstreetbets community,” part of the message read. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X54uWP"&gt;The mods removed by Reddit can’t be immediately reinstated as moderators of r/WallStreetBets, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The mods removed by the bad actors &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be reinstated as mods on r/WallStreetBets, but at the discretion of the current mod team. It’s unclear which of the removed mods may return, or which have been invited to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7wNGh"&gt;Last week, Discord also had to step in to help moderate a WallStreetBets community. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22253251/discord-bans-the-r-wallstreetbets-server"&gt;banned the original r/WallStreetBets server&lt;/a&gt; due to “hateful and discriminatory content” and has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254339/discord-r-wallstreetbets-server-help-moderation-ban"&gt;helping the mods of the new one&lt;/a&gt; with moderation.&lt;/p&gt;
