    <title>Hands off: Moen’s new smart faucet doesn’t even need a handle</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ld0ezaW_0LwtytQGhgwU3Txr-Rg=/0x768:2100x2168/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70343552/Moen_Smart_Faucet_with_Motion_Control___No_Handle___Brushed_Gold.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moen’s newest smart faucet goes handle-free.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Moen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A5USWw"&gt;Moen revealed its latest smart faucet at CES this week: the Moen Smart Faucet with Motion Control. The new feature adds completely handle-free operation, using gestures to control temperature as well as flow. But you can still have a handle if you really want one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QOMoQ7"&gt;The idea is you operate the faucet using swipe and push motions in front of the sensor to get hot, warm, or cold water. The Moen Smart Water App should let you set the default temperatures, as well as customize the gestures further.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VnXrZWLpeqflNa3t2uKrjF6sVeA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23133025/Moen_Smart_Faucet_with_Motion_Control___Nio___No_Handle___Chrome.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Moen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The handle-free design of the Moen Smart Faucet with Motion is a minimalist’s dream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4iNciQ"&gt;The new faucet has all the features of the existing Moen Smart Faucet — including voice activation (with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant). There’s also the ability to dispense precise measurements and temperatures — so you can ask for one cup of 100-degree water, as well as set presets for common commands (such as the right temperature and volume to fill your coffee pot versus your water bottle). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2fXV3"&gt;There are two handle-free styles at launch and four options that feature the more traditional control option as well. Pricing starts at $675 and varies based on style and finish, and it will be available to buy in April 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WONUfV"&gt;Moen also announced integrations between its smart faucet and other smart water products and its new Smart Water Network, a residential smart water ecosystem centered around Moen’s Flo Smart Water Monitor and Shutoff. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b1rBZVr8cUFhBoZXuDnAa8VJ-K0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132981/Moen_Smart_Water_Network___Products.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Moen&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Moen’s smart devices will all work together as part of its Smart Water Network. From left: Moen Smart Faucet, Smart Leak Detector, Smart Sump Pump Monitor, Flo Smart Water Monitor and Shutoff, Smart Shower controller. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SBiBoU"&gt;If a house has the smart water monitor and a Moen faucet and / or smart shower installed, the devices should soon be able to communicate with each other to help winterize the system and prevent burst pipes by flushing the water lines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="50ZdWR"&gt;The Smart Water Monitor installs on a home’s main water supply line and monitors the water flow, pressure, and temperature to notify you of leaks, burst pipes, and other potential issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Aedjc"&gt;When paired with the other Moen products and controlled by the Moen Smart Water app, a homeowner is supposed to be able to tell the system to winterize itself by shutting off water coming into the home and purging the water line via the faucet and shower. When it’s time to get the pipes flowing again, a Health Protect feature should flush the water lines to prevent dirt, debris, or germs from building up in the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZEp6cj"&gt;The system also has a built-in freeze protection feature. When it senses high pressure or low temperatures that could cause a pipe to burst, it can automatically shut off water to the home via the Flo Smart Water Monitor and Shutoff, then purge the water line using the Moen faucet and shower.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZKpC8c"&gt;The Moen Smart Water App integration with the smart faucet will launch in 2022, with the smart shower coming to the app in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7cEg7s"&gt;This type of integration currently requires a substantial investment in products from one company, but the whole home approach to protecting and monitoring essential infrastructure in a house is a key part of the possible future of the smart home. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sleep Number wants you to grow old in its smart beds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A render of the Sleep Number 360 smart bed" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w9ucr8BOvX-YzZ5MwsSJlW2Psq8=/130x0:4459x2886/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70343556/Sleep_Number_360_Smart_Bed__Sept__9__4_alt.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Sleep Number 360 smart bed&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sleep Number&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LGV74P"&gt;Sleep Number’s 360 smart beds are a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/4/10705482/sleep-number-it-bed-pricing-availability-ces-2016"&gt;regular&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/6/7490851/sleep-number-sleep-iq-kids-ces-2015"&gt;fixture&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/8/14195396/sleep-number-360-smart-bed-ces"&gt;at CES&lt;/a&gt;, and this year is no exception. Today, Sleep Number is announcing the latest upgrades to its 360 smart beds, improving some of their built-in sensors and adding on surrounding tech like lights and mobility accessories that it calls “smart furniture.” The idea, according to Sleep Number, is to create more accessible smart beds so that people can age more comfortably or recover from injuries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sruALL"&gt;“Smart furniture” is a new addition that surrounds the 360 smart bed. While it looks like one of those fancy headboards with built-in shelves, Sleep Number says it was built to support sleep health and make its beds more accessible. For example, the smart furniture includes mobility aids to help sleepers who may need extra help entering or exiting the bed. It also features individual audio and noise reduction technology meant to block out environmental noise and has built-in reading lights, charging ports, and storage areas. Lastly, the furniture has ambient lighting designed to help maintain normal circadian rhythms — think amber-colored lighting at night and a dawn simulator in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A render of the smart furniture with descriptions of features like ambient lighting and mobility aids." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wM7kCR0xziZfBTaeNgT6xJkERbU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132478/Sleep_Number_Smart_Furniture__Sept_9_2021__6.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sleep Number&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sleep Number’s new smart furniture.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4VeGSj"&gt;As for the bed itself, this year Sleep Number seems particularly keen to position the 360 bed as a potential healthcare tool — though overall, the updates seem to be focused on refining its smart capabilities rather than introducing groundbreaking new features. Sleep Number says the new 360 bed can continuously monitor a person’s general wellness, sleep health behaviors, chronic sleep issues, and generate real-time insights and suggestions for sleepers, their caregivers, and doctors. It also says that over time, the bed’s AI can identify abnormal events and notify the sleeper that something is off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ul8nTn"&gt;Sleep Number’s always given sleep insights and wellness reports, but the company says its improved sensing capabilities move it closer to a future where it can proactively alert users of oncoming illness and risks for conditions like insomnia, sleep apnea, or cardiac events. To be clear, this does not mean Sleep Number’s beds can diagnose any of these medical conditions right now. That would require FDA clearance and even the most advanced smartwatches aren’t quite there yet, though there is plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535204/apple-watch-fitbit-oura-wearables-illness-prediction"&gt;research being done on that front&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshots of the SleepIQ app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0tIklZgsPLiJn3SRDLmhTe8xu0E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132477/04_Health_Awareness.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sleep Number&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yV7Qq3"&gt;Better accuracy isn’t all that exciting on paper, even though it might be an impressive achievement under the hood. Sleep Number says that it’s used over 12 billion hours of sleep data to “significantly innovate its 360 smart bed.” Aside from software updates, physical updates include small changes like adding “high-tech textiles,” antimicrobial components, and graphite-infused foam that supposedly keeps sleepers cool by encouraging airflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xz0L6v"&gt;In a briefing, Sleep Number also noted that the new 360 smart beds will be able to actively monitor body temperature to create “microclimates,” as well as tilt the bed to improve airflow by elevating the head without sacrificing spinal alignment. For elderly or injured sleepers, Sleep Number also says you can adjust the height to make it easier to get in and out of bed. Again, this isn’t as fun as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/1/8/14195396/sleep-number-360-smart-bed-ces"&gt;foot-warming feature&lt;/a&gt; it introduced in 2017, but greater accessibility and accuracy are always welcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5NODYZ"&gt;The new 360 smart beds will be available starting in 2023, with prices starting at $1,099. The smart furniture will also be available in 2023, but Sleep Number hasn’t yet decided pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rZVDDx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the accessories you’ll need for your new PlayStation 5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tKR_P301-r_RAX5aYlCy2lUGo0Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67755669/vpavic_4278_20201030_0345.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8EKGm6"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; is becoming more available than it once was, but even with the increased frequency of restocks, Sony’s next-gen console remains difficult to find. If you were lucky enough to secure a launch unit or receive a PS5 as a holiday gift, however, picking up a few accessories can help ensure you get the most out of your new console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fonFGm"&gt;From headsets and remotes to M.2 SSDs that allow you to expand your console’s storage capacity — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22664808/ps5-playstation-5-update-m2-ssd-sony-software"&gt;that’s a thing now&lt;/a&gt;, after all — these are just a few PS5 accessories we suggest picking up from the get-go, some of which are now available at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ken Levine’s ambitious new game is reportedly in development hell</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="BioShock Infinite" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j2LbuszK48We3GHnxYWN1FCTfS0=/46x0:1846x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70342948/BioShockTC_Bio1_AndrewRyan_Statue_05.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vjNDOh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt; creative lead Ken Levine is reportedly facing trouble. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-03/bioshock-creator-s-next-game-and-its-narrative-legos-in-turmoil"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s &lt;/em&gt;Jason Schreier&lt;/a&gt;, Levine’s studio Ghost Story Games and its long-awaited debut project have been plagued by shifting design goals and an overambitious vision. It’s not a new criticism of Levine, but it suggests that the game’s nearly eight-year waiting period might not end any time soon and hints at some details about what Ghost Story is actually doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZT9bK"&gt;Schreier’s story indicates that Ghost Story, a division of Take-Two Interactive staffed with former members of Levine’s old studio Irrational, was originally supposed to release a small game in 2017. The project was &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-01-28-ken-levine-teases-new-first-person-sci-fi-project"&gt;a sci-fi shooter&lt;/a&gt; set on a “mysterious space station” where three factions would respond to the player’s actions. (While &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; compares it to &lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt;, the setting sounds similar to Levine’s earlier space horror game &lt;em&gt;System Shock 2&lt;/em&gt;.) But the project’s scope was seemingly bigger than the 30-person team could handle, including a “complicated dialogue system that would morph based on player choices.” As of 2022, the project has apparently been rebooted multiple times and still has no name or release date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XkUmNJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The game has reportedly changed directions multiple times&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3FXblC"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, part of the delay stems from Levine’s mercurial management style and perfectionism. Like &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/3/6/5474722/why-did-irrational-close-bioshock-infinite"&gt;previous reports from his time at Irrational&lt;/a&gt;, it describes a place where projects would get suddenly overhauled or scrapped after months of work. One anecdote describes studio members joking about convincing Levine to adopt their ideas via “Kenception,” a reference to the artificially planted thoughts in Christopher Nolan’s &lt;em&gt;Inception&lt;/em&gt;. An open-ended release timeline has apparently been a double-edged sword, with Levine reportedly saying that the studio’s ongoing budget is a “rounding error” in Take-Two’s operation, which could give its game an indefinitely long development process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYa81y"&gt;But Ghost Story’s core mission also contains some built-in tension. The studio &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/30/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-compares-new-game-to-a-much-more-ambitious-shadow-of-mordor-nemesis-system"&gt;grew alongside&lt;/a&gt; Levine’s &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/3/21/5534258/ken-levine-next-project"&gt;fascination with “narrative Legos,”&lt;/a&gt; his term for the kind of procedurally generated drama produced by &lt;a href="https://www.cbr.com/shadow-mordor-nemesis-system/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor’s&lt;/em&gt; Nemesis system&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/30/22807568/procedural-storytelling-video-games-dwarf-fortress-wildermyth-blaseball"&gt;some recent indie games&lt;/a&gt;. (The &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report also mentions the procedurally generated games &lt;em&gt;Dead Cells&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Void Bastards&lt;/em&gt; as potential influences.) At the same time, it’s apparently been pursuing the feel of a heavily scripted and polished big-budget 3D experience, something that’s difficult to produce with a highly variable story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5q42ZS"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;BioShock&lt;/em&gt; franchise, meanwhile, has proceeded without Levine — although a new installment has also &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/bioshock-4-everything-we-know-about-the-new-bioshock"&gt;been in development&lt;/a&gt; for some time with no release in sight. An unrelated &lt;em&gt;System Shock&lt;/em&gt; sequel has followed an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724301/system-shock-live-action-tv-series-nightdive-binge-streaming-platform"&gt;even more tortured&lt;/a&gt; development roadmap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ImwkMq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;System Shock 2&lt;/em&gt; helped define &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/8/18/12539476/what-makes-an-immersive-sim-and-why-are-they-staging-a-comeback"&gt;the immersive sim&lt;/a&gt;, a genre that gave players a feeling of free choice through versatile but often painstakingly handcrafted systems. It’s a style that feels ripe for an experiment with infinitely generated conflict, especially &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/2013/1/10/3853198/ken-levine-bioshock-infinite-vgas"&gt;paired with Levine’s love&lt;/a&gt; of lofty, clashing philosophical movements. But for now, those clashes are apparently happening inside the studio as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple briefly crossed a $3 trillion market cap</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cUabvvoSkfx96vZLhek6NKJjLLU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70342842/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5VLcZu"&gt;Apple’s market cap briefly passed $3 trillion on Monday more than a year after it surpassed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21375223/apple-2-trillion-market-cap-first-us-company-stock-price"&gt;the $2 trillion mark&lt;/a&gt; and three years after eclipsing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17638764/apple-worlds-first-1-trillion-company-market-cap-stock-price"&gt;$1 trillion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3Hhyj"&gt;Apple’s huge success is due in large part to the iPhone, which revolutionized the smartphone industry and remains a cash cow for the company. But Apple continues to see strong momentum in its other businesses as well, with its services and Mac divisions reporting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751418/apple-q4-2021-earnings-supply-constraints-chip-shortage"&gt;all-time highs in its Q4 2021 earnings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCrPC4"&gt;Shortly after hitting the $3 trillion milestone at around 1:45PM ET, Apple’s market cap dipped below it again. Apple’s market cap must be above the $3 trillion mark when the market closes at 4PM ET for it to officially be designated as the first publicly-traded company with that valuation, and it ended below $3 trillion on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvSXK3"&gt;Apple isn’t the only company in the trillion-dollar club; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/4/17819160/amazon-worth-1-trillion-dollars-stock-price-value%5D"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770569/alphabet-google-market-cap-hits-2-trillion"&gt;Google parent company Alphabet&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/25/18515623/microsoft-worth-1-trillion-dollars-stock-price-value"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22744504/hertz-tesla-order-100000-vehicles-electrify-fleet"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; all have market caps exceeding $1 trillion. (Facebook parent company Meta breached the $1 trillion milestone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/28/22554502/facebook-1-trillion-dollar-market-cap-company-business"&gt;in June&lt;/a&gt; but is currently sitting below it.) In recent years, Apple has also jostled with others for the crown of the world’s most valuable publicly traded company. It passed Saudi Aramco &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21350154/apple-worlds-most-valuable-company-saudi-aramco"&gt;in July 2020&lt;/a&gt;, though it was overtaken for a time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22753251/microsoft-apple-market-cap-business-valuable-company"&gt;by Microsoft in October&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oQ9fq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 3rd, 4:36PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Apple’s market cap ended the day below $3 trillion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla opens showroom in region of China associated with genocide allegations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TE0Uk8LWI1b5BFCI0WWHVN6AJ5k=/0x129:3632x2550/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70342716/1328265762.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by VCG/VCG via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fv50Wp"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-opens-showroom-in-chinas-xinjiang-region-at-center-of-u-s-genocide-allegations-11641214630"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out that on New Year’s Eve, Tesla &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/3615027564/L8A9JyRJy"&gt;revealed on its Weibo page&lt;/a&gt; the launch of a new dealership in Xinjiang, a region where the Chinese government has been accused of human rights violations against Uyghur Muslims. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_bx6b5DSVY4Ugj5H48UjGV5KQSU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142299/tesla_weibo_xinjiang.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Weibo / Tesla&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JpJPcm"&gt;Just over a week ago, President Joe Biden signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, and US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement that “[we] call on the Government of the People’s Republic of China to immediately end genocide and crimes against humanity against the predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and members of other ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DY9ERZ"&gt;Earlier in December, the Treasury Department &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22839970/dji-chinese-military-industrial-complex-investment-blacklist"&gt;sanctioned several Chinese companies for their alleged participation in the abuses&lt;/a&gt;, including drone maker DJI, blocking US investments in the company, and the Biden administration announced plans for a “diplomatic boycott” during the Beijing Winter Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0jmvC"&gt;Now Tesla has a showroom in Urumqi, the region’s capital. The automaker has had an uneven relationship with China’s government for years, including when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/10/17553094/tesla-china-gigafactory-cars-deal-agreement"&gt;signed a deal to open a factory in Shanghai&lt;/a&gt; and at the beginning of 2021, when that factory’s output &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252765/tesla-profit-q4-2020-earnings-elon-musk-record-sales"&gt;helped push Tesla to its first annual profit.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBENPi"&gt;As the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; notes, the US accusations of genocide are based on reports that the Chinese government has imprisoned over 1 million Uyghur people and other minorities in the region, subjugating them with forced labor, surveillance, and population controls. The Chinese government maintains that its “facts and truth on Xinjiang-related issues” refute the allegations and claims that it’s imposed measures like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/21/14682068/china-gps-trackers-xinjiang-uighur-violence"&gt;real-time GPS vehicle tracking&lt;/a&gt; to fight terrorism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8hjpOv"&gt;Other US companies have been linked to the region, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428899/apple-suppliers-china-uyghur-forced-labor-report"&gt;reports that Apple suppliers had used forced labor&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745068/best-buy-home-depot-lorex-ezviz-uyghur-surveillance-sales-dji"&gt;Best Buy and Home Depot&lt;/a&gt; removed security cameras they were selling after the brands were linked to surveillance. Most recently, Intel made a statement that it would not use labor or goods sourced in the region &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/24/22852773/intel-apology-china-xinjiang-labor-goods"&gt;before deleting the post and apologizing on Chinese social media sites&lt;/a&gt;, saying “the paragraph about Xinjiang in the letter is only for expressing the original intention of compliance and legality, not for its intention or position.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qa4WFR"&gt;Tesla dissolved its PR department in 2019 and has not commented on the new location.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An Apple HomeKit bug can send iOS devices into a death spiral </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nTqYAp00NgK0PiuWRv3U86YWtgM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70342714/acastro_190218_1777_apple_streaming_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ia3g4y"&gt;You should always be wary of invites to a stranger’s Home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djTWM3"&gt;That’s the upshot of a new piece of security research that has found a vulnerability capable of locking iOS devices into a spiral of freezing, crashing, and rebooting if a user connects to a sabotaged Apple Home device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8v4KJ"&gt;The vulnerability, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/trevorspiniolas/status/1477185285784051712?s=21"&gt;discovered by security researcher Trevor Spiniolas&lt;/a&gt;, can be exploited through Apple’s &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/homekit/"&gt;HomeKit API&lt;/a&gt;, the software interface that allows an iOS app to control compatible smart home devices. If an attacker creates a HomeKit device with an extremely long name — around 500,000 characters — then an iOS device that connects to it will become unresponsive once it reads the device name and enter a cycle of freezing and rebooting that can only be ended by wiping and restoring the iOS device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="idDwXd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the most likely way to trigger the exploit would be through a spoof Home network&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SRvaRh"&gt;What’s more, since HomeKit device names are backed up to iCloud, signing in to the same iCloud account with a restored device will trigger the crash again, with the cycle continuing until the device owner switches off the option to sync Home devices from iCloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVIby9"&gt;Though it’s possible that an attacker could compromise a user’s existing HomeKit-enabled device, the most likely way the exploit would be triggered is if the attacker created a spoof Home network and tricked a user into joining via a phishing email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kdVMO8"&gt;To guard against the attack, the main precaution for iOS users is to instantly reject any invitations to join an unfamiliar Home network. Additionally, iOS users who currently use smart home devices can protect themselves by entering the Control Center and disabling the setting “Show Home Controls.” (This won’t prevent Home devices from being used but limits which information is accessible through the Control Center.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LHQzpH"&gt;Spiniolas &lt;a href="https://trevorspiniolas.com/doorlock/doorlock.html"&gt;released details on his personal website&lt;/a&gt; on January 1, 2022. He was &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-sg/HT209600"&gt;previously credited by Apple&lt;/a&gt; for discovering a vulnerability in macOS Mojave that was patched in 2019. The new vulnerability affects the latest iOS version, 15.2, and goes back at least as far as 14.7, Spiniolas said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QorAC"&gt;Spiniolas also accused Apple of being slow to respond to the initial disclosure, which was made months before the public release. The researcher shared emails with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that appeared to show an Apple representative acknowledging the issue and requesting Spiniolas refrain from publishing details until early 2022. The blog post detailing the vulnerability claims that Apple was made aware of the issue on August 10, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvC0YM"&gt;“Apple’s lack of transparency is not only frustrating to security researchers who often work for free, it poses a risk to the millions of people who use Apple products in their day-to-day lives by reducing Apple’s accountability on security matters,” Spiniolas wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UWFLY"&gt;Apple had not responded to a request for comment by time of publication.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple selling new AirPods Pro coinciding with the Year of the Tiger in certain markets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3OiCFczPA_I9r0afqJmI7VaxiOk=/0x334:2000x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70342687/MN6U3_AV1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b6AkUG"&gt;Apple is now selling a new set of special edition AirPod Pros (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/01/apple-launches-special-edition-tiger-airpods-pro-for-chinese-new-year/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;via 9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) in time for the Chinese New Year, which begins on February 1st, 2022. Just as the previous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218360/apple-lunar-new-year-ox-airpods-pro-asia"&gt;Year of the Ox&lt;/a&gt;, Apple is engraving a special emoji on the AirPods Pro case — this time, themed for the Year of the Tiger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6XzHM"&gt;At first glance, it seems like only the standard tiger emoji is featured on the case — but turns out, it’s just a bit more snazzy with sparkles and fireworks surrounding the tiger face topped off with a cute tiger growly-face hood. Other than that, the only other difference is the retail box has the same emoji in red on the sides.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/haCVc645ugqdcPA2D9vYCFQrI8M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142021/airpods_tiger.001.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Images from Apple Store website&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New special edition Year of the Tiger AirPods on the left comparing to AirPods Pro with a regular tiger emoji on the right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Tprz5U"&gt;The new Special Edition AirPods Pro - Tiger (the official name) is available to order now in several Asian markets, including Hong Kong (with a heavy backorder until May 1st as of writing), where it retails for HK$1,999 ($256.38 USD). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FCXc4c"&gt;Apple also is &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/4720927805801613"&gt;giving away&lt;/a&gt; free red envelopes with a golden embossing of different Chinese zodiac emojis — all wearing the same tiger hood. It’s a cute addition for those traditionally gifting money for the celebration of the new year but is only available if purchased in an Apple Store that sells the special edition AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0pyp3H"&gt;While people in markets like the US might feel left out — you could just order regular AirPods Pro and get a free tiger emoji engraving... it’s really not that different. The existence of these yearly special editions is perhaps a literal product of courting the Chinese market — a country in which Apple historically has had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21423347/apple-freedom-speech-expression-information-china-censorship-policy"&gt;bend&lt;/a&gt; to stay competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="4WexEA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The four numbers Apple won’t let you engrave on your iPad in China","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632029/apple-engraving-filter-censorship-keyword-china-hong-kong-taiwan"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dxj4xJ"&gt;Apple’s Beats by Dre brand also put out a pair of new Beats Studio Buds — which has a case that is adorned with golden tribal-style tiger stripes on a classic Beats red body. The stripes continue onto the actual buds themselves, unlike the standard-fare buds the special edition AirPods Pro come with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gI7PtC"&gt;

    <title>The secret weapons in Arlo’s new security system are the all-in-one sensors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mPiFT-nC_W2ebJsJQNTaindaDfg=/199x0:5302x3402/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70342629/Keypad_sensors_final_V3.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arlo has announced a new smart home security system.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Arlo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JA3T9P"&gt;Arlo announced the impending arrival of its long-awaited home security system at CES 2022 this week, and the product even got a nod as a 2022 CES Innovation Award honoree. The company, known for its top-quality smart security cameras, also announced its support for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;Matter&lt;/a&gt;, a possible indication that a Matter specification for security cameras isn’t too far away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WHm3yj"&gt;The DIY security monitoring solution is a natural expansion for the company that has a full suite of home security cameras. So natural that it actually &lt;a href="https://blog.bestbuy.ca/smart-home/new-arlo-security-system-announced-at-2019-ces"&gt;announced one at CES 2019&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFXVp5"&gt;While that product never saw the light of day, the latest Arlo Security System is a complete redesign. The signature feature are the new, all-in-one multi-sensors with eight different functions, plus NFC integrated into the hub so users can tap their phone to disarm the system. Arlo says the system will be available to buy in the first half of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1s4yT"&gt;The all-in-one sensors are capable of recognizing motion, door / window openings and tilt, water leaks, light / temperature changes, and they can listen for smoke and CO alarms, says Arlo. Small and lightweight, the multi-sensor is 1.1 inches wide and runs on a battery.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/APGH5m2-dnS2OxvFtuw6-XzSkyI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142188/sensor_V2__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Arlo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arlo’s new security system uses these single multi-sensors to monitor your home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eapCCH"&gt;The sensors go with the Arlo Security System’s “modular hub,” which serves as a central controller and has a built-in siren, smoke / CO alarm sensor, and integrated backlit keypad. It also has NFC technology to enable the tap to arm / disarm feature. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpFFak"&gt;“We engineered the Arlo Security System to not only complete Arlo’s ecosystem but to address pain points common with other solutions on the market,” says Tim Johnston, SVP of product at Arlo. Additionally, Arlo says the system integrates with existing Arlo security cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9CbL8"&gt;However, details on exactly what those integrations will entail were not made available. We also don’t know the price of the system or if you will need to subscribe to Arlo Secure — Arlo’s monthly subscription plan for its cameras that starts at $3 a month. My guess is there will be a fee to use the system, although currently it doesn’t appear there is any professional monitoring option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jyqGn6"&gt;There’s also no word on smart home integrations, but Arlo traditionally has been a very open system, working with SmartThings, Google Home, Amazon Alexa, and Apple HomeKit. I reached out to Arlo with these questions and was told that more information will be available at launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VnPgf3"&gt;While the multi-sensors are an innovative idea and similar to Google's excellent Nest Detect sensors for its now-defunct &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/20/16337562/nest-secure-guard-detect-tag-alarm-home-security-system"&gt;Nest Secure security system&lt;/a&gt;, the downside is likely to be cost. These multi-sensors are often significantly more expensive than the motion and contact sensors used in security systems from competitors such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21215231/ring-alarm-second-generation-update-preorder-features-emergency"&gt;Ring&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/9/7/17828782/security-system-self-installed-easy-installation-set-up"&gt;SimpliSafe&lt;/a&gt;. This means outfitting a typical three-bedroom home with an Arlo Security System could get expensive quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RaqcEA"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="SuCvvN"&gt;Blood tests on pregnant people that look for rare and devastating developmental conditions in fetuses are often wrong, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/01/upshot/pregnancy-birth-genetic-testing.html"&gt;an investigation from &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZqv1z"&gt;The blood testing technology, called noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT), works very well for more common disorders like Down syndrome. But &lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reported that a review of data from multiple studies showed that when NIPT is used to test for uncommon things like Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (which is found in one in 20,000 births) or Cri-du-chat syndrome (which is found in one in 15,000 births), positive results are wrong 80 percent of the time or more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1RhwaG"&gt;These tests, made by companies like Natera and Sequenom, have become more popular in recent years. Estimates of the size of the market approach billions of dollars. Positive results on the tests are supposed to trigger more extensive (and accurate) follow-up testing, but those tests are expensive, invasive, and often can’t be done until it would be too late for a legal abortion. Many patients don’t end up getting those follow-up tests, and some terminate pregnancies based on the initial information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V49HBo"&gt;The investigation highlights the statistical challenge of testing for things that are extremely rare. Even a test that’s highly accurate would still find lots of false positives if it was used on thousands of people to try to find a condition that’s only &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; there .005 percent of the time (like Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome). It’s very difficult to create tests for rare conditions that are so good that they won’t have a high number of false positives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CZnAor"&gt;But, as &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reporting found, that issue wasn’t adequately explained to patients who were sold the tests. Companies developing NIPTs used language like “highly accurate” and “total confidence.” Many companies didn’t publish data on their tests’ performance overall, or only stressed data from tests that are more accurate. “I think the information they provide is misleading,” Alberto Gutierrez, the former director of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) office overseeing medical tests, told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLJVmV"&gt;Many NIPTs don’t have to be cleared or reviewed by the FDA before they’re used for patients — they fall under a category called lab-developed tests, which are able to skirt some regulatory oversight. Despite the lack of scrutiny, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22816112/theranos-lab-developed-test-fda-regulation-everlywell"&gt;they’re able to advertise&lt;/a&gt; to patients and tout the limited data they have in marketing materials, even if it’s misleading.&lt;/p&gt;
