    <title>Archivists are trying to chronicle Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ unforgettable first year</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YYqo6k_xzlJCX05uAyENNx1qmew=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68973836/Switch_ACNH_2020_DecUpdate_SCRN_12_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The challenge of documenting a virtual world&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qxeAKE"&gt;“The serendipity of the time [&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;] came out is ridiculous,” says Lex Roberts, curator of the UK National Videogame Museum’s &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; Diaries. &lt;a href="https://thenvm.org/the-animal-crossing-diaries/"&gt;The project&lt;/a&gt; aims to capture “the cultural phenomenon that followed the release &lt;em&gt;of Animal Crossing &lt;/em&gt;… in March 2020, just as the world was transformed by the pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aTxIBR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; has been inextricably associated with COVID-19, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21179238/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-nintendo-switch-features"&gt;early&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/3/16/21178911/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-nintendo-switch"&gt; reviews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/mar/16/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-nintendo-switch"&gt; making&lt;/a&gt; mention of how much we all needed an escape as lockdowns and quarantines suddenly became our lives. As it became apparent that social distancing would be around for a long time, the game became the location of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/04/02/animal-crossing-wedding-coronavirus/"&gt;weddings&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/1/21309893/animal-crossing-new-horizons-memorials-nintendo-grief"&gt; memorials&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.usgamer.net/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-fast-becoming-a-new-way-for-hong-kong-protesters-to-fight-for-democracy"&gt; protests&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21409727/biden-harris-animal-crossing-campaign-new-horizons-yard-signs-election"&gt;political campaigning&lt;/a&gt;, to name just a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0rHgL"&gt;But it’s not possible to experience the same &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; as the one everyone was playing in the spring of 2020. “You can’t play the game and understand how people used it and what the experience of playing it in the [early days of the] pandemic was,” says Roberts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FoHTmv"&gt;Kelsey Lewin, co-director of the Video Game History Foundation, notes that the social experience has changed as people have moved on. “[Early on], a co-worker from six years ago just kind of randomly wandered into my town, because everyone was playing and my gates were open,” she says. “If you were to just randomly show up unannounced to someone’s island [now], it’s not going to be taken in the same way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WpOF3F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What’s important for the future is making sure that we have some kind of record.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5nXmmx"&gt;“What’s important for the future is making sure that we have some kind of record of what the game was like in these moments of time,” she says. That’s what the National Videogame Museum is aiming for, and that requires more than just being able to access a Nintendo Switch and a game cartridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ml6OAd"&gt;“It’s something that we’ve wanted to do at the Museum for a little while,” says its marketing and communications lead Conor Clarke. “A lot of video game history and preservation looks at the technological advancement of games and doesn’t really cast too much of an eye at the cultural history around games.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dCpl4D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ first year: a timeline","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22327659/animal-crossing-new-horizons-first-year-timeline-events-holidays"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xa_izrbSL6pclindWc87_YY4WBg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22356313/Switch_ACNH_OctUpdate_screenshot__1_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9pJzS"&gt;The serendipity of &lt;em&gt;New Horizons’&lt;/em&gt; release date was their opportunity to try something new. The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation, a grant-making charity, asked for cultural heritage organizations to “collect the history as it’s happening,” says Clarke, and the museum’s application to use the game for that purpose was successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0o0SVl"&gt;“Playing a game is not necessarily the best way of understanding a game,” says Roberts. Instead, the open call asks for whatever kind of data volunteers might want to offer up. “We’ve had … audio recordings, we’ve had video recordings of people speaking to camera, we’ve had people writing diary entries of their experience, photo diaries of ‘this is the progression of my island over the last year.’ We’ve had some really interesting essays of people really reflecting on their experience and things that have happened.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0hdbcc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Playing a game is not necessarily the best way of understanding a game.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WkkMY8"&gt;Lewin and Roberts both emphasize the value of paying attention to the ordinary within the turbulence of 2020. “It’s really important that we were able to capture the protests and all of the huge pandemic-related events … that have been expressed in &lt;em&gt;AC&lt;/em&gt;, but also the everyday. We’re really keen to not miss out on those everyday experiences like the date nights and hanging out with friends,” says Roberts. They give an example of an entry where the person’s Joy-Con had broken, meaning they started playing on the television while in lockdown with their family. “It meant that their family started to see what they were doing … and the parents got really into it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTdMJ4"&gt;“There’s so much more than what gets reported on happening that is still very meaningful,” says Lewin. “What’s going to be important is that we’ve documented what it was like to play … what was going on at the time, what was the context, what was the community interested in and talking about, and what were the social dynamics that were going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3u2jN"&gt;This is something that in some ways is easier today than it used to be. “Because people weren’t interviewing children on playgrounds back then, if you’re talking about a game from the ‘80s or something, [magazines] are really all we have,” says Lewin. “But Twitter is the new playground discussion, right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOtV8J"&gt;This is, at least in part, what digital humanities aims to explore, though scholars Quinn Dombrowski and Liz Grumbach say a complete definition is evasive. “If we put it in our own words then as many people will disagree as agree,” laughs Dombrowski, who works in the department of literatures, cultures, and languages at Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjgClq"&gt;Grumbach, who leads the Digital Humanities Initiative at Arizona State University, obligingly gives it her best shot. “What I usually say is that it is either using digital tools to explore something that humanists would research or it is using humanities methodologies to explore the digital… or it is both at the same time. And when it’s both at the same time is when it’s really, really cool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/63V54szpWiqXqHvYjBCGxlFpMes=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22356316/Switch_ACNH_SummerUpdate_02_2020_screen_06_copy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eGGcjH"&gt;The two have been running &lt;a href="https://digitalhumanities.stanford.edu/acndh"&gt;a series of lightning talks&lt;/a&gt; where other scholars in the digital humanities have been invited to speak from within Dombrowski’s &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; island. Attendees can either visit in the game or watch &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/acndighum"&gt;on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. Though the talks typically aren’t about &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing &lt;/em&gt;itself, they have some insight into why it might have become so popular especially during the early months of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e93xny"&gt;“I think what &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; does so well is that it captures the feeling of travel in a time where we cannot travel to see the people that we care about,” says Grumbach. She and Dombrowski are old friends, and they discovered that playing &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing &lt;/em&gt;“feels like we’re hanging out,” in a way that’s more personable than a voice or video call, or even other virtual spaces that try to simulate physical ones, like &lt;a href="https://gather.town/"&gt;Gather&lt;/a&gt;. The island setting helps; Grumbach calls it a “really joyful environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kdgZUQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Video games are a really difficult topic to exhibit!”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Zza2O"&gt;“One of the things that I like about &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; compared to some of those other platforms is the fact that it’s personal,” adds Dombrowski. “When you go to someone’s island, this is something that they’ve spent a lot of time putting together just the way they like it … and you can water their plants for them, and their physical digital presence is something where they’ve customized the way they look.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JW7ry"&gt;The idea of putting together a COVID archive was a popular one in the digital humanities last March. Though Grumbach and Dombrowski do caution that there are potential ethical considerations around asking people to process these events while simultaneously sharing them for analysis and consumption, the former highlighted Arizona State’s &lt;a href="https://covid-19archive.org/s/archive/page/welcome"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the Plague Year&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and the latter has also written some of &lt;a href="https://epoiesen.library.carleton.ca/2020/10/30/classicist-in-disguise-response2/"&gt;their own thoughts&lt;/a&gt; about playing &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZanOCv"&gt;Coming up on the anniversary, museum researchers are beginning to think about what kind of exhibition they’ll put together with the data they’ve  gathered. “We tried really, really hard when we opened this project up not to make assumptions about what people would submit, so we haven’t planned the exhibition,” says Roberts. “So that’s a really exciting next stage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x5ny9icFiTCrxCtrB3p8f_plaHU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22356321/Switch_ACNH_SummerUpdate_screen_15_copy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NWcehH"&gt;They’ve been considering themes as submissions roll in, mentioning examples like &lt;a href="https://thenvm.org/the-animal-crossing-diaries/"&gt;a recent collection&lt;/a&gt; on love they put together for Valentine’s Day, people expressing creativity through filmmaking and comics, as well as how people have formed relationships with the non-playable villagers in the game. And, echoing Dombrowski and Grumbach, they note that many submissions appear to view &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; as a specific place in a way that other social games, like &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt;, wouldn’t be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7uS3DV"&gt;The museum hopes that this will be a springboard for more cultural history projects in the future. “We’re constantly looking at … different ways of exhibiting games history,” says Clarke. “We’re constantly trying to innovate and try new things there because it’s a really interesting topic. Video games are a really difficult topic to exhibit!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0evdr"&gt;“You just have to think about: what is going to be important to know about this game in 100 years? What is it that we want to keep? And not an easy question to answer,” Lewin says. “But if we want to do a good job of actually preserving video game history, those are the questions we need to be asking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="UGOJMu"&gt;“I think it’s imperative to be gathering and collecting all of this stuff now before we’re trying to scramble and find it and pick up the pieces later.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram will no longer let adults message teens who don’t follow them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yJ7fRIGlhlH0WLsp9vBZZW9PdXc=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68973775/Adult_Minor_Restrictions_in_DM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adults are now unable to message teenage users that don’t follow them. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XFFOMq"&gt;Instagram is introducing &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/continuing-to-make-instagram-safer-for-the-youngest-members-of-our-community"&gt;new policies&lt;/a&gt; limiting interactions between teenagers and adults to make its platform safer for young users. The app has banned adults from direct messaging teenagers who don’t follow them and is introducing “safety prompts” that will be shown to teens when they DM adults who have been “exhibiting potentially suspicious behavior.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLhMMJ"&gt;Safety prompts will give teenage users the option to report or block adults who are messaging them. The prompts will remind young users not to feel pressured to respond to messages and to “be careful sharing photos, videos, or information with someone you don’t know.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zOyX4k"&gt;Notices will appear when Instagram’s moderation systems spot suspicious behavior from adult users. The company is not sharing detail on how these systems operate but says such suspicious behavior could include sending “a large amount of friend or message requests to people under 18.” The Facebook-owned Instagram says this feature will be available in some countries this month (it did not specify which) and available globally “soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zW8IVUrPbDm-7zEMnJJFOeKL-io=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374236/Safety_Notices.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New safety prompts will appear when teens DM adults who have exhibited “suspicious behavior.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yC4xLU"&gt;Instagram also says it’s developing new “artificial intelligence and machine learning technology” to try and detect someone’s age when they sign up for an account. Officially, the app requires that users are aged 13 and above, but it’s easy to lie about one’s age. The company said it wants to do “more to stop this from happening” but did not go into any detail about how new machine learning systems might help with this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJEOFp"&gt;New teenage users who sign up to Instagram will also now be encouraged to make their profile private. If they choose to create a public account anyway, Instagram will send them a notification later “highlighting the benefits of a private account and reminding them to check their settings.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZtFnTx-S7vxgqAPTklAe3FeOsFE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374240/Teen_Privacy_Experience.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Teen users will be encouraged to make their account private when signing up to Instagram. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>The Kensington StudioDock turns your iPad into a tiny iMac</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;“What’s a computer?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ghkmHd"&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/7/18656227/apple-ipad-pro-11-12-9-keyboard-test-review-logitech-brydge-zagg-price-specs-features"&gt;a lot of iPad keyboard cases&lt;/a&gt; out there that aim to turn Apple’s tablet into a laptop, but the Kensington StudioDock is something altogether different: it turns your iPad Pro into the world’s tiniest iMac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAAebO"&gt;This is a serious accessory for people who are serious about iPad productivity. (Yes, they exist.) It’s a dock that lets you use your USB-C-equipped iPad Pro or Air in portrait or landscape orientation while giving it a whole lot more connectivity. Basically, if you ever sit down and work at your desk with an iPad Pro, the StudioDock could be for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHOLt9"&gt;Well, if you’re happy to spend $399, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AHI3wd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10394868"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="eECvZe"&gt;The StudioDock is mostly made from aluminum and is sturdy enough that you can adjust the iPad’s position without it moving on your desk, making it easy to switch between portrait and landscape modes or tilt the vertical viewing angle. (An iPad Pro in a StudioDock in portrait mode is a great Zoom device, for example.) The build quality of the stand itself is solid, though the plastic back panel does feel a little low rent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4A7BDm"&gt;On one side of the dock you’ll find a USB-C port and a power button, while the other has an SD card slot and a headphone jack. Around back there’s a barrel connector for power, three USB-A ports, an HDMI port, and a Gigabit Ethernet port. There are also two 7.5W Qi wireless chargers integrated into the stand’s base, and (of course) two Kensington security locks. The iPad Pro connects over USB-C and slots onto a magnetic plastic panel that helps support the jack; the dock is available for 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPads, though the size of the magnetic panel is the only thing that’s different between the two versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l90EFQ"&gt;Once your iPad is connected with a keyboard and trackpad or mouse hooked up, it’s like having a little desktop computer with a touchscreen — and way more ports than most Mac laptops these days. It’s really quite adorable, if you find things like the idea of wired internet connectivity on a tablet adorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/87CwfWp9cCdOiHKqtXsAOJ8YXpY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374202/DSCF7585.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="IE7OZS"&gt;Even if you aren’t using a bunch of accessories, the StudioDock is more comfortable to use at a desk than a laptop simply because it raises the display to a better angle. I’m reminded of a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Fcover-story%2Fcover-story-2020-12-07&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22333551%2Fkensington-studiodock-review-ipad-desktop-dock-accessory" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recent &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; cover&lt;/a&gt; showing a woman at home with her laptop precariously perched on a pile of books. Laptop stands exist, obviously, but not everyone wants to use them, and I like that the StudioDock means you’re not stuck with a redundant keyboard and trackpad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j8BXIQ"&gt;A crucial element of this product is that it’s easy enough to move the iPad to and from the dock. It’s still slightly fiddly and in a perfect world I’d want the StudioDock to use the Smart Connector, but since no-one other than Apple and Logitech has ever released products that actually do use it, I assume Kensington had its reasons — bandwidth no doubt among them. One benefit of this design is that it charges the iPad very quickly at 37.5W, so I haven’t had to think about charging it any other way at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9r4I7l"&gt;Kensington also sent an Apple Watch charger that attaches to the USB-C passthrough port. It’ll be sold separately after the StudioDock is released. I found it a little plasticky, like the dock’s back panel, but it worked fine. I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22265910/belkin-magsafe-3-in-1-wireless-charger-hands-on-iphone-12-watch"&gt;already make use of an Apple Watch desktop charger&lt;/a&gt; every day so I didn’t see much need for this, but if you don’t yet have one then this would be a convenient add-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QFBgmNRbM6vffKbJp5K7g7YuuRs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374205/DSCF7586.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="NmSN6a"&gt;The wireless chargers, meanwhile, are also a nice addition. You won’t get the fastest speeds out of them, but the ability to charge a phone and AirPods throughout the day is useful and saves space on your desk compared to separate pads. I did notice a slight coil whine noise when devices were fully charged — this isn’t all that uncommon with wireless chargers, but not all of them do it, so it’s worth noting that this one does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rA7rle"&gt;The StudioDock’s HDMI port supports 4K monitors at 60Hz and should be ideal for iPad dual-display setups, but the software isn’t really there yet on Apple’s part. Only a few apps let you show different content on each monitor — the rest of the time you’re dealing with a pillarboxed mirror of your iPad’s 4:3 screen. (One clever way to get around this is an app called &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shiftscreen/id1498683180?itsct=apps_box&amp;amp;itscg=30200&amp;amp;at=1001l7uV&amp;amp;ct=TheVerge&amp;amp;ls=1"&gt;Shiftscreen&lt;/a&gt;, which is basically a browser that lets you run up to four web apps across two displays — useful for things like multitasking in Slack and Asana.) I’d personally need iPadOS to get much better external monitor support before I went all-in on an iPad desktop setup, but if you’re used to using a laptop by itself, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro should be big enough for most tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSp4Yn"&gt;That’s how I used the StudioDock most of the time, and it was generally a great experience. I really like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;trackpad support&lt;/a&gt; that was added to iPadOS last year, and it’s great to be able to combine that with a wired mechanical keyboard and still have a ton of connectivity options. I will just say that I would generally rather use the StudioDock than a laptop balanced on a pile of books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mnf80AHI0WGnv6HvUWzdjaaAKAM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374204/DSCF7588.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="IxUsrk"&gt;The StudioDock is plainly a niche product, and it does have its quirks. But for the most part, Kensington’s attempt to morph the iPad into a desktop computer actually works. You’d have to be really into the iPad-as-work-machine lifestyle for this to make sense for you, but the StudioDock and iPad Pro combination is a fast, fun computer that does most of what I want it to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvMfxK"&gt;My biggest hangup is the price. It &lt;a href="https://store.kensington.com/products/studiodock%E2%84%A2-ipad-docking-station?utm_source=ktg&amp;amp;utm_medium=landing_page_CTA&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ktg_to_store"&gt;costs&lt;/a&gt; $399.99 for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro version, or $379.99 for a model that fits the 11-inch iPad Pro and the 10.9-inch iPad Air. That’s clearly a lot of money to invest into a third-party peripheral — it’s more than some iPads cost alone. And I’d worry about whether it’d work with any future iPad Pro designs, considering the current Pros haven’t had a significant update since their introduction in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="QBqSRH"&gt;Those are some pretty big caveats, but if you can get over them, the StudioDock is a great way to work on an iPad. It turns the tablet into a more comfortable, capable, and flexible computer, and I just hope Apple’s software evolves to make this kind of use case even better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia confirms it accidentally unlocked RTX 3060 Ethereum mining</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HKLoOG"&gt;Nvidia made a big deal about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289154/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency"&gt;reducing the hash rate of Ethereum mining&lt;/a&gt; on its new RTX 3060 graphics card last month. A special system was supposed to make the RTX 3060 undesirable for cryptominers, but Nvidia has now confirmed that it has accidentally unlocked those restrictions with a new driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UuV5dd"&gt;“A developer driver inadvertently included code used for internal development which removes the hash rate limiter on RTX 3060 in some configurations,” says an Nvidia spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The driver has been removed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adeddj"&gt;While Nvidia has now removed the driver, the genie is out of the bottle. Nvidia’s latest 470.05 beta driver &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331537/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-cryptocurrency-mining"&gt;automatically unlocks performance for most RTX 3060 cards&lt;/a&gt;, boosting hashing rates for Ethereum mining. Mirrors of the driver can easily be found online, and Nvidia won’t be able to prevent RTX 3060 owners from continuing to use this driver in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="depzAx"&gt;Nvidia originally restricted RTX 3060 mining performance in an attempt to steer cryptominers away from purchasing the cards. The GPU maker seemed confident that its restrictions couldn’t be defeated, even claiming it wasn’t just a driver holding back performance. “It’s not just a driver thing,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bdelrizzo/status/1362619264423747590"&gt;said Bryan Del Rizzo&lt;/a&gt;, Nvidia’s head of communications, last month. “There is a secure handshake between the driver, the RTX 3060 silicon, and the BIOS (firmware) that prevents removal of the hash rate limiter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UyEI7R"&gt;Nvidia clearly wasn’t expecting to release a driver that would accidentally unlock its own restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2e0zF8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California bans ‘dark patterns’ that trick users into giving away their personal data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dark Patterns" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z0jHw7iZ1zVaumlo4n_S6R8-PNA=/34x0:1066x688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68973341/ui_static.1419979789.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Patterns put obstacles between the user and what they want to achieve. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M8ngF3"&gt;If you’ve ever struggled through a maze of online customer service to cancel a subscription or delete an account, you’ve likely encountered “dark patterns” — user interfaces that are designed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/8/29/4640308/dark-patterns-inside-the-interfaces-designed-to-trick-you"&gt;trick and frustrate users&lt;/a&gt;. The concept was coined in 2010 but is slowly being addressed in US legislation, with California this week announcing that it is banning the use of dark patterns that stop users from opting out of the sale of their personal data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QWs3Am"&gt;The updated regulation strengthens enforcement of the 2018 California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), one of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17509720/california-consumer-privacy-act-legislation-law-vote"&gt;toughest consumer privacy laws&lt;/a&gt; in the US. The CCPA gives Californians the right “to say no to the sale of personal information,” but the state government is evidently worried that these options will be buried under byzantine menus. By banning dark patterns, California will “ensure that consumers will not be confused or misled when seeking to exercise their data privacy rights,” said the state’s Attorney General Xavier Becerra in a &lt;a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-becerra-announces-approval-additional-regulations-empower-data"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3jyf2"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://oag.ca.gov/system/files/attachments/press-docs/CCPA%20March%2015%20Regs.pdf"&gt;newly-approved regulation&lt;/a&gt; does not ban all uses of dark patterns, only those that have “the substantial effect of subverting or impairing a consumer’s choice to opt-out” of schemes where their personal data is being sold. The regulation offers a number of examples of such dark patterns, including: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="1V19Rp"&gt;Using confusing language like double-negatives (eg “Don’t Not Sell My Personal Information”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="smno7K"&gt;Forcing users to “click through or listen to reasons why they should not submit a request to opt-out before confirming their request.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ldxQFG"&gt;Requiring users to “search or scroll through the text of a privacy policy or similar document or webpage to locate the mechanism for submitting a request to opt-out.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/plhD1aLRe7fmr0Xsu0bQx93mVYM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374182/california_privacy_opt_out_button.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: California Office of Administrative Law&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The “Privacy Options Opt-Out Icon.”&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3EHp41"&gt;Businesses found not to be in compliance with the CCPA are sent a “notice to cure,” giving them a 30-day window to amend their services. According to Becerra’s office: “Since CCPA enforcement began on July 1, 2020, the Department has seen widespread compliance by companies doing business in California, especially in response to notices to cure.” To help standardize access to these opt-out schemes, the state of California has even designed what it calls an “eye-catching” icon that companies can use to direct users to exercise their rights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LuY1Li"&gt;Although this legislation only bans dark patterns in specific scenarios, there have been other attempts to crack down on such deceptive design more generally. In 2019, Sens. Mark Warner (D-VA) and Deb Fischer (R-NE) introduced a bill that would ban internet platforms with more than 100 million users from using any dark patterns that trick users into handing over personal data. The bill, though, &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/s1084"&gt;never&lt;/a&gt; received a vote in congress. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite season 6 adds animals, crafting, Lara Croft, and Neymar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H7LZ9-UMaP51_HPSjGPcWlW2WEY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68973192/EN_16BR_Social_KeyArt_Social.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lHr4lM"&gt;A new season of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is upon us, and the latest digs even deeper into the battle royale’s reality-spanning narrative. Today, Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/chapter-2-season-6"&gt;officially launched season 6&lt;/a&gt; of the game’s second chapter, which is dubbed “Primal.” It takes place directly after the “Zero Crisis Finale” that concluded season 5 and introduces a new prehistoric biome to the island.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utJYvp"&gt;When players start playing the season for the first time, they’ll be greeted with a quick cinematic — which you can watch below — following a short-yet-intense single-player adventure where you help Agent Jonesy attempt to save reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7g3viH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xNWaHd8tj2E?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="534lll"&gt;That new setting includes a towering spire in the center of the island — right where the zero point explosion from season 5 took place — which is surrounded by a village and other new locations, replacing the alien desert from last season. Perhaps more significant is that animals now roam the island, including everything from wolves and wild boar to seemingly more harmless creatures like chicken and frogs. Along with this is a new crafting mechanic that lets players build makeshift weapons, like new bows, from hunted wildlife and discarded technology.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UtR0Rz2Wl9hhBkOIaxnsp1GWbqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374161/EN_CH2S06_MiniMap_1080x1080.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zj3oyB"&gt;Additionally, those who pick up the battle pass can expect the usual assortment of new character skins and other cosmetic items to unlock. This time around that includes characters connected to the ongoing story, like Agent Jones, as well as someone called the “Spire Assassin,” and Raz, described as “seeker of The Spire’s mysteries.” Of course, it wouldn’t be &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; without licensed tie-ins. This season those come in the form of Lara Croft from &lt;em&gt;Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt;, Raven from &lt;em&gt;Teen Titans,&lt;/em&gt; and, at some point in the future, Brazilian soccer star Neymar (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/14/22330003/epic-games-fortnite-brazilian-soccer-star-neymar"&gt;as expected&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPj7oS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s previous season &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21831926/fortnite-chapter-2-season-5-battle-pass-trailer-mandalorian-baby-yoda"&gt;started last December&lt;/a&gt;, and it similarly began with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21831926/fortnite-chapter-2-season-5-battle-pass-trailer-mandalorian-baby-yoda"&gt;an impressive live event that capped off its Marvel-themed storyline&lt;/a&gt; — which turned out to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21921491/fortnite-galactus-live-event-player-count"&gt;the game’s biggest event to date&lt;/a&gt;. However, season 5 will likely be best-remembered for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;the sheer number of licensed tie-ins&lt;/a&gt;, spanning everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22028767/the-mandalorian-fortnite-perfect-character-season-5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22231705/fortnite-soccer-skins-manchester-city-juventus-ac-milan-faze-clan"&gt;professional sports&lt;/a&gt;. Those looking to dig a bit deeper into the ever-evolving &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; lore can also check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303107/batman-fortnite-comic-crossover-epic-games-dc-launch-date"&gt;an upcoming Batman crossover comic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s new gaming-focused earbuds play nicely with USB-C devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Logitech G333" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qs4TEudqlmI2HdwuR4VNSEeNgAg=/0x0:5851x3901/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68973117/g333lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Logitech&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DCXyKb"&gt;Logitech’s latest earbuds, a $50 model called the G333, are unremarkable in terms of design, with a flat cable that houses an inline remote and mic, swappable silicone ear tips, and the ability to connect to gadgets via a 3.5mm jack. What makes them stand out is the included 3.5mm-to-USB-C adapter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D3X2Wu"&gt;If your phone or other audio device lacks a headphone jack but has a USB-C port to spare, you’re all set to plug in with this model. With the adapter attached, I had no issues hooking up the G333 to my 3.5mm-less Pixel 3, my Nintendo Switch, or through a USB-C port on the MacBook Pro I use for work. Also included with these earbuds are two additional sizes of silicone ear tips and a small mesh carrying case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CWFwqz"&gt;The G333 looks almost identical to Logitech’s other two gaming earbuds: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439854/logitech-g-pro-g333-headphones-earbuds-gaming-headset-oculus-quest-2-ready-vr"&gt;$50 G333 VR&lt;/a&gt; headphones (which are certified for the Oculus Quest 2) and the $50 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21494174/astro-a03-in-ear-headphones-monitor-earbuds-gaming-nintendo-switch-pc-chat-playstation-xbox"&gt;Astro A03 earbuds&lt;/a&gt;. The added value here is the USB-C adapter, which is included for the same price. So if you’re trying to decide between them, the new G333 are the most feature-packed for the price.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Logitech G333" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mWh30fUSjC_OyU5wAm_Gqo2_1VI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22371741/logitechg333product.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Each set of Logitech’s G333 includes a 3.5mm-to-USB-C adapter, swappable ear tips, and a small mesh carrying case.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wXcQXd"&gt;The G333 earbuds seem to have the same dual dynamic drivers as those aforementioned models, and their overall performance was similar in my testing. If you aren’t expecting much (considering the price), I think you’ll be impressed with their sound quality. There’s plenty of bass, but it doesn’t muddle the sound. My biggest nitpick against them is that the silicone ear tips don’t always want to stay in my ears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYNch5"&gt;Logitech’s new earbuds will be available in three colorways: black with blue details, dark purple with neon yellow detailing, and lastly, silver with light purple detailing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new Windows 10 update fixes the issue where some printers would crash computers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eRO4bUWP7qvp51rf_hEI5vxMJ3w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68971939/acastro_180226_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yoajye"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/march-15-2021-kb5001566-os-build-18363-1441-out-of-band-23c4c824-8638-43e9-a381-ff58213ae6fe"&gt;is fixing&lt;/a&gt; the issue where trying to use certain printers would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22326083/windows-10-security-update-bug-printer-crash-kyocera-ricoh-zebra-microsoft"&gt;freak out your Windows 10 computer and cause it to blue screen&lt;/a&gt;. If you (or your IT department) have been dealing with the issue, today’s update should let you get back to printing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qs4Asm"&gt;In the update notes, Microsoft says that the issue only affected “certain printers using some apps,” but doesn't clarify which. It seemed to impact some printers from Kyocera, Ricoh, and Zebra, and if you owned one it’s the type of error that would be extremely annoying — or worse, workflow-breaking, if printing’s a need and not something you just do occasionally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BgvLuh"&gt;If this issue has been affecting you, you can download the update by going to Settings &amp;gt; Update &amp;amp; Security &amp;gt; Windows Update, and clicking Check for Updates. Hopefully, after updating, your printer and computer can go back to being friends again. May the ink once again meet the paper, and your computer not have to be rebooted from a hard crash.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GitHub employee fired for saying ‘Nazi’ in Slack declines to take his job back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Agrees To Buy Coding Site GitHub For $7.5 Billion" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R0fRiL5OtMfm0DKvxsoBBL4FoTo=/0x2:3000x2002/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68971773/967228286.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HNb7dZ"&gt;A Jewish GitHub employee who was fired for warning co-workers in Slack to stay safe from Nazis during the January 6th attack on the US Capitol has declined to take his job back after an offer from the company, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/15/fired-github-employee-reaches-amicable-resolution-with-company/"&gt;GitHub told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dw8KWM"&gt;“We offered the employee his job back immediately after reviewing the investigation findings, and he declined,” a GitHub spokesperson said to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. GitHub shared the same statement with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S88vtj"&gt;“Me and the company reached an amicable resolution,” the employee said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;. “I appreciate that they have denounced white supremacy and the dangers it poses to everybody.” The terms of the resolution are unclear, but the employee had “previously told me he was seeking damages or some other form of reconciliation,” &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzA3PY"&gt;GitHub fired the employee two days after he wrote “stay safe homies, Nazis are about” to colleagues in Slack on January 6th, as &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-github-backlash-jewish-employee-termination-2021-1"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Approximately 200 of the company’s 1,700 employees signed an open letter asking the company for an explanation, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232766/github-employees-protest-jewish-employee-firing-warn-nazi"&gt;employees began using the word “Nazi” in Slack&lt;/a&gt; to describe the Capitol rioters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jknQFR"&gt;Following an independent investigation, GitHub CEO Nat Friedman admitted that “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/17/22235913/github-significant-mistakes-were-made-firing-jewish-employee-nazis"&gt;significant mistakes were made&lt;/a&gt;” in an internal message to employees on January 16th, and the company offered the employee his job back. The company’s head of HR also resigned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="24kowd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update March 15th, 8:10PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added that GitHub shared a statement with &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
