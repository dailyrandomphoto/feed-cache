    <title>Google still ran ads on climate denial, despite promising to stop </title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0Z5FjQ"&gt;Google has struggled to uphold its recent &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11221321"&gt;pledge&lt;/a&gt; to stop running ads on content that promotes climate change denial, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.counterhate.com/post/google-ads-still-serving-climate-change-deniers"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the nonprofit Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T49mE6"&gt;The new research identified 50 articles that include lies about climate change and that still featured Google ads after the date that Google said they would be banned. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22715102/google-youtube-climate-change-deniers-ads-monetization"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a new &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/11221321"&gt;policy&lt;/a&gt; in October that prohibits “ads for, and monetization of, content that contradicts well-established scientific consensus around the existence and causes of climate change.” The new policy was supposed to kick in for Google advertisers, publishers, and YouTube creators on &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/publisherpolicies/answer/10852414?hl=en-GB"&gt;November 9th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GI1IiH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They have not followed through with real action”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WZVFkq"&gt;“In making their initial announcement, Google appears to recognise that they have played a part in making climate change denial a profitable business, and yet they have not followed through with real action,” Imran Ahmed, chief executive of the Center for Countering Digital Hate, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1sE21"&gt;In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Google communications and public affairs manager Michael Aciman said the company “reviewed the pages shared with us and have taken appropriate enforcement actions.” Google says it removed ads from a majority of the URLs because they violated the company’s climate change policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5CzBKB"&gt;One &lt;em&gt;Breitbart&lt;/em&gt; article on CCDH’s list calls global warming a hoax. Another article by conservative website &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/us/western-journal-highlights.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Western Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; falsely claims “whether the climate is changing — and whether it is caused by man — are questions not answered definitively.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Scientists agree that human activity has already heated up the planet by &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/2020-was-one-of-three-warmest-years-record"&gt;more than a degree&lt;/a&gt; Celsius, which is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;driving more extreme weather&lt;/a&gt; and triggering other threats across the globe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BGtktD"&gt;The new report follows another &lt;a href="https://www.counterhate.com/_files/ugd/f4d9b9_2da34b078cbe43b6820297e3a3113f69.pdf"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published in November by CCDH that traced nearly 70 percent of all interactions with climate denial content on Facebook back to just 10 “fringe” publishers. Many of those publishers carried Google ads, which CCDH estimates earned Google $1.7 million in revenue over six months this year. Five of those publishers, including &lt;em&gt;Breitbart&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Western Journal&lt;/em&gt;, showed up once again on the organization’s new tally of climate denial content that featured Google ads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8OoDg"&gt;Facebook has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763795/facebook-climate-denial-worse-study"&gt;come under fire&lt;/a&gt; by activists for not stopping the spread of climate misinformation on its platform. But unlike Google, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763795/facebook-climate-denial-worse-study"&gt;Facebook maintained that the posts&lt;/a&gt; activists flagged as misleading were “posts these groups disagree with politically” and did not violate their policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EUxkve"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles are available at Target (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/npvAfNtlaJPFSveh-zpJlohFcIU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70280624/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zg3za0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 8:30AM ET, December 16th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Target has sold out of consoles for now. This one went fast, but we hope you had some luck on your side.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4wg1Wx"&gt;Look, nobody is happy about the current state of new consoles and their availability. While the hunt for a good deal is something we’re all about, having to search just to find a normal, full-price product is a whole lot less fun. That’s why we are always doing our best to help you score a new console whenever the chance arises, and today is no different.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTEqZK"&gt;Target’s online listings for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X have just gone live, which means there is a narrow window to order one this morning. The &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-console%2F-%2FA-81114595&amp;amp;subid1=vergeps5restock"&gt;PlayStation 5 is available in the standard $499.99&lt;/a&gt; flavor with a disc drive as well as the &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fplaystation-5-digital-edition-console%2F-%2FA-81114596&amp;amp;subid1=vergeps5restock"&gt;Digital Edition for $399.99&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x-console%2F-%2FA-80790841&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Xbox Series X is also available for its usual $499.99&lt;/a&gt;. The listings show sold out to start, but the early bird (hopefully) gets the worm so be prepared to hit refresh. Target usually populates its stock of consoles for local store pickup within the hour of the pages going live, and the ones with the most persistence are usually the ones rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AtWKoC"&gt;Be sure to log in to your Target account in advance, with all your account info — billing and shipping — sorted ahead of time. You might also want to consider trying both a desktop browser and Target’s mobile app at the same time. Target often bases their console sales around in-store pickup, so it helps to set your favorite store near you, though be prepared to widen your search to more stores if the availability dwindles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J6XL6g"&gt;If you’re out of luck on this one, be sure to stay tuned to Verge Deals for more info on future console restocks, and be sure to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;subscribe to our newsletter&lt;/a&gt; for your regularly scheduled tech deal savings.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s P50 Pocket is a stylish clamshell foldable launching this month</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T6aRiNRkhbtH8SI2cHbl8CHI_Vk=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70280496/001RBNXygy1gxfadt3cfyj61hc0u07ee02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The P50 Pocket appears to have a small external circular screen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Harper’s Bazaar China&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0qbOuv"&gt;Huawei is set to announce a new foldable phone later this month called the Huawei P50 Pocket, according to a post on the company’s &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4714230723379666"&gt;official Weibo account&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike its previous Mate X foldables, which fold from a device the size of a tablet into a smartphone, the P50 Pocket has a clamshell design that folds out to the size of a smartphone. It’s a similar design to Samsung’s Z Flip devices, or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;Motorola Razr&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="seNxZo"&gt;A &lt;em&gt;Harper’s Bazaar China&lt;/em&gt; photoshoot of the P50 Pocket &lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/status/L6h3qlP5V"&gt;posted on Weibo&lt;/a&gt; makes it look like a stylish little foldable. It appears to have a similar dual-ring camera bump to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22598135/huawei-p50-china-release-date-price-news-features-specs-cameras"&gt;Huawei P50&lt;/a&gt;, but its lower ring has been repurposed to work as a small external screen, which appears to be able to show notifications or work as a camera viewfinder.  &lt;a href="https://chinese.engadget.com/huawei-p50-pocket-harper-s-bazaar-teaser-062427696.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Engadget China &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that the phone has a side-mounted fingerprint sensor for security, and available colors include silver and gold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CHx8kttYuRFP1szeWEDe4IcW4o8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100949/001RBNXygy1gxfat5sa7jj60u01400xc02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Harper’s Bazaar China&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h-wP6CpbfxKSh99T9kPa0fzo3QI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100953/p50_pocket_3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Harper’s Bazaar China&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Blj1lZbnmPp8RDE0ZmK9qtfqg3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100951/001RBNXygy1gxfadtvk2hj61400u0n0g02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Harper’s Bazaar China&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zHDMhrpvEkBdgIl-peKwOf8iduE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100952/001RBNXygy1gxfadvhl0cj61400u0q8202.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Harper’s Bazaar China&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TYT7cw"&gt;Huawei is of course no stranger to foldable devices, and has previously released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/25/18239565/huawei-mate-x-foldable-phone-hands-on-design-mwc-2019"&gt;Mate X&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21145519/huawei-mate-xs-foldable-phone-news-features-quad-layer-screen-hinge-kirin-990-5g"&gt;Mate XS&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22294983/huawei-mate-x2-fold-specs-price"&gt;Mate X2&lt;/a&gt;. But these use a folding form-factor that some have compared to a hotdog bun. In contrast, the new P50 Pocket looks to be using what’s been called a hamburger-style design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oMxwvt"&gt;Huawei’s post only mentions a Chinese launch, and it’s unclear if or when the P50 Pocket could see a global release. We might be waiting a while, though. Huawei is yet to offer its latest flagship smartphone, the P50, outside of China following its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22598135/huawei-p50-china-release-date-price-news-features-specs-cameras"&gt;launch in July&lt;/a&gt;, and the company is still subject to US sanctions that both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20993148/huawei-mate-30-no-american-components-manufacturers"&gt;limit its ability to source hardware components&lt;/a&gt; and mean it can’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21147919/google-addresses-huawei-services-ban-android-trump-sideload-apps"&gt;preinstall Google’s apps and services&lt;/a&gt; on its phones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber expands its same-day local delivery business to more cities</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ep1scKFm-K9vqjaKkuvb-dyZjWY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70280394/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tKAT16"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227828/uber-connect-direct-deliveries-medication-pet-supplies"&gt;Uber Connect&lt;/a&gt;, the ride-hail company’s same-day courier service, is expanding to more cities. It’s also getting a few new features to make sending and receiving items easier for customers and drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxpvuo"&gt;Uber Connect is now available in 6,000 cities and towns in the US, including major markets like New York City, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and San Diego. The service was initially launched in April 2020 as a means to diversify Uber’s business during the early months of the pandemic. Since then, the company has seen incredible growth in Uber Connect, registering a 200 percent increase in trips since the first week of January 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OiF8QF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Uber Connect is now available in 6,000 cities and towns in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UjjBBt"&gt;In addition to expanding to more markets, Uber is also allowing the sender to include delivery instructions (e.g. Handle with care) to their driver and arrange “meet at door” pick-up and delivery. Originally, the package recipient needed to meet the courier at the curb. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3NDRa"&gt;This isn’t the first time that Uber has experimented with same-day local deliveries. From 2014 to 2018, the company operated a business called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/31/17184480/uber-uberrush-shut-down"&gt;Uber Rush&lt;/a&gt;. The company even opened an API to allow private businesses to use it as a delivery option, but never grew it beyond a handful of major cities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmDjwO"&gt;During the pandemic, Uber’s core ride-hailing business tanked as a result of lockdown orders. In response, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583397/uber-grocery-delivery-expansion-cities-safeway-acme"&gt;the company quickly pivoted to food delivery&lt;/a&gt; and later to groceries, as it sought to find new revenue streams. Uber is still relying heavily on cash from its delivery products as it struggles to make up for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371850/uber-lyft-driver-shortage-covid-bonus-stimulus"&gt;nationwide driver shortage&lt;/a&gt;. (Of course, delivery won’t work without drivers either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fHFYw9"&gt;To help fuel its grocery delivery expansion, Uber has acquired a number of smaller startups in recent months, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21312447/uber-postmates-acquisition-announced-food-delivery"&gt;Postmates&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315159/uber-grocery-delivery-launch-cornershop-latin-america-canada"&gt;Cornershop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2021/Uber-to-Acquire-Drizly/default.aspx"&gt;Drizly&lt;/a&gt;, as it seeks to expand its delivery options. Uber is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419461/uber-gopuff-grocery-delivery-expansion"&gt;partnering with delivery startup Gopuff&lt;/a&gt;, which specializes in delivering “essential” or “instant need” items, like liquor, beauty and pet products, snacks, and over-the-counter medication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCHQaa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford launches new EV charging project to help commercial customers go electric </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zJz0SuTYRHjTSIxk8T7yX7k_yg0=/472x0:5566x3396/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70280422/FordPro_Depot_Charging.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ISXyAN"&gt;Ford is launching a new project to help its commercial customers switch to electric vehicles by selling them EV charging installation equipment and software management tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LX1gq6"&gt;The automaker says it expects to sell over 300,000 electric vehicles to businesses and government agencies over the next decade. To help ease the transition, Ford is launching a new project, called Ford Pro Charging, to offer the necessary software and hardware to aid in the charging of their electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVRWaF"&gt;Ford’s commercial vehicles will come with the automaker’s telematics software, which makes it easier for fleet owners to keep tabs on the location, charging status, or the health of their vehicles. This software will help commercial fleet operators figure when, where, and how often they’ll need to charge their EVs, depending on the types of energy that is being expended. For example, a customer that is using an electric &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22450563/ford-f150-lightning-pro-electric-pickup-truck-commercial-fleets"&gt;Ford F-150 Lighting Pro&lt;/a&gt; truck to tow materials may end up using more battery power than a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21559954/ford-e-transit-electric-delivery-cargo-van-price-specs-range"&gt;Ford E-Transit van&lt;/a&gt; used for deliveries, and therefore may need to charge more frequently. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vILjSL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The automaker says it expects top sell over 300,000 electric vehicles to businesses and government agencies over the next decade&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cyWjiT"&gt;Ford’s fleet software will also help operators tackle some of the more unconventional issues that might crop up as they switch to electric vehicles. For instance, some workers take their fleet vehicles home at night, fill up the gas tank on their own, and get reimbursed by their employer. Ford has previously said it will help install home chargers for those workers, writing into the fleet software a way to let employers reimburse workers for the cost of at-home charging.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HAlB2Ogi1oCd9engRCeNgLmvZWg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100243/FordPro_Home_Charging.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bPA8sa"&gt;“Let’s say the customer fleet returns around 10PM planning to go back out starting at 5AM,” Muffi Ghadiali, head of Ford Pro Charging, said. “You have a limited window for charging and have to make charging decisions in a highly dynamic environment. Does every vehicle need to be fully charged? Can we balance charge power against the available charging window to take advantage of low overnight energy rates? Ford Pro Charging accounts for a multitude of variables and controls each charge station precisely to optimize energy costs and ensure vehicle uptime.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4Xo3V"&gt;Ford Pro Charging customers will subscribe to the company’s software platform, meaning Ford will be able to count on subscription fees as recurring revenue. The amount that each customer pays is based on the number of vehicles or charge ports they have in operation, as well as a number of other variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCCCZ3"&gt;Ford will also help install charging stations, whether at a customer’s home or at a depot for fleet vehicles. The company will install either AC or DC fast charging ports, depending on a customer’s needs. Ford said it is working with a number of different suppliers, though a spokesperson declined to provide any charging company names. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s46Qi3"&gt;Ford also declined to disclose the amount of money it plans on spending on this project. Previously the company said it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22267195/ford-electric-autonomous-investment-29-billion"&gt;spend $29 billion on electric and autonomous vehicles&lt;/a&gt; through 2025. Ford expects to start shipping the F-150 Lightning Pro, its electric pickup truck geared toward commercial customers, and the E-Transit van in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="trFWvV"&gt;The demand for commercial EVs is likely to be huge over the decade. Under the Biden administration, the federal government alone is likely to spend billions of dollars purchasing hundreds of thousands of electric vehicles in order to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22824500/biden-executive-order-climate-change-carbon-emissions-electric-vehicles"&gt;fulfill the executive order to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XUZyhn"&gt;EV charging has been a challenge for the entire auto industry, Ford included. In 2019, the automaker introduced its FordPass network, claiming that EV owners would have access to 12,000 public chargers. But the branding made it seem as if Ford were launching its own version of Tesla’s Supercharger network, when it was actually tapping existing stations from companies like Electrify America. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/29/22356539/ford-connected-charge-station-sales-halt-issue-mustang-mach-e"&gt;the company stopped selling its Level 2 home chargers&lt;/a&gt; for the Mustang Mach-E after discovering some weren’t working. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Msp8B1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok tests PC game streaming app that could let it take on Twitch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The TikTok music note logo against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WDFW190i498zt3gQ6suyqNOCzD4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70280363/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="otLJyf"&gt;TikTok is testing a new piece of desktop streaming software called TikTok Live Studio that lets users broadcast live footage from games and other desktop applications, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/12/15/tiktok-is-testing-a-desktop-streaming-software-called-tiktok-live-studio/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The software is currently being tested with a small number of users across some Western markets, TikTok says, but its &lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:IcX8L3AB2AIJ:https://www.tiktok.com/studio/download+&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=uk"&gt;official page on TikTok’s site&lt;/a&gt; appears to have been taken down as of publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEh4gD"&gt;If released, TikTok Live Studio could mark an interesting change for TikTok’s live streaming strategy. Rather than being focused on users streaming directly from mobile devices, it could expand TikTok Live’s focus to include game streaming, bringing it into competition with the likes of Twitch, YouTube Gaming, and Facebook Gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ODSxFC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It's super basic in its current state. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Has both Landscape and Portrait Scenes.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sources include Game Capture, Mobile Capture, Video Capture, Program Capture, and some text/images. No browser sources, or alerts.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Emojis are limited to the stock ones. &lt;a href="https://t.co/oOHwUbSdUF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/oOHwUbSdUF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Zach Bussey (@zachbussey) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zachbussey/status/1471172519226916865?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ovdcdz"&gt;According to Zach Bussey, who shared screenshots of TikTok Live Studio &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zachbussey/status/1471172519226916865"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, the software is currently in a barebones state. It reportedly supports streaming in both landscape and portrait, and can draw footage from games, individual programs, mobile devices, and cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MbPV42"&gt;It’s previously been possible to live stream from a desktop device to TikTok using third-party &lt;a href="https://streamlabs.com/content-hub/post/streamlabs-announces-integration-with-tiktok"&gt;software like Streamlabs&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://streamlabs.com/content-hub/post/how-to-live-stream-on-tiktok-from-a-pc"&gt;a help page for the feature&lt;/a&gt; notes that access is limited and invite-only. There are also &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAefS9XDPdQ"&gt;tutorials&lt;/a&gt; that use third-party services like Loola.tv as a workaround to connect TikTok with streaming programs like OBS. But even these aren’t perfect — a &lt;a href="https://support.loola.tv/en/articles/1755882-connecting-your-tiktok-account"&gt;Loola.tv help page&lt;/a&gt; notes that “TikTok streaming is currently disabled for most users” as of July this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L5M7O8"&gt;It’s not clear when TikTok might expand its test of Live Studio to more users. But if it becomes widely available, desktop streaming could bring a lot more variety to the platform’s catalog of live content.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Adidas is launching an NFT collection with exclusive access to streetwear drops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A black hoodie with text and logos on the upper left chest. There’s a blockchain address followed by logos for GMoney, Bored Ape Yacht Club, Punks Comics, and Adidas." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_ch8IlvktsUWZAY5zEIi0nbwdWI=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70280303/aO_metaverese_BlackHoodie_400_01_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Adidas’ NFT-exclusive hoodie. | Image: Adidas&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UZRV2I"&gt;Adidas is getting into the NFT game. The apparel company is launching a line of NFTs on Friday, called &lt;em&gt;Into the Metaverse&lt;/em&gt;, which will offer buyers access to what’s essentially a very exclusive fan club. NFT holders will be able to purchase special merch drops, and Adidas says members will help to shape what kinds of products and experiences the company puts together for its NFT-owning community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74zuXy"&gt;“Adidas is in the metaverse,” Tareq Nazlawy, Adidas’ senior director of digital growth, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We want to figure out what would be the dopest thing to do in that space and start involving the communities we’re activating through this [NFT] in how we should manifest in the virtual world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dNy6gF"&gt;The launch comes after a couple weeks of crypto and metaverse hype from Adidas. The company launched digital tokens last month, which will offer holders early access to the NFT drop, and a couple weeks ago, it began tweeting vaguely about the metaverse. Adidas also bought a Bored Ape — the company named the ape Indigo Hertz — and outfitted it with a custom Adidas-branded tracksuit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The hoodie lists the blockchain address: 0x676DBC8275D6164696461737f3Fd325741474D49 " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2iQm-nqEEggWDEEao4CstF2wZNI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23100694/aO_metaverse_BlackHoodie_420_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Adidas&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A close-up on the hoodie.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iwC9ne"&gt;The NFTs will sell for 0.2 ETH, or about $800 USD, starting December 17th &lt;a href="https://adidas.njih.net/c/482924/264102/4270?u=http%3A%2F%2Fadidas.com%2Fmetaverse&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;through Adidas’ website&lt;/a&gt;. Adidas declined to share how many NFTs would be sold, citing “security protocols,” and declined to say whether the company would receive royalties on NFT resales. The company was also unable to share imagery or a description of what &lt;em&gt;Into the Metaverse &lt;/em&gt;NFTs will look like before this story was scheduled to publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vblLr"&gt;NFT buyers will get access to “digital and physical” Adidas products and experiences. At first, the physical goods will include the tracksuit worn by Indigo, a hoodie with a blockchain address on it, and an orange beanie. The merch is cobranded with a trio of collaborators: Bored Ape Yacht Club, the highly sought-after NFT collection; Punks Comics, which recently featured Indigo on an issue’s cover; and GMoney, a pseudonymous crypto enthusiast who’s been consulting with Adidas on how to enter the NFT space in a way that feels authentic. The beanie is supposed to be the one worn by GMoney’s CryptoPunks avatar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ALaHNL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You belong to a community, and we continue to add value to that over time.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FQ0NGG"&gt;“There will be other experiences we’re putting together,” Erika Wykes-Sneyd, VP of marketing for Adidas Originals, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The intent is this thing, this NFT, you belong to a community, and we continue to add value to that over time, and it’s gonna also evolve with what we’re learning about the community how they’re changing and evolving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUlsqt"&gt;It’s a familiar formula for the NFT space. NFT project creators will tell you that the real value of their tokens comes from building a community around them and developing a roadmap to deliver new experiences. Adidas seems to be borrowing that approach, but it’s new to see a major company jump into the fray.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6yhXr2"&gt;There’s a lot of opportunity here for Adidas. Streetwear enthusiasts are already used to competing to get limited-run product drops, and Adidas already has an app, called Confirmed, for selling special runs like Yeezys. The &lt;em&gt;Into the Metaverse&lt;/em&gt; NFT series just offers a new (and potentially &lt;em&gt;even more &lt;/em&gt;exclusive) way to offer those kinds of drops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93sqtG"&gt;Plus, the NFT space already operates a bit like pricey, hyped streetwear brands like Supreme. One of the key privileges thus far of owning a Bored Ape Yacht Club NFT is access to exclusive merch drops, like a hat and hoodie, which resell on eBay for hundreds of dollars beyond their sale price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KBLktS"&gt;From that perspective, it was only a matter of time before an actual streetwear brand got in on the action. And it may not be long before others join them: just this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22833369/nike-rtfkt-nft-sneaker-shoe-metaverse-company"&gt;Nike bought a company that makes NFTs and virtual sneakers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 developer CD Projekt will pay just $1.85 million in proposed class-action settlement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J6jducDENZKdmuNu6JV7QzDPzGI=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70280253/Cyberpunk2077_No_Future_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fMUBSy"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/8/22824847/cd-projekt-red-settle-class-action-lawsuit-cyberpunk-2077-launch"&gt;we reported&lt;/a&gt; that game developer CD Projekt was negotiating to settle a class-action lawsuit over the infamously botched launch of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, a game that came riddled with bugs and poor enough performance on consoles that Sony pulled it from the PlayStation Store and many storefronts offered refunds. CD Projekt says those negotiations are now concluded, and here’s how much it’s agreed to pay: $1,850,000 USD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNVM2S"&gt;While the settlement will likely have to be approved by a court, it sounds like the lead plaintiffs and their lawyers negotiated for a fairly tiny sum here in exchange for “relinquish[ing] any and all claims against the Company and members of its Management Board.” That’s when you consider that the game had a development budget of over $316 million (&lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-04-22-cd-projekt-refunded-around-30-000-cyberpunk-2077-copies"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;GamesIndustry.biz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), recouped that &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/11/22170468/cyberpunk-2077-sales-revenue-cd-projekt"&gt;entire development and marketing budget in digital pre-orders alone&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195728/cyberpunk-2077-sales-copies-sold-launch-refunds"&gt;didn’t actually see a huge impact from refunds&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkG3ev"&gt;Perhaps the plaintiffs didn’t have much of a case? It’s worth noting that this lawsuit (technically, four lawsuits that had been rolled into one) were brought by &lt;em&gt;shareholders&lt;/em&gt; who believed they were misled by the company about financial performance, not gamers who purchased the game. Despite the game’s seemingly &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; decent sales, the company’s reputation has slipped, &lt;a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/83350/analysts-reduce-cyberpunk-2077-sales-predictions-by-65/index.html"&gt;sales projections have lowered&lt;/a&gt;, and its stock price &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-10/a-year-on-from-cyberpunk-fiasco-cd-projekt-no-nearer-redemption"&gt;has fallen a reported 54 percent&lt;/a&gt; since last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BgWoGL"&gt;CD Projekt has repeatedly promised to fix the game, and issued a series of patches, suggesting it might eventually become the game it promised. In late October, the company announced that next-gen updates for both Cyberpunk and &lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt; would be delayed to 2022. “Apologies for the extended wait, but we want to make it right,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CDPROJEKTRED/status/1450845753996455944"&gt;the company wrote.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="do0YJk"&gt;Reddit &lt;a href="https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-announces-confidential-submission-of-draft-registration-statement-related-to-proposed-public-offering"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; late Wednesday that it has started the process of taking the company public, by filing a confidential S-1 with the Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMhXLH"&gt;The  number of shares to be offered, and the price range for the proposed offering haven’t been determined yet, the company said, adding that it was in a quiet period and could not provide further details for regulatory reasons, which is standard practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hq6mJf"&gt;The company has been &lt;a href="https://www.forex.com/en/market-analysis/latest-research/reddit-ipo/"&gt;rumored&lt;/a&gt; to be considering an IPO for some time, and in August announced it had &lt;a href="https://www.redditinc.com/blog/reddit-secures-funding-to-continue-growth-plans/"&gt;raised a $700 million round&lt;/a&gt; of funding at a valuation of more than $10 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haPJrU"&gt;In the August announcement, Reddit said it had made $100 million in ad revenue for the second quarter of 2021, a nearly 200 percent increase from the previous year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8r2VJ"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22621445/reddit-valuation-revenue-funding-round"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year that it planned to double its staff by the end of 2021 to around 1,400 employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgCW7B"&gt;Reddit, founded in 2005, had grown to around 52 million daily users as of August, with more than 100,000 active sub-reddits. Huffman told the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/12/technology/reddit-new-funding.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in August that Reddit was “still planning on going public” but didn’t have a firm timeline, adding, “All good companies should go public when they can.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="kupS3d"&gt;A ransomware attack is disrupting operations at many major companies, and some workers are concerned that it could affect their last paychecks before the holidays — because their payroll provider, Kronos, is the one that’s dealing with the ransom. The incident has left entire cities and states trying to come up with a plan to get paychecks out to their workers, and could affect HR operations at organizations like &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/12/13/mta-timekeeping-system-goes-dark-after-ransomware-attack/"&gt;New York City’s Metro Transit Authority&lt;/a&gt;, Honda, GameStop, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q4Oe3d"&gt;One Whole Foods worker &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/security/ransomware-attack-threatens-paychecks-just-christmas-rcna8795"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that there’s “a real fear about our paychecks this upcoming Friday,” saying that employees had been to to use “a paper punch sheet to keep track of our hours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5h5jgl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ransomware has disrupted HR operations around the world&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TpOcBM"&gt;Kronos Private Cloud is a suite of human resources software operated by a company called Ultimate Kronos Group, or UKG. Initially, Kronos didn’t reveal how severe the issue might actually be: &lt;a href="https://www.ukg.com/KPCupdates"&gt;the company reported&lt;/a&gt; that its hosted versions of Workforce Central, TeleStaff, and other services were unavailable, and said that it didn’t have an estimate when they’d be back online. UKG recommended that its customers “evaluate alternative plans to process time and attendance data for payroll processing”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b4vilw"&gt;But early the next morning, UKG revealed that the issue was deeper than a service disruption: the company said it had been the victim of a ransomware attack, saying “it may take up to several weeks to fully restore system availability.” It also said its backups were “currently unavailable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XSRKAX"&gt;UKG’s list of clients includes some huge names including &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90706145/kronos-ransomware-attack-the-nightmare-that-could-hit-paychecks-right-before-christmas"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, GameStop, Honda, &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hr-platform-kronos-brought-down-by-ransomware-attack-ukg-warns-of-data-breach/"&gt;Sainsbury’s&lt;/a&gt;, Puma, the YMCA, MGM Resorts, the city of Denver, and &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/12/13/mta-timekeeping-system-goes-dark-after-ransomware-attack/"&gt;New York City’s Metro Transit Authority&lt;/a&gt;. Medical facilities have also reportedly been affected — Honolulu’s &lt;a href="https://www.staradvertiser.com/2021/12/13/breaking-news/board-of-water-supply-employees-warned-to-check-credit-reports-after-cyberattack-strikes-contractor/"&gt;EMS and Board of Water Supply&lt;/a&gt; used Kronos, along with &lt;a href="https://www.gosanangelo.com/story/news/2021/12/13/shannon-hospital-impacted-ransomware-software-company-kronos/6502755001/"&gt;San Angelo, Texas’ Shannon Medical Center&lt;/a&gt; and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PYt5Cv"&gt;Some companies have promised to get paychecks out, despite the disruption. According to &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;, Whole Foods has said that it’ll be able to pay its employees on Friday, and the state of West Virginia &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21154976-release-from-erp-board-on-kronos"&gt;has said&lt;/a&gt; that it’d already processed paychecks for December 17th, and is coming up with a plan for paying workers on the 31st. The City of Cleveland has reportedly said that employees &lt;a href="https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/local/cleveland/cleveland-kronos-cybersecurity-incident/95-5cab1459-0779-4125-a74e-443bed04e90c"&gt;will keep getting their paychecks&lt;/a&gt;, though it did say that some of them may have had their names, addresses, and partial social security numbers compromised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6pn0UV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some companies have been able to promise payments, others have not&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fDNoQd"&gt;However, &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/hr-platform-kronos-brought-down-by-ransomware-attack-ukg-warns-of-data-breach/"&gt;anonymous sources told &lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that some companies will be missing payroll for the week. A post on the Sysadmin subreddit offers some insight as to why, as &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/rga2sn/ukg_cyber_attack_what_is_your_current_payroll/"&gt;one person describes&lt;/a&gt; the Herculean efforts they’re taking to tally up employee hours and produce and mail checks without UKG’s services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFnhqX"&gt;UKG hasn’t given details on the ransom, or talked about who’s behind it, according to &lt;em&gt;NBC News&lt;/em&gt;. Not all of its products have necessarily been affected, though — the company claims the self-hosted versions of the affected applications should keep working fine, and that it doesn’t have evidence any product outside Kronos Private Cloud was affected in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H5BmMX"&gt;There’s been speculation that the ransomware attack could be linked to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22828303/log4j-library-vulnerability-log4shell-zero-day-exploit"&gt;massive log4j vulnerability that was recently discovered&lt;/a&gt;. But in an update to &lt;a href="https://www.ukg.com/KPCupdates"&gt;the site UKG set up to respond to this incident&lt;/a&gt;, the company said there’s currently “no indication” that the two events are linked, though it is still investigating.&lt;/p&gt;
