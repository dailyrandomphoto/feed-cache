    <title>DC attorney general launches antitrust suit against Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WD6gpt7OasrSMiaP-O3Bq_6_rOE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69339766/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="axTcj2"&gt;On Tuesday, DC Attorney General Karl Racine &lt;a href="https://oag.dc.gov/sites/default/files/2021-05/Amazon-Complaint-.pdf"&gt;sued Amazon on antitrust grounds&lt;/a&gt;, accusing the e-commerce giant of suppressing competition by placing strict conditions on what third-party sellers can do outside of the company’s platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2bctC"&gt;“Amazon’s policies have prevented competing platforms, including sellers’ own websites, from competing on price and gaining market share,” Racine said in a press call. “The loss of competition results in less innovation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3mjG7"&gt;Filed in DC Superior Court, the lawsuit alleges that Amazon unlawfully maintains its monopoly power by preventing independent sellers from offering products at lower prices on other platforms. It also claims that these “most favored nation” agreements harm consumers by inflating prices and stifling competition and innovation in the online retail market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZwBDF"&gt;In particular, the lawsuit takes aim at a clause in Amazon’s required agreements for third-party sellers that “explicitly prohibited [third-party sellers] from offering their products on a competing online retail sales platform, including the TPS’s own website, at a lower price or on better terms than the TPS offered the products on Amazon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cx06AX"&gt;Racine is seeking structural remedies, like Amazon ending its price agreements and recovering damages to curb additional anti-competitive conduct. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZq8wc"&gt;Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vy61hZ"&gt;Amazon’s Marketplace platform offers a way for independent sellers to list products and make sales on the site, leading to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/19/18140799/amazon-marketplace-scams-seller-court-appeal-reinstatement"&gt;an often chaotic mix of independent shops and offerings&lt;/a&gt;. Amazon’s pricing agreements with those sellers have long been controversial, and it quietly withdrew one of the clauses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/11/18260700/amazon-anti-competitive-pricing-agreements-3rd-party-sellers-end"&gt;spelling out the requirement in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. But the new lawsuit argues the same provisions were later incorporated into the company’s Fair Pricing Policy, which deals primarily with deceptive listings or otherwise predatory pricing behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQIRw2"&gt;The new DC lawsuit is the latest in a string of major antitrust cases against tech companies. Last December, 48 state attorneys general and the Federal Trade Commission &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;sued Facebook&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly acquiring companies that it perceived as competitive threats to its business. That same month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178988/google-antitrust-ad-tech-lawsuit-texas-attorney-general-paxton"&gt;Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton&lt;/a&gt; led an antitrust lawsuit against Google for allegedly abusing its market dominance in the online advertising market.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos updates the One SL to make it more power efficient and recyclable</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jiiyXnsjpqnhQDgyPIXX_Ly12qc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69339575/dseifert_190826_3622_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t4BEJY"&gt;Sonos is refreshing its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20849821/sonos-one-sl-port-price-specs-features-announcement"&gt;One SL speaker&lt;/a&gt;, which doesn’t have always-on microphones or integrated voice controls, to make it more power efficient and recyclable, the company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. However, the new model won’t have any additional features or functionality. The updated speaker first appeared in &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/SBVRM038"&gt;FCC filings published Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnFlfH"&gt;The primary change in this new One SL is a “more efficient” wireless radio, according to Sonos. The base of the speaker has also been redesigned to remove extra plastics and “stickering,” and the product packaging has a “more sustainable design” like what’s used with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22368487/sonos-roam-bluetooth-speaker-review-features"&gt;recently released Sonos Roam&lt;/a&gt;. And while there won’t be any new functionality, Sonos says that this updated One SL will only work with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/8/21283738/sonos-s2-platform-app-release-ios-store-google-play"&gt;newer Sonos S2 app&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvPDrU"&gt;Here is exactly what Sonos shared with us:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="N6NQ3B"&gt;We continually seek opportunities to make our products more efficient and sustainable. In this case, we’ve made updates to One SL that reduce waste, improve recyclability and deliver efficiencies in power consumption. The principal change is a new, more efficient wireless radio (hence the need for an FCC filing). In addition, we’ve redesigned the base of the speaker to remove extra plastics and stickering as well as refreshing the packaging to the new more sustainable design introduced with Roam. These changes don’t deliver new features or functionality so it won’t be labeled and sold as a new product, but it will only be compatible with S2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5vQMLi"&gt;The refreshed One SL is now available on Sonos’ websites and from third-party retailers, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AmmPni"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 25th, 12PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added confirmation that the updated speaker is available now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tidal now also offers offline listening on the Apple Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vzihcGwATCdsY0OUrDD7qarx8kQ=/255x0:2145x1260/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69339545/TIDAL_on_Apple_Watch_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Tidal&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="o5Ek5G"&gt;Music streaming service Tidal is now available &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftidal.com%2FAppleWatch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22453031%2Ftidal-apple-watch-offline-listening-spotify-deezer" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on the Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt;, allowing subscribers to stream music directly to Apple’s wearable or download it for offline listening. Instructions on how to get set up can be found on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ftidal.com%2FAppleWatch&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22453031%2Ftidal-apple-watch-offline-listening-spotify-deezer" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Tidal’s site&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447222/spotify-adding-feature-music-downloads-offline-apple-watch"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443522/deezer-apple-watch-offline-listening"&gt;Deezer&lt;/a&gt; both announced similar offline listening features for the Apple Watch last week. Subscription prices for Tidal start at $9.99 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KpKOR7"&gt;Tidal has historically sold itself on the quality of its audio streaming, offering features like lossless playback and even hi-res streaming before many of its bigger rivals. But this year, some of its biggest competitors are starting to catch up. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;Spotify’s lossless HiFi tier&lt;/a&gt; is set to launch later this year, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440090/apple-music-lossless-audio-dolby-atmos-support-audio"&gt;Apple Music will introduce support&lt;/a&gt; for lossless and hi-res streaming next month. Tidal’s high audio quality won’t translate to its Apple Watch app however. The music service has confirmed audio will be limited to 96Kbps on the wearable, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447222/spotify-adding-feature-music-downloads-offline-apple-watch"&gt;like Spotify&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="f8uVMB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tidal is facing renewed competition from Spotify and Apple Music&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n4wHzl"&gt;The service’s other major selling point is the amount it pays artists in royalties to stream their music. Analysis &lt;a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2018/12/25/streaming-music-services-pay-2019/"&gt;from &lt;em&gt;Digital Music News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; puts Tidal’s rates ahead of Spotify, Apple, and Deezer, and it looks like this artist-supporting trend is set to continue after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313108/square-inc-tidal-majority-stake-jack-dorsey-jay-z"&gt;Jack Dorsey’s financial services company Square recently acquired a majority stake&lt;/a&gt; in the streaming service for $297 million. Dorsey specifically cited wanting to find “new ways for artists to support their work” as the reason for the acquisition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YV11Ry"&gt;“Square created ecosystems of tools for sellers &amp;amp; individuals and we’ll do the same for artists,” the CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1367460914149003271"&gt;tweeted at the time&lt;/a&gt;, “We’ll work on entirely new listening experiences to bring fans closer together, simple integrations for merch sales, modern collaboration tools, and new complementary revenue streams.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ewwp6Q"&gt;Tidal’s Apple Watch support requires a Series 3 model or later running watchOS 7.1. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sling TV announces completely redesigned app, and it looks way nicer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c2fl8sQAly3jMLGV5BMcEh7wBcM=/63x0:737x449/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69339536/SlingApp2.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DjxL6H"&gt;Compared to competitors like YouTube TV and Hulu, Sling TV has never had the flashiest app, and the overall user experience leaves something to be desired. It’s been easy enough to overlook these faults since Sling TV undercuts those rivals on price, but today the company &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.sling.com/pm/newapp" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced a completely redesigned app&lt;/a&gt; that focuses on more polish and personalized recommendations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IBcfV6"&gt;The new Sling TV app is rolling out first to “select customers” using Amazon’s Fire TV devices, and other platforms will be added as the year stretches on. (It’ll arrive on Roku sometime this summer, for example.) The Dish-owned company describes this as the “most comprehensive update in Sling TV’s history.” And based on screenshots and the GIF above, it does look like a significant makeover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ss4kdg"&gt;“After a year of talking to customers and working with our design and advanced engineering teams, we’re happy to roll out the new Sling TV app to deliver the best in live sports, news and entertainment, at the same unbeatable low price point,” Michael Schwimmer, group president of Sling TV, said &lt;a href="https://news.sling.com/2021-05-25-SLING-TV-unveils-new-app-experience-delivering-live-sports,-news-and-entertainment#assets_all"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJAEf2"&gt;The redesign comes with a lot of changes, including a left-side navigation column and a new homescreen that focuses on content recommendations. The channel guide has been “reimagined” to make favoriting channels and filtering easier, though it will still feel familiar to customers who want that traditional cable-like grid. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DbNKqc_V-2_Z5fSi8yh6O6lB1Rk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22538521/Screen_Shot_2021_05_25_at_11.26.32_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sling TV&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A dedicated DVR section provides easy access to your cloud recordings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NFx8tH"&gt;Sling TV’s cloud DVR now gets its own tab, which should make it easier to sort through your recordings. By default, the service comes with 50 hours of DVR space, but you can expand this to 200 hours for an extra $5 per month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0TLCv"&gt;“If a streaming app is done right, it should be practically invisible, allowing the user to get to the most relevant content quickly and easily — the new Sling TV experience does just that,” said Jon Lin, Sling TV’s VP of product. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pansonic teases a GH6 and focuses on streaming with the GH5 Mark II</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gB5mdIs0pKJNtKLYSWRcluejVLM=/0x134:2667x1912/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69339418/GH5M2_MKIT_slant_K_T4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Panasonic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iHxknI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fRXhezdFxhM"&gt;Panasonic has announced&lt;/a&gt; not one but two follow-up cameras to the Lumix GH5, a camera that’s been popular with videographers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14145730/panasonic-gh5-fz80-gx850-compact-cameras-ces-2017"&gt;since it launched in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. There’s the GH6, which Panasonic says features a brand-new sensor and will launch by the end of the year for $2,500, and the GH5 Mark II, which is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1639337-REG%2Fpanasonic_dc_gh5m2body_lumix_gh5_ii_mirrorless.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22451677%2Fpanasonic-gh6-gh5-mark-ii-2-live-streaming-video-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;going up for preorder today&lt;/a&gt;, with a body-only package coming in at $1,700.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdLR3A"&gt;The GH6 will feature a new image engine along with the sensor and will have the capability to record 10-bit 4K at 120fps and 10-bit 5.7K at 60fps. The camera also promises DCI 4K60 at 4:2:2 without a recording time limit. The GH6 is currently in development, so Panasonic didn’t provide many more details, but it did say that the camera would feature a Micro Four Thirds sensor. The impressive video capabilities might sound familiar, as they’re very similar to the full-frame &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21341095/sony-a7s-mark-iii-camera-video-price-specs-features"&gt;Sony A7S III&lt;/a&gt; (which also has a much heftier price tag). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsUbaW"&gt;While the details on the GH6 were light, we got a very good look at the GH5 Mark II. It’s, as the name implies, an improved version of the GH5, and Panasonic’s idea for it seems to be that it’s built to serve people who aren’t looking to spend $2,500 on a GH6 but want something more capable than a G7 or older GH4. When the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/4/14145730/panasonic-gh5-fz80-gx850-compact-cameras-ces-2017"&gt;GH5 originally launched&lt;/a&gt; it was $2,000, so it seems like Panasonic is trying to split the difference with the Mark II and GH6, offering cameras on both sides.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2QzfDIuaAaLeQndE04Lai3Clqw0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22537072/GH5M2_MKIT_top_K_T4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Panasonic&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There’s also a kit that comes with a 12-60mm f/2.8-4 image-stabilized lens for $2,300.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qegNcN"&gt;The GH5 Mark II has the same body as the GH5 (making it compatible with any previous accessories or cages), but it packs internals that make it an even more powerful video camera. While the original did support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/9/19/12971066/panasonics-lumix-gh5-4k-60p-video-6k-photos-mirrorless-camera"&gt;4K recording at 60 frames a second&lt;/a&gt;, it was only 8-bit — the Mark II supports it at 10-bit 4:2:0, which can simultaneously be recorded internally and externally (with some HDMI recorders supporting 4:2:2). The cinema 4K mode, which provides a wider-than-16:9 aspect ratio, also now supports 30p and 25p, where the GH5 only supported 24p. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ntoUea"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The GH5’s famous in-body stabilization is also getting a bump in performance&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RLakWz"&gt;The color profiles have also gotten a revamp in the Mark II, with the camera including Cinelike D2 and V2 profiles. It also now includes the V-Log L profile for free, which was previously &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.panasonic.com%2Fcameras-and-camcorders%2Fcamera-and-camcorder-accessories%2Fcamera-accessories%2FDMW-SFU1-VLOG.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22451677%2Fpanasonic-gh6-gh5-mark-ii-2-live-streaming-video-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a $100 upgrade to the GH5&lt;/a&gt;. In addition to the improved color, the sensor (which is the same as the one found in the GH5) has also gotten an anti-reflective coating to avoid unwanted lens flares, and Panasonic claims it has 25 percent wider dynamic range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFVnRX"&gt;The GH5 Mark II’s in-body stabilization is getting a bump in performance, too: the original could provide five stops of compensation, according to Panasonic, while the Mark II will be able to compensate up to 6.5 stops (though for longer lenses, achieving this number will require the lens to also have optical stabilization). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KIw2kM"&gt;Panasonic is also saying that the autofocus system will be improved — a good sign, given the GH5’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.premiumbeat.com%2Fblog%2Fsolutions-for-gh5-autofocus%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22451677%2Fpanasonic-gh6-gh5-mark-ii-2-live-streaming-video-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;lackluster performance in the area&lt;/a&gt;. The GH5 Mark II will feature head and body detection, as well as support for tracking animals, in addition to the eye and face detection found on the previous camera. The tracking will also be twice as fast, with the system looking for objects 60 times a second, while the GH5 tracks at 30 times a second. Panasonic also says that the system should lock on to subjects better and will have better support for tracking people who are farther in the distance. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SYWOs5ESDi0Eeb3pw44ZPow_tfE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22537069/GH5M2_body_back_K_T4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Panasonic&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Panasonic says the screen is 1.5 times brighter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="l5ATkJ"&gt;The Mark II also has some creature comfort improvements and really nerdy additions. The rear LCD is both higher-resolution and brighter, and the USB-C port is now compatible with the Power Delivery standard so it can run the camera and trickle-charge the batteries at the same time. It also takes higher-capacity batteries, though the older batteries the GH5 used will still work in the camera, and vice versa. There’s also now the option to add a red border around the screen when recording, and the ability to have two levels of zebra patterns to help determine exposure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OBhHBL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Panasonic knows its audience is mostly made up of video people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m6OaOW"&gt;When shooting with supported lenses, creators will now be able to change the focus ring mode, setting it to be linear if that’s what they prefer, and even setting a specific focus throw if their use case calls for it. Panasonic has also updated its in-camera anamorphic de-squeezing feature (which allows people shooting with the special lenses to get a non-distorted preview of their picture) to include more lenses: the GH5 supported lenses with 1.33x and 2x aspect ratios, while the Mark II also supports lenses at 1.3x, 1.5x, and 1.8x. There’s also now support for image stabilization with anamorphic lenses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxhXLt"&gt;The GH5 Mark II can, of course, also shoot pictures, but it seems like Panasonic knows its audience is mostly made up of video people: new photo features were largely absent, apart from a brief mention of improved color science and some new profiles. But while Panasonic doesn’t seem to be putting in a lot of work to entice photo shooters to its platform, it does seem to be trying to make the GH5 Mark II appealing to a different breed of video creators: the livestreamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNaeVB"&gt;The GH5 Mark II’s presentation for journalists focused heavily on its livestreaming capabilities: it can stream to platforms like YouTube, Facebook, and Twitch directly over Wi-Fi, with compression being done on-camera. The streaming compression can be done at various levels and resolutions, depending on the requirements of the platform. Streamers can either input their streaming URLs and keys manually, for platforms like Twitch that support RTMP (or RTMPS), or they can directly sign on to Facebook or YouTube if they’re using the Lumix Sync smartphone app to set up the stream. Panasonic says that the ability to hardwire to a phone or even directly to a LAN via USB will be coming in a future firmware update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hoy2Yv"&gt;I was shown a live demo of the streaming, which was conducted over YouTube, and to my eye it looked about as good as a stream can be expected to. Panasonic also said that the XLR microphone adapter built for the camera would work while streaming, and that an HDMI recorder could be used to capture a full-quality recording of any stream (though internally recording stream footage isn’t possible). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qmnGyN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s hard to find a direct competitor to the GH5 Mark II&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6NNnFC"&gt;It’s hard to find a direct competitor to the GH5 Mark II, especially in its price range: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21151718/fujifilm-xt4-announced-specs-pricing-ibis-stabilization-vlogging"&gt;Fujifilm’s X-T4&lt;/a&gt; is no slouch when it comes to video, but it doesn't have the heaps of options the Panasonic does (for example, you probably won’t get a custom menu for your most-used frame rates and resolutions, or filters to help pare down that information in the main menu like the GH5 Mark II has). The story is similar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21497207/sony-a7c-review-camera-price-specs-features"&gt;with Sony’s A7C&lt;/a&gt;, and the A7S III has similar specs but costs almost twice the price. And while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/4/9/17217394/blackmagic-pocket-cinema-camera-4k-announced"&gt;BlackMagic’s Pocket Cinema Camera 4K&lt;/a&gt; has comparable video power as well as RAW video support, there are some places it falls way short when compared to the GH5 Mark II: the lack of a flip-out screen and autofocus spring to mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXmj8C"&gt;Panasonic has also announced that its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PANASONIC-Mirrorless-Megapixels-High-Resolution-DC-G9KBODY/dp/B0774KTV1X?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;G9&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mirrorless-Sensitivity-Multi-Aspect-Megapixels-DC-GH5S/dp/B078J119BC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GH5S&lt;/a&gt; cameras would also be getting firmware updates, bringing some of the new features from the GH5 Mark II. Both cameras will be getting the autofocus performance improvements, along with the frame indicators and markers, as well as support for vertical video detection. The GH5S will additionally be getting 12-bit raw over HDMI support when outputting to an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atomos-Daylight-Viewable-Portable-ATOMNJAV01/dp/B07C2QQGM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Atomos Ninja V&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4IhEhJ"&gt;Panasonic also announced that it was working on a new lens, the Leica DG 25-50mm f/1.7. The aperture is constant throughout the 50-100mm full-frame equivalent focal range, and while there weren’t any additional details announced, Panasonic has emphasized it as a companion to the existing &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1480838-REG%2Fpanasonic_h_x1025_panasonic_lumix_g_10_25mm.html%2Freviews&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F25%2F22451677%2Fpanasonic-gh6-gh5-mark-ii-2-live-streaming-video-camera" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;10-25mm f/1.7&lt;/a&gt;. That lens features dust and moisture resistance and produces &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2fDOOgzxcY"&gt;some lovely images&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s exciting to hear that the more tele-oriented version in the works will likely be similar in terms of build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BWZW6"&gt;Panasonic is still, for better and worse, dedicated to Micro Four Thirds. In its presentation to journalists, it said that the format was necessary to get all the features and readout speeds it wanted at the price point it was looking to hit. It’s obviously invested a lot into these cameras, with the addition of livestreaming and the upcoming GH6’s monster specs, but the limitations of the format are something aspiring cinematographers will have to keep in mind when choosing their next video camera.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft has built an AI-powered autocomplete for code using GPT-3</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l5IAAG1NfIUw9AMjc_Srg_IaitU=/0x12:503x347/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69339291/microsoft_gpt3_powerapps_code.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B5jsjU"&gt;In September 2020, Microsoft purchased an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21451283/microsoft-openai-gpt-3-exclusive-license-ai-language-research"&gt;exclusive license&lt;/a&gt; to the underlying technology behind GPT-3, an AI language tool built by OpenAI. Now, the Redmond, Washington-based tech giant has announced its first commercial use case for the program: an assistive feature in the company’s PowerApps software that turns natural language into readymade code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gICEYz"&gt;The feature is limited in its scope and can only produce formulas in &lt;a href="https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/introducing-microsoft-power-fx-the-low-code-programming-language-for-everyone/"&gt;Microsoft Power Fx&lt;/a&gt;, a simple programming language derived from Microsoft Excel formulas that’s used mainly for database queries. But it shows the huge potential for machine learning to help novice programmers by functioning as an autocomplete tool for code. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="om6Q70"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Why don’t we ... speak the language of a normal human?”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fQGv5x"&gt;“There’s massive demand for digital solutions but not enough coders out there. There’s a million-developer shortfall in the US alone,” Charles Lamanna, CVP of Microsoft’s Low Code Application Platform, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “So instead of making the world learn how to code, why don’t we make development environments speak the language of a normal human?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="33mvCV"&gt;Autocomplete for coders&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rVoF8A"&gt;Microsoft has been pursuing this vision for a while through Power Platform, its suite of “low code, no code” software aimed at enterprise customers. These programs run as web apps and help companies that can’t hire experienced programmers tackle basic digital tasks like analytics, data visualization, and workflow automation. GPT-3’s talents have found a home in PowerApps, a program in the suite used to create simple web and mobile apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EVgYag"&gt;Lamanna demonstrates the software by opening up an example app built by Coca-Cola to keep track of its supplies of cola concentrate. Elements in the app like buttons can be dragged and dropped around the app as if the users were arranging a PowerPoint presentation. But creating the menus that let users run specific database queries (like, say, searching for all supplies that were delivered to a specific location at a specific time) requires basic coding in the form of Microsoft Power Fx formulas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBkR0q"&gt;“This is when it goes from no code to low code,” says Lamanna. “You go from drag and drop, click click click, to writing formulas. And that quickly becomes complex.” Which makes it the right time to call for an assist from machine learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qu6ZYr"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Microsoft GPT-3 PowerApps demo|102277" data-volume-uuid="911690cf4" data-volume-id="102277" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-171" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PeIUvy"&gt;Instead of having users learn how to make database queries in Power Fx, Microsoft is updating PowerApps so they can simply write out their query in natural language, which GPT-3 then translates into usable code. So for example, instead of a user searching the database with a query “FirstN(Sort(Search(‘BC Orders’, “Super_Fizzy”, “aib_productname”), ‘Purchase Date’, Descending), 10),” they can just write “Show 10 orders that have Super Fizzy in the product name and sort by purchase date with newest on the top,” and GPT-3 will produce the correct the code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2BMxB8"&gt;It’s a simple trick, but it has the potential to save time for millions of users, while also enabling non-coders to build products previously out of their reach. “I remember when we got the first prototype working on a Friday night, I used it, and I was like ‘oh my god, this is creepy good,’” says Lamanna. “I haven’t felt this way using technology for a long, long time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sTK6gT"&gt;The feature will be available in preview in June, but Microsoft is not the first to use machine learning in this way. A number of AI-assisted coding programs have appeared in recent years, including some, like Deep TabNine, that are also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708542/coding-autocompleter-deep-tabnine-ai-deep-learning-smart-compose"&gt;powered by the GPT series&lt;/a&gt;. These programs show promise but are not yet widely used, mostly due to issues of reliability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t46xHs"&gt;Programming languages are notoriously fickle, with tiny errors capable of crashing entire systems. And the output of AI language models is often haphazard, mixing up words and phrases and contradicting itself from sentence to sentence. The result is that it often requires coding experience to check the output of AI coding autocomplete programs. That, of course, undermines their appeal for novices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="LMbVAP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The simplicity of Power Fx is its greatest strength in this scenario&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EPmdiW"&gt;But Microsoft’s implementation has one big advantage over other systems: Power Fx is extremely simple. The language has its roots in Microsoft Excel formula, explains Lamanna, and is very constrained in what it can do. “It’s data-binding, single-line expressions; there’s no concept of build and compile. What you write just computes instantly,” he says. It has nothing like the power or flexibility of a programming language like Python or JavaScript, but that also means it doesn’t have as much room to commit AI-assisted errors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uX3r7w"&gt;As an additional safeguard, the Power Apps interface will also require that users confirm all Power Fx formulas generated from their input. Lamanna argues that this will not only reduce mistakes, but even teach users how to code over time. This seems like an optimistic read. What’s equally likely is that people will unthinkingly confirm the first option they’re given by the computer, as we tend to do with so many pop-up nuisances, from cookies to Ts&amp;amp;Cs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RP8yjy"&gt;Mitigating bias&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="F1LDgy"&gt;The feature accelerates Microsoft’s “low code, no code” ambitions, but it’s also noteworthy as a major commercial application of GPT-3, one of a new breed of AI language models that dominate the contemporary AI landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5CpsE1"&gt;These systems are extremely powerful, able to generate virtually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential"&gt;any sort of text&lt;/a&gt; you can imagine and manipulate language in a variety of ways, and many big tech firms have begun exploring their possibilities. Google has incorporated its own language AI model, BERT, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931657/google-bert-search-context-algorithm-change-10-percent-langauge"&gt;into its search products&lt;/a&gt;, while Facebook uses similar systems for &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2020/10/first-multilingual-machine-translation-model"&gt;tasks like translation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AfZSob"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One medical chatbot built on GPT-3 told a mock patient to kill themself&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DEN7mr"&gt;But these models also have their problems. The core of their capacity often comes from studying language patterns found in huge vats of text data scraped from the web. As with Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/24/11297050/tay-microsoft-chatbot-racist"&gt;chatbot Tay&lt;/a&gt;, which learned to repeat the insulting and abusive remarks of Twitter users, that means these models have the ability &lt;a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3442188.3445922"&gt;to encode and reproduce&lt;/a&gt; all manner of sexist and racist language. The text they produce can also be toxic in unexpected ways. One experimental chatbot built on GPT-3 that was designed to dole out medical advice &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/10/28/gpt3_medical_chatbot_experiment/"&gt;consoled a mock patient by telling them to kill themself&lt;/a&gt;, for example. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Gd5aG"&gt;The challenge of mitigating these risks depends on the exact function of the AI. In Microsoft’s case, using GPT-3 to create code means the danger is low, says Lamanna, but not nonexistent. The company has fine-tuned GPT-3 to “translate” into code by training it on examples of Power Fx formula, but the core of the program is still based on language patterns learned from the web, meaning it retains this potential for toxicity and bias. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SSRI23"&gt;Lamanna gives the example of a user asking the program to find “all job applicants that are &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;.” How will it interpret that command? It’s within GPT-3’s power to invent criteria in order to answer the question, and it’s possible it might assume that “good” is synonymous with white-sounding names, given that this is one of a number of categories favored by &lt;a href="https://www.nber.org/digest/sep03/employers-replies-racial-names"&gt;biased hiring practices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3IgE9"&gt;Microsoft says it’s addressing this issue in a number of ways. The first is implementing a ban list of words and phrases that the system just won’t respond to. “If you’re poking the AI to generate something bad, we’re not going to generate it for you,” says Lamanna. And if the system produces something it &lt;em&gt;thinks&lt;/em&gt; might be problematic, it’ll prompt users to report it to tech support. Then, someone will come and register the problem (and hopefully fix it). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GOJx6x"&gt;But making the program safe without limiting its functionality is difficult, says Lamanna. Filtering by race, religion, or gender can be discriminatory, but it can also have legitimate applications, and it sounds like Microsoft is still working out how to tell the difference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tlKpC2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Like any filter, it’s not perfect.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OQdRla"&gt;“Like any filter, it’s not perfect,” says Lamanna, emphasizing that users will have to confirm any formula written by the AI, and implying that any abuses of the program will ultimately be their responsibility. “The human does choose to inject the expression. We never inject the expression automatically,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="STkoqf"&gt;Despite these and other unanswered questions about the program’s utility, it’s clear that this is the start of a much bigger experiment for Microsoft. It’s not hard to imagine a similar feature being integrated into Microsoft Excel, where it would reach hundreds of millions of users and dramatically expand the accessibility of this product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0oeveP"&gt;When asked about this possibility, Lamanna demures (it’s not his domain), but he does say that the plan is to make GPT-3-assisted coding available wherever Power Fx itself can be accessed. “And Power Fx is showing up in lots of different places in Microsoft products,” he says. So expect to see AI completing your code much more frequently in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Former NASA astronaut Peggy Whitson is returning to space — this time, on a private ride</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X7uewe7m0xyMh_cm0nSHhnte40s=/388x0:4540x2768/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69339271/51193870203_bf4f7763b6_o.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule is seen docked to the International Space Station on May 5th, 2021, shortly before returning four astronauts back to Earth.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA / Johnson Space Center&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zY4FIe"&gt;Peggy Whitson, one of NASA’s most experienced retired astronauts, is going back to space — this time with a racecar driver and two other passengers in the latest mission planned by Axiom Space. The Houston-based space company announced on Tuesday that Whitson will serve as the mission commander for its second private flight to the International Space Station, with John Shoffner, a GT racer, serving as mission pilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nPCq2s"&gt;The Ax-2 mission with Whitson and Shoffner will be similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250327/space-tourists-axiom-private-crew-iss-price"&gt;Ax-1&lt;/a&gt;, Axiom’s first planned flight for early next year: a crew of four private citizens will fly to the International Space Station for a roughly eight-day stay conducting scientific research. It’s the latest private spaceflight planned so far as companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic race to offer tourists a trip to space — either to the ISS, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22358313/spacex-crew-dragon-glass-dome-window-space-tourists"&gt;orbit&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/22/22448928/virgin-galactic-spaceplane-vss-unity-space-branson"&gt;edge&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445585/jeff-bezos-blue-origin-new-shepard-millions-auction-bid"&gt;space&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggcTNJ"&gt;Axiom serves as a mission manager that procures other companies’ spacecraft to fly people to space, charging passengers somewhere around $55 million per mission if it’s on SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule and probably more if it’s on Boeing’s Starliner capsule, which has yet to be flight-certified by NASA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5jDmRa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Whitson didn’t think she’d go back to space after retiring in 2018&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="48ujWk"&gt;Whitson, 61, has tallied 665 days in space across three missions, the most for any NASA astronaut. She and Shoffner have been training as backups for Ax-1, which is slated to launch three entrepreneurs and former NASA astronaut Michael López-Alegría to the ISS in January 2022. That flight will use SpaceX’s Crew Dragon capsule, which has flown three crews of government astronauts to the ISS since May last year under NASA’s Commercial Crew Program. The ride for Ax-2 hasn’t been confirmed yet, Axiom says, and the two other Ax-2 crewmates are still being sorted out.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qRAPdDp94ho5T9raTydvdultQmQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22538075/Ax2_Group_Presskit2.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ax-2’s mission commander Peggy Whitson (left) and pilot John Shoffner (right).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WdTNfO"&gt;When Whitson retired from NASA in 2018, she didn’t think she’d go back to space again. “I didn’t think it was likely. Probably because of that, I was more excited to be assigned as an Axiom backup for Ax-1 and then prime commander for Ax-2 than even for my first spaceflight,” she told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in a phone interview. “It seemed even more unexpected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTDeiJ"&gt;Shoffner, 65, is a trained pilot, investor in the life sciences industry, and a racecar driver who started a GT3 motorsports racing team named J2-Racing with his wife. He and Whitson will do research on the ISS for 10x Genomics, a California-based biotechnology company that manufactures gene sequencing technology for researchers. Shoffner, an investor 10x Genomics, plans to test single-cell sequencing methods while in microgravity, a first for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g10pUT"&gt;“I’m going to try and help because I’m a geek. I like this stuff, too,” says Whitson, who holds a doctorate in biochemistry from Rice University and was once the deputy division chief for the Medical Sciences Division at Johnson Space Center, NASA’s astronaut headquarters in Houston.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NhuHb8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ax-2 is planned for mid-2022 — if it can find a parking spot on the ISS&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zSYiu1"&gt;Axiom says its private missions will launch every six months, meaning Ax-2 would launch in the middle of 2022 (or roughly half a year after Ax-1 in January 2022). But the date for Ax-2 depends largely on traffic at the space station, which only has two international docking adapters that serve as parking spaces for both cargo and government astronaut missions. Axiom will have to squeeze into the station’s increasingly busy schedule and reserve one of those adapters for the 10-day trip, including eight days docked to the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9d6uz"&gt;Earlier this month, NASA signed an agreement with Axiom to greenlight the company’s Ax-1 mission. The Ax-1 crew is still going through a rigorous training process intended to adjust crew members to the G forces of launching to space. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwjYNq"&gt;While its crew members will have to go through the same training, the Ax-2 mission is likely to be more costly than Ax-1. NASA has shifted the prices for hosting private astronaut missions on the space station, primarily a government-run research platform. Axiom’s second mission will be subject to the agency’s latest pricing table: a base of $5.2 million per person, and $4.8 million per mission to pay for planning and integration. The day rate for each passenger is anywhere between $88,000 and $164,000 to accommodate food, cargo, and other services. Axiom says it sorts this out with NASA and includes all of these charges in the customer’s single ticket price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdZ3Hv"&gt;Axiom, founded in 2016 by a veteran NASA ISS program manager, is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Axiom_Space/status/1380214866451959808?s=20"&gt;building&lt;/a&gt; its own private space station modules that it plans to attach to the ISS as soon as 2024. Whitson says her mission will help open doors for more ambitious crewed missions into space. “The future of spaceflight depends on us building an infrastructure that enables us to step further and further away from Earth,” she says. “This step by Axiom, introducing private astronauts to the space station, is going to be just the initial step.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams opens up to new collaborative apps that plug into meetings</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6hORw3weG-WehRmrNNpE5cJZCdA=/0x0:2640x1760/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69339256/microsoftteams.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hOZai4"&gt;Microsoft first let developers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332414/microsoft-teams-third-party-apps-calls-meetings-integration-features"&gt;build third-party apps into Teams last year&lt;/a&gt;, but the company is going a step further at Build 2021 today. In a push to get more app developers building for Teams, Microsoft is opening up its crucial APIs, Teams Store, and tools to what it calls collaborative apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuYFUO"&gt;Developers will soon be able to build apps that plug into the Teams meeting canvas, ones that use in-app purchases or subscriptions, and even create separate apps that get access to Teams’ real-time video and audio streams. “If you can build web apps, you can build extensions into Teams chats, channels, and meetings,” explains Jeff Teper, head of Microsoft 365 collaboration, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “You can build once, run, deploy anywhere.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bnNjuX"&gt;This means apps built for Teams will work across Windows, Mac, the web, iOS, Android, and even Linux. While we’ve seen some apps that plug into the meeting canvas previously, Microsoft is launching a preview that will allow devs to share apps like whiteboards and project boards and share apps more directly into the meetings area in Teams. Microsoft is also making it easier for devs to create these apps with greater integration into Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/flAA2klkfbmktfE7VFXHh6lSCvM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22537996/teamstogethermode.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Custom Together Mode scenes are on the way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GiQ71L"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317526/microsoft-teams-together-mode-dynamic-view-new-features"&gt;Together Mode for Teams&lt;/a&gt;, which uses AI to segment your face and shoulders and place you and your co-workers together in a virtual space, is also being opened up. “We’re giving people a toolkit so they can design their own Together Modes scenes,” says Teper. “We’re pretty excited to see what people come up with.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40KHr8"&gt;Later this summer, Microsoft will also allow third-party apps to access real-time audio and video streams from Teams. This will primarily allow for transcription or note-taking apps to process audio and video coming out of Teams, but it will also enable devs to create bespoke apps that access Teams. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZiOFj2mT8qKCJhMTYiVeGAQVLfc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22537998/teamstranscription.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Real-time access to Teams for transcription, note-taking, and more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sSvHq8"&gt;“Somebody could build a completely custom application that is different than the Teams UI and that app can interoperate with Teams via voice, video, or chat,” explains Teper. An example could be a hospital that wants to build a connection from their telehealth app into Teams to enable video calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2lCu4"&gt;Microsoft will also allow developers to sell their own subscriptions within their Teams apps. This opens up the Teams Store to in-app purchases. Microsoft hasn’t gone into detail on whether it takes a cut on sales here, but Teper is keen to point out Microsoft’s main focus is building an ecosystem of apps. “We may make some money in the marketplace, but our primary business model will be the Microsoft 365 licenses and the Azure and Power platform licenses that developers consume,” says Teper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iVhb98"&gt;With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22406472/microsoft-teams-145-million-daily-active-users-stats"&gt;145 million daily active users of Microsoft Teams&lt;/a&gt;, there certainly could be an appetite for more apps that plug into and appear inside of Teams meetings. Microsoft has always positioned Teams as a hub for productivity, and these latest announcements are clearly designed to make Teams a little more developer-friendly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hot summer days are even hotter for many Americans of color </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dangerous Heat Wave Grips Two-Thirds Of The Nation" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EleFbEd24dkZmH2rg7qPK2LlJVE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69339260/1163059092.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;CHICAGO, ILLINOIS - JULY 19: Swimmers cool off at 31st Street Beach as temperatures climb into the 90’s with a heat index expected to reach as high as 115 degrees on July 19, 2019 in Chicago, Illinois.&amp;nbsp; | Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0BNc2Q"&gt;In cities across the US, people of color are enduring hotter summer temperatures than their white counterparts, new research shows. It’s another sign that the consequences of rising temperatures will hit vulnerable communities harder than others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="YXpmUv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rising temperatures will hit vulnerable communities harder&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LVYsG9"&gt;A person of color, on average, lives in a census tract that’s more than a full degree Celsius (nearly 2 degrees Fahrenheit) hotter in the summer than their non-Hispanic white counterparts, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-22799-5"&gt;study published today in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That included anyone who did &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; identify as “white alone,” plus anyone who identifies as Hispanic. The difference in temperature was slightly larger still for Black residents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eASvML"&gt;Cities are typically &lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/heatislands"&gt;several degrees warmer&lt;/a&gt; than more rural areas, and areas within cities without much green space are even hotter. Asphalt, cement, and dark rooftops absorb heat, while exhaust from tail pipes and industry warm neighborhoods up even more. It’s a phenomenon called the “urban heat island effect.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="AslJUU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Extreme heat is already the deadliest weather-related disaster&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8KfQ6"&gt;Extreme heat is already the &lt;a href="https://www.weather.gov/hazstat/"&gt;deadliest&lt;/a&gt; weather-related disaster in the US. The urban heat island effect and climate change are making blistering temperatures even riskier for people who live in cities. The risks are even greater for some groups, like &lt;a href="https://grist.org/justice/another-legacy-of-redlining-unequal-exposure-to-heat-waves/"&gt;Black Americans, who have faced a long history of housing discrimination and disinvestment&lt;/a&gt;. A rise in even a few degrees poses serious threats, the study’s lead author warns. The average one-degree Celsius difference in temperatures that people of color experience in America masks more extreme disparities — perhaps up to 10 degrees Celsius — that some communities face. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jhzuad"&gt;“That’s a lot when you translate that into real impacts and how that feels on a summertime day,” says Angel Hsu, lead author of the study and an assistant professor of public policy and the environment, ecology, and energy at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFxMuA"&gt;Some neighborhoods in Hsu’s hometown of Greenville, South Carolina can see temperatures six to eight degrees Celsius higher than other parts of the city. They tended to be neighborhoods with higher proportions of Black residents. Other communities in Baltimore, Maryland got eight to ten degrees Celsius hotter than their neighbors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nU5D74"&gt;The research also showed that households below the poverty line, across all racial and ethnic groups, faced more blistering temperatures than more affluent households. But the average person of color still faced hotter temperatures than their white counterparts, regardless of income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsgnmE"&gt;That’s evidence that something fishy is going on with regard to race in particular, Hsu says. Other studies have suggested the same thing — Black, Asian, and Latino people are &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3701995/"&gt;more likely&lt;/a&gt; to live in urban heat islands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="dmn4KA"&gt;&lt;q&gt; A long, terrible history of segregation in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BbYq7x"&gt;There’s also a long, terrible history of segregation in the US that has pushed Black Americans and other marginalized groups into specific neighborhoods. Since the 1930s, financial institutions systemically denied home loans and &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/05/03/526655831/a-forgotten-history-of-how-the-u-s-government-segregated-america"&gt;insurance&lt;/a&gt; to Black Americans. The result was &lt;a href="https://grist.org/justice/extreme-heat-redlining-portland/"&gt;“redlined”&lt;/a&gt; neighborhoods, where &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/08/24/climate/racism-redlining-cities-global-warming.html"&gt;the majority of residents were Black&lt;/a&gt;. City planners slotted more roadways and big building complexes in and around redlined neighborhoods — and all that asphalt and concrete turned them into heat traps. Black Americans are also &lt;a href="https://naacp.org/resources/fumes-across-fence-line-health-impacts-air-pollution-oil-gas-facilities-african-american"&gt;more likely to live near polluting industries&lt;/a&gt;, which can also make neighborhoods hotter. Now, these neighborhoods are up to 7 degrees Celsius hotter than other neighborhoods, according to another &lt;a href="https://www.mdpi.com/2225-1154/8/1/12/htm"&gt;study&lt;/a&gt; published last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhyliD"&gt;All those disparities take a deadly toll. In New York City &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/epi/datatable47.pdf"&gt;between 2000 and 2012&lt;/a&gt;, African Americans made up about a quarter of the city’s population, but nearly half of its heat-related deaths. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juEqmE"&gt;The new study published today gives one of the most comprehensive views yet of how widespread the injustice still is. The researchers compared 2017 census data to high-resolution satellite-based temperature data for 497 urban areas in the US. They used satellite remote sensing to take stock of how surface temperatures differed between urban landscapes and more rural areas. They used that data to figure out how surfaces like asphalt made a location hotter compared to a more rural baseline. In the end, they discovered that in 169 of the 175 largest urban areas in the continental US, the average person of color lives with hotter summer daytime surface temperatures than a non-Hispanic white person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gahkqG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Something that was really surprising is how systemic this problem is.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gERz39"&gt;“Something that was really surprising is how systemic this problem is. We’re not talking about one or two cities or a couple of major cities like Chicago or San Francisco. We’re talking about [this trend] in every single city,” Hsu says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjuAWW"&gt;The next step, she says, is to look at a time series to figure out whether the temperature gaps between Americans of different races have gotten any better or worse over the years. She hopes that this work can identify what’s still causing these disparities and inform solutions to cool these neighborhoods down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="umGEL1"&gt;Looking forward, average temperatures are rising around the world because of climate change. But some places might feel the heat even more if they keep losing trees and green spaces to industrial development and urban sprawl.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cult classic Shin Megami Tensei III gets remastered after modern consoles ‘left the game behind’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qH2xvs4v6l4PKaD9g78nprmPoqM=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69338919/ss_a4d30220223c122c15c5c5fefcbd8e250ab79ba2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8V12nc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne&lt;/em&gt; has a lot in common with the rest of the cult roleplaying series — namely a focus on everything demonic and post-apocalyptic. And despite a punishing difficulty level, the game received rave reviews when it debuted on the PS2. But since then it has remained largely inaccessible. There’s no easy way to play &lt;em&gt;Nocturne&lt;/em&gt; on modern hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYMl00"&gt;That changes today with the release of a new remastered version that’s available on the Switch, Steam, and PS4. For director Kazuyuki Yamai, it marks yet another chance to bring the game to new players. While &lt;em&gt;Nocturne&lt;/em&gt; was initially a Japan-only release, Yamai worked on a special edition dubbed “Maniax” that would eventually launch in North America and Europe, as well as a larger director’s cut, called “Chronicle Edition,” that debuted in Japan in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dClYOM"&gt;I recently had the chance to share a few questions with Yamai over email. “Something stuck out to me was the fact that despite &lt;em&gt;Nocturne&lt;/em&gt;’s acclaim over the years, modern consoles have all but left the game behind,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Read on for more about the original intentions behind the game, the initial backlash from fans, the influence of the &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt; series, and why now is a good time for a remaster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QxEL7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kG3vS4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What can you tell me about the goals the team had on the original version? What did you want to do that was new or different for the series, and do you think the audience understood at the time?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1a2p5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nocturne&lt;/em&gt; was originally designed around the goal of fully rendering the world of &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei&lt;/em&gt; in 3D — and in a striking way that would set it apart from its predecessors. However, these lofty demands caused the initial development team to run into all sorts of issues and eventually disband, so our team inherited the project in something of a critical state.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9TnU0g"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“‘Nocturne’ actually faced a great deal of backlash from hardcore fans.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ulnl7s"&gt;Nonetheless, we made efforts to refine the core mechanics — things like the “press turn” battle system, recruiting, and leveling up demons — and sought to streamline the gameplay by removing complicated holdovers from previous titles, such as weapons and armor. So it wouldn’t be inaccurate to say we were responsible for overhauling the &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei&lt;/em&gt; series as a whole. A lot of these changes can be attributed to director Katsura Hashino, who later went on to turn &lt;em&gt;Persona 3&lt;/em&gt;-&lt;em&gt;5&lt;/em&gt; into wildly successful enterprises. He’s someone I’ve learned many invaluable lessons from over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rRcBJh"&gt;At the time of its initial release, &lt;em&gt;Nocturne&lt;/em&gt; actually faced a great deal of backlash from hardcore fans. Online forums were cluttered with negative statements like, “This isn’t &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei&lt;/em&gt; at all” or “This has lowered my expectations,” and I remember being heartbroken upon reading them. But as time passed, perceptions gradually began to shift, and by the time &lt;em&gt;Nocturne Maniax&lt;/em&gt; was released a year later, people had even started referring to the game as a masterpiece. This is the only time in my entire career that such an unexpected turnaround has happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wusIZQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jFs4m8oMiQg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KoXTuA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was it like going back to the game now so many years later? Were there elements that stuck out to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tSmocu"&gt;This marks my fourth time developing &lt;em&gt;Nocturne&lt;/em&gt; in all its various iterations, as I had previously worked on the original, &lt;em&gt;Maniax&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Chronicle Edition&lt;/em&gt;. So I couldn’t help but say to myself, “Wow, I guess I’m back at it again!” At this point, I’d like to be included in the Guinness Book of World Records for “Developing &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei III&lt;/em&gt; the Most Times.” But our fans have waited long enough for a remaster, so I was thrilled to hear this project was approved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nUjK1r"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Wow, I guess I’m back at it again!”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pw4YzS"&gt;Something stuck out to me was the fact that despite &lt;em&gt;Nocturne&lt;/em&gt;’s acclaim over the years, modern consoles have all but left the game behind. Our team is very aware that many younger players, particularly &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt; fans, are often drawn to &lt;em&gt;Nocturne&lt;/em&gt; but can’t access the game due to the gap in hardware. So with the remaster, we sought to deliver a fresh experience for new players that didn’t betray the first impressions of the original fans. In short, we aimed to recreate the feeling of experiencing &lt;em&gt;Nocturne&lt;/em&gt; for the first time but with vibrant, enhanced visuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLfLry"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What were some of the main areas you wanted to focus on for the remaster? Did you have any big regrets — things you couldn’t do because of time or technological reasons — that you wanted to fix this time around?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKWPyG"&gt;To summarize what was said above, our main focus was to recreate &lt;em&gt;Nocturne&lt;/em&gt; as authentically as possible. At the same time, certain aspects of the game did feel outdated, and portions of the dialogue had either aged poorly or lacked nuance, so we took great care to update these in a way that didn’t feel intrusive or artificial. There was also some ambiguity regarding the usage of old voice assets, so we ended up hiring new talent to reenact the demon voices, often doing many retakes in the process. After recording finished, our sound staff adjusted the effects with painstaking attention to detail, and we feel that the new voices are nearly indistinguishable from the originals, even to the most attentive fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ozqM6n"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Several times, the complexities of this endeavor pushed me to the breaking point.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1HpqQ"&gt;Upon reflecting on what we could or couldn’t implement with the original, there isn’t much that comes to mind. A large reason for that is because so much of the visuals and mechanics had already been perfected, and in my humble opinion, they still stand the test of time. But to remaster the game properly, a lot of polishing was needed, at least on the technical side (most of which centered around adding depth of field and eliminating obsolete graphical techniques, such as mipmaps). Because PS2 game architecture relied on vastly different elements than modern games (things like opacity and particle systems), we ended up spending a significant amount of time simply figuring out how to recreate old assets with the new technology at our disposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLlV2A"&gt;Several times, the complexities of this endeavor pushed me to the breaking point, making me think, “We’ll never be able to do this from scratch!” But then miraculous things would happen, such as &lt;em&gt;Nocturne&lt;/em&gt;’s original programmer coming in to write a shader that rendered graphics just like how they were in the old game. Efforts like these were what enabled the team to push past their challenges and move the project to completion.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M3k2BE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The series has become much less niche in the intervening years, especially with the success of &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Persona&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;. Did that influence your approach with the remaster?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Kf12s"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt; series was certainly a big factor in helping expand our market and allowing this remaster to come to fruition. It’s amazing how faithfully the &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt; series has stuck to its roots without drastically altering its image in a way that would betray fans’ expectations. I can proudly say that &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt; has evolved into a franchise that has brought a diverse range of players into the &lt;em&gt;Megaten&lt;/em&gt; fold. But for those who are unfamiliar with &lt;em&gt;Nocturne&lt;/em&gt;, perhaps because they grew up in a generation without it, please note that the remaster was designed to provide the same unadulterated thrills as the original when it first came out.&lt;/p&gt;
