    <title>Google Podcasts now supports private RSS feeds so you can listen to the shows you pay to access</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YFPMbeQckkWcQe49mVMAz4Qhc0U=/0x0:820x547/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68451718/googlepodcasts_rss_feed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google Podcasts&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bzA9VP"&gt;Google Podcasts is finally getting a feature that’s already standard across most listening apps: private RSS feed support. The head of product for Google Podcasts, Zack Reneau-Wedeen, made the announcement &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZackRW/status/1334590407850696705"&gt;on Twitter today&lt;/a&gt; and shouted out some networks that are especially reliant on private feeds, including Patreon, Slate, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/29/18522031/redcircle-podcast-service-hosting-analytics-cross-promotion"&gt;Red Circle&lt;/a&gt;, and Supercast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jD29G"&gt;To access the feature, tap over to the activity tab in the bottom right-hand corner and slide over to the Subscriptions tab, then tap the plus symbol. You’ll then be prompted to add by RSS feed. You can see the entire process below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NDZOis"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Important milestone in our mission to help creators grow their audience and build sustainable businesses — in whichever ways work best for them!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Add your own RSS feed on Google Podcasts here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/Koiqsx2Iex"&gt;https://t.co/Koiqsx2Iex&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/RzcVTrt1EB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/RzcVTrt1EB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Gabe Bender (@GabeBender) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GabeBender/status/1334593474688126979?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EchEw2"&gt;This is a relatively standard feature that’s helped prop up the podcasting business for creators. On Patreon, for example, members often pay for access to a subscribers-only feed. To access that content, the creator sends them a private RSS feed they then can insert into their favorite listening app to retrieve the audio. It’s a useful thing to support both for creators and listeners, so it’s not surprising Google would build this in. In fact, it’s been a long time coming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yodYi5"&gt;Still, not every app supports the feature, including, most notably, Spotify. But if Google Podcasts, and even Spotify, wants to become the places where people consume all of their audio, they have to support private RSS feeds, at least for the time being because it’s how creators get their shows out to fans while still getting paid.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Leak left 243 million Brazilians’ medical records and personal info ripe for the picking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u-jwl-DP5TSKANdnUejLGLIBN7o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68451505/acastro_170621_1777_0006_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BEbABR"&gt;The personal information of more than 243 million Brazilians was potentially accessible for at least six months thanks to weakly encoded credentials kept in the source code of the Brazilian Ministry of Health’s website (&lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/data-of-243-million-brazilians-exposed-online-via-website-source-code/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The security issue was first reported by &lt;a href="https://saude.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,nova-falha-do-ministerio-da-saude-expoe-dados-pessoais-de-mais-de-200-milhoes,70003536340"&gt;Brazilian publication &lt;em&gt;Estadão&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6knfqU"&gt;The personal data of anyone who had registered with Sistema Único de Saúde (SUS), Brazil’s national health system, could be viewed. That data included people’s full names, addresses, and telephone numbers, reported &lt;em&gt;Estadão.&lt;/em&gt; The database also includes records of living and dead people as the population of Brazil was more than 211 million in 2019, &lt;a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=BR"&gt;according to The World Bank&lt;/a&gt;, which is about 32 million fewer people than the reported number of records that were potentially accessible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjAYPZ"&gt;The Ministry of Health’s website stored the encoded access credentials to the database of personal information in its source code, reports &lt;em&gt;Estadão&lt;/em&gt;. However, the login and password were encoded using Base64, a method that can be easily decoded. Given that you can look at any website’s source code with a keyboard shortcut or by accessing it in a menu, potentially anyone could have found these encrypted credentials and, if they were savvy enough, decoded them to then access the personal records of Brazilians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K9qJJu"&gt;Health records can be &lt;a href="https://www.securelink.com/blog/healthcare-data-new-prize-hackers/"&gt;quite valuable&lt;/a&gt; on the black market given the amount of personal information they often include. If a bad actor knew of this vulnerability, it’s very possible they could have taken this data to use for their own nefarious purposes or to sell later. The Ministry of Health has corrected the problem, according to &lt;em&gt;Estadão&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Justice Department is suing Facebook for side-stepping visa rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Munich Security Conference" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xbjoXY6CzUei_fdRTPNOsNA7ksI=/0x13:5064x3389/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68451375/1200868249.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sven Hoppe/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qckWVB"&gt;The Justice Department has &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-files-lawsuit-against-facebook-discriminating-against-us-workers"&gt;filed charges against Facebook&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly discriminating against US workers in its hiring practices. &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142257/united_states_v._facebook_complaint_0.pdf"&gt;The complaint&lt;/a&gt;, filed on Thursday, alleges that the company maintained a separate job listing process for visa-eligible job postings, both limiting the visibility of the job listing online and insisting that job seekers submit their applications by mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oqgLyU"&gt;According to the Justice Department, the result was a systematic effort to discourage US workers from applying for an entire class of jobs at Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HkYuhJ"&gt;“Facebook’s discriminatory recruitment and hiring practice is routine, ongoing, and widespread,” the complaint reads. “It discriminates against U.S. workers because of their immigration or citizenship status, and it harms them by limiting their ability to apply, to be considered, and to be hired.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="khY3Q5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook’s discriminatory recruitment and hiring practice is routine, ongoing, and widespread”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YcoPQs"&gt;In simple terms, prosecutors believe Facebook was hiding job listings reserved for visa-bound workers that the company had already contacted and knew it wanted to hire. But in its rush to clear the lane for its preferred applicant, the company allegedly violated important labor rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t7tPFt"&gt;The Justice Department’s case focuses on permanent labor certifications at Facebook, which enable visa holders to work in the United States indefinitely (as opposed to guest worker visas like the H-1B that must be renewed every few years). US law &lt;a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/programs/permanent"&gt;requires an extensive process&lt;/a&gt; for permanent labor certification and approves applications only after a company attests that it could not find a qualified US worker for the position.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="21lqAe"&gt;But when a guest worker at Facebook expressed interest in a permanent position, the complaint alleges, “Facebook diverged from its normal recruiting protocols by not advertising the position on its external website, &lt;a href="http://Facebook.com/careers"&gt;Facebook.com/careers&lt;/a&gt;, by not accepting online applications, and by requiring interested applicants to apply to the position by mail.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qyIhGe"&gt;In one particularly strange note, the complaint notes that visa-linked job openings were listed in the print version of the &lt;em&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; but not the paper’s website, even though the Chronicle offers free online listing for every ad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1MZMv2"&gt;Prosecutors say the double standard has been in place since at least the beginning of 2018 and has yet to be remedied. Facebook received more than 2,600 permanent labor certifications for its employees during the named period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CqjikT"&gt;Reached for comment, Facebook said it was cooperating with the Department of Justice but disagreed with its findings. “Facebook has been cooperating with the DOJ in its review of this issue,” a representative said, “and while we dispute the allegations in the complaint, we cannot comment further on pending litigation.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is stepping up moderation against anti-Black hate speech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PbEyqbqTDfUku3NgAfdILf2MIF8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68451258/jbareham_180405_1777_facebook_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="i3me8N"&gt;Facebook has started weighting anti-Black hate speech on its platform as higher priority than hate speech directed at white people, men, and Americans in an effort to address the disproportionate effects such speech has on minority groups, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1id5x"&gt;The result is that Facebook’s automated moderation systems for detecting and taking action against hate speech should now more proactively scan the site for such racist content. Meanwhile, more innocuous forms of hate speech, like those directed at white people or men in general, are deemed lower priority and left alone unless a user reports them. Facebook has internally deemed this approach “WOW,” or “worst of the worst” for the types of behaviors it now wants to focus its resources on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W2jJco"&gt;The effort is part of a new hate speech project within Facebook, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/03/facebook-hate-speech/"&gt;first reported earlier today by &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, that aims to address years of inaction regarding racial discrimination on the platform. Activists, civil rights advocates, and researchers of the platform have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/7/10/21318718/facebook-civil-rights-audit-critique-size-congress"&gt;long accused Facebook of abetting hate speech&lt;/a&gt; and operating a moderation system that doesn’t take into account real-world effects of bias and the way racism disproportionately affects minorities. Only in July of this year did Facebook say it would begin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21333405/facebook-instagram-racial-bias-equity-team-formed-ai-algorithms"&gt;studying racial bias in its algorithms&lt;/a&gt;, after executives spent years resisting doing so by forming new research-focused equity teams for its main app and Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jUJiKi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We know that hate speech targeted towards underrepresented groups can be the most harmful.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1wFhZt"&gt;Now, the company says it’s taking steps to ensure it moderates its platform to help the most vulnerable victims of hate speech and abuse — instead of treating the problem as one that affects everyone in equal measure. The new moderation changes aren’t just aimed at helping root out anti-Black hate speech, but also hate speech directed toward Muslims, Jewish people, and members of the LGBTQ+ community. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NSehH8"&gt;“We know that hate speech targeted towards underrepresented groups can be the most harmful, which is why we have focused our technology on finding the hate speech that users and experts tell us is the most serious,” says Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokesperson, in a statement given to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XorUEw"&gt;“Over the past year, we’ve also updated our policies to catch more implicit hate speech, such as content depicting Blackface, stereotypes about Jewish people controlling the world, and banned holocaust denial,” Aldous adds. “Thanks to significant investments in our technology we proactively detect 95 percent of the content we remove and we continue to improve how we enforce our rules as hate speech evolves over time.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eNrjmG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>People are putting their routers in jail to protect themselves from harmless Wi-Fi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fN9xrBVL1WdSwlUcBkrP6l0ACq4=/0x71:1860x1311/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68451248/Screen_Shot_2020_12_03_at_3.37.12_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KDdXDD"&gt;Please do not put your internet router in a Faraday cage. Please do not put your internet router in a Faraday cage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZcUIg"&gt;If you’re reading this, as someone who uses the internet, this may seem obvious. A Faraday cage, after all, blocks electromagnetic radiation and signals from escaping. Putting one around your router would, by very similar physics, prevent those same radio waves that &lt;em&gt;carry your internet &lt;/em&gt;from reaching your devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OcnGxT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;So apparently putting Faraday cages around routers has become a thing for the 5g conspiracy nuts and there are companies out there ready to cash in. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My sides are in orbit. &lt;a href="https://t.co/mGcud5Kb70"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mGcud5Kb70&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;—  Ansgar Odinson  (@AnsgarTOdinson) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AnsgarTOdinson/status/1334015546979803137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 2, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OrIa5V"&gt;And yet, an entire cottage industry of con artists looking to make a quick buck by selling “router shields” that claim to fix the issue and protect you and your loved ones from your Wi-Fi has popped up this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqCjER"&gt;The grift is a clever one — the Faraday cages are being sold at fairly ridiculous prices for metal boxes (typically between $70 to $100 on Amazon), meaning that sellers are likely making a considerable profit here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUlX4Y"&gt;And the products themselves, while based entirely in conspiracy, aren’t entirely lying, unless it’s about their claims that these boxes “should not at all affect signal range and internet speed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHANZk"&gt;Putting what effectively amounts to a Faraday cage around your router to block electromagnetic radiation will do exactly that. It’ll block almost all the signal from your router, as any number of the amusing Amazon reviewers complaining about degraded signal strength and internet speeds have learned:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FyhzMUhp7awMcJnOtlEYSwTRmJA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142174/Screen_Shot_2020_12_03_at_3.11.25_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B23LyZ"&gt;Equally ironic are reviews complaining that the shields aren’t working at all and that their internet is working just fine:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u2Gd58mEet420OGFklA2okf8b3w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142111/Screen_Shot_2020_12_03_at_9.21.00_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dwISc3"&gt;That’s likely due to poorly designed cages — some of them appear to simply be overpriced &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/DecoBros-Cabinet-Basket-Organizer-Silver/dp/B00COC66A0/ref=sr_1_35?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=mesh+storage+container&amp;amp;qid=1607026454&amp;amp;sr=8-35&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;mesh storage boxes&lt;/a&gt;. (Also amusing are the sellers concerned about cheaper “counterfeit” copies of their shields, who have taken to boasting about their “original” designs or US origins to appeal to buyers.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RsXCbx"&gt;The conspiracy has been going on for some time, with some Amazon listings that date back years, but catapulted to the spotlight this week after a viral tweet from Twitter user &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AnsgarTOdinson/status/1334015546979803137"&gt;@AnsgarTOdinson&lt;/a&gt;. Recent (and equally nonsensical) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21276912/5g-conspiracy-theories-coronavirus-uk-telecoms-engineers-attacks-abuse"&gt;conspiracies about 5G cellular networks&lt;/a&gt; — which operate using similar swaths of the electromagnetic spectrum as Wi-Fi routers — also likely helped contribute to the spread of the conspiracy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Vw6emr"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Everything you need to know about 5G|70098" data-volume-uuid="9c3b53f77" data-volume-id="70098" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-916" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BEEvbr"&gt;All of this is completely beside the point: routers &lt;em&gt;don’t&lt;/em&gt; emit harmful electromagnetic radiation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKMaZ2"&gt;As we’ve written many times here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, nearly all wireless technology — be it AM / FM radio, cellphone networks for calling, LTE, 5G, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and even the IR remote you use to turn on your television — is based on transmitting and receiving signals broadcast on some part of the electromagnetic spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZJkkD"&gt;When we talk about “electromagnetic radiation,” we’re just describing a wave of photons traveling through space. Even light — what you use to see — is a form of electromagnetic radiation, and a harmless one at that (despite having a far higher frequency than any radio or microwaves used for cellular or internet). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="a7VksH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G coronavirus conspiracy theorists are endangering the workers who keep networks running","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21276912/5g-conspiracy-theories-coronavirus-uk-telecoms-engineers-attacks-abuse"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="EWgoZe"&gt;Wi-Fi — and 5G internet and all those aforementioned forms of wireless communication — all are fundamentally similar in how they work and are a form of what’s called non-ionizing radiation. Non-ionizing means that it doesn’t have enough energy to move any electrons from atoms and degrade cells, which is the kind of danger that you probably think of when the word “radiation” comes to mind. But it’s just not physically possible for your internet router to do that, and your router is no more of a danger to you than a TV remote or your car’s radio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fN0lg5"&gt;Look, I get it. “Radiation” is a scary word, and the idea that your internet router is sending out invisible, harmful energy could be concerning, if it were remotely true. But fortunately, based on all the current scientific evidence (as described by the &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emitting-products/cell-phones/do-cell-phones-pose-health-hazard"&gt;Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk/radiation/cell-phones-fact-sheet"&gt;National Cancer Institute&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/radiation-exposure/cellular-phones.html"&gt;American Cancer Society&lt;/a&gt;), that “danger” just isn’t there. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Developers can now sign up for Apple’s reduced 15 percent App Store cut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Photo of a group of apps on an iPhone." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dpqJ8RliLpAJvP1Ksqi_Wb0ASqQ=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68450369/1228782512.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oWPPg9"&gt;Apple has opened enrollment in its new small business program that will allow eligible app developers to receive 15 percent more from App Store sales, the company &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=6lyxewwp"&gt;announced on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. Apple says “the vast majority of developers on the App Store who sell digital goods and services are eligible” and all developers need to do to qualify is complete the company’s enrollment form &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/"&gt;available online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QG4Pw"&gt;Apple announced the new program &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt;, marking a significant change in how the App Store is structured. Under the new terms of the program, eligible developers making under $1 million per year in App Store sales and in-app purchase revenue are eligible for the reduced commission rate of 15 percent for the following year. Apple typically takes 30 percent of all App Store revenue on digital items as per its longstanding policy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpZWkP"&gt;Although Apple has never released specific figures regarding how much developers earn per year or how much the App Store grosses, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/apple-app-store-had-estimated-gross-sales-of-50-billion-in-2019.html#:~:text=Apple's%20App%20Store%20platform%20grossed,Store%20alone%20would%20be%20no."&gt;analysts estimate&lt;/a&gt; the App Store is responsible for more than $50 billion in sales in 2019, while analytics firm Sensor Tower estimates about 98 percent of developers are responsible for just 5 percent of that amount and would qualify for the new program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3WsDTM"&gt;Here, in Apple’s words, are the basics as outlined by &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/"&gt;its new FAQ&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uE8Opq"&gt;Existing developers who made up to 1 million USD in proceeds in 2020 for all their apps, as well as developers new to the App Store, can qualify for the program and the reduced commission.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wcYOuQ"&gt;If a participating developer surpasses the 1 million USD threshold, the standard commission rate will apply for the remainder of the year.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t7MsLL"&gt;If a developer’s proceeds fall below the 1 million USD threshold in a future calendar year, they can re-qualify for the 15% commission the year after.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="p7ov6D"&gt;Developers must identify any Associated Developer Accounts to determine proceeds eligibility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0swbGW"&gt;Apple has set a deadline of December 18th, 2020 at 10AM PT / 1PM ET for submitting enrollment, with a January 1st, 2021 start date for when the proceeds adjustment takes effect. The FAQ states that if a developer applies after the deadline, they must wait until 15 days after they are approved to see the reduced commission rates, and approval may not happen until well into spring of next year. If you’re a new developer with no proceeds, you can submit enrollment to the program and see the reduced App Store rate immediately upon approval if your app is then live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JlqdsL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WgkfhV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Warner Bros. will release all of its new 2021 movies simultaneously on HBO Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d_v7nf2aTIxH3aujJEuP_SZNOSk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68450048/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Lsq6E4"&gt;WarnerMedia is pushing even more aggressively into streaming by releasing every single one of its movies in 2021 simultaneously on HBO Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdPM7m"&gt;There are some limitations to the new business model. The movies will only stream on HBO Max for one month before leaving the platform for a period of time. They will also play in theaters simultaneously, keeping the relationship with movie theater distributors like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514822/amc-theaters-cash-movies-delays-closing-pandemic-debt-regal"&gt;AMC and Regal&lt;/a&gt;. The plan is to run this experiment for one year. For people who don’t have access to HBO Max in their market, it appears that theatrical releases will still be the go-to option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaDPNy"&gt;The movies Warner Bros. is planning to release for now include: &lt;em&gt;The Little Things, Judas and the Black Messiah, Tom &amp;amp; Jerry, Godzilla vs. Kong, Mortal Kombat, Those Who Wish Me Dead, The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It, In The Heights, Space Jam: A New Legacy, The &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21377415/suicide-squad-2-james-gunn-fandome-characters-introduction-dc-comics"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Reminiscence, Malignant, Dune, The Many Saints of Newark, King Richard, Cry Macho, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/21/20826649/matrix-sequel-m4trix-keanu-reeves-carrie-anne-moss-lana-wachowski-fan-wishes"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Matrix 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnwYpS"&gt;These titles could change depending on delays. All films will be released on HBO Max in 4K Ultra HD and HDR. The moves will also likely help WarnerMedia reach an agreement with Roku after months of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324139/peacock-roku-amazon-fire-tv-hbo-max-streaming-warnermedia-nbcuniversal-disney-apple"&gt;fighting over a deal&lt;/a&gt;. WarnerMedia is also offering a limited deal, making HBO Max 22 percent cheaper for people who sign up for six months. The $69.99 price works out to just under $12 a month instead of $15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ihUhJg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re expecting it to continue to be choppy.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AwVOwr"&gt;“We’re living in unprecedented times which call for creative solutions, including this new initiative for the Warner Bros. Pictures Group,” said Warner Bros. CEO Ann Sarnoff. “No one wants films back on the big screen more than we do. We know new content is the lifeblood of theatrical exhibition, but we have to balance this with the reality that most theaters in the U.S. will likely operate at reduced capacity throughout 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zsVszk"&gt;On one hand, it’s a simple decision for Warner Bros., WarnerMedia, and parent company AT&amp;amp;T. Executives haven’t tried to hide how important HBO Max is to the future of the business. It’s also no secret that HBO Max isn’t seeing as many subscriber additions as WarnerMedia would like. Warner Bros. tried to release a movie in theaters during the pandemic — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551390/tenet-home-release-date-dvd-blu-ray-digital-nolan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — and the studio lost hundreds of millions of dollars. These factors, on top of a resurgence of COVID-19 cases around the world that put the next several months of any group activities at risk, present the perfect opportunity for WarnerMedia to experiment. Think of what AT&amp;amp;T CEO John Stankey told investors just a couple of months ago about theatrical releases in 2021:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="6U3Mgs"&gt;We’re not optimistic. We’re not looking that we’re seeing here — expecting a huge recovery in theatrical moving into the early part of next year. We’re expecting it to continue to be choppy. As a result of that, we’re having to evaluate all of our options and keeping them open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="90ksKs"&gt;WarnerMedia also isn’t the only company using this time to experiment with things that would have played out several years from now. Disney moved &lt;em&gt;Hamilton, Artemis Fowl, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Soul &lt;/em&gt;to streaming only exclusives. It also released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21428088/mulan-review-disney-live-action-remake"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mulan &lt;/em&gt;exclusively&lt;/a&gt; on Disney Plus for $30 in September. Disney CEO Bob Chapek told analysts on the company’s recent fourth quarter call that despite the backlash the movie received, it performed well (no numbers were given) and made the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562796/disney-plus-one-year-earnings-q4-mandalorian-streaming-subscribers-theaters"&gt;case to Disney executives&lt;/a&gt; that a Premier Access strategy that could work. Disney will likely continue to move certain titles to Disney Plus as exclusives, but it could also decide to mirror what Warner Bros. is doing and release movies in theaters at the same time as Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QAfPlj"&gt;Streaming is a balance game: there needs to be a consistent addition of new titles to attract subscribers as a platform scales, with a full library of beloved and various TV shows and movies that keep people around. You likely won’t sign up for HBO Max just to watch &lt;em&gt;Friends,&lt;/em&gt; but you might sign up to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21504152/wonder-woman-1984-release-delay-new-date-warner-bros-disney-black-widow-dune-tenet"&gt;watch &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and then stick around to watch &lt;em&gt;Friends.&lt;/em&gt; That’s part one. But the increased competition in the space means that competitors are doing the same thing, often with big franchise IP (Disney) or top talent (Netflix, Amazon). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqN5lq"&gt;The key to “winning” is demanding attention. By having a new mega release every single month, there are more reasons for people to stay subscribed. Having those constantly, on top of regular library programming that keeps people opening HBO Max in between big releases, keeps attention. (Netflix knows this and executes on it very well.) It’s a constant cycle of needing more, needing quality, and needing big. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1sxHRe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Streaming is a balance game&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5Mx3V1"&gt;One of the big questions this development brings up is what happens to theaters? 2020 has been one of the most devastating years for the theatrical industry. Now, it’s tougher than ever to convince people to risk their lives in a theater when studios are making films available to them to watch at home. Theater chains have pointed to studios moving their titles to streaming platforms as a big part of the problem, but the theater industry has struggled for decades. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvSwce"&gt;In 2019, people, on average, visited a movie theater less than four times, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-07/hollywood-box-office-numbers-surge-even-as-americans-stay-home"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;— &lt;/em&gt;a record low since 2002. Of the movies people did go out to see, 25 of the top-grossing films made up 50 percent of the box office. Those movies are important to the studios (&lt;em&gt;Avengers: Endgame &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/29/20734621/disney-record-breaking-2019-box-office-avengers-endgame-lion-king-aladdin-avatar"&gt;brought in $2.8 billion&lt;/a&gt;) and the theaters. AMC needs Disney, but Disney would also like to keep its relationship with AMC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbbhbs"&gt;The real question is whether Warner Bros. is working out deals with the theaters to make this transition beneficial to both sides. When Universal worked out its deal with AMC Theaters for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345713/amc-universal-movies-theaters-digital-rentals-pvod-streaming-agreement"&gt;shorter exclusivity window&lt;/a&gt; (the time a movie must play in theaters before it can end up on digital retailers like Amazon or NBCUniversal’s Peacock), AMC CEO Adam Aron noted that AMC would also receive some form of revenue. Warner Bros. doesn’t want to lose its relationship with AMC, making it reasonable to assume that some kind of deal was put in place before the announcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPOXj2"&gt;Blockbusters are always going to go to theaters in some form. Warner Bros., however, is betting big that the future of theaters isn’t &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; going to be in theaters — and it’s going all in on that in 2021. Executives are betting on simultaneous releases to help drive as much revenue as possible, from wherever people want to watch. If that’s in a theater, sure. If it’s at home, great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QRn3UC"&gt;What’s increasingly clear, however, is that, despite WarnerMedia saying this is a one-year event, it’s probably not. Once the genie is out of the bottle, it’s hard to stuff back in. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Drone footage shows the shocking collapse of the Arecibo Observatory</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BGfKc6hCahMDKditbfCN1Tfqre4=/0x0:600x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68449981/arecibo_collapse.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yLpjVs"&gt;Today, the National Science Foundation (NSF) released shocking footage of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21754959/arecibo-observatory-platform-collapse-dish-puerto-rico-telescope"&gt;the collapse of the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico&lt;/a&gt;. The video, captured on December 1st, shows the moment when support cables snapped, causing the massive 900-ton structure suspended above Arecibo to fall onto the observatory’s iconic 1,000-foot-wide dish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ll4nGL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the drone operator was very adept to see what was happening.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7kKJcx"&gt;The videos of the collapse were captured by a camera located in Arecibo’s Operations Control Center, as well as from a drone located above the platform at the time of collapse. The operator of the drone was able to adjust the drone camera once the platform started to fall and capture the moment of impact. NSF, which oversees Arecibo, had been doing hourly monitoring of the observatory with drones, ever since engineers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575025/arecibo-observatory-puerto-rico-decommission-structural-collapse-cable-break"&gt;warned that the structure was on the verge of collapsing in November&lt;/a&gt;. “I think we were just lucky and the drone operator was very adept to see what was happening and be able to turn the camera,” Ashley Zauderer, the NSF program manager for Arecibo Observatory, said during a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D2sk4A"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Arecibo Observatory Collapse|99655" data-volume-uuid="7ab800b8d" data-volume-id="99655" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-16" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="chorus"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ilhJpB"&gt;The footage highlights the moment when multiple cables snapped, causing the platform to swing outward and hit the side of the dish. The collapse also brought down the tops of the three support towers surrounding Arecibo, where the cables had been connected to keep the platform in the air. “The cables that go from the top of Tower 4 to the platform — they’re very faint in the camera view but they’re there,” said John Abruzzo, a contractor at engineering consulting firm Thornton Tomasetti,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;hired by the University of Central Florida. “And so it’s those cables that fail near the tower top first, and then once those fail, the platform then loses stability and starts to come down,” Abruzzo said, describing the first video from the control center.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="saU2ZL"&gt;The collapse of Arecibo didn’t come as a surprise. Following the failure of two support cables in both August and November, engineers had concluded that there was no safe way to repair Arecibo and that the platform could fall onto the dish at any moment. NSF hoped to do a controlled demolition of the telescope before that happened, but the collapse occurred before any kind of action could take place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="E9r0Nz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it’s very early for us to comment on the replacement.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ime1Rj"&gt;Now NSF is trying to figure out a path forward, which mostly revolves around figuring out how to clean up Arecibo in a safe manner. Engineers need to do a full environmental assessment of the area and figure out how stable the remaining structures are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6S62v2"&gt;Replacing Arecibo would be a much longer process, involving decisions from lawmakers. “With regards to replacement, NSF has a very well defined process for funding and constructing large scale infrastructure — including telescopes,” Ralph Gaume, director of NSF’s division of astronomical sciences&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;said. “It’s a multi-year process that involves congressional appropriations, and the assessment and needs of the scientific community. So it’s very early for us to comment on the replacement.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter turns off threaded replies because they made conversations hard to read</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6QgdNa"&gt;Twitter has been experimenting with threaded replies for some time as a way to potentially make replies easier to read and follow. But the company has decided to end those experiments because of user feedback, it announced on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KHs05V"&gt;“We asked and you let us know this reply layout wasn’t it, as it was harder to read and join conversations,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1334544255298232320"&gt;the company wrote in a tweet&lt;/a&gt; published today. “So we’ve turned off this format to work on other ways to improve conversations on Twitter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JvPAXT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Your feedback shapes Twitter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We asked and you let us know this reply layout wasn’t it, as it was harder to read and join conversations.

&lt;p id="IQ6v7g"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterComms/status/1334552671462641664"&gt;follow-up tweet&lt;/a&gt;, the company said threaded replies made conversations harder to read and join and that people wanted more context about who they were talking to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VOylI6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Some learnings:&lt;br&gt;*the new look made convos harder to read &amp;amp; join – we’re exploring other ways to make this easier.&lt;br&gt;*you want more context about who you're talking to – we're working to add this.&lt;br&gt;*you want more control – we’re iterating on our convo settings.&lt;a href="https://t.co/UzS08x4Jcf"&gt;https://t.co/UzS08x4Jcf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Comms (@TwitterComms) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterComms/status/1334552671462641664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MsqWwU"&gt;Twitter is also shutting down its beta app, which the company called twttr, designed for experiments like threaded replies. “For now we’re turning [twttr] off so we can work on new tests to improve the conversation experience on Twitter,” the company said &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1334545842972332032"&gt;in another tweet&lt;/a&gt;. People currently using twttr will lose access for now, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterComms/status/1334552672435720193"&gt;according to the company&lt;/a&gt;, but Twitter is exploring potential next steps for the app as it develops future plans to test new products, a Twitter spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Cr1Poq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We appreciate the feedback you gave us through this run of our prototype app twttr. For now we’re turning it off so we can work on new tests to improve the conversation experience on Twitter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you’re using twttr, switch to the main Twitter app to keep up with what’s happening. &lt;a href="https://t.co/xq4emx9HeH"&gt;https://t.co/xq4emx9HeH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1334545842972332032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IZX49V"&gt;Trying to follow more than even a few replies on most tweets can be a headache (see: the &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2019/2/12/18222558/kara-swisher-jack-dorsey-twitter-interview-conversation-karajack-livetweet"&gt;infamous Twitter conversation&lt;/a&gt; between CEO Jack Dorsey and &lt;em&gt;Recode&lt;/em&gt; co-founder Kara Swisher), and threaded replies were Twitter’s attempt to make tracking them more straightforward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xSoG0Q"&gt;Twitter first signaled it was considering threaded replies back &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/31/17807092/twitter-threading-replies-status-update-product-test-update"&gt;in August 2018&lt;/a&gt;, rolled them out along with twttr &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/12/18262457/twitter-twttr-beta-app-threaded-replies-hands-on"&gt;in March 2019&lt;/a&gt;, added them to the iOS app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21117608/twitter-ios-app-replies-design-ui-change-update"&gt;in January&lt;/a&gt;, and revised how threaded replies looked for some on iOS and the web &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21249011/twitter-threaded-conversations-test-ios-web-lines-indents-interface-hiding-like-retweet-buttons"&gt;in May&lt;/a&gt;. But it seems the product change was one users didn’t like, so Twitter is reverting back to its old system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dSrMN1"&gt;Hopefully, the company comes up with a new solution at some point. But for now, we’ll be stuck scrolling forever on high-reply tweets to figure out exactly what’s going on.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google fires prominent AI ethicist Timnit Gebru</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QIDSeL"&gt;Timnit Gebru, one of Google’s top artificial intelligence researchers, says the company abruptly fired her yesterday. The technical co-lead of Google’s Ethical Artificial Intelligence Team claims managers were upset about an email she’d sent to colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKekMh"&gt;The email, which was sent to the Brain Women and Allies listserv, voiced frustration that managers were trying to get Gebru to retract a research paper. &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical"&gt;The full text was first published in &lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “A week before you go out on vacation, you see a meeting pop up at 4:30pm PST on your calendar,” it reads. “Then in that meeting your manager’s manager tells you ‘it has been decided’ that you need to retract this paper by next week... You are not worth having any conversations about this, since you are not someone whose humanity (let alone expertise recognized by journalists, governments, scientists, civic organizations such as the electronic frontiers foundation etc) is acknowledged or valued in this company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mPkBNn"&gt;After the email went out, Gebru told managers that certain conditions had to be met in order for her to stay at the company. Otherwise, she would have to work on a transition plan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tweet-text"&gt;Megan Kacholia, vice president of engineering at Google Research, said she could not meet the conditions and accepted Gebru’s resignation as a result, &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/noted-a-i-ethicist-timnit-gebru-leaves-google-following-tense-email-exchange-f602cdb7fe89"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Kacholia added, “However, we believe the end of your employment should happen faster than your email reflects because certain aspects of the email you sent last night to non-management employees in the brain group reflect behavior that is inconsistent with the expectations of a Google manager,” according to Gebru. On Twitter, she claimed &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1334352694664957952"&gt;the decision to fire her ultimately came from Google’s head of AI, Jeff Dean&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6JOP9V"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apparently my manager’s manager sent an email my direct reports saying she accepted my resignation. I hadn’t resigned—I had asked for simple conditions first and said I would respond when I’m back from vacation. But I guess she decided for me :) that’s the lawyer speak.&lt;/p&gt;— Timnit Gebru (@timnitGebru) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timnitGebru/status/1334341991795142667?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xZLjqv"&gt;Dean sent an email to Google staff Thursday morning explaining his view Gebru’s departure, which was first &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical"&gt;obtained and published by &lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCsHwT"&gt;“Timnit co-authored a paper with four fellow Googlers as well as some external collaborators that needed to go through our review process (as is the case with all externally submitted papers),” the email reads. “Unfortunately, this particular paper was only shared with a day’s notice before its deadline — we require two weeks for this sort of review — and then instead of awaiting reviewer feedback, it was approved for submission and submitted. A cross functional team then reviewed the paper as part of our regular process and the authors were informed that it didn’t meet our bar for publication and were given feedback about why...We acknowledge that the authors were extremely disappointed with the decision that Megan and I ultimately made, especially as they’d already submitted the paper.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yvbhX"&gt;Gebru is famous for her work on algorithmic bias, particularly in facial recognition technology. In 2018, she co-authored a paper with Joy Buolamwini showing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21287101/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-police-ban-one-year-ai-racial-bias"&gt;error rates for identifying darker-skinned people were far higher than the error rates for identifying white-skinned people&lt;/a&gt;, in part because the datasets used to train algorithms were overwhelmingly white. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBMDNy"&gt;News of Gebru’s alleged firing swept through Twitter yesterday, prompting an outpouring of support from colleagues and collaborators. “I have your back as you have always had mine,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jovialjoy/status/1334495010427899906"&gt;Buolamwini tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. “You are brilliant and respected. You listen to those others readily ignore. You ask hard questions not to advance yourself but to uplift the communities we owe our foundations. I am proud to call you leader mentor friend sister.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VuivGR"&gt;Hours earlier, news broke about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22047383/google-spied-workers-before-firing-labor-complaint"&gt;the National Labor Relations Board filing a complaint against Google&lt;/a&gt; for firing two workers last year in the wake of employee organizing efforts. At the time, Google said the employees, Laurence Berland and Kathryn Spiers, had violated security policies and internal systems. But the NLRB found these rules violated labor laws and alleged Berland and Spiers had done nothing wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CbElnM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 3rd, 3:20PM EST:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to include the email Jeff Dean sent to Google staff. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
