    <title>Google is adding COVID-19-related information to searches for travel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/elWecdlROtbuM826mojKXtoAuQw=/165x0:1635x980/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69198250/Explore_Map.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gQD7M8"&gt;Google has unveiled new tools to help people planning their first post-vaccination vacations, as COVID-19 restrictions and requirements still vary widely among domestic and international travel destinations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjReuL"&gt;A Google search for flights, hotels, or things to do will now also bring up results for any COVID-19-related travel advisories or restrictions at the searcher’s destination. Google has added additional travel restriction details, including whether quarantine is required or if you have to show proof of immunization or a negative COVID-19 test. Users can choose to receive updates about when restrictions are lifted or added for a given destination. The updates are country-specific and state-specific within the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yd7rQq"&gt;Under the “explore” &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/travel/"&gt;tab on Google’s travel page&lt;/a&gt;, people can browse not just for flights but filter destinations by interests, like beaches or skiing. When you choose a destination, you’ll get the updated information on any travel advisories or restrictions as well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VOews-4-4OYcM82ow8tjXSa7n94=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471671/COVID_19_Advisory_on_Search.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="r2pChl"&gt;After pandemic lockdowns and travel restrictions kept many people at home much of last year, Google isn’t the only company preparing for the return of travel. Expedia Group — which includes online travel agent (OTA) websites Expedia, Vrbo, Travelocity, Hotels.com, and others — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373546/expedia-travel-restriction-tool-destination"&gt;created its Travel Advisor tool&lt;/a&gt; to help customers plan trips and follow any COVID-19 restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iW82TU"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) still recommends Americans delay travel until they’ve been fully vaccinated, after which they can travel safely within the US. The agency &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/map-and-travel-notices.html"&gt;has a map&lt;/a&gt; showing where travel may be especially risky due to the coronavirus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ab1ejf"&gt;And while Americans are still barred from traveling to many international destinations, a European Union official &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/25/world/europe/american-travel-to-europe.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;over the weekend that Americans fully vaccinated against the coronavirus should be able to visit the EU this summer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UmzHpE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICtYpf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Pokémon Snap is a supremely chill safari on the Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QDobB0yjcLc0e8_eGrKg48HYORU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69198235/Switch_NewPokemonSnap_Screenshots_Feb26__35_.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="18FDCh"&gt;Virtual worlds have long been a place to escape. That was true before the pandemic, but lockdowns and stay-at-home orders across the world certainly accelerated the phenomenon. I spent an embarrassing amount of time last year gardening in &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; and going to concerts in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. They were great distractions, but never really gave that vacation-like escape I was truly searching for — turns out what I needed was a safari full of Squirtles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uVf2m"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt; launches this week as the long-awaited sequel to a fan-favorite Nintendo 64 game from 1999. The premise remains the same: you, a budding wildlife photographer, traverse beautiful landscapes while snapping photos of every critter you can find. At its core the concept is incredibly simple, but — much like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; — it’s a form of wish fulfillment. It takes out the battling and complex roleplaying elements that drive the main &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; games and instead just lets you be a part of this world, at your own pace, and without the threat of failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2XN8nO"&gt;There is a story, but it’s pretty simple. At the outset, you join a research expedition exploring the new Lental region, and naturally they need some help documenting the wildlife. The Lental region is actually a string of islands with a surprising amount of biodiversity. You start out in a fairly run-of-the-mill wildlife preserve, but eventually you’ll be riding a sort of futuristic, enclosed hovercraft through deserts, beaches, volcanic trails, and even underwater. In many cases, you’ll be able to see the areas during both day and night, giving you a better understanding of how the animals behave.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fbv5CRzk3UBEgLe8Ovtk40xeCX8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22473300/Switch_NewPokemonSnap_Screenshots_Feb26__22_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jO9C1E"&gt;You move through these environments on rails, as if you were on a ride at a particularly cool amusement park, and view the world through the lens of your camera. The main goal is to take pictures. Each area is teeming with creatures: birds soaring through the air, bugs digging through the sand, Machamps flexing for anyone who happens to be looking. The most impressive part might just be the density. There are pokémon seemingly everywhere, just waiting for the right moment to pop out and reveal themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pPvUYx"&gt;The goal is to catalog as many creatures as you can. Just like in the main games, you have a pokédex of sorts, only this time you fill it out by photographing monsters. You’re supposed to capture them in different poses, and at the end of each level a professor will rate each photo based on things like framing, pose, and whether there are any other creatures in the shot. Outside of your camera, you have a few ways to interact with the world. You can toss out berries to feed pokémon (or annoy sleeping ones), play a lullaby to get their attention, or scan your surroundings to center on points of interest. There are also bonus quests that ask you to capture very specific images — like a sleeping Arbok falling out of a tree, or a yawning Torterra — for extra points. As your overall score increases, you’ll unlock new areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i0UCmN"&gt;But your most important tool is careful observation. And that’s because &lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt; is a game largely built on repetition. You’ll be traveling through the same areas many, many times in search of new things. There are twists — you may get a new tool, and some levels have multiple pathways — but actually getting good photos requires a lot of time, patience, and experimentation. You might have to keep your camera trained on a soaring Wingull in hopes it does a loop-de-loop, or try multiple tactics to get a Magikarp to do, well, anything. Sometimes I would toss berries at everything just to see what happened. (Mostly it resulted in some adorably angry pokémon faces.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7L6BCi"&gt;Initially this process felt tedious, particularly early on, when there were only two spaces for me to explore. It was almost boring, like riding the same slow rollercoaster over and over. But this feeling changed when I started looking closer. It was amazing how many creatures I missed the first (or tenth) time I went through a level. But when I looked closely, there they were, hiding in shrubs or in undersea caves. Sometimes if I watched for long enough, I could see pokémon fighting or cuddling together for warmth. The more time I spent in these places the more I started to notice the fine details — and the more I wanted to search out even more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6zGWf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snap&lt;/em&gt; also does a great job of creating spectacle. Those quiet moments are punctuated by the shock of a giant Wailord rising out of the sea in front of you, or the joy of spotting a flock of cute Squirtles just hanging out on a beach. It’s enough to make me long for a &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game in VR.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dgrf8A_ZwKgWdomtH96S-f_-GlE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22473305/Switch_NewPokemonSnap_Screenshots_Feb26__9_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c72o0A"&gt;This is helped by the fact that &lt;em&gt;Snap&lt;/em&gt; moves at a leisurely place. There are some photos where you have to react quickly, but if you miss the shot, you can always try again. There’s no penalty for failure; bad photos are simply discarded. The emphasis is on celebrating your triumphs. When I couldn’t figure out how to capture the photo I needed to progress, I did run into a few roadblocks, which were frustrating. But generally &lt;em&gt;Snap&lt;/em&gt; is a game that rewards curiosity and does little to punish players for not following the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTHzV9"&gt;(It should also be noted that one of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt;’s most intriguing features wasn’t available to test ahead of launch. The game includes an Instagram-like photo sharing mode, where you can add filters, stickers, and borders to your images and then share them online with others. It’s a feature that could add a new social element to the series, but I haven’t been able to test it yet.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3yMn1M"&gt;Really, &lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt; is a game that forced me to change the way I think about virtual spaces. Decades of playing games have conditioned me to race through levels, checking off a to-do list of accomplishments as efficiently as possible. But that doesn’t work here. I had to slow down and watch carefully, focusing on the small details as well as the big moments. I had to relax to enjoy the view — and it’s exactly what I needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QrKytl"&gt;&lt;small&gt;New Pokémon Snap &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is available on the Nintendo Switch on April 30th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is changing the default Office font and wants your help to pick a new one</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/78eH6yQWtLczyw3W9kFqDXS5dwc=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69198231/microsoftofficenewfonts.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft has commissioned five new fonts for Office.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IuPePR"&gt;Microsoft is changing its default Office font next year and wants everyone to help pick the new default. While there are more than 700 font options in Word, Microsoft has commissioned five new custom fonts for Office, in a move away from the Calibri font that has been the default in Microsoft Office for nearly 15 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nCdzJY"&gt;The five new sans-serif fonts feature a variety of styles, including traditional, modern, and even one inspired by German road and railway signs. Microsoft is starting to gather feedback on these five new fonts today, and it plans to set one as the new Office default font in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e_3xNhV1vd98gjufcrFZ3Qo-uyA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475056/next.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new Office fonts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dYo2RA"&gt;Tenorite, created by Erin McLaughlin and Wei Huang, is the more traditional style out of the five. It almost looks like a more modern version of the default Times New Roman font from decades ago, with wide characters, accents, and clear punctuation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T9Arw6"&gt;Skeena, created by John Hudson and Paul Hanslow, feels inspired by various periods of font design. It has big variations in the thick and thin parts of its letters, along with very distinct curves on letters like S, A, and J.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D7xow-zd2KI2oE1vIr7HSUAw160=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475057/Skeena_104.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Skeena font.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Cjmj6F"&gt;Bierstadt by Steve Mattison is inspired by mid-20th-century Swiss typography. The stroke endings are very clearly cut off, but there’s some subtle softening to avoid the rigid grid-based typography you typically find with a font like this. Helvetica is the most famous example of this type of “grotesque san serif” font, and Mattison has attempted to contrast Microsoft’s Arial font here, too. Mattison named the font after a rocky mountain in Colorado that reminds him of the Swiss Alps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFhVvX"&gt;Seaford by Tobias Frere-Jones, Nina Stössinger, and Fred Shallcrass, feels the most immediately familiar out of the bunch, invoking the classic old-style serif text typefaces. The designers took inspiration from old armchairs to find a practical way to bring a classic, valued font back to life without the serifs. I’ve been testing all the new fonts in Word, and this one in particular feels the most comfortable for reading long documents.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PQon-UBC0tq0ZdeoMBiOSF3e13w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475059/Grandview_108.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grandview draws inspiration from classic German railway signage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VxcFiK"&gt;Grandview is the most striking of all five new fonts. Created by Aaron Bell, it draws inspiration from classic German road and railway signage. Much like the signs, this font is designed to be highly legible, with some tweaks to make it more comfortable for long-form reading. Based on the spirit of the German industrial standard, Grandview looks like it would work well in PowerPoint slides in particular.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBDbNG"&gt;Microsoft is now releasing these five new fonts in Microsoft 365 so everyone can try them out before a new default is chosen. Polls and feedback will be considered as part of how Microsoft picks a winner, and the company is going to spend the next few months evaluating these new fonts and seeing which ones are proving popular. Once a decision has been made, the new default font will appear in Microsoft Office apps in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Messages gets One UI-inspired redesign on recent Samsung flagships</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ch1vt6_NLoK8sH3bBnc2aqFebW0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69198083/vpavic_210118_4377_0119.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2dXjib"&gt;Google’s Messages app is getting a redesign on Samsung’s Galaxy S21 devices, bringing its appearance into line with Samsung’s other One UI software, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-messages-galaxy-s21-one-ui-design/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Screenshots posted by &lt;em&gt;XDA &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyS21/comments/mwav0k/google_messages_adopting_a_oneui_design_anyone/"&gt;users on Reddit&lt;/a&gt; show the app’s home screen has been divided into two sections: an upper information area with an unread messages counter and a lower section with links to each conversation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXN2Db"&gt;The redesign follows Samsung’s decision to use Google’s messaging app as the default for its S21 lineup in select markets. With the redesign the Messages app now looks like it belongs as a default, with a look that’s similar to other Samsung software like its Notes or Settings apps. However, in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/samsung-galaxy-s21-makes-google-messages-app-native/"&gt;Samsung Messages is still the default&lt;/a&gt; messaging app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/adJl93OB6F_tPCxPBjY-x8XS1IY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475098/Google_Messages_One_UI_Design_461x1024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-messages-galaxy-s21-one-ui-design/" target="_blank"&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The home screen now features a large title area in the top half.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KKzb6F"&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/27/google-messages-one-ui-galaxy-s21/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that Google has been testing the redesign previously, but that it’s now getting a widespread rollout on S21 devices outside of the US. With the app’s appearance now more in line with Samsung’s design style, it will be interesting to see whether Samsung is tempted to make Google’s app its default within the US.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Samsung Galaxy Unpacked 2021 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung (STOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2iIPOLTeVnmDapM8oGy4aW1GZ30=/0x1:1100x734/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69198042/DSC_4935.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JKEk79"&gt;If you’re a Samsung fan — or just curious about what the manufacturer means when it announces that “the most powerful Galaxy is coming” — then you may want to drop in on today’s Galaxy Unpacked event 10AM ET / 7AM PT.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9DezX"&gt;There isn’t a lot of info out there about what’s in store. But those who have been following Samsung can made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382512/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-april-28th-event-most-powerful-device-book-pro"&gt;a few educated guesses&lt;/a&gt;. These include the possibility of a new line of Galaxy Book laptops — a line that is certainly due for a refresh, since the last models were first announced in 2019. Other rumors include new Galaxy Book Pro laptops with 13.3-inch and 15.6-inch OLED panels, and S-Pen support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Dnz5s"&gt;Want to be the first to find out for sure? We’ll stream it above, so feel free to stick around, but there are other ways to watch it as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QIVuhB"&gt;WHAT TIME IS THE “SAMSUNG UNPACKED” EVENT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="l4kc6b"&gt;You can tune into the live stream, which starts at 10AM ET / 7AM PT today, Wednesday, April 28th. The event will likely be available to watch again after it concludes, so you’re not stuck if you miss out on the debut stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gAIWaj"&gt;WHERE CAN I WATCH THE SAMSUNG EVENT?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XbxczI"&gt;You can watch it at the top of this article; in addition, Samsung is &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/events/unpacked/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hosting the stream on its site&lt;/a&gt; and it’s &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/81vXN2MOi0s"&gt;streaming on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

    <title>Spotify premium subscriber count increases 21 percent to 158 million</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spotify’s subscriber growth.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zksf6g"&gt;Spotify now boasts 158 million premium subscribers and 356 million monthly active users, according to its &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-04-28/spotify-reports-first-quarter-2021-earnings/"&gt;latest earnings report&lt;/a&gt; released today. That’s a 21 percent and 24 percent year-over-year increase, respectively. It’s up from 155 million premium subscribers and 345 million monthly active users last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ittJB7"&gt;The streaming service has continued to focus on podcasts both as a way to convert free listeners to premium subscribers, and as a way to generate ad revenue. Spotify said that ad-supported revenue outperformed its forecast thanks in part to its podcasting efforts. In particular, the company said the Joe Rogan Experience, which it now exclusively licenses, “performed above expectations.” Spotify says it’s seen a “strong increase” in the amount of hours of podcast listening on the platform, though the actual proportion of users listening to podcasts was “consistent” with the previous quarter&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCjvAJ"&gt;Just yesterday Spotify announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404273/spotify-podcast-subscriptions-monetize-subscriber-shows"&gt;launch of podcast subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;. However, it’s only rolling them out for select partners at the moment and has said podcasters won’t have to pay it for the service for the first two years, meaning we’re unlikely to see it generating any extra revenue for Spotify until 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VKavasvO_RvpN1Ai36dBUUF0XAY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22475049/Spotify_Q1_2021_Earnings_Infographic_Motion_20210428.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hrQccw"&gt;It’s a similar story with the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22380014/spotify-car-thing-release-voice-control-data-interactive-ads"&gt;Car Thing music player&lt;/a&gt; which is only getting a limited launch for now, and which the company is currently giving away rather than selling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQqQuB"&gt;Today’s release follows Spotify’s announcement that it will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403813/spotify-price-increase-subscriptions-2021"&gt;soon be increasing prices&lt;/a&gt; for its family plan in the US and Duo, Student, and Family plans in the UK and some European countries. Today’s numbers give a possible reason for the increases: Spotify’s falling average revenue per subscriber. Spotify says it earned an average of €4.12 (around $4.97) per premium subscriber. That’s a decrease of 7 percent compared to the same period the previous year. Within Spotify’s premium business, average revenue per user has declined for five out of the six previous quarters due to Spotify using discounted plans to attract subscribers in new markets like Russia and India, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-adds-subscribers-as-covid-19-boosts-at-home-streaming-11619604000"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mna6li"&gt;Spotify consistently cites “product mix” as the reason for this decline, suggesting that more of its users are opting for cheaper subscription bundles. Increasing the price of these bundles could help slow the trend. Today’s earnings release only covers the period up until the end of March, so we won’t see any impact of this week’s price increases until next quarter, if that. But Spotify reports that the increases have shown no “material impacts” on cancellation rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUKBhy"&gt;Amidst these price increases, Spotify is also attempting to push back against criticism that it doesn’t pay artists enough to stream their music. Last month it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336087/spotify-loud-clear-website-launch-pay-artists-streaming-royalities"&gt;launched a new website&lt;/a&gt; called Loud &amp;amp; Clear where it attempted to offer more transparency about its payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4WkfcE"&gt;Overall, Spotify made a profit of €23 million, up from €1 million a year before, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-adds-subscribers-as-covid-19-boosts-at-home-streaming-11619604000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3Ym6N"&gt;Perhaps the biggest change to Spotify’s core music streaming business is due to arrive later this year when it launches its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;HiFi lossless streaming tier&lt;/a&gt;. The service promises it “will deliver music in CD-quality, lossless audio format to your device and Spotify Connect-enabled speakers” in the “select markets” where it’s launching. Pricing for the new subscription tier is yet to be announced.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple fined $12M by Russian regulator over App Store monopoly abuse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3RndH-wUt0Ddj6SWahiycWcotio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69197569/acastro_180130_1777_0005_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="de1B1g"&gt;Russia’s antitrust regulator, the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS), has fined Apple $12 million over complaints it unfairly cracked down on third-party parental control apps, the &lt;a href="https://fas.gov.ru/news/31268"&gt;regulator has announced&lt;/a&gt;. The FAS started its investigation after &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaspersky.com%2Fblog%2Fapple-fas-complaint%2F26017%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F28%2F22407293%2Fapple-russia-antitrust-monopoly-fine-kaspersky-parental-control-app" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;receiving a complaint from Kaspersky Lab&lt;/a&gt; in March 2019, which claimed Apple had forced it to limit the functionality of its Safe Kids app shortly after Apple added the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17870126/ios-12-screen-time-app-limits-downtime-features-how-to-use"&gt;Screen Time feature to iOS 12&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YpfBwL"&gt;The fine comes in the same week that EU regulators are expected to issue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405260/apple-eu-antitrust-charges-app-store-policies-decision-rumor"&gt;charges of their own&lt;/a&gt; against Apple. These come in response to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263453/spotify-apple-app-store-antitrust-complaint-ec-30-percent-cut-unfair"&gt;complaint from Spotify&lt;/a&gt; in March 2019 about the 30 percent cut Apple takes for in-app purchases, which it said gives Apple’s own services an unfair advantage. As well as Spotify, parental control apps Kidslox and Qustodio also complained to European regulators, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/27/technology/apple-screen-time-trackers.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; in April 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="i5TwsE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple plans to appeal the fine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WWonOa"&gt;In its statement, which was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/russian-competition-watchdog-fines-apple-12-mln-abusing-dominant-position-2021-04-27/"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the FAS said it wants Apple to take steps to ensure its own apps don’t have an unfair advantage, and that developers of parental control apps can distribute their software without having to limit its functionality. The FAS originally determined Apple had abused its market position &lt;a href="https://fas.gov.ru/news/30275"&gt;in August last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zIuhM3"&gt;In response to the fine, Apple said it disagrees with the regulator’s decision and that it will be issuing an appeal. “We worked with Kaspersky to get their app in compliance with rules that were put in place to protect children,” an Apple spokesperson said. “They now have 13 apps on the App Store and we have processed hundreds of updates for them.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNB3d3"&gt;Kaspersky Lab declined to comment on news of the fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MTJmBH"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/27/18519888/apple-screen-time-app-tracking-parental-controls-report"&gt;originally justified&lt;/a&gt; limiting the functionality of third-party parental control apps because it said they were using Mobile Device Management (MDM) technology, which is intended for enterprises to control company devices. Apple said it was “incredibly risky” for consumer-focused apps to have the same level of control, and that it could make them vulnerable to hacking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pr9KMy"&gt;However, after an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/30/18646601/parental-control-app-developers-band-together-to-demand-an-api-from-apple"&gt;outcry from developers&lt;/a&gt;, Apple later changed its policies to allow the use of MDM technology for parental control apps, but only “in limited cases.” At the time, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kaspersky.com%2Fblog%2Fapple-fas-complaint%2F26017%2F%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3Dupdate%3A%2520june%252010%2C%25202019.%2520regarding%2520recent%2520changes%2520to%2520the%2520apple%2520app%2520store%2520review%2520guidelines&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F28%2F22407293%2Fapple-russia-antitrust-monopoly-fine-kaspersky-parental-control-app" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kaspersky welcomed the changes&lt;/a&gt; but expressed concern that using the technology would require Apple’s written consent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lw7517"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony has sold 7.8 million PS5 consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7LRVLXm50FBz28Cq1mLjyqFjmA0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69197315/vpavic_4278_20201030_0041.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LZjurN"&gt;Sony has sold 7.8 million PlayStation 5 consoles as of March 31st, the company says in its latest earnings report. The number of PlayStation Plus subscribers is now 47.6 million, a 14.7 percent increase year on year. The fourth-quarter figures bring the overall PlayStation business to a total operating profit of 342.2 billion yen ($3.14 billion) for the 2020 financial year — a record for Sony.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MJPihh"&gt;Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22263821/sony-earnings-q3-2020-ps5-launch-sales"&gt;last earnings report&lt;/a&gt; revealed that the company had shipped 4.5 million PS5 units worldwide through the end of 2020. That means that 3.3 million units were shipped from January to March, giving an idea of Sony’s current manufacturing capacity; it’s still very difficult to actually buy a PS5, with demand far outstripping supply. The quarter-to-quarter drop is likely explained by Sony ramping up production ahead of the system’s launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPdFSG"&gt;Earlier this month NPD &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1383042564756893703"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that the PS5 was the fastest selling console in US history through its first five months of availability, both in terms of units moved and total dollar spend. For the first quarter of 2021, however, Nintendo has sold more Switch units in the US than Sony has of the PS5, according to NPD. That’s not really surprising given how hard it’s been to find a PS5 since the initial launch batch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Q1PZb"&gt;Sony also shipped an additional million PS4 consoles in the last quarter, bringing that system’s life-to-date number to 115.9 million units. The figure is down 28.6 percent from the previous year’s 1.4 million. Sony’s report suggests PS5 is selling a little faster than the PS4 worldwide — the PS4 had shipped 7.6 million units as of March 31st, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Behind the controversy at Basecamp</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-ZdNX4hAbMiFb_Z2d6hYMJ-HRU4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69196232/acastro_210427_4564_basecamp_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Basecamp announced it would ban “societal and political discussions” at work. But the hardest conversations at work were about the company itself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2 id="ixNrS1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="jGKU9Y"&gt;The controversy that embroiled enterprise software maker Basecamp this week began more than a decade ago, with a simple list of customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="khUDr4"&gt;Around 2009, Basecamp customer service representatives began keeping a list of names that they found funny. More than a decade later, current employees were so mortified by the practice that none of them would give me a single example of a name on the list. One invoked the sorts of names Bart Simpson used to use when prank calling Moe the Bartender: Amanda Hugginkiss, Seymour Butz, Mike Rotch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1wSMY"&gt;Many of the names were of American or European origin. But others were Asian, or African, and eventually the list — titled “Best Names Ever” — began to make people uncomfortable. What once had felt like an innocent way to blow off steam, amid the ongoing cultural reckoning over speech and corporate responsibility, increasingly looked inappropriate, and often racist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="viuSW6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Several employees, though, are already making their exit plans&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4n8CbZ"&gt;Discussion about the list and how the company ought to hold itself accountable for creating it led directly to CEO Jason Fried announcing Tuesday that &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/jason/changes-at-basecamp-7f32afc5"&gt;Basecamp would ban employees from holding “societal and political discussions”&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s internal chat forums. The move, which has sparked widespread discussion in Silicon Valley, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/9/30/21493906/brian-armstrong-coinbase-blog-post-politics-workplace-activism"&gt;follows a similar move from cryptocurrency company Coinbase last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5H0vaI"&gt;Fried’s memo was revised and updated several times; co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson followed with &lt;a href="https://world.hey.com/dhh/basecamp-s-new-etiquette-regarding-societal-politics-at-work-b44bef69"&gt;one of his own&lt;/a&gt;. Together, they are two of the most outspoken leaders in the entire tech industry on issues related to company culture, remote work, and collaboration. The company has &lt;a href="https://basecamp.com/books"&gt;published five books&lt;/a&gt; on work culture, one of which was a &lt;em&gt;New York Times &lt;/em&gt;bestseller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTIsay"&gt;But both of their posts avoided discussing the actual series of events that had led up to the policies, which were related directly to the workplace. In fact, the events all took place on Basecamp’s own software, which it sells to other companies on the promise of improving cohesion and reducing stress in the workplace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ub6Svk"&gt;Employees say the founders’ memos unfairly depicted their workplace as being riven by partisan politics, when in fact the main source of the discussion had always been Basecamp itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrA4Gc"&gt;“At least in my experience, it has always been centered on what is happening at Basecamp,” said one employee — who, like most of those I spoke with today, requested anonymity so as to freely discuss internal deliberations. “What is being done at Basecamp? What is being said at Basecamp? And how it is affecting individuals? It has never been big political discussions, like ‘the postal service should be disbanded,’ or ‘I don’t like Amy Klobuchar.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="cZZ3E1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A lot of people are gonna have a tough time living with that”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ifr1iY"&gt;Interviews with a half-dozen Basecamp employees over the past day paint a portrait of a company where workers sought to advance Basecamp’s commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion by having sensitive discussions about the company’s own failures. After months of fraught conversations, Fried and his co-founder, David Heinemeier Hansson moved to shut those conversations down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDoIh5"&gt;”In the end, we feel like this is the long-term healthy way forward for Basecamp as a whole — the company and our products,” Fried wrote in his blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6s7me"&gt;Several employees, though, are already making their exit plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bBLjep"&gt;Basecamp, which makes workplace collaboration tools and launched the email service Hey last year, has long been recognized for producing “opinionated software.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQzmxk"&gt;“We’ve hired opinionated people, we’ve created opinionated software, and now basically the company has said, ‘well, your opinions don’t really matter — unless it’s directly related to business,’” one told me. “A lot of people are gonna have a tough time living with that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lZYH1U"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="GbG39u"&gt;In December, a new hire at Basecamp volunteered to help the company work on diversity issues. Posting on a long-dormant thread in the &lt;a href="https://basecamp.com/how-it-works"&gt;Basecamp software&lt;/a&gt;, which resembles a message board, the employee sought other volunteers to begin working on DE&amp;amp;I issues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UoXGFl"&gt;There was reason to believe that the co-founders would be receptive. In 2017, after Basecamp had been around for 18 years, Fried &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/magazine/201709/jason-fried/2017-inc5000-diversity-in-the-workforce.html"&gt;wrote an essay in &lt;em&gt;Inc.&lt;/em&gt; about the company’s weak record on diversity issues&lt;/a&gt;. “I believe a company is at its best when it reflects those it serves,” Fried wrote. “If you fill a room with 20 random employees and 20 random customers, an outside observer should have trouble telling them apart.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ccprmq"&gt;Last year, in the wake of the racial justice protest that swept the country, Hansson had encouraged employees to read &lt;em&gt;Between the World and Me&lt;/em&gt;, a memoir by Ta-Nehisi Coates, and &lt;em&gt;The New Jim Crow&lt;/em&gt;, Michelle Alexander’s exploration of the racist nature of mass incarceration. Both founders are also active — and occasionally hyperactive — on Twitter, where they regularly advocate for mainstream liberal and progressive views on social issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5c0NP3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“just a gross violation of the trust”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sv1ymL"&gt;While Basecamp does not publish diversity statistics, it is still, like most tech companies, majority white and male, employees said. But the idea of worker-led efforts on diversity issues got a frosty reception from the founders last year, employees told me. They were allowed to work on the project, but did not feel as if the founders were particularly invested in the outcome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yezk2A"&gt;Nonetheless, the DE&amp;amp;I council attracted significant support. More than a third of the company — 20 out of roughly 58 employees — volunteered to help. They began examining Basecamp’s hiring processes, which vendors the company works with, how Basecamp employees socialize, and what speakers they might invite to one of the all-remote company’s twice-yearly in-person gatherings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvBT0r"&gt;In the aftermath of these discussions, employees began to discuss the list of customer names. On April 13, two employees posted an apology on the internal Basecamp for having contributed to the list in the past. The employee responsible for initially creating it had left the company. But while previous versions of the list had been deleted, copies had resurfaced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gyWg1K"&gt;The employees noted that there had never been an internal reckoning over the list, and said it was important to discuss why making fun of customers’ names had been wrong. The apology included an image of “&lt;a href="https://www.adl.org/sites/default/files/documents/pyramid-of-hate.pdf"&gt;the pyramid of hate&lt;/a&gt;,” an illustration created by the Anti-Defamation League to show how the most extreme acts of extremist violence are enabled by a foundation of biased attitudes and acts of bias.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBtytT"&gt;A day later, Hansson responded with a post of his own. He had conducted a forensic analysis of who created the document and how it had spread around the company. He called it a systemic failure on the company’s part. In a conversation with me today, he acknowledged that he and Fried had known about the list for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="axsiOC"&gt;“There was some awareness at the time within the company that that list had existed and it wasn’t acted upon. That is squarely on Jason’s and my record.” The list, he said, “in itself is just a gross violation of the trust … It’s just wrong in all sorts of fundamental ways.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJCPFi"&gt;Employees responded mostly positively to the first part of this note. But Hansson went further, taking exception to the use of the pyramid of hate in a workplace discussion. He told me today that attempting to link the list of customer names to potential genocide represented a case of “catastrophizing” — one that made it impossible for any good-faith discussions to follow. Presumably, any employees who are found contributing to genocidal attitudes should be fired on the spot — and yet nobody involved seemed to think that contributing to or viewing the list was a fireable offense. If that’s the case, Hansson said, then the pyramid of hate had no place in the discussion. To him, it escalated employees’ emotions past the point of being productive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="rCfPWN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;for a small company, Basecamp has taken an outsized number of political stances&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UQMNnB"&gt;Hansson wanted to acknowledge the situation as a failure and move on. But when employees who had been involved in the list wanted to continue talking about it, he grew exasperated. “You are the person you are complaining about,” he thought.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GkKi0H"&gt;Employees took a different view. In a response to Hansson’s post, one employee noted that the way we treat names — especially foreign names — is deeply connected to social and racial hierarchies. Just a few weeks earlier, eight people had been killed in a shooting spree in Atlanta. Six of the victims were women of Asian descent, and their names had sometimes been mangled in press reports. (The Asian American Journalists Association responded by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IAmAmnaNawaz/status/1373016964038324228?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1373016964038324228%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailykos.com%2Fstory%2F2021%2F3%2F27%2F2022680%2F-Say-their-names"&gt;issuing a pronunciation guide&lt;/a&gt;.) The point was that dehumanizing behavior begins with very small actions, and it did not seem like too much to ask Basecamp’s founders to acknowledge that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZUt0P"&gt;Hansson’s response to this employee took aback many of the workers I spoke with. He dug through old chat logs to find a time when the employee in question participated in a discussion about a customer with a funny-sounding name. Hansson posted the message — visible to the entire company — and dismissed the substance of the employee’s complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVrKj5"&gt;Two other employees were sufficiently concerned by the public dressing-down of a colleague that they filed complaints with Basecamp’s human resources officer. (HR declined to take action against the company co-founder.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Itlw0K"&gt;Less than two weeks later, Fried announced the new company policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="E9yh0G"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;III.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="UynkQ9"&gt;When Coinbase announced its ban on internal political discussions last year, some managers I spoke with praised the move for the clarity it brought to the workplace. By making workplace chat a politics-free zone, Coinbase was freeing employees to do the work they were hired to, rather than wage partisan warfare on the job. It’s no surprise, then, that Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong was among those who praised Basecamp’s moves this week: “Another mission focused company,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brian_armstrong/status/1386806511628783617?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet"&gt;he tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, followed by the emoji for applause. “It takes courage in these times.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGpxdL"&gt;What that view misses, I think, is how confusing rules like these are to employees. One Basecamp worker I spoke with today, who requested anonymity, wondered the extent to which parenting issues could be raised at work. “How do you talk about raising kids without talking about society?” the employee said. “As soon as I bring up public schools, then it’s already political.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EpvBic"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the move was received more as a shift to willful ignorance&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yrD1L2"&gt;Jane Yang, a data analyst at the company, told me that restricting internal conversations would negatively affect diversity and inclusion efforts. For example, she said, the company’s profit-sharing plan gave more profits to people who have longer tenure — a group that is majority white and male. Making that discussion off-limits internally could ensure that inequality in profit sharing becomes a structural feature of the company. (Yang also &lt;a href="https://janeyang.org/2021/04/27/an-open-letter-to-jason-and-david/"&gt;wrote an open letter to the founders about her experiences at the company&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJx8aL"&gt;That confusion is compounded by the fact that, for a small company, Basecamp has taken an outsized number of political stances — all of which employees are encouraged to discuss. Most prominently, the company and its founders have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295778/apple-app-store-hey-email-fees-policies-antitrust-wwdc-2020"&gt;vocal critics of Apple’s 30 percent tax on in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt;. But it has also involved itself in politics at a much lower level: in 2018 Basecamp &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/chicago/inno/stories/news/2018/04/30/why-tech-founder-neal-s-les-griffin-is-running-for.html"&gt;let a candidate for Chicago mayor use its office in the West Loop as a campaign headquarters&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="49RNqb"&gt;Basecamp employees are encouraged to discuss the company’s own political positions — or, perhaps more accurately, the founders’ political positions — as much as they like. Keeping track of which issues of the moment are up for discussion thus becomes one more chunk of mental overhead for employees who are already struggling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dWG7bE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“they are not interested in seeing things in their work timeline that make them uncomfortable”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KCq1GW"&gt;Hansson told me that the rules are not draconian — no one is going to be bounced out the door for occasionally straying out of bounds. The founders’ goal is to reset the culture and focus on making products, he said, not to purge political partisans from the workforce. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJRlFn"&gt;But to employees, the move was received more as a shift to willful ignorance — about the world around them, and about the lived experiences of the employees who occupied it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="nBg0km"&gt;“There’s always been this kind of unwritten rule at Basecamp that the company basically exists for David and Jason’s enjoyment,” one employee told me. “At the end of the day, they are not interested in seeing things in their work timeline that make them uncomfortable, or distracts them from what they’re interested in. And this is the culmination of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
