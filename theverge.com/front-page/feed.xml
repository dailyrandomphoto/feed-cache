  &lt;p id="4dFljI"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NJIBjo"&gt;
&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP5095084519&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VCtrBf"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, Nilay and Dieter, along with managing editor Alex Cranz and senior reporter Sean O’Kane, discuss electric vehicle startup Rivian becoming a publicly traded company after executing one of the biggest initial public offerings in history. This leads to a discussion on how Rivian got to this point where other EV startups have failed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CZR77J"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774403/rivian-ipo-debut-evs-12-billion-amazon-tesla-valuation"&gt;Rivian goes public in one of the biggest IPOs ever&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="QP0FZb"&gt;There’s a whole lot more news covered on the show, especially from Apple. This week, we saw:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="bBr0W9"&gt; &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22773082/epic-apple-fortnite-lawsuit-ruling-injunction-stay-app-store-anti-steering-rules"&gt;orders Apple to let developers add links and buttons to external payment options. &lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1r6m8D"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/9/22772433/apple-iphone-13-screen-replacements-face-id-software-update"&gt;Apple backed off its policy&lt;/a&gt; that made it harder for independent repair shops to repair iPhone screens. &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="SF89S9"&gt;And surprise! More news. Microsoft had a few announcements this week as well: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="SZ5qiq"&gt;All of this and more were discussed on this week’s &lt;em&gt;Vergecast. &lt;/em&gt;Listen here or in your preferred podcast player for the full episode. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Secretlab really built its extra-small gamer chair that started as an April Fools’ joke</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YEUrEDgdMErO-1qpTylbL3kuqNU=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70133055/Secretlab_TITAN_XXS_Main.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Secretlab&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JQ0pTW"&gt;When it comes to gaming chairs, most of the focus is on how they can support and comfort your next 5,000 IQ play, but the fact is that most of them are designed to be large and imposing. After teasing a miniaturized version of its Titan chair &lt;a href="https://secretlab.co/pages/xxxxxs?"&gt;as an April Fools’ joke&lt;/a&gt;, Secretlab decided to send it to production, creating this &lt;a href="https://secretlab.co/pages/titan-xxs"&gt;Titan XXS&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rU4C3B"&gt;The Titan Extra Extra Small has matching materials and even a five-year warranty just like the full-size chairs, and it even has height-adjustable armrests. It has child-locking casters and supports up to 70kg (~154lbs), so it should be safe enough for pets, kids, or anyone else who wants a small seat in front of the RGB keyboard and mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAW3bw"&gt;The chair will be available globally in “limited quantities,” so if you want this 1:2 scale version you may have to decide quickly on a preorder. A black hybrid leatherette version is available for $299 while opting for Plush Pink or Frost Blue fabric costs $319. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727969/xbox-series-x-mini-fridge-price-release-date"&gt;Xbox Series X minifridge&lt;/a&gt; went from joke to sold out in seconds, and now I’m wondering which non-serious product will be next.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok tics are a symptom of a much bigger problem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nFxhtpm-fUbRetpHapH-VT3GLKo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70132980/acastro_211111_4875_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Mental illness doesn’t work like measles&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="XSgKrq"&gt;Reports of teens developing tic-like behaviors after watching TikTok videos highlight something most of us don’t consider about mental health: symptoms can be social. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CDCs5q"&gt;Since March 2020, specialists in the United States, Australia, Canada, and the United Kingdom have seen a dramatic spike in young patients seeking treatment for tics, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/teen-girls-are-developing-tics-doctors-say-tiktok-could-be-a-factor-11634389201?mod=tech_lead_pos12"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Doctors say most of the young people watched content from TikTok creators who say they have Tourette syndrome, one type of tic disorder. Top TikTokers film themselves involuntarily cursing, slapping themselves, making clapping sounds, and more. Cumulatively, #tourettes videos have been viewed more than 5 billion times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GphYFj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We learn in different cultural settings, even local settings, how to communicate our suffering.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MHXwMy"&gt;Some researchers have &lt;a href="https://movementdisorders.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/mdc3.13316"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; the sudden surge in TikTok tics is a “pandemic within a pandemic,” as the teens struggle with schoolwork, feelings of isolation, and even bruises and other physical marks from their tics. But TikTok isn’t &lt;em&gt;creating&lt;/em&gt; the distress these teens feel, says pediatric psychologist &lt;a href="https://www.ucsfbenioffchildrens.org/providers/allison-libby"&gt;Allison Libby&lt;/a&gt;, an associate clinical professor at the University of California, San Francisco. Instead, the tics are a byproduct of anxiety, depression, and even traumatic stress. Far from dismissing these issues as “all in your head,” acknowledging how symptoms are shaped by a broader social context — and, now, by social media — could help teens find relief for more than just their tics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7kWpeL"&gt;“Symptoms are a means of expression,” &lt;a href="https://anthropology.wustl.edu/people/rebecca-lester"&gt;Rebecca Lester&lt;/a&gt;, a professor of sociocultural anthropology at Washington University who studies psychiatry, religion, and gender, told me. “We learn in different cultural settings, even local settings, how to communicate our suffering.” That learning isn’t intentional — or even necessarily conscious. But the consequences can be debilitating.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vE3LG0"&gt;Mental illness doesn’t work like measles, which manifests the same way wherever it goes. Because emotional experiences can vary dramatically across time and place, so can symptoms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lyt5no"&gt;Take, for example, traumatic stress from war. Psychiatrists tend to treat World War I-era “shell shock” as a precursor to PTSD, a concept that was solidified in the aftermath of the Vietnam War. But the two groups of veterans often exhibited wildly different symptoms. Mutism, seizures, and paralysis were common symptoms of shell shock. PTSD, by contrast, is defined primarily by flashbacks. The further back in history you go, the stranger soldiers’ symptoms seem: in the Civil War, soldiers &lt;a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/ptsd-civil-wars-hidden-legacy-180953652/"&gt;suffered from “nostalgia,”&lt;/a&gt; or homesickness, that made it difficult for them to breathe and unsettled their stomach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V6uOYZ"&gt;There isn’t a “correct” stress response to war — or any other hardship. In every case, the soldiers’ suffering was very real. But their symptoms changed in part because their culture did. The plight of the TikTok teens suggests we’re in the middle of another revolution in the language of distress today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="cySp8h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tics, in particular, happen to be very suggestible&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kthyQD"&gt;Many symptoms have a social component, but tics, in particular, happen to be very suggestible, Libby says. In 2011, for example, as many as &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-students-twitcnew-york-h/schools-end-clears-up-new-york-students-mystery-twitching-idUSBRE85M0DF20120623"&gt;20 teenagers&lt;/a&gt; in upstate New York, almost all of them students in the same school, suddenly developed similar tremors. Explanations included environmental pollution and cancer clusters; Erin Brockovich &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/magazine/teenage-girls-twitching-le-roy.html"&gt;sent a team&lt;/a&gt; to test local soil. Ultimately, doctors close to the patients &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/11/magazine/teenage-girls-twitching-le-roy.html"&gt;concluded&lt;/a&gt; the physical symptoms were the result of psychic distress. Fortunately, by the next spring, many of the afflicted teens were on the road to recovery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2C5ib"&gt;Just 10 years ago, teens were most directly influenced by the handful of kids in their homeroom; today, thanks to platforms like TikTok, the whole world can feel like one big high school. Earlier this year, German psychiatrist Kirsten Müller-Vahl and her colleagues &lt;a href="https://academic.oup.com/brain/advance-article/doi/10.1093/brain/awab316/6356504"&gt;introduced the phrase&lt;/a&gt; “mass social media-induced illness” to describe an outbreak of tic-like behaviors among German teens that began in 2019 and is &lt;a href="https://www.wired.co.uk/article/tourettes-youtube-jan-zimmermann"&gt;linked&lt;/a&gt; to a popular YouTube creator with Tourette syndrome. Add to that the COVID-19 pandemic, which more than &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/mental-health-and-substance-use-considerations-among-children-during-the-covid-19-pandemic/"&gt;25 percent&lt;/a&gt; of American high school students say has worsened their emotional health, and an outbreak of tics seems almost inevitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="psohFX"&gt;So what happens next? The difference between true tic disorders, which typically emerge in childhood, and tic-like behaviors, which are what these TikTok users seem to be experiencing, doesn’t matter much for treatment, Libby says. Both groups will likely undergo something called comprehensive behavioral intervention for tics, or &lt;a href="https://tourette.org/research-medical/cbit-overview/"&gt;CBIT&lt;/a&gt;, to manage their symptoms. However, if there are other underlying mental health issues, those need to be treated, too. “My guess is that they will absolutely be able to recover,” Libby says, “especially if they are getting treatment for the underlying anxiety or depression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="uAVGqV"&gt;When it comes to the current spike in tic-like disorders, “blaming TikTok, it’s a cop-out,” Lester says. For these teens, the distress was probably already there. These symptoms just made it impossible to ignore.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Adi Robertson? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iqne-WDyMvKpmueZlSckvvFoW5s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70132974/arobertson_211031_4861_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A space to feel good working in&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="NYDUPB"&gt;When you have a tendency to collect stuff, it’s difficult to create a detritus-free space in which to work. It’s even harder when you have to do it on the fly because you’re suddenly working at home rather than in an office. Adi Robertson, senior reporter for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, has actually managed to do that, and in this chapter of “What’s on your desk,” she explains how she has organized a place in which she can concentrate and do her fabulous reporting without distraction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AL9tw3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about yourself. What is your background, and what do you do at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxFhFF"&gt;I joined &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; a few weeks after launch as a news writer; it was my first professional journalism (or writing in general) position after some low-key blogging and writing the cocktails column in my school newspaper. The great thing about my job is that I get to work across so many areas — I’ve covered film festivals, virtual reality hardware, net neutrality and copyright, speech moderation, obsolete tech, and too many random gadgets to count.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvGtpb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I think this is absolutely the neatest workspace I’ve seen yet. Is this new?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0qk26p"&gt;Extremely new. I spent the pandemic working at my dining room table until I cleared out a dedicated room — which I’m unbelievably lucky to have in a Brooklyn apartment — for a long-term home office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6J5jdL"&gt;To put it delicately, this looks nothing like the rest of my home. I’m trying to commit to having one neat space that I can feel good working in, and then… well, everything else. Which means I occasionally bring things (knitting, my mic stand) into the office and then shuffle them into the next room (let’s be honest, the dining room table, it’s not like I hold dinner parties) when I’m done with them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A corner of the room that’s best for Zoom." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oMZf1mB3rB5wnO9n36s3-dHLnRo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23007728/arobertson_211031_4861_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A corner of the room that’s best for Zoom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IytR8V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me about your desk. Where is it located in the room, and where did you get it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ItIQnD"&gt;I put my desk in the corner of the room that gives me the least trouble on camera for Zoom meetings and interviews. It’s against a wall that’s facing a window, opposite the only wall with no windows or doors, and far enough from my ancient radiator that I won’t scald myself in the winter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AeEuEm"&gt;The desk is a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.kardiel.com%2Furbane-55-writing-desk-walnut%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22774259%2Fadi-robertson-desk-tech-setup-writer-decor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;walnut Kardiel Urbane&lt;/a&gt; — minimalist so that I won’t feel tempted to fill it with stuff, but with a tiny drawer that’s perfect for spare cables, USB drives, and the recorder and earpiece microphone I use to capture interviews for transcription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aWILNw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10857752"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CHzioU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me about your chair.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjIOwN"&gt;The chair is from &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeDeskItems111221/https://www.jossandmain.com/furniture/sb0/office-chairs-c1859034.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Joss &amp;amp; Main&lt;/a&gt;, although like every furniture brand I mention here, I had to ask my husband where he bought it. Left to my own devices, I am incapable of finding home goods anywhere except Ikea or the first random neighborhood store I walk into, so I acquire everything by vaguely describing what I want and always end up with something nicer than I’d have ever gotten for myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jJXXZJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Could you tell us about the tech that you’re using?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GHnvMc"&gt;I spend the workday at my Vox laptop, a 2017 MacBook Pro, with a few accessories: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/6/1/17413728/the-best-usb-c-hub-for-laptops-macbook-pro"&gt;Satechi USB-C hub&lt;/a&gt; my colleague Chaim Gartenberg recommended, a pair of Sony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;WH-1000XM4 wireless headphones&lt;/a&gt; that my &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; colleague Chris Welch reviewed, an Anker wireless charger for my Samsung Galaxy S10E, and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-DeathAdder-Elite-Mechanical-Ergonomic/dp/B01LXC1QL0?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer DeathAdder Elite&lt;/a&gt; wrapped up for the rare times I need an external mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zH05hm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361616"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h5F1WW"&gt;Sadly, I got the MacBook during Apple’s bad keyboard years, and I guess it couldn’t handle my typing volume and intensity. I’ve broken so many keys on butterfly keyboards that I gave up on getting them repaired and stacked a Bluetooth keyboard on my laptop with a cardboard separator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O7VAvm"&gt;Outside work, I bought a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Chromebook-Celeron-Processor-Gigabit/dp/B07XQQTVS3?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung Chromebook 4&lt;/a&gt; that I’d hoped I could turn into a &lt;a href="https://wiki.galliumos.org/Hardware_Compatibility"&gt;GalliumOS Linux machine&lt;/a&gt;, only to learn most newer Chromebooks don’t support full Linux installs. Turns out Chrome OS is almost shockingly convenient, but I still want actual control over my hardware. It really bothers me! I miss netbooks!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nU6uX5"&gt;There’s also an &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=VergeDeskItems111221&amp;amp;murl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fquest-2%2F&amp;amp;LSNSUBSITE=LSNSUBSITE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus Quest 2 VR&lt;/a&gt; headset tucked by the desk legs. Like the Google Chromebook, there are some real privacy concerns here, but it’s such a well-designed product and Meta-Facebook-Oculus is very good at nabbing game exclusives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DpInR1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10459857"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7TlzMZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEkFPd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love your lamp. Where did you get it? And is that a duck or a goose?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eakeNo"&gt;It’s a &lt;a href="https://westelm.e54b.net/c/482924/267856/4336?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.westelm.com%2Fproducts%2Frachel-koslowski-mallard-duck-table-lamp-w1936%2F&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDeskItems111221"&gt;mallard duck from West Elm&lt;/a&gt; — another thing I would never have bought and now find delightful to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYlqXb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see you use a notebook.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZgdGdV"&gt;I’m usually accidentally writing across two or three different notebooks during any given period, but I keep one ruled &lt;a href="https://www.muji.com/sg/products/list/Note%20B6"&gt;Muji B6&lt;/a&gt; at my desk for jotting interview notes and doing non-work writing and game design. (I love Muji pens, too, but I bought a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002T401Y/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A16HZ3J3WEU71V&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lamy Safari fountain pen&lt;/a&gt; because I was constantly using up disposable ballpoints.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="90DaWR"&gt;The B6 is a solid all-purpose size that fits in a purse very well, it feels respectable without being super expensive, and as a left-handed person, a spiral-bound notebook means there’s less paper to get in the way of my hand when I’m writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;A Bluetooth keyboard was needed to replace a broken MacBook keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dgxnED"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And of course, you’ve got to tell us about the typewriter!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hbXBHT"&gt;I spend a bunch of my time outside work writing games and fiction for fun, and I like experimenting with the ways different tools influence the flow of it, although I usually end up using my laptop or notebook. (There’s a &lt;a href="https://getfreewrite.com/products/freewrite-smart-typewriter-3rd-gen"&gt;Freewrite electronic typewriter&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/2/9080499/psion-series-5-vintage-pda-review"&gt;Psion Series 5&lt;/a&gt; PDA on the shelf behind me.) I’ll cop to this being kind of pretentious, but I think of it like a musician’s instrument collection — some tools let you go back and edit and others don’t, some make it harder or easier to see what you’ve already written, some are physically faster or slower to write on than others, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LNael"&gt;The typewriter is a manual Olympia I bought a decade ago off Craigslist and got tuned up by visiting a typewriter repair technician in an unmarked office at the top of a rickety elevator in Manhattan, because I had just moved to New York and was amazed that this was the kind of thing you could just up and do. It’s still got a couple of bent keys, but on the whole it works pretty well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RMKbCJ"&gt;That said, trying to use a typewriter always makes me impressed that anybody wrote anything at all during their era. There’s such a precise rhythm to hitting the keys hard enough that they’re legible but not so fast they lock up against each other. And you’re so exposed! Anybody can just wander in and see exactly what you’re writing! Someday I will be confident enough to complete a story on a typewriter. Today is not that day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The manual Olympia typewriter still works pretty well." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cJhnsT7q8bsoxHav9ZT4imwuyJk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23007732/arobertson_211031_4861_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The manual Olympia typewriter still works pretty well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iKbgF2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are you planning to decorate your space any further, or are you going to keep it minimalist?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6yDwk1"&gt;I knew an early &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; video team member who kept a corkboard where he’d pin up all his badges from covering events, like a trophy / memory board, and I always thought it was a cool idea but never had the space to put one up. So I’ve got a decade’s worth of haphazardly collected film festival and tech conference badges stored in a box in my bedroom, and I want to finally put them on a wall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpB7lX"&gt;Otherwise, I’m currently getting a Michael Tunk cutout collage based on &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid&lt;/em&gt; framed, and I’m hoping to put up a &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; 10-year anniversary poster as well. But my general goal is to bring as little into the room as possible. Like a fortified redoubt against the clutter of my apartment. We’ll see if I can keep that up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bu6g73"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything else about your workspace that we haven’t covered?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUKw1j"&gt;I have a minor update on the dried leaf at the edge of one of my photos. My cat Trico saw it moving outside the window the morning I took the pictures, and she got so excited that we brought it inside for her to play with. It’s on the floor now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0eXZTX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBHbY6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram Reels now have text-to-speech and voice effects just like TikTok </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZDKXIKTetEBuNHy1b2FeSTGDGXo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70132851/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5CncBi"&gt;Instagram has added text-to-speech and voice effects to its TikTok competitor Reels, two features TikTok has had for some time. The robotic voice-overs used as narration for videos grew so ubiquitous on TikTok in fact, that voice actor &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22435058/tiktok-voice-sues-unauthorized-usage-text-to-speech"&gt;Bev Standing sued the company in May&lt;/a&gt;, saying it didn’t have permission to use her voice. In September, TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701167/bev-standing-tiktok-lawsuit-settles-text-to-speech-voice"&gt;reached a settlement with Standing&lt;/a&gt; that included a licensing agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="07PDxQ"&gt;While it’s popular among TikTok creators, more importantly, text-to-speech is a widely used accessibility feature that allows blind people and those with low vision to hear spoken versions of written text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ilzlba"&gt;To use text-to-speech in Reels, open the Instagram app and go to the Reels camera, record or upload a video, and add text to the video using its text tool. Tap the text bubble to get to the three-dot menu, and select “text-to-speech,” then choose which voice option you want. Then post the Reel as usual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YVckuW"&gt;If you want to add voice effects to your Reel, which lets you modify audio including a voice-over, after recording a Reel, tap the music note to open the audio mixer, tap “effects” and choose the voice effect you want. Options include “helium,” “giant,” and “robot.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7S5JqOKS6x9n954CS_RzJzndgWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23008827/voice_effect.PNG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can add voice effects to Instagram Reels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cEBF0C"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;Reels launched in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, meant to be a direct competitor to the wildly popular TikTok. Instagram launched a bonus program for creators in July, part of parent company Facebook’s (now Meta) plan to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577242/facebook-1-billion-payments-creators-2022"&gt;pay $1 billion to creators&lt;/a&gt; through 2022, and has offered creators with high follower counts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22777899/instagram-reels-bonus-program-35000-dollars-creators-tiktok-competitors"&gt;as much as $35,000 in bonuses to create Reels&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cT5QHn"&gt;Meanwhile, TikTok has evolved its text-to-speech feature with &lt;a href="https://collider.com/scream-ghostface-tiktok-text-to-speech/"&gt;specialized character voices&lt;/a&gt;; on Friday it introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778092/disney-plus-day-tiktok-text-to-speech-voices-characters-marvel"&gt;text-to-speech voices from Disney characters&lt;/a&gt; including Stitch, Chewbacca, Rocket Raccoon, and others. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Invasion’s creepy alien reveal was worth the wait</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Invasion" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/45mkUDYvyjJwkq1vLDS5JPcRWdM=/480x0:3360x1920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70132841/Invasion_Photo_010508.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GFjmVk"&gt;It took half of a season, but we’re finally here: the aliens have shown themselves in &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt;. The Apple TV Plus series got off to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22740520/invasion-review-apple-tv-plus"&gt;a slow start&lt;/a&gt; when it debuted in October. The first handful of episodes were tense character drama, focusing on a few characters spread across the globe, each of whom was dealing with some personal issues in addition to the titular attack on the planet. That was all well and good, but the sci-fi elements were so scant that you could blink and miss them. No one even said the word “alien” until episode five. But now that we’re halfway through the season, that’s changed. The latest episode finally shows the creepy off-world invaders, and it has given the show the purpose it needs — along with some scares.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4dbcps"&gt;If you haven’t watched the show yet, &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; is probably best described as &lt;em&gt;This is Us&lt;/em&gt; mashed up with &lt;em&gt;War of the Worlds&lt;/em&gt;. It takes a big idea — aliens are invading seemingly every part of the world — but explores it through a series of small, intimate stories. There’s a mother learning about an unfaithful spouse, a US soldier on his own in Afghanistan, and a bus full of English teens that crashes in the middle of nowhere, among others. Each of these characters is not only dealing with their own shit but also the early stages of the invasion. No one even knows what’s going on. Amidst power outages, mysterious objects crashing from space, and the occasional synchronized nosebleed, there’s a lot of misplaced blame on “the Russians” or unspecified terrorists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uZFX68"&gt;Viewers, of course, have known all along that it’s aliens. It’s right there in the title of the show. But the hints for the actual characters living through the invasion have been sparse, sporadic, and confusing. Now things are becoming more clear. In episode five, we got a tease of just how strange these invaders might be when a doctor named Aneesha (played by Golshifteh Farahani, whose distraught performance remains a highlight of the show) notices a spiky little blob while stitching up a patient. It’s gross and dangerous-looking. It also seems alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSdAaW"&gt;It turns out that was just a taste. In episode six, after a brief detour that started out as a hunt for food and ended up as a short-term residency at a field hospital, Aneesha returns to the house her family has been staying in, only to find it empty and boarded-up like something from a zombie movie. Except it’s not empty; &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; is lurking around. You see and hear it in brief, terrifying flashes. The whole house will start to shake unexpectedly. Giant, spider-like legs scurry in the background. At one point, you can see the full creature but as a tiny reflection in a mirror.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="invasion" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l8WLDrnD0FTv56naoDQp2I_dQKE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23005242/Invasion_Photo_010503.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UTLTEV"&gt;Like everything else in &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt;, the build-up is slow and methodical. But it works: it’s almost like a horror movie, one that takes its time before showing the monster in its full, terrifying glory. And the reveal here is wonderful, as you watch a tortuous sequence where the creature terrorizes the family as they attempt to make an escape. Seeing the alien doesn’t take away from its mystery or menace at all. In fact, it just raises more questions about how these spindly black blobs managed to coordinate a planet-wide attack and what exactly it is they want.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EW7K68"&gt;What I’m saying is, the slow-burn reveal was worth it. Not only are the aliens unexpected and scary, but their arrival also makes almost every character’s arc more interesting. Before, as engaging as many of the personal stories were, it felt a lot like a bunch of people floundering around during the end of the world. Now there’s some purpose. That’s especially true with Mitsuki Yamato (Shioli Kutsuna), an obsessed Japanese space technician who appears to be the only one close to figuring out what’s going on with the invaders. More than just moving the plot forward, though, the blobby bugs from space have introduced a tangible threat. It’s no longer just some weird stuff going on — it’s a bunch of killer spiders sneaking around every city on the planet for unknown reasons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dncTTx"&gt;I’m glad I stuck it out to see the aliens. But they do introduce a new problem for &lt;em&gt;Invasion&lt;/em&gt; because now the show has to do it all over again. The first five episodes were a slow build-up that ultimately paid off, but we’re just over halfway through the story at this point, so there’s plenty to go. The reveal worked, but the next test will be seeing if the show can connect all of its many stories into something satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hospitals are at a high risk of cyberattacks, but patients don’t realize it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Health Care Professionals Work On The Frontlines Of COVID-19 Pandemic In Maryland Hospital" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Jl5wVeb1ojKI6UAalNNAzgZYRoM=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70132722/1222271719.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0RzJeq"&gt;Southern Ohio Medical Center, a not-for-profit hospital in Portsmouth, Ohio, canceled appointments for today and is diverting ambulances after it was &lt;a href="https://myfox28columbus.com/news/local/southern-ohio-medical-center-hit-by-cyberattack"&gt;hit by a cyberattack on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. It’s part of a series of escalating attacks on healthcare organizations in the past two years — a trend that could have serious consequences for patient care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YY7qWA"&gt;But while information technology experts are well aware that the risk of cyberattacks that compromise patient data and shut down computer systems is on the rise, patients don’t seem to be, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.armis.com/press-releases/armis-data-highlights-increased-risk-for-healthcare-organizations-as-attack-surface-expands/"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; by cybersecurity company Armis. In fact, over 60 percent of people in the general public surveyed in the new report said they hadn’t heard of any cyberattacks in healthcare in the past two years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yG0DMs"&gt;That’s despite a &lt;a href="https://healthitsecurity.com/news/healthcare-cyberattacks-doubled-in-2020-with-28-tied-to-ransomware"&gt;doubling of cyberattacks&lt;/a&gt; on healthcare institutions in 2020, high-profile incidents like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21482304/ransomware-outage-hospital-chain-cybersecurity"&gt;attack on hospital chain Universal Health Services&lt;/a&gt;, and a major &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540026/cyberattack-ransomware-hospitals-russia-covid"&gt;threat&lt;/a&gt; from groups using the ransomware Ryuk. The magnitude of attacks during the COVID-19 pandemic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21551050/cyberattacks-hospitals-coronavirus-deadly-tactics"&gt;shocked experts&lt;/a&gt;, who said that ransomware gangs were targeting hospitals more aggressively than they had before. Unlike attacks on banks or schools, which are also common, these attacks have the potential to directly injure people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vmMMt3"&gt;“It crosses a line that I think the entire cybersecurity community just didn’t think was going to get crossed anytime soon,” Caleb Barlow, CEO of cybersecurity consulting firm CynergisTek, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21551050/cyberattacks-hospitals-coronavirus-deadly-tactics"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7DsLfE"&gt;The Armis report surveyed 400 IT professionals in healthcare and over 2,000 people in the general public who could potentially be patients at healthcare institutions around the United States. Though the number of people surveyed is small, the findings indicate that members of the public generally aren’t aware of cyberattacks in&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the healthcare industry unless they have been impacted directly by one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DU6sst"&gt;While 61 percent of potential patients surveyed hadn’t heard of cyberattacks in healthcare in recent years, around a third of respondents said that they’d been the victim of a cyberattack in the health system. Assuming most people in the group that had been victims of a cyberattack had heard of one, only a small percentage of survey respondents &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; heard of attacks in healthcare without being the victim of one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pkm4iY"&gt;“Attacks on hospital systems really aren’t top of mind until they impact you directly,” says Oscar Miranda, chief technology officer for healthcare at Armis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSFfLY"&gt;The report also zeroed in on a gap between people’s awareness of healthcare cyberattacks and their level of concern about the problem. Around half of people surveyed said that they would switch hospitals if there was a cyberattack, and over 70 percent said they thought attacks could have consequences for their care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIqyeY"&gt;Those concerns are warranted: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696097/hospital-ransomware-cyberattack-death-rates-patients"&gt;healthcare organizations say&lt;/a&gt; that ransomware delays procedures for patients and can lead to longer hospital stays. An &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632378/pandemic-ransomware-health-risks"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; from the United States’ Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency also showed that hospitals battling ransomware attacks during the COVID-19 pandemic reached a tipping point associated with excess deaths more quickly than hospitals not dealing with one.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EpyVCw"&gt;Cybersecurity has historically not been a priority for healthcare organizations, many of which don’t have the resources to invest in that area. But the spikes in ransomware attacks on hospitals in the past two years, coupled with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696097/hospital-ransomware-cyberattack-death-rates-patients"&gt;the new research&lt;/a&gt; showing links between cyberattacks and health outcomes, are pushing groups to make changes. In the Armis survey, three-quarters of IT experts said the steady pulse of news about ransomware attacks has led to a push for more investment in cybersecurity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="69M0pr"&gt;“I do believe we’re making strides in finally actually addressing ransomware,” Miranda says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla vehicle in ‘Full Self-Driving’ beta mode ‘severely damaged’ after crash in California</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gd5mJv1y0OnQGAmw7RKQzgxcTU0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70132720/tesla_model_y_3597.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VLeOdC"&gt;A Tesla Model Y in “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) beta mode allegedly crashed on November 3rd in Brea, a city southeast of Los Angeles, marking what is likely to be the first incident involving the company’s controversial driver assist feature. No one was injured in the crash, but the vehicle was reportedly “severely damaged.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9y0XGa"&gt;The crash was reported to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which has multiple, overlapping investigations into Tesla’s Autopilot system. The incident report appears to have been made by the owner of the Model Y. A spokesperson for NHTSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcot8N"&gt;According to the report: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="v9sPxq"&gt;The Vehicle was in FSD Beta mode and while taking a left turn the car went into the wrong lane and I was hit by another driver in the lane next to my lane. the car gave an alert 1/2 way through the turn so I tried to turn the wheel to avoid it from going into the wrong lane but the car by itself took control and forced itself into the incorrect lane creating an unsafe maneuver putting everyone involved at risk. car is severely damaged on the driver side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="RSGGtu"&gt;Tesla’s decision to test its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22693610/tesla-opens-full-self-driving-beta-software-more-customers"&gt;“Full Self Driving” driver assistance software&lt;/a&gt; with untrained vehicle owners on public roads has attracted a massive amount of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724171/nhtsa-tesla-letters-fsd-beta-autopilot-recall-emergency-vehicles"&gt;scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528508/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-first-reaction-video"&gt;criticism&lt;/a&gt;. Throughout, the company has rolled out — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/24/22743628/elon-musk-tesla-fsd-beta-10-3-rollback-issues-phantom-fcw"&gt;and retracted&lt;/a&gt; — several software updates meant to upgrade the system while also addressing bugs in the software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXYour"&gt;There have been many video clips uploaded online showing Tesla owners using FSD beta, with varying degrees of success. Some clips show the driver assist system confidently handling complex driving scenarios, while others depict the car drifting into the wrong lane or making other serious mistakes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Bneq48"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Despite its name, FSD is not an autonomous driving system&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s3YFum"&gt;Despite its name, FSD is not an autonomous driving system. Drivers are required to stay vigilant, keeping their eyes on the road and their hands on the steering wheel. Vehicles with highly automated driving systems that still require human supervision are classified as Level 2 under the Society of Automotive Engineers’ taxonomy. (Level 5 describes a vehicle that can drive anywhere, under any conditions, without any human supervision.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="48Wwdc"&gt;The US government has taken a renewed interest in Tesla, recently announcing that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626819/tesla-autopilot-crash-emergency-vehicle-probe-nhtsa"&gt;investigating incidents involving Tesla cars operating Autopilot that have crashed&lt;/a&gt; into parked emergency vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dSSz0"&gt;NHTSA is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724171/nhtsa-tesla-letters-fsd-beta-autopilot-recall-emergency-vehicles"&gt;seeking more information from Tesla&lt;/a&gt; about the growing public beta test of FSD, the recently launched “Safety Score” evaluation process for entering the program, and the nondisclosure agreements Tesla was making participants sign up until recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zOuZRV"&gt;A spokesperson for Tesla did not respond to a request for comment — nor is it likely they will after disbanding their press department in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xEyCrn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s 2021 holiday gift guide for creators</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Gifts for the aspiring and established content creators&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="c4X606"&gt;From YouTube to Twitch to TikTok, or everyday photography, videography, and podcasting. To some degree, everyone is a content creator, whether it is a pursuit of a personal passion or for the consumption and streaming by a huge audience. Consequently, the most dedicated creators can also be the most difficult to shop for. What do you get for someone who is just starting out that will be most helpful? Or what about someone that’s a bit further along and more established?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Amzgyl"&gt;If you find yourself shopping for someone in your life that is looking to start something fresh or take their craft to the next level, we have a few gift ideas for you to check out. Like the Sony A6600 ($1,600), some are no small investment but are favored by YouTubers far and wide. Others, like Shure’s MV7 mic ($250), could jumpstart a serious podcast project or be used by a professional. And fun ideas like the IKEA Lanespelare ($25) and Philips Hue Lightstrip kit ($80) could be a great choice for anyone who wants to freshen up the decor in a studio or streaming space, as they look great on-camera.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney partners with TikTok for official text-to-speech voices from Stitch, Chewbacca, Rocket Raccoon, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gEdMDnRtQNr-2va3DEXGZIluUnE=/0x129:1102x864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70132532/Screen_Shot_2021_11_12_at_9.28.44_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KmlF9T"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1459151492586299401"&gt;Disney is teaming up with TikTok&lt;/a&gt; to add official character voices to the popular social media app’s text-to-speech feature, allowing you to have your captions read by &lt;em&gt;Lilo and Stitch&lt;/em&gt;’s Stitch, C-3PO, Chewbacca, a Stormtrooper from &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;, and Rocket Raccoon from &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy. &lt;/em&gt;The new character voices are rolling out in the app today as part of the &lt;a href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/482924/564546/9358?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fwelcome%2Fsubscribe-now%3Fcid%3DDSS-Search-Google-71700000058993695-%26irclickid%3DRgfSZFzslxyIRHnyqjWYSydRUkGxmxXflxjQxI0%26irgwc%3D1%26cid%3DDSS-Affiliate-Impact-Content-Vox%2520Media-564546%26gclid%3DCj0KCQiAsqOMBhDFARIsAFBTN3dBoDWJXrDVwzeR5APtVTarczQ4WhI6tkPIVtKwBlFRLhxMopaTyLMaAlj9EALw_wcB&amp;amp;subid1=VergeDisneyPlusDayTikTok111221" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Disney Plus Day&lt;/a&gt; promotional holiday celebrating the two-year anniversary of the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wp8vXx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Disney is partnering with TikTok for new themed character test-to-speech voices, a feature that will surely be used only in a mature and appropriate fashion. &lt;a href="https://t.co/3Hz2NPZFor"&gt;pic.twitter.com/3Hz2NPZFor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Chaim Gartenberg (@cgartenberg) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cgartenberg/status/1459166147325173765?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cRzovU"&gt;Using the voices works similarly to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22594929/tiktok-text-to-speech-how-to"&gt;regular text-to-speech voices&lt;/a&gt; on TikTok; after recording a video, tap the text button on the screen, and type whatever you’d like the text-to-speech voice to read. Then, tap the text-to-speech button (it looks like a head with sound waves coming out of it) to select a voice. But instead of just seeing the usual milquetoast Siri-like presets that TikTok usually offers (the company has five different ones now, after a lawsuit over the original text-to-speech voice earlier this year), you’ll see — at least in theory — the new Disney voices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1i5GJ"&gt;I say in theory because as part of the promotion, you’ll have to unlock the new Disney voices first by using specific keywords. When I tried it out, I only had the Rocket voice unlocked, but presumably intrepid Disney fans on the internet will figure out how to unlock the other voices quickly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jAPLlI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;*yells in Chewbacca*    New Text-to-Speech voices ft. some of your favorite characters are available now on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tiktok?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TikTok&lt;/a&gt;! To unlock them, discover the mystery keywords. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DisneyPlusDay?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DisneyPlusDay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/mRwzLsmod3"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mRwzLsmod3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Disney+ (@disneyplus) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus/status/1459151492586299401?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="cTOnCo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use TikTok’s Text-to-Speech feature","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22594929/tiktok-text-to-speech-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ByIQUI"&gt;The Disney collaboration isn’t the first time that TikTok has offered promotional text-to-speech voices: the app &lt;a href="https://collider.com/scream-ghostface-tiktok-text-to-speech/"&gt;previously teamed up with Paramount&lt;/a&gt; to add a &lt;em&gt;Scream-&lt;/em&gt;themed voice that sounded like the villainous Ghostface to coincide with the trailer for the upcoming horror film. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6grAE"&gt;Disney and TikTok haven’t said how long the new character text-to-speech voices will be available. Fortunately, though, there is literally no way that giving TikTok creators the power to make C-3PO say &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; will backfire in any way as the new text-to-speech voices get used solely in a mature and appropriate fashion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RvxPgF"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhdzDy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
