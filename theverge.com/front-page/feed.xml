    <title>Sony has 25 PS5 games in the works, including characters you’ve never seen</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZAwl3E"&gt;Sony is apparently looking to release more than 25 PlayStation 5 games under its PlayStation Studios brand. And “nearly half” of them will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be sequels or spinoffs, according to &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/playstation-5-six-months-later/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;’s interview&lt;/a&gt; with PlayStation Studio lead (and former Guerrilla Games managing director) Hermen Hulst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDbbQx"&gt;That could theoretically be a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;more games than the four first-party Sony titles we already know about:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="KH3YLT"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West &lt;/em&gt;(2021)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nBm5rq"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart &lt;/em&gt;(June 2021)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lRbRTm"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;God of War: Ragnarok &lt;/em&gt;(2021)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CGFjhA"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 7 &lt;/em&gt;(2022)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="LfviKv"&gt;Twenty-one additional games could be a huge shot in the arm for the PS5, especially considering how slowly exclusives are trickling out; &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297059/gran-turismo-7-ps5-playstation-5-release-date-delay-2022"&gt;already slipped to next year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWHJXb"&gt;Sony also may not be completely on the hook for producing all of the games that are unaccounted for, though. The PlayStation Studios branding is a bit murky. When it was first announced, Eric Lempel, the head of global marketing at Sony Interactive Entertainment, &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-05-12-sony-unveils-playstation-studios-brand-to-launch-alongside-ps5"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;GamesIndustry.biz&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the branding “doesn’t mean that we outright own the developer, but it just means we brought it up as a first-party. In a lot of cases we don’t own the developer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Va1NEh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In a lot of cases we don’t own the developer.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rQhFr0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt; specifically name-drops indie games from outside studios partnered with Sony, including the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Kena: Bridge of Spirits&lt;/em&gt;, and a game from Haven Studios. It’s unclear whether those and similar titles will be counted toward the more-than-25 figure. Sony didn’t immediately respond to a request for clarification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugebbq"&gt;Also, if Haven Studios doesn’t sound familiar, it’s because it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22334101/jade-raymond-haven-game-studio-playstation"&gt;just formed in March&lt;/a&gt; when noted industry figure Jade Raymond left Google when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;shut down its in-house Stadia development studios&lt;/a&gt;. That speaks to the idea that we many not be seeing some of these games for quite a while. Hulst did mention that some of the games would be small, however, likely taking less development time. That, along with the fact that many of the games won’t be part of existing franchises, is exciting for non-AAA aficionados like myself and could help relieve worries that it’ll take a decade for all these games to come out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dPoyZN"&gt;And while the games may not all be first-party games, that’s not necessarily a bad thing: &lt;em&gt;Returnal &lt;/em&gt;was a PlayStation Studios game made by an outside developer, and it’s an example of an original game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"&gt;that’s received a lot of praise&lt;/a&gt; since its release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oj1Vuy"&gt;It’s also worth noting that these games won’t necessarily be exclusive to the PS5. &lt;em&gt;MLB: The Show 21 &lt;/em&gt;is a PlayStation Studios game that’s available on Xbox, and &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn &lt;/em&gt;has gotten &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21363127/horizon-zero-dawn-pc-port-review-performance"&gt;a (somewhat troubled) PC port&lt;/a&gt;. Sony has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297091/days-gone-pc-playstation-games-ports-jim-ryan"&gt;said it’s interested&lt;/a&gt; in bringing more of its games to the PC in the future. There are also, of course, games that will come out for PS4 as well as PS5: we know that &lt;em&gt;Forbidden West &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-forbidden-west/"&gt;will be released on the older PlayStation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5emVeY"&gt;Even with all the caveats, it’s exciting to hear that Sony is working on a slate of games for the PS5, likely far beyond what we’ve already heard about. With Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407195/sony-ps5-sales-numbers-q4-2020-earnings"&gt;latest earnings report&lt;/a&gt; indicating that it’s sold 7.8 million PS5s, there are a lot of customers who will be looking for experiences that justify the cost of the PS5, and it seems like Sony is trying to make sure it’s got its bases covered. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees circulate petition demanding investigation into ‘misogynistic’ new hire</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6Dwe2ELmHZsF_DvsEHnCbuD7HDA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69276915/acastro_190322_1777_apple_streaming_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jBojf7"&gt;A group of Apple employees has written a petition asking for an investigation into the hiring of Antonio García Martínez — a former Facebook product manager and author of the book &lt;em&gt;Chaos Monkeys.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2D4443"&gt;In the petition, the employees expressed concern about García Martínez’s views on women and people of color. His hiring “calls into question parts of our system of inclusion at Apple, including hiring panels, background checks, and our process to ensure our existing culture of inclusion is strong enough to withstand individuals who don’t share our inclusive values,” they write. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAagkL"&gt;García Martínez, who has &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/author/antonio-garcia-martinez/"&gt;also written for &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, was the product manager for Facebook’s ad targeting team from 2011 to 2013. Most of the things the Apple employees have expressed concern about come from &lt;em&gt;Chaos Monkeys&lt;/em&gt; itself. (The book is dedicated to “all my enemies.”) The autobiography traces García Martínez going from Wall Street to Silicon Valley. García Martínez has &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2016/8/9/12415696/antonio-garcia-martinez-chaos-monkeys-recode-decode-podcast-transcript"&gt;described the book&lt;/a&gt; as “total Hunter S. Thompson/Gonzo mode.” The employees, in the petition, view it differently: they say it’s racist and sexist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fs9Ja"&gt;One screenshot from the book that has been circulating on Twitter calls women in the Bay area “soft and weak, cosseted and naive despite their claims of worldliness, and generally full of shit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7Fqto"&gt;“It’s so exhausting being a woman in tech; sitting opposite men who think because of my gender, I am soft and weak and generally full of shit,” wrote an Apple employee on Twitter, drawing attention to the quote. “It’s not even worth it to say I have worked relentlessly for every accomplishment I have.” The tweet also contained a screenshot of the passage in question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2qnioq"&gt;Silicon Valley has consistently had a white, male workforce. There are some in the Valley, such as notorious ex-Googler James Damore, who suggest this is because women and people of color &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/16/16153740/tech-diversity-problem-science-history-explainer-inequality"&gt;lack the innate qualities needed to succeed in tech&lt;/a&gt;. But wave after wave of sex discrimination lawsuits tell a different story: that underrepresented groups have been &lt;em&gt;prevented&lt;/em&gt; from succeeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGKFPT"&gt;At Apple, women make up 40 percent of the workforce but only 23 percent of the research and development teams, according to the company’s most recent diversity report. Half of the workforce is white, and 27 percent is Asian. “Across Apple, we’ve strengthened our long-standing commitment to making our company more inclusive and the world more just,” reads the header on the &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/diversity/"&gt;website containing the report&lt;/a&gt;. “Where every great idea can be heard. And everybody belongs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRBLvn"&gt;Here’s the full text of the letter, which began circulating today (emphasis theirs): &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="V3yw3D"&gt;
&lt;p id="f9AUEU"&gt;Eddy and I&amp;amp;D champions, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HERCTV"&gt;We are deeply concerned about the recent hiring of Antonio García Martínez. His misogynistic statements in his autobiography — such as “&lt;em&gt;Most women in the Bay Area are soft and weak, cosseted and naive despite their claims of worldliness, and generally full of shit&lt;/em&gt;” (further quoted below this letter) — directly oppose Apple’s commitment to Inclusion &amp;amp; Diversity. We are profoundly distraught by what this hire means for Apple’s commitment to its inclusion goals, as well as its real and immediate impact on those working near Mr. García Martínez. It calls into question parts of our system of inclusion at Apple, including hiring panels, background checks, and our process to ensure our existing culture of inclusion is strong enough to withstand individuals who don’t share our inclusive values. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fsq8JU"&gt;It is concerning that the views Mr. García Martínez expresses in his 2016 book &lt;em&gt;Chaos Monkeys &lt;/em&gt;were overlooked — or worse, excused — during his background check or hiring panel. &lt;strong&gt;We demand an investigation into how his published views on women and people of color were missed or ignored, along with a clear plan of action to prevent this from happening again&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Y7nHv"&gt;Inclusion isn’t just about who we hire; it’s also about how we support everyone who already works at Apple. Given Mr. García Martínez’s history of publishing overtly racist and sexist remarks about his former colleagues, we are concerned that his presence at Apple will contribute to an unsafe working environment for our colleagues who are at risk of public harassment and private bullying. &lt;strong&gt;We are entitled to insight into how the People team intends to mitigate this risk. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iZONtG"&gt;Further, the e&lt;em&gt;xplicit, conscious &lt;/em&gt;biases expressed in Mr. García Martínez’s writing will continue to slow our I&amp;amp;D progress as long as they are tolerated by those with the power to affect hiring decisions and career trajectories. At a minimum, &lt;strong&gt;we demand assurance that Mr. García Martínez and any who share his harmful views will not be involved in hiring, interviewing, or performance decisions during their tenures at Apple. &lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gzfp88"&gt;Finally, &lt;strong&gt;we expect and deserve a transparent, intentional, and detailed strategy from Apple to ensure our culture of inclusion is strong enough to protect our team members against biases like these that ANY new hire brings&lt;/strong&gt;. Our training calls attention to the unconscious biases that contradict our stated values, but no amount of training can inspire a commitment to inclusion in someone who objects to its basic premise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11y8H8"&gt;We have included a selection of direct quotes below this letter from &lt;em&gt;Chaos Monkeys &lt;/em&gt;and interviews with Mr. García Martínez that showcase some of the statements he’s made. We are aware that Mr. Martinez has claimed that the quote above is taken out of context, but the full passage is no less harmful. We are also aware that Mr. Martinez has attempted to distance himself from these statements by claiming that they represent widely held attitudes in the tech industry. This is not a tenable position. In reproducing these harmful stereotypes, and in materially benefiting from them, Mr. Martinez shows himself to be a participant in this culture and only furthers the sexism and racism that our I&amp;amp;D initiatives are working to counteract. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCETiw"&gt;Thank you for hearing our concerns. We look forward to your response regarding Apple’s plans to continue moving toward a more inclusive workspace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwtiaA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quotes from the book &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="znQdCV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Most women in the Bay Area are soft and weak, cosseted and naive despite their claims of worldliness, and generally full of shit. They have their self-regarding entitlement feminism, and ceaselessly vaunt their independence, but the reality is, come the epidemic plague or foreign invasion, they’d become precisely the sort of useless baggage you’d trade for a box of shotgun shells or a jerry can of diesel. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id="S3VlPs"&gt;We tried to contextualize the above quote further with additional text from his book, but there was no context that made the language used and views expressed acceptable. In fact, the additional context opened our eyes to some of Mr. García Martínez’s other problematic views — none of which he has disclaimed since &lt;em&gt;Chaos Monkeys &lt;/em&gt;was published: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="sS09D9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you had been standing on the corner of Broadway and MacArthur Boulevard in Oakland the night of March 7, 2010, you would have seen a curious sight. A heavily pregnant woman, bent over in pain and scarcely able to walk, was being half carried, half dragged across the street by a tall, goateed man. The woman could barely stand, and needed to pause and cling to either the man, or any fixed object, as they struggled across the last couple hundred feet. Every ten paces or so, the woman would double over and gasp in pain, bringing everything to a halt. The man was simultaneously trying to check for traffic, keep his female companion from collapsing, tow a large suitcase, and navigate the whole lurching ensemble toward the emergency room door. That goateed man, gentle reader, was me. The woman was a former City of London derivatives trader. She was thirty-seven weeks pregnant. We had known each other for thirty-nine weeks. Let’s rewind before we fast-forward again. “Life is what happens when you’re making other plans.” If you ever run across an online dating profile with the above as a tagline, be aware you’re in for one fucking life-changing date. I had found British Trader’s profile while searching for the keyword “sailing.” Thematic searches (e.g., “physics,” “PhD,” “beer”) were my way of finding some iota of common ground with which to structure an introductory message. At the time, online dating sites distinguished themselves mostly by the demographics of their members. Craigslist was for escorts, fat chicks in Fremont, and serial killers. OkCupid was for penniless hipster chicks who lived in shared flats in the Mission. Match.com was for professional women busy with the time-honored tradition of husband shopping. Choose your audience, and write your ad copy. Mine was heavy on the sailing and outdoor adventuring. Zero mention of diaper changes and daycare drop-offs. Truth in advertising, more or less. She had vaguely Slavic-looking cheekbones and feline eyes. Her Match profile photo featured her at the tiller of a boat, which instantly quintupled her attractiveness. Message led to dinner date. Dinner date led to an opera outing. One early Friday evening, dressed in her corporate finest, she appeared unannounced at the boatyard. My twenty-six-foot sloop Moksha was hauled out on land, and I was busily refitting it for serious offshore sailing. Covered in dust and grease, I welcomed her to my boat. She climbed up the precarious twelve-foot ladder to Moksha’s deck, which towered over the ground due to the boat’s deep keel. Then, a romantic reversal. The following weekend, a tall, rangy guy put his boat next to mine in the yard. A strapping and strutting South African, he walked over and we started talking boats. We got along famously, and continued our unending string of boat talk with beer and pizza at the local red-and-white-tablecloth Italian place. He was, as fate would have it, British Trader’s ex-boyfriend, who had recently and unceremoniously dumped her. This business was serious. As I’d eventually learn from British Trader, they had tried having a child despite never marrying. Their inability to conceive had convinced British Trader she was barren. He and I ended our boozing and bullshitting and got back to work on our respective boats. As I was painting the bottom, I looked over and saw some hot chick talking to my new South African friend. I saw only her jeans-clad ass. Given my as-yet noncomprehensive knowledge of her anatomy, I didn’t recognize her. Of course, it was British Trader, stopping by the yard to check randomly on my progress. Given there was only one large boatyard for serious refitting in the East Bay, meeting her recent beau wasn’t a completely improbable coincidence. Weirded out by my bonding with her ex, she decided to end the budding romance. But then a week later she changed her mind. I had brunch with her and her female confidante. On my finest social behavior, I passed muster with her friend. The next invitation was dinner at her house. When I appeared on her doorstep with a bottle of wine and a smile, she opened the door conspicuously made up, perfumed, and in a fetching dress. The moment that door swung open, I knew I had her. The contemporary honeymoon of a several-week fuck- fest, consummated at the start of a new romantic liaison, played itself out comme il faut. No surprises really, other than British Trader’s taste for being physically dominated in bed, a bit of a surprise given her alpha-female exterior. To a woman, every girlfriend of mine has been intelligent, ambitious, and independent. Until very recently, all were vastly more successful and wealthier than me. And yet, come the pressing hour of physical need, so unfolded the countless boudoir scenes recalling Fragonard’s Le Verrou: a ravished chambermaid, half resisting and half yielding, violently seized in the arms of her predatory lover, who slams shut the bolt on the bedroom door. The backdrop to the tryst turned relationship was a modest bungalow fixer-upper that British Trader had bought, taking advantage of a corporate relocation package. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3EP396"&gt;&lt;em&gt;She made Bob Vila of This Old House look like a fucking pussy. She had ripped out the ornate and custom built-in shelves and display case from one room and installed them in another. The flooring was down to the planking, to be redone in fresh hardwood (by her, with a nail gun and lots of patience). The only room that was even remotely livable was the kitchen (which featured beautiful hardwood counters that were regularly oiled). Her bed consisted of a cheap foam mattress about the width of an extra-jumbo-sized menstrual pad inside a room stripped to the wall studs. The floor was dusty with drywall powder from the demolition, and postcoitally, it was all I could do to balance myself precariously on the edge of the pad and off the drywall dust. Morning showers were in the one functioning bathroom, whose empty window frames were covered in plastic. A molded plastic shower in the corner and a lonely-looking white porcelain toilet were the only signs of civilization in what appeared to be the inside of a garden shed. The scene of conception was either the aforementioned foam pad, or the hardwood kitchen counter. Two generations ago, her branch of the family, moneyed Jews in czarist Russia, had seen the revolutionary writing on the wall and had fled to the United Kingdom. Another branch moved to China and became an established trading family in Harbin. In Britain, the family made the unlikely transition to landed gentry, and ran a farm in Bedfordshire. A great-uncle was elevated to the peerage, and a second cousin shared the Nobel Prize with Alexander Fleming for penicillin. When she was in her teens, her father decided to move the family to the United States, where they suffered a financial reversal she was unwilling to talk about. Suddenly not among the moneyed class, she hustled herself through the redbrick boondocks of the University of Vermont. Citibank internship led to Deutsche Bank job, and after a few years she was an equity derivatives trader at Deutsche, holding her own against the toff sharks of the City of London. She had wild green eyes, with unnatural red spots in her irises when you pulled close, reminiscent of that Afghan girl from the National Geographic cover. Her personality was flinty and rough, and as leathery as her skin. She had spent years between various jobs backpacking around the rougher parts of the world. She was an imposing, broad- shouldered presence, six feet tall in bare feet, and towering over me in heels. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Most women in the Bay Area are soft and weak, cosseted and naive despite their claims of worldliness, and generally full of shit. They have their self- regarding entitlement feminism, and ceaselessly vaunt their independence, but the reality is, come the epidemic plague or foreign invasion, they’d become precisely the sort of useless baggage you’d trade for a box of shotgun shells or a jerry can of diesel. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;British Trader, on the other hand, was the sort of woman who would end up a useful ally in that postapocalypse, doing whatever work—be it carpentry, animal husbandry, or a shotgun blast to someone’s back— required doing. Long story short, you wanted to tie your genetic wagon to the bucking horse of her bloodline. Which is why I was less nervous than I should have been on a random Saturday in July, when I showed up for a brunch appointment and found her uncharacteristically moody. She complained of feeling nauseated and slightly out of it. With perhaps too much offhandedness, while grabbing the local newspaper off her couch, I suggested, “Well, perhaps do a pregnancy test.” Like any male who’s played it fast and loose with the safe-sex rules, I’d had my fair share of scares. I was on season four of the show whereby tear-filled woman X shows up two weeks after the shag saying she had “missed her period” (sort of in the same way I’d say I “missed my bus”). Nothing had ever come of it, and after the third showing you just wanted to say, “Look, woman, unless you’ve got a screaming infant in your arms and it looks like me, we have nothing to talk about.” She’d have both soon enough. “Well, I did go to the doctor,” she replied instantly. Things took on a rather portentous air for a casual Saturday-morning brunch. “Ah . . . and?” “I am pregnant.” BAM! A human life. Shit, I thought. I could hear God laughing in his vaulted hangout. Life is what happens when you’re making other plans indeed. By her account, British Trader had broken into tears on hearing the news from her doctor, whom she had gone to see on some routine visit. Yeah, that old story. One look into her hard, green eyes, and I knew this kid was seeing the light of day. Due more to some residual Catholic guilt and Hispanic chivalry than true love for British Trader, I sublet my one-bedroom bohemian pad in the Mission, which had followed my hippie-chick household, and moved into her home turned construction site. I’d make a go of this domesticated parental life. If you jump into the abyss, jump headlong. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="QkyKUY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PMMess, as we’ll call her, was composed of alternating Bézier curves from top to bottom: convex, then concave, and then convex again, in a vertical undulation you couldn’t take your eyes off of. Unlike most women at Facebook (or in the Bay Area, really) she knew how to dress; forties-style, form-fitting dresses from neck to knee were her mainstay. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Her blond hair was offset by olive skin, and bright blue eyes shone like headlights from her neotenic face. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="uTI0k7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chander was a recent hire from Friendster, where he claimed to have put out the technical fires that had resulted from rapid scaling. He had brought a crew of engineers with him from the dying social network, and they formed the nucleus of his personal mafia. He managed mostly through intimidation. In his ill-fitting polyester polo shirts with color palettes stolen from the late seventies, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;he reminded me of the bored auto-rickshaw drivers in front of Connaught Place, Delhi, who’d overcharge you a hundred rupees to go down the street to Paharganj. “So is there anything we can do compensation-wise, Antonio?” asked Chander in his thick Indian accent. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="atbeNW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The market was on Willow Road, which started just outside 24-karat Palo Alto, then wended its way through equally gold- plated Menlo Park and past the VA hospital that Ken Kesey once worked in and that inspired One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest. Almost as if on an exotic safari, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Willow Road then traversed East Palo Alto, the local slum that once had the highest murder rate in the Bay Area (two of the local schools are named after César Chávez and Ron McNair, an African American astronaut) &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;We, before ending at Facebook’s entrance gate, complete with Like sign ringed by an ever- present scrum of tourists. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="UmaPH2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What’s my big beef with capitalism? That it desacralizes everything, robs the world of wonder, and leaves it as nothing more than a vulgar market. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The fastest way to cheapen anything—be it a woman, a favor, or a work of art—is to put a price tag on it. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;And that’s what capitalism is, a busy greengrocer going through his store with a price-sticker machine—ka- CHUNK! ka-CHUNK!—$4.10 for eggs, $5 for coffee at Sightglass, $5,000 per month for a run-down one-bedroom in the Mission. ... &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XqMl0b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Out of nowhere British Trader informs me she is once again pregnant; the calendar math takes us right back to my move- out imbroglio in December, our last tryst after a breakup desert of nonintimacy. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;After a brief debate, British Trader confirms her desire to keep the child, whatever my thoughts on the matter. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;It occurred to me that perhaps this most recent experiment in fertility—and the first—had been planned on British Trader’s part, her back up against the menopause wall, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a professional woman with every means at her disposal except a willing male partner—in which case I had been snookered into fatherhood via warm smiles and pliant thighs, the oldest tricks in the book. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ENMjUf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Funding a company via equity, rather than debt, is a different beast. With a capped note, there’s no universal agreed-upon value. You can bounce from investor to investor, like a bee from flower to flower gathering pollen, getting notes signed at various caps, and no one need be the wiser. In priced-equity rounds, however, everyone has to agree on a share price and a total amount sold, and everyone must sign on the dotted line at once. Typically there’s a round lead, usually the biggest investor in that round, who will help you herd the other investor cats into the deal. Also, the contractual legal work is more complex, and hence more expensive. Then the bank wires fly and you’re money. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To make an analogy, a capped note is like having to seduce five women one after the other, while an equity round is having to convince five women to do a sixsome with you. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The latter is exponentially harder than the former.* &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id="XpiOXA"&gt;Footnote for the quote above: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XVLu4U"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The women analogy breaks down in that, unlike with women, the more investors you seduce into your moresome, the more likely others are to join. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is an expression of the lemming-like nature of tech investors, most of whom scarcely merit the title. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="jT4lqL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;I had never been fired in my life, but I always suspected that in extreme cases, it would kind of resemble that scene. I wasn’t too far off. The Tommy moment hit when I noticed some hot chick in the room with Gokul. Then it hit me. Oh shit. Gokul, you steaming little cunt. You won’t even let me quit. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There were few women one would call conventionally attractive at Facebook. The few there were rarely if ever dressed for work with their femininity on display in the form of dresses and heels. A fully turned out member of the deuxième sexe in a conference room was as clear an angel of death as a short-barreled .38 Special revolver. Gokul gave an awkward smile, and bolted out the door the moment I sat down. I looked across the table. If her look was supposed to disarm me, she needed either more cleavage or more charm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="VCVAOc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;After waiting our turn, I stood in the “next up” booth, getting wired to a mike by Y Combinator’s CFO, an unflappably chipper Brit named Kirsty. The polite applause for the previous pitch dying down, I took the stage. Cued by whoever was running the laptop, I lit into it like I had just mainlined a handful of cocaine. Screenshots flew by, logos of all the current customers, growth rates, $70 billion market, Google is just the first step—&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;there was even an appropriate amount of laughter at the one half-naked woman we’d snuck in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;(a lingerie company was using AdGrok to sell fancy bras). It all went as practiced, even better. If the VCs were falling asleep before AdGrok, they sure were awake after. Two and a half minutes later, it was done. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id="mnnDhF"&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Quotes from Mr. García Martínez after the publishing of Chaos Monkeys &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="XAMdJZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;You think I’m bad, you should meet other people in tech.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TM1CkF"&gt;&lt;em&gt; Here’s the scoop: outsiders who know nothing about Silicon Valley think I’m terrible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IvWVQV"&gt;&lt;em&gt; Insiders who know the game well think I’m actually honest, self-deprecating, and funny, and actually tame by Valley standards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMbGvO"&gt;&lt;em&gt; You’re evidently the former, as are many of the one-star reviews on AMZN.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19aWHc"&gt;&lt;em&gt; The latter are the five-star reviews and the gushing Tweets.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKEaPR"&gt;&lt;em&gt; Maybe the real problem is that most people don’t really understand how the Valley works, thinking it looks like what’s on the front page of Fortune magazine. Rather than re-adjust their vision, they choose to shoot the messenger. It’s certainly their right, but I’d hope they act otherwise. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="KjyBgk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5b4tqe/i_am_antonio_garcia_martinez_a_tech_entrepreneur/"&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5b4tqe/i_am_antonio_garcia_martinez_a_tech_entrepreneur/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="labVqn"&gt;Regarding “Most women in the Bay Area are soft and weak ... they become precisely the sort of useless baggage you trade for a box of shotgun shells or a jerrycan of diesel:” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="gzWvfe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;And this is the important thing to put into context! I am contrasting this broad overgeneralization to the reality of the woman that I was falling in love with, okay? &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>The cast for the first Knives Out sequel is shaping up to be pretty awesome</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Street Style - Paris Fashion Week - Womenswear Fall/Winter 2020/2021 : Day Eight" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YMh22gqxUT_xu5JzWbq3sYpXgMw=/0x0:5831x3887/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69276624/1209913522.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Hanna Lassen/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SZBpc2"&gt;At the end of March, Netflix acquired the rights &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360964/netflix-knives-out-sequels-2-3-deal-rian-johnson-daniel-craig"&gt;to two &lt;em&gt;Knives Out&lt;/em&gt; sequels&lt;/a&gt; in a blockbuster deal reportedly worth more than $400 million, and the cast for the first sequel is quickly shaping up to be as epic as the one for the original movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVxw2M"&gt;We got the first inkling about the new cast on Monday, when &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/05/dave-bautista-daniel-craig-rian-johnsons-knives-out-2-netflix-1234752608/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Dave Bautista was joining the cast of the film. (He talked about his role with &lt;em&gt;Polygon’s&lt;/em&gt; Tasha Robinson in &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/movies/22430923/dave-bautista-knives-out-2-cast-interview-army-of-the-dead"&gt;an interview published on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;.) Then, on Tuesday, &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; had another scoop, reporting that &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/05/knives-out-2-edward-norton-daniel-craig-rian-johnson-1234752619/"&gt;Ed Norton has signed on as well&lt;/a&gt;. And on Wednesday, &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; said that musician and actress &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/janelle-monae-knives-out-sequel-1234950252/"&gt;Janelle Monáe is joining the cast&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1q2OMo"&gt;They’ll all appear alongside Daniel Craig, who will reprise his delightful role as Detective Benoit Blanc in both sequels. Director Rian Johnson will also be back to helm the two new movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X11W7M"&gt;I saw the original &lt;em&gt;Knives Out&lt;/em&gt; for the first time last year, and I absolutely loved it. A large part of my enjoyment of the film was because of its fantastic ensemble cast, which included Ana de Armas, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, LaKeith Stanfield, and Christopher Plummer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfW55P"&gt;Plot details for the new movies haven’t been revealed just yet, but given the A-list talent that’s already coming together for the first sequel, I’m guessing Johnson has something good in the works. Production on the movie will begin in Greece this summer, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/05/dave-bautista-daniel-craig-rian-johnsons-knives-out-2-netflix-1234752608/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok adds another way to remix videos with green screen duets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The TikTok music note logo against a dark background. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tReyOaGc_FX4s7mFGDX4x-uQpKo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69276104/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N1QYua"&gt;TikTok launched a &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/green-screen-duet"&gt;new feature today&lt;/a&gt; that combines the existing duet and green screen formats, letting people use other TikToks as the background for their own. “Green Screen Duet” now appears as an option in the duet layout menu. Like all duets, the creator of the original video is tagged in the caption of the new one. This could be great news or a portent of even more sensory overload in the app, depending on your sensibilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A layout menu in TikTok that shows duet options labelled left and right, green screen, react, and top and bottom." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L_uZQkH5pwIb_ku15nne_qtJ_vU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22509596/tiktok_green_screen_duet.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TikTok&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The green screen option among duet layouts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fj6f0K"&gt;The new feature will likely be a useful tool for people who already use TikTok’s “green screen” to put images in the background of their videos, or edit videos to create a similar effect. It also might make TikToks that are reactions to other TikToks more visually cohesive than Duets (where videos are tiled next to each other) and Stitches (where a clip of the original video plays for a few seconds before the new one starts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1fsDJ"&gt;TikTok continues to roll out new formats as other companies add TikTok-like features to their own apps. Instagram’s Reels can now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360544/instagram-reels-remix-tiktok-duet-feature-launch"&gt;be “remixed”&lt;/a&gt; like TikTok duets. Snap says its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21585513/snapchat-snap-spotlight-creators-app-update-tiktok"&gt;TikTok competitor Spotlight&lt;/a&gt; reached &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266970/snap-spotlight-100-million-mau-q4-2020-earnings"&gt;100 million users&lt;/a&gt; two months after it launched, and YouTube is planning to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22429350/youtube-shorts-fund-video-payments-tiktok-competitor"&gt;pay creators&lt;/a&gt; who use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22334540/youtube-shorts-us-beta-tiktok-competition-launch"&gt;YouTube Shorts&lt;/a&gt; to encourage them to keep posting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xy9YCN"&gt;For a better idea of how the feature works, here’s someone adding sign language interpretation to a TikTok that’s already a running bit between several users:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uQB39y"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@signstorm/video/6959683573557382405" data-video-id="6959683573557382405" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@signstorm" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@signstorm"&gt;@signstorm&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a title="duet" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/duet"&gt;#duet&lt;/a&gt; with @themikeandmoshow I just had to add to this!! &lt;a title="greenscreen" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/greenscreen"&gt;#greenscreen&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="funnyduet" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/funnyduet"&gt;#funnyduet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Marcus DiPaola" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6958374958800079621"&gt;♬ original sound - Marcus DiPaola&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

    <title>Chevy Bolt EUV gets lower than expected EPA range of 247 miles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DKmPeU5CpKlcZdBiC_9LvdJ34hk=/0x0:1280x853/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69276001/2022_Chevrolet_BoltEUV_007.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eZMtaU"&gt;The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) says the new “EUV” version of the 2022 Chevy Bolt will travel an average of 247 miles on a full battery pack — three miles shy of the estimate General Motors provided when the vehicle was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/14/22280449/chevy-bolt-ev-euv-super-cruise-range-price-specs"&gt;announced in February&lt;/a&gt;. The updated version of the existing Bolt, meanwhile, will top out at 259 miles, which is exactly what GM had predicted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ciYRd1"&gt;The EUV (which stands for “electric utility vehicle”) is basically a Bolt with a more traditional compact SUV shape. It’s about six inches longer and &lt;em&gt;slightly&lt;/em&gt; roomier than the standard Bolt, and as such it weighs nearly 100 pounds more. That it can make fewer miles on the same 65kWh battery pack is not surprising, but it’s helpful to finally have an EPA rating in order to benchmark it against the competition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cDOkOm"&gt;Those ratings are for city and highway driving combined. The EPA says owners should expect to get a little more out of each new vehicle when confined to city driving (roughly 267 miles for the EUV and 280 miles for the regular Bolt), while more demanding highway driving will drain the battery faster (about 223 miles for the EUV and 233 miles for the regular Bolt). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vq50l4"&gt;The Bolt was one of the first real long-range options to hit the EV market that wasn’t made by Tesla. And while it’s disappointing that GM wasn’t able to leverage some of the technology it’s developing for its upcoming Ultium series of battery packs (which will power far more capable EVs like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22370058/gm-chevy-electric-silverado-pickup-truck"&gt;electric Silverado pickup&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22362072/hummer-suv-electric-price-specs-release-date"&gt;pair of electric Hummers&lt;/a&gt;), the new Bolts offer more than enough range for most people’s daily driving needs at a more palatable price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rxrDFP"&gt;The bigger question with these new Bolts will be the reliability of their battery packs. GM recently had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564217/gm-chevy-bolt-recall-battery-fire-lg-chem"&gt;issue a recall&lt;/a&gt; in response to a handful of reports of fires in the battery packs, and so did Hyundai, which used the same LG Chem batteries in its Kona EVs. The Detroit automaker’s fix &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417634/chevy-bolt-recall-fire-fix-software-update"&gt;involves installing additional software&lt;/a&gt; to monitor for abnormalities in the battery packs, and it told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that this software would be installed on all new Bolts moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZnYJZm"&gt;There’s a great site-wide deal happening for a limited time at eBay on, well, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fb%2FeBay-Coupons%2Fbn_7109765183%3F_trkparms%3D%2526clkid%253D1590810078023031888%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F12%2F22432408%2Febay-4k-tv-lg-oled-samsung-qled-neo-tcl-mini-led-sale-deal-gaming-ps5-xbox-series-x-hdmi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a lot of things&lt;/a&gt;. The&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;offer code &lt;strong&gt;PICKSUMMER15 &lt;/strong&gt;is active through May 16th (ending 11:59PM PT) and knocks 15 percent off your purchase total when applied (via &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/05/12/save-15-on-the-new-nest-hub-google-wifi-and-tons-more-smart-tech-in-latest-ebay-sale/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The code will automatically show up at checkout when you have eligible products in your cart, but you’ll need to check the box to activate it. The terms state that you can use it two times, which is impressive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aoz5PS"&gt;To receive the maximum $100 discount, you’ll need to spend more than $666. With that in mind, purchasing a 4K TV with this deal seems like a smart idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNYuF7"&gt;We scoured eBay’s various pages to find which products are eligible for discounts, and the TVs on offer were better than expected. In fact, we found a few models included in news editor Chris Welch’s guide for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"&gt;the best gaming TV to pair with a PS5 or an Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;, though it’s not clear how much stock is available for each model. Also, the final price might not be the lowest we’ve seen on these models, but they’re better than what other retailers are currently offering.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oKr-UsNoVCuargkwbXUYeriybgw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22400097/tcl.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sG4WNk"&gt;First up is TCL’s 65-inch 6-series Mini LED QLED 4K TV (model 65R635). It’s listed for $1,100 on eBay, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F184448058243%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F5%2F12%2F22432408%2Febay-4k-tv-lg-oled-samsung-qled-neo-tcl-mini-led-sale-deal-gaming-ps5-xbox-series-x-hdmi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but this offer code brings it down by $100 before taxes take effect&lt;/a&gt;. The QLED TV features 120Hz support in 1440p resolution — which the Xbox Series X supports — but it tops out at 60Hz for 4K gameplay. It also supports variable refresh rate (VRR) and auto low-latency mode (ALLM).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xiu4mp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462612"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="juRk7J"&gt;If you want to upgrade to an OLED, LG’s 55-inch CX model is $1,296 once the offer code goes into effect. The LG CX features a brilliant OLED display and HDMI 2.1 support, which opens the door to 4K resolution displaying up to 120Hz. Like the above TCL model, it also supports VRR and ALLM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dfNjsP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462552"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tq-7QVKOY7dmwRW9Xa_IUK_-nVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217046/DSCF2777.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Dk9NtO"&gt;The most high-end option we found — it retails for $1,698, post discount — was Samsung’s 55-inch Neo QLED QN90A 4K TV. It’s the company’s first series of LCD TVs to use Mini LED backlighting tech, which results in better contrast and higher brightness. It also has an HDMI 2.1 port, allowing for a powerful PC or gaming console and 4K support at up to 120Hz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BoLhqf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462562"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The original Xbox background is here to haunt the Xbox Series X / S</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q9YIob7rKeW0qeZoWIWwmEmTQsw=/187x0:1414x818/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69275727/Screen_Shot_2021_05_12_at_9.12.40_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TOepfI"&gt;The Xbox has gone through several visual periods during its life span, from an edgy and yet somehow dorky green alien thing, to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21517293/xbox-series-x-s-dashboard-ui-october-update-release"&gt;a modern look&lt;/a&gt; that could be described as “I know how to use Excel but I can still have fun.” But like stumbling on a Facebook album from high school, you can still hold on to a bit of the past. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1392240418016878592?s=20"&gt;As spotted by senior editor Tom Warren&lt;/a&gt;, the original Xbox background is now an option for the Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKSvJ3"&gt;The new (old) styling was added as a new dynamic background as part of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430549/xbox-update-may-quick-resume-saved-audio-passthrough"&gt;Tuesday’s system update&lt;/a&gt;, which notably also brought improvements to quick resume. Titled “The Original,” it looks like a higher-resolution version of the glowing green orb that was at the center of the first Xbox’s user interface. Please note: it’s not the interface itself (Microsoft wouldn’t abandon tiles like that), but it is a recognizable part of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gUYIAC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Xbox insiders can now access the original Xbox dashboard animation as a dynamic background called "The Original" &lt;a href="https://t.co/Nvh6D8iw2X"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Nvh6D8iw2X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1392240418016878592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 11, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Z5eV8"&gt;My experience with the original Xbox is admittedly secondhand. To me, it was the loud box that lived at my friend’s house and let us play &lt;em&gt;Halo: Combat Evolved&lt;/em&gt;. But I do think you can get a pretty solid hit of nostalgia just by looking at this background and remembering what used to be. A simpler, more green time, when consoles were consoles and not Metro-inspired (or I guess &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/11/15615812/microsoft-fluent-design-system-project-neon-features"&gt;Fluent Design-inspired&lt;/a&gt;) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/21/4352654/xbox-one-powered-by-windows-app-development"&gt;pseudo-Windows&lt;/a&gt; machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3axnYK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X7hRb2BXL1A?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VEVcwe"&gt;Microsoft and the Xbox team have been through a lot since the 2001 launch of the Xbox — the Xbox One was briefly positioned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/8/5075216/xbox-one-tv-microsofts-plan-to-take-over-the-living-room"&gt;as a sort of cable box&lt;/a&gt; — but there’s some charm missing in the current dashboard and user experience. That charm was exchanged for a mostly better, if more complicated experience overall, but the heart still remembers what the brain forgot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Il13IW"&gt;For a longer trip down memory lane, check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21152674/xbox-design-history-360-one-series-x-console-dashboard"&gt;our visual history of the Xbox Dashboard&lt;/a&gt; and ponder with me how the Xbox 360’s “Blades” could be crammed on the Series X and S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7Do7CA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AZYhri2tsM4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Dax Shepard’s Armchair Expert podcast is going exclusive to Spotify</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="2020 Winter TCA Tour - Day 10" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fLefmrVUTAiJhUOxIdPvKq0OEjg=/0x0:3228x2152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69275635/1199958258.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amy Sussman/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sFxUPK"&gt;Spotify’s adding another big name to its list of exclusive podcasts: Dax Shepard and his show &lt;em&gt;Armchair Expert&lt;/em&gt;, which is one of the most popular podcasts running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="roquwJ"&gt;All past and future episodes will be available exclusively on Spotify starting July 1st. Along with the exclusive distribution rights to &lt;em&gt;Armchair Expert&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Spotify is also signing a first look deal with Armchair Umbrella Network, meaning it gets first dibs on any other shows the network creates. The show will be exclusively licensed to the company for an undisclosed number of years. The terms of the deal were not shared, but the program will move over to Megaphone, a Spotify company, for hosting, and Spotify will handle ad sales in-house&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fa5Qfd"&gt;The deal harkens back to Spotify’s Joe Rogan partnership. Similarly, Rogan’s show, &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21263927/joe-rogan-spotify-experience-exclusive-content-episodes-youtube"&gt;went exclusive to Spotify&lt;/a&gt; in September last year, although clips continue to live on YouTube. &lt;em&gt;Armchair Expert&lt;/em&gt; is widely considered one of the world’s most popular shows, and &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/stories/more/the-highest-earning-podcasters/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; estimated&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 that it had a monthly audience of 20 million people, putting Shepard near the top of its list of highest-earning podcasts. Also on that list are Rogan and Bill Simmons, who sold &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21124201/bill-simmons-the-ringer-spotify-acquistion-podcast-purchase"&gt;his company The Ringer&lt;/a&gt; to Spotify in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtIflJ"&gt;Clearly, Spotify has centered its podcasting strategy on bringing the biggest names to its platform exclusively. That seems to be working, given that the company said last month that it grew its premium subscribers by 21 percent year over year and that people were listening to podcasts for longer periods of time. It also added that &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience&lt;/em&gt; performed “above expectations.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ME9Elq"&gt;A key component of Spotify’s podcasting moves is that it makes shows available to both free and paying users, and also includes ads for both of them. This means that Spotify makes ad money on every podcast listen. With &lt;em&gt;Armchair Expert&lt;/em&gt;, the company can bring more people to Spotify, offer another popular show exclusively, and sell more ads, all in a quest to become the dominant place people consume audio.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Humble Bundle offers a lot of great games to raise money for COVID-19 relief</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5bVHY483tT3fqQ4Z18SLRlW7CHU=/0x42:1000x709/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69275631/Nm5F6Y4w.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of what’s in the Humble Heal: COVID-19 Bundle.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Humble Bundle&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6313uZ"&gt;Humble Bundle is launching a new bundle to raise money for COVID-19 relief in India and Brazil, which have recently seen a surge in COVID-19 cases. The new &lt;a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/humble-heal-covid-19-bundle"&gt;Humble Heal: COVID-19 Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is jam-packed with a lot of great games, including the cult hit RPG &lt;em&gt;Undertale&lt;/em&gt;, mind-bending puzzler &lt;em&gt;Baba Is You&lt;/em&gt;, turn-based strategy games &lt;em&gt;Into the Breach &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Wargroove&lt;/em&gt;, as well as ebooks and software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQUhDZ"&gt;Humble Bundle says that all of the content in the bundle is worth more than $640, if everything was purchased on its own, but you can get everything in it for as little as $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EMeoDd"&gt;All of the proceeds from the bundle will go to charities including &lt;a href="https://www.directrelief.org/"&gt;Direct Relief&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org/"&gt;Doctors Without Borders (MSF)&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://internationalmedicalcorps.org/"&gt;International Medical Corps&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.giveindia.org/"&gt;GiveIndia&lt;/a&gt;, according to Humble Bundle. The bundle will be available from now through May 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="t0oFmi"&gt;This isn’t Humble Bundle’s first COVID-19 relief bundle — last March, Humble Bundle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/3/31/21201818/humble-bundle-coronavirus-games-ebooks-comics-charity"&gt;launched the Humble Conquer COVID-19 Bundle&lt;/a&gt; and raised more than $6.5 million. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus introduces the ZenFone 8 Flip and mini flagship ZenFone 8</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TbbKSZKNqtENZYByAL5R9R-AaEA=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69275349/ZenFone8_group_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The larger, pricier ZenFone 8 Flip includes a camera module that rotates forward for selfies.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SoD7xy"&gt;Asus is taking a slightly different turn with this year’s ZenFone series. While the ZenFone 8 Flip looks a lot like previous years’ phones, with its large screen and flip-out camera mechanism, the company went back to the drawing board for the flagship ZenFone 8 and redesigned it as a smaller one-hand-friendly device: kind of an Android iPhone mini. The two phones make their global debut today, priced at €599 for the ZenFone 8 and €799 for the ZenFone 8 Flip. Asus says that only the ZenFone 8 will come to North America; it is expected this summer. The US price is still being finalized, but the company says it will cost somewhere between $599 and $799.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDCtMW"&gt;The ZenFone 8 and 8 Flip both use a Snapdragon 888 chipset, but that’s about as far as the similarities go. The ZenFone 8 features a 5.9-inch 1080p OLED display with a fast 120Hz refresh rate. It will be sold in configurations of up to 16GB of RAM and 256GB of storage and includes an IP68 waterproof rating. Both the 8 and 8 Flip support 5G — but when the ZenFone 8 arrives in the US, it will only work on AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile’s LTE and sub-6GHz 5G networks.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1W36z258N7p_w5BcEdYsC-QArSE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22508007/Zenfone_8_group_shot_all_color_04.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZenFone 8 offers just two fixed rear-facing cameras.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OfKeES"&gt;The ZenFone 8’s two rear cameras are borrowed from the ZenFone 7 series: a 64-megapixel standard wide with OIS that kicks out 16-megapixel images and a 12-megapixel ultrawide. Since the camera array doesn’t flip forward to play the role of a selfie camera, there’s now a 12-megapixel camera under an off-center hole punch on the front panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k1E3Ie"&gt;The phone’s compact size is reflected in its 4,000mAh battery, which is much smaller than previous years’ 5,000mAh cells. It supports 30W wired charging with the included charger, but it doesn’t offer wireless charging. There are dedicated dual stereo speakers and even a 3.5mm headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ZenFone 8 Flip’s rotating camera housing features a stronger, more durable motor this year.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VKeWzM"&gt;The ZenFone 8 Flip is, by necessity, a much larger device with a 6.67-inch screen — a 1080p OLED panel with a 90Hz refresh rate. It offers a bigger 5,000mAh battery with 30W wired charging, includes up to 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage, but it lacks an IP rating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7VZbZ"&gt;The main attraction, of course, is its flip-out camera array. The triple-camera hardware is borrowed from the ZenFone 7, including a 64-megapixel main camera, a 12-megapixel ultrawide, and an 8-megapixel telephoto with 3x optical zoom. Asus says the module itself has a stronger motor with better endurance; users can expect to get up to 300,000 “flips” out of it. A custom RhinoShield case will be sold separately in some markets with a sliding cover to protect the housing and a sensor that automatically activates the camera when the cover is opened.&lt;/p&gt;
