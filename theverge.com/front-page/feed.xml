    <title>Apple’s App Store made an estimated $64 billion in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KcvAtL"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/08/apples-app-store-had-gross-sales-around-64-billion-in-2020.html"&gt;According to CNBC’s analysis&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s App Store made $64 billion in revenue in 2020, which is a 28 percent increase from the estimated $50 billion it made in 2019. This represents a good amount of growth for the App Store since the estimated increase between 2018 and 2019 was only 3.1 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7gnEwX"&gt;It’s hard to tell the exact reason for the spike in growth, but it likely had something to do with the COVID-19 pandemic. I can say from personal experience that I bought quite a few more games in 2020 than I have in years past, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020-roundup/22206745/2020-home-exercise-tech-games-apps-vr-apple-watch-covid-quarantine-pandemic-shelter-in-place"&gt;as well as subscriptions to fitness&lt;/a&gt; and productivity apps to try to regain some control of my life during quarantine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QwJfxj"&gt;When Apple reports on its financials, it lumps the money it makes from the App Store in with its services revenue, &lt;a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/04/apple-to-release-financial-results-amid-global-crisis/"&gt;which is by far its fastest-growing category&lt;/a&gt;. The company takes a 30 percent cut of most of the money coming in to the App Store, which, while there are caveats and exceptions, represents billions of dollars of revenue. Apple typically guards its take carefully, despite recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch"&gt;pushback from developers like Hey.com&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know"&gt;legal challenges from Epic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pVKrKD"&gt;Its grip has recently loosened just a little, though, as Apple now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21572302/apple-app-store-small-business-program-commission-cut-15-percent-reduction"&gt;only takes a 15 percent cut from developers who make under $1 million a year&lt;/a&gt; from the App Store. That isn’t likely to have a huge change on the revenue estimates, as analysts have approximated that &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/technology/apple-app-store-fee.html"&gt;the top 2 percent of App Store developers generate 95 percent of the revenue&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lu63PU"&gt;Every year, Apple reports how much money it has paid out to developers since 2008. CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;used that to calculate the App Store revenue number by subtracting last year’s number from this year’s, then it accounts for Apple’s 30 percent cut. While the numbers may be a little rough, Apple doesn’t self-report them, so all we can do is get close. Regardless, there are two things that are hard to argue: the App Store’s revenue grew by quite a bit this year, and it brought in a lot of money for both developers and for Apple. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The ultra-cheap Samsung A02S is coming to the US, documentation suggests</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy A02S" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dWoXAvJrXTqyIE1xuiPs06Ji8Jk=/83x99:1358x949/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68639733/pk_feature_power_that_keeps_you_going_358694490.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The A02S offers a 6.5-inch display and 5,000mAh battery.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cKNNc4"&gt;Unlocked and carrier versions of the budget Samsung Galaxy A02S appear to be coming to the US, &lt;a href="https://www.sammobile.com/news/unlocked-carrier-bound-galaxy-a02s-variants-headed-for-usa/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;SamMobile&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth certification documents appear to refer to unlocked as well as Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T carrier versions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1FzMy1"&gt;The A02S was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21628573/samsung-a12-a02s-phones-budget-price-specs-2021"&gt;announced in November&lt;/a&gt; for European markets alongside the slightly higher-specced Galaxy A12. The A02S includes a 6.5-inch HD+ display and an impressive 5,000mAh battery, but it cuts costs by opting for 3GB of RAM and 32GB of (expandable) storage in the base model and a 13-megapixel main camera. It also lacks a fingerprint sensor. These sacrifices land it at an affordable €150 price point, and it will likely sell for less than $200 outright in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6KeYPn"&gt;There’s no official word from Samsung yet on North American availability. In Europe, the A02S is set to go on sale in February.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alphabet Workers Union calls on YouTube to ban Trump</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bXalVL6aHmHfhYcEEzEy58FnABc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68639338/acastro_181130_1777_google_bias_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bfpdLh"&gt;The Alphabet Workers Union (AWU) is calling on YouTube to permanently ban President Trump following a raid on the US Capitol on January 6th. The move shows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212347/google-employees-contractors-announce-union-cwa-alphabet"&gt;the newly formed organization&lt;/a&gt;, comprised of employees and contractors at Google’s parent company, is dead set on influencing issues that go well beyond workers’ rights.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ez0dPR"&gt;On Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217743/trump-capitol-attack-youtube-video-removed-twitter-facebook-moderation"&gt;YouTube removed a video of Trump addressing the attack&lt;/a&gt;, citing its policy against content that alleges widespread voter fraud. But the union called the response “lackluster” and said the company hasn’t gone far enough. “YouTube refuses to hold Donald Trump accountable to the platform’s own rules by choosing only to remove one video instead of removing him from the platform entirely,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlphabetWorkers/status/1347331587315171330/photo/1"&gt;they wrote in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. The platform “will continue to function as a vector for the growth of the fascist movements if it persists in prioritizing advertisers while exposing the public,” they added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FABOqg"&gt;Workers also called out YouTube’s role in allowing white nationalist movements to grow. “YouTube must no longer be a tool of fascist recruitment and oppression,” they said. “Anything less is to countenance deadly violence: from Gamergate to Charlottesville, from Christchurch to Washington D.C., from Jair Bolsonaro to Donald Trump. Alphabet, in failing to act, has done tremendous damage: to the thousands of victims of hate and to the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9WRdkO"&gt;Alex Hanna, a research scientist at Google and AWU member, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge:&lt;/em&gt; “It’s incredibly significant that our union has spoken out on YouTube’s complicity in perpetuating white supremacist content, misinformation, and hate speech on the platform ... As workers, we’re in a unique position to speak out against this behavior and push Alphabet towards being responsible for the social effects of its technology when it goes against its profit incentives.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TFfE3E"&gt;Other platforms have already taken concrete steps to stop Trump from continuing to spread falsehoods and incite violence. On January 7th, Facebook CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg announced in a blog post that Trump would be banned from both Facebook and Instagram indefinitely&lt;/a&gt;, for at least the next two weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zc48lN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;Twitter took a slightly weaker stance, locking Trump’s account for 12 hours&lt;/a&gt;. The company said it would permanently suspend the president if he continued to violate its policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmfS3k"&gt;Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="htiuo9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8xpSl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BaETNn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch will change the face of PogChamp every 24 hours</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ry0-W94a74Pwj9OGehmYFW_rSQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68639227/acastro_200901_1777_twitch_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jDqsXV"&gt;Twitch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22218088/twitch-bans-pogchamp-poggers-capitol-trump-violence-gootecks"&gt;removed its popular PogChamp emote a couple of days ago&lt;/a&gt; after the person on which it was based — Ryan “Gootecks” Gutierrez — posted some tweets encouraging more mob violence after the riot at the Capitol. The spirit of PogChamp, however, will live on: today, Twitch announced that it would cycle through different versions of the emote every 24 hours, starting today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="f0e6hg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You know what? In the spirit of figuring out 2021 together, let’s just roll with it for now! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Get ready for a new PogChamp every 24 hours, starting today. &lt;a href="https://t.co/R16EyASsFx"&gt;https://t.co/R16EyASsFx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch (@Twitch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1347589555197595650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HAA12O"&gt;The reason PogChamp was popular was because it was the site’s global hype emote: when anything cool happened on Twitch, you could be sure to see people pogging in the chat. As the writer (and, full disclosure, my friend) Ryan Broderick put it in his excellent newsletter Garbage Day, &lt;a href="https://www.garbageday.email/p/the-sun-is-going-down-and-youre-getting"&gt;Twitch removing the PogChamp emote was probably in service of taking the site truly mainstream&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPsIpa"&gt;“The other big part of this is that Twitch’s long-term goal as a company seems to be fully divorcing themselves from the reputation as an ESPN for gamers,” Broderick writes. “So the PogChamp debacle is basically perfect for Twitch — a small change that signals they’re no longer aligned with Gutierrez and everything within the specific toxic strain of the pro-gaming community he represents.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbQYGd"&gt;Twitch’s push toward truly mainstream relevance didn’t start in 2020, and a year spent mostly inside helped move the site there. Perhaps the biggest win — and the strongest signal — that Twitch was beginning to achieve those goals was Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s (D-NY) stream with some of Twitch’s biggest stars, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21526164/aoc-among-us-twitch-debut-top-concurrent-viewers"&gt;which was one of the largest individual streams the site has ever seen&lt;/a&gt;. The idea that there was a difference between Twitch influence and mainstream influence evaporated at the very moment AOC’s stream went dark. (Since then, internet-savvy congresswoman Ilhan Omar (D-MN) &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/21/926329321/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-and-ilhan-omar-play-on-twitch-to-engage-young-voters"&gt;has also streamed &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; with a cast of all-star broadcasters.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zIJZiD"&gt;A Twitch spokesperson told me in an email that the company wanted to update the emote given what happened this week, and that Sean “Day9” Plott had a great idea. The spokesperson did not say how long the experiment would last, but says that the company is  looking to the Twitch community to see their response. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8RO6J"&gt;In other words: PogChamp is dead. Long live PogChamp. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlD75Q"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DwDJqF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update Jan 8th, 2:37pm ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Article updated with information from Twitch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Reddit bans r/donaldtrump forum for inciting violence</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Washington D.C. Tense After U.S. Capitol Is Stormed By Protestors On Wednesday" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2LM5FyYtYcSA7-WZLXNnA2nVkoE=/0x26:4798x3225/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68639176/1295288482.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by John Moore/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9ULnd5"&gt;Reddit has banned r/donaldtrump for encouraging and glorifying violence after Wednesday’s mob attack on the US Capitol. &lt;em&gt;Axios&lt;/em&gt; reporter Sara Fischer first &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sarafischer/status/1347592263275311108"&gt;reported the news&lt;/a&gt;, noting that the unofficial pro-Trump forum had been given multiple warnings. A Reddit splash page says the subreddit was “banned due to a violation of Reddit’s rules against inciting violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AjKZuy"&gt;“Reddit’s site-wide policies prohibit content that promotes hate, or encourages, glorifies, incites, or calls for violence against groups of people or individuals. In accordance with this, we have been proactively reaching out to moderators to remind them of our policies and to offer support or resources as needed,” a Reddit spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We have also taken action to ban the community r/donaldtrump given repeated policy violations in recent days regarding the violence at the US Capitol.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IncYw"&gt;The r/donaldtrump forum had approximately 52,000 members before its ban, according to an &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210106185207/https://www.reddit.com/r/donaldtrump/"&gt;Internet Archive snapshot&lt;/a&gt;. That was significantly smaller than r/The_Donald, a notorious Trump subreddit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/29/21304947/reddit-ban-subreddits-the-donald-chapo-trap-house-new-content-policy-rules"&gt;banned last year&lt;/a&gt; for pervasive rule-breaking — after many members had &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/months-before-reddit-purge-the-donald-users-created-a-new-home-a732f79e4f04"&gt;already moved&lt;/a&gt; to an independent site. However, &lt;a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2020/10/the_donald_reddit_discord/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mother Jones&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that former r/The_Donald members had used r/donaldtrump as a conduit back into Reddit, promoting posts through backchannels like a Discord server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="08pVKR"&gt;This deletion marks the latest in an internet-wide crackdown on President Donald Trump and his most aggressive supporters, even as online researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22219416/capitol-raid-identify-faces-online-footage-charges-law-enforcement-doxxing"&gt;used social media footage to identify mob members&lt;/a&gt;. Trump was suspended from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22219144/twitch-trump-ban-indefinitely-capitol-attack"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; after making inflammatory statements, although he’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218794/trump-twitter-ban-lifted-unbanned-realdonaldtrump"&gt;been reinstated&lt;/a&gt; on the latter. Major web platforms have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217421/capitol-building-trump-mob-protest-live-stream-youtube-twitch-facebook"&gt;removed content&lt;/a&gt; that glorified the attack — which was aimed at overturning the US presidential election and left at least five people dead, including a police officer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Successor to HMD’s Nokia 6.2 leaks with side-mounted fingerprint sensor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/afb8Zcj6DtxEHhoztues6VpTWFo=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68639112/d3288e72a4fef4453a86cd253218179b1b80e192eb9c16d05a402079e57cb971.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new phone has an extra rear camera compared to its predecessor.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@onleaks/exclusive-first-look-at-the-new-and-affordable-nokia-63-64—1610066614-289532428" target="_blank"&gt;Steve Hemmerstoffer / Voice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="abYfuu"&gt;Renders of what’s believed to be the Nokia 6.3 or 6.4 have leaked online, giving us our best look yet at HMD Global’s upcoming affordable handset. The renders come to us via Steve Hemmerstoffer &lt;a href="https://www.voice.com/post/@onleaks/exclusive-first-look-at-the-new-and-affordable-nokia-63-64--1610066614-289532428"&gt;over on Voice&lt;/a&gt;. New for this model is a side-mounted fingerprint sensor embedded in the power button, which replaces the rear-mounted sensor on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/5/20850871/nokia-6-2-7-2-phones-revamp-hmd-midrange-lineup-camera-features-specs-ifa-2019"&gt;2019’s Nokia 6.2&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zENob4"&gt;Beyond this, there’s not a lot separating the Nokia 6.3 / 6.4 from the 6.2, which &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XW1G6NB?tag=gsmarena093-20&amp;amp;linkCode=osi&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;psc=1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently retails for $249 on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. It’s still got a screen with a small teardrop-shaped notch, a headphone jack, and a circular camera array on its rear. However, Hemmerstoffer reports that the screen could be bigger at 6.45 inches rather than 6.3 inches, and it has four cameras on its rear, up from three last time. &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/nokia_6_3_6_4_renders-news-47095.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; the fourth sensor is likely to be for macro shots.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Otherwise, it’s a very similar phone to its predecessor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2ldJ8S"&gt;There isn’t any indication of how much the phone is likely to cost as part of this latest leak, but &lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt; reports that it was previously rumored to be priced at €249 (around $306). Hemmerstoffer notes that we should see an announcement before April.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter suspends Sci-Hub account amid Indian court case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the Sci-Hub site, with its logo of a raven holding a red key, and a search bar for finding articles. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4X8APx8PFPTXQ0DE-X91U-mIMj4=/0x0:972x648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68638986/scihub_home_page.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sci-Hub’s homepage.  | Sci-Hub&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LFjp1I"&gt;Twitter has suspended the account of Sci-Hub, a website that provides free access to paywalled academic papers. The account was being used by Sci-Hub’s founder to collect statements of support from the scientific community during an ongoing court case in India.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="76nWlY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Twitter suspends the account of Sci-Hub &lt;a href="https://t.co/XQfNYmR1Ra"&gt;pic.twitter.com/XQfNYmR1Ra&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Catalin Cimpanu (@campuscodi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/campuscodi/status/1347551800338112513?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NhIM5k"&gt;Journal articles are often costly to access, and many researchers and writers use services like Sci-Hub to bypass those costs. Publishers are unhappy about their content being distributed for free and argue that the site infringes on their copyright.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D0LzVH"&gt;In December, academic publishers Elsevier, Wiley, and the American Chemical Society filed a suit with the Delhi High Court, asking Indian internet service providers to block Sci-Hub and similar site Libgen. The court rejected the publishers’ requests that the sites be blocked immediately, instead declaring it &lt;a href="https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sci-hub-libgen-case-delhi-hc-to-hear-students-researchers/story-PxBftjgAPFPfuXGok4qG7N.html"&gt;an “issue of public importance”&lt;/a&gt; and allowing time for the scientific community to weigh in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="li1FzC"&gt;Sci-Hub founder Alexandra Elbakyan had been using Twitter to gather and archive &lt;a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/twitter.tweets.pdf"&gt;responses from Indian researchers&lt;/a&gt;, who argue that Sci-Hub is critical to their work. It’s unclear if the suspension is directly related to the court case, but “it happened right after Indian scientists revolted against Elsevier and other academic publishers after Sci-Hub posted on Twitter about the danger of being blocked,” Elbakyan &lt;a href="https://torrentfreak.com/sci-hub-founder-criticises-sudden-twitter-ban-over-over-counterfeit-content-210108"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;TorrentFreak&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qZXtzW"&gt;Publishers have tried to pursue legal action against Elbakyan several times before, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/8/16985666/alexandra-elbakyan-sci-hub-open-access-science-papers-lawsuit"&gt;but Sci-Hub has prevailed&lt;/a&gt;. As the “Pirate Bay of Science,” the site frequently switches domains to combat takedowns. &lt;/p&gt;

The SpongeBob Reef-Top, which will only be available in Madden’s arcade-style The Yard mode, will offer challenges that you can complete to unlock Nickelodeon-themed content as well as gear inspired by the famous yellow sponge himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qIZIiU"&gt;In “the coming weeks,” you’ll also be able to unlock gear themed after Patrick Star, Sandy Cheeks, Mr. Krabs, Plankton, and Squidward Tentacles. (TIL that Squidward’s canon last name is Tentacles.) &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and Google face pressure to deplatform Parler over calls to violence</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="This illustration picture shows the social media website from Parler displayed on a computer screen. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XO_GO-OWfrvK8Qozat1kLO5T484=/0x15:4000x2682/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68638888/1225872887.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by OLIVIER DOULIERY/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WDGyqC"&gt;Apple and Google are facing new pressure to deplatform Parler, a social network founded as a less moderated and more conservative-friendly alternative to Facebook and Twitter. Activist group Sleeping Giants has called on both companies to ban Parler from their app stores in response to posts calling for violence against elected officials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DBxgR6"&gt;As evidence, the group posted screenshots of Parler posts calling for Vice President Mike Pence to face a firing squad and encouraging “American Patriots” to return to the capital on January 19th “carrying Our weapons.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NSgQ3X"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yesterday, we asked &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AppStore?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@AppStore&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GooglePlay?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GooglePlay&lt;/a&gt; to enforce their own Terms of Service on Parler based on the sheer number of violent threats on the platform with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PullParler?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PullParler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Look at the VERY CLEAR terms set by these two app stores below: &lt;a href="https://t.co/SpPuSCUxy4"&gt;https://t.co/SpPuSCUxy4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sleeping Giants (@slpng_giants) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/slpng_giants/status/1347522919992336387?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fiVyHk"&gt;The group points out that both Google and Apple have clear rules against violent threats and moderation of content. Apple’s App Store says apps must have “a method for filtering objectionable material from being posted” and “a mechanism to report offensive content.” Google’s Play Store bars apps that “depict or facilitate gratuitous violence or other dangerous activities,” and that “we don’t allow apps that contain or facilitate threats, harassment, or bullying.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfmlvL"&gt;Neither Apple nor Google replied to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Parler also did not reply to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNiOPG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21557219/parler-conservative-app-download-new-users-moderation-bias"&gt;Parler saw its numbers skyrocket&lt;/a&gt; after Twitter and Facebook tightened their moderation, with conservative protesters finding a home among like-minded users. In a &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/07/opinion/sway-kara-swisher-john-matze.html?"&gt;Thursday interview with Kara Swisher&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;em&gt;Sway&lt;/em&gt; podcast, Parler CEO John Matze said any posts on the site indicating Wednesday’s riots were “illegally organized and against the law” would have been removed. “But I don’t feel responsible for any of this and neither should the platform, considering we’re a neutral town square that just adheres to the law,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZpnbBG"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552752/facebook-stopthesteal-ban-twitter-parler-discord-trump"&gt;“Stop the Steal” campaign&lt;/a&gt; challenging President Trump’s loss gained particular momentum among Parler users, as well as other conspiracy theories around the election that had been debunked elsewhere. In the wake of the Capitol raid, researchers have circulated &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cbluedreams/status/1347405890505252864?"&gt;dozens of posts on Parler that encouraged violence&lt;/a&gt; leading up to the attack on the Capitol. “Chloroform. Silencers. SHARP knives &amp;amp; keep walking,” reads one, “take zip ties with you, sneak up on them like ninjas and zip tie their hands and feet,” reads another, to which someone replied: “around their neck, can’t get it off in time, they die.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YyhCUf"&gt;On Thursday evening, the site had posts from Trump supporters &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ddale8/status/1347570822437863424"&gt;questioning whether his concession speech&lt;/a&gt; was a deepfake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmpzSI"&gt;There is some precedent for removing an app for hosting violent content. After a gunman killed eleven people in a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/27/18032930/paypal-banned-gab-following-pittsburgh-shooting"&gt;PayPal banned the social network Gab&lt;/a&gt; from its platform, when it was revealed that suspect Robert Bowers had posted anti-Semitic rants on Gab ahead of the shooting. &lt;a href="https://www.inc.com/salvador-rodriguez/gab-apple-inauguration.html"&gt;Apple had rejected&lt;/a&gt; Gab’s application to appear in its App Store in 2016, and Twitter removed Gab’s access to its API. Google removed the app from the Google Play store in 2017 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/18/16166240/gab-google-play-removed-hate-speech"&gt;for violating its hate speech policy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VayTgj"&gt;Since Apple and Google control the biggest smartphone operating systems, the companies wield immense power over mobile app distribution. The inability to push its app on the two biggest app stores greatly reduced Gab’s reach, forcing users to find &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20691957/mastodon-decentralized-social-network-gab-migration-fediverse-app-blocking"&gt;workarounds to use it&lt;/a&gt; on mobile sites. Gab’s desktop site, however, appears alive and well, with a new post from President Trump extolling the “great American Patriots who voted for me” leading the site’s “hot” posts on Friday morning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcmjee"&gt;Both Twitter and Facebook have implemented temporary bans on President Trump’s accounts, treating recent statements as likely to provoke violence. The platforms had previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552763/election-2020-tech-social-platforms-facebook-twitter-youtube-misinformation"&gt;adopted strict policies against election and voting misinformation&lt;/a&gt; during the campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d2N9IJ"&gt;In a post on Parler Thursday, &lt;a href="https://parler.com/post/23a2c1d63ea94c74b04d03917ad03339"&gt;Matze criticized Facebook and Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for their actions against the president’s posts. “It’s clear that Facebook and Twitter believe the ends justify the means. They believe the American people are weak. They insult our founding fathers by suggesting Zuckerburg [sic] and Dorsey know what is best for us,” he wrote. “Parler is not an arbiter of truth. We believe in you. We believe you are wise enough to decide for yourself and trust that given access to all information we can self govern.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Substack is adding theming options to change the look of newsletters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Substack theming options" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gfC8i_K7IStiupGuCA3AAbZTZik=/108x0:1038x620/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68638876/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_5.16.25_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Substack&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R7oxsZ"&gt;Substack is adding a long-awaited new feature today: the ability to change the look of newsletters. Writers will now be able to choose their background color and accent color and set different fonts for the title and body of posts. It’s a limited set of customizations, but it should allow Substack newsletters to stand out more from one another — right now, they’re basically the same, save for profile pictures and the color of links.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vfogyf"&gt;The feature is being called Themes, and Substack says it plans to continually add more options for writers. It’s supposed to be available starting today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Substack’s theme editor" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zSsG3CwFRqsBFtVcP_8oBY12jJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22220841/Screen_Shot_2021_01_05_at_4.57.44_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Substack&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ejPgAz"&gt;As fun as themes are, writers may get a lot more use out of two other features that Substack is planning for release sometime “soon.” Writers will be able to create sub-lists of members and only send out certain emails to them (Substack imagines lists of “founding members” or “lapsed readers”). It’s also adding a “multipub” tool that will allow writers to aggregate multiple newsletters and podcasts they manage under a single publication. &lt;em&gt;The Dispatch&lt;/em&gt; already has this tool and uses it to &lt;a href="https://thedispatch.com/"&gt;bundle a dozen titles&lt;/a&gt;, but soon it’ll be available to everyone. Substack expects the new options to launch in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmFYpt"&gt;The features were announced this morning during &lt;a href="https://substack.com/on"&gt;Substack On&lt;/a&gt;, a one-day virtual conference for Substack writers. Substack was founded in 2017, and over the past year, has become an increasingly popular choice for journalists who want to run subscription publications. It’s managed to attract some high-profile names, including Anne Helen Petersen, Glenn Greenwald, and Matthew Yglesias.&lt;/p&gt;
