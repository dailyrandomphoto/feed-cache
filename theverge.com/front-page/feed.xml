    <title>The Oculus Rift S is $100 off at several retailers</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="howhVF"&gt;Oculus has knocked $100 off the cost of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/30/18523941/oculus-rift-s-review-vr-headset-price-specs-features"&gt;Rift S&lt;/a&gt; tethered virtual reality headset, which brings the price down to $299. This makes it the same price as the Oculus Quest 2 standalone headset that doesn’t require connecting to a PC to play games and experiences — yet the Rift S doesn’t require a Facebook account to use it. Oculus announced earlier this year that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21422717/facebook-oculus-rift-s-discontinued-quest-2-vr-connect"&gt;it discontinued the Rift S&lt;/a&gt;, so this discount could be its way of clearing out stock. You can get this price at several retailers, including on &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Frift-s%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Oculus&lt;/a&gt;’ site, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Faccessories-and-monitors%2Fconsumer-electronics%2Far-vr%2FOculus-Rift-S-3D-virtual-reality-system%2Fp%2F78011328&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2020%2F12%2F11%2F22169460%2Foculus-rift-s-vr-headset-sale-discount-deal-amazon-walmart#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Lenovo&lt;/a&gt; (the headset’s manufacturer), as well as &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FOculus-Rift-S-PC-Powered-VR-Gaming-Headset%2F231668381&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTMKYS7/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=965268772192b4a0e42821b659089186&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MkWsvk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10221560"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ajWui8"&gt;If you’re considering your options, this price cut makes the Rift S far more affordable than the Valve Index, which currently takes weeks to deliver after placing an order. The Quest 2 has been a popular holiday gift item, resulting in it selling out at most stores. So if you don’t mind being tethered to your modest gaming PC with the Rift S, this might be your best option to get a solid VR headset in time for the holidays. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Happy Friday, have some pictures of squirrels posing like superheroes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jZQp9NEcObYWwL4gF7KKEn65pic=/0x1:960x641/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68496219/y42ymyu7qqa31.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mdjLnD"&gt;We interrupt your anticipation of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167976/disney-investor-day-2020-biggest-announcements-plus-marvel-star-wars-pixar-animation"&gt;new Marvel content&lt;/a&gt; to bring you news that if you photograph a squirrel juuuuust right, you can make it look like the woodland creature has just pulled off one hell of a superhero landing. People have known about the phenomenon for a little while (the first reference we could find online appears to be &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/photoshopbattles/comments/ce3znb/psbattle_squirrel_superhero_landing/"&gt;this Reddit post&lt;/a&gt; from July 2019), but frankly, we don’t think it’s had the attention it deserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FLBjQ6"&gt;
    &lt;blockquote class="reddit-card" data-card-created='"2020-12-11T12:48:59.621069+00:00"'&gt;
      &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/d2r2ot/squirrels_doing_superhero_landings_is_my_spirit/?ref_source=embed&amp;amp;ref=share"&gt;Squirrels doing superhero landings is my spirit animal&lt;/a&gt; from

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
    &lt;script async="" src="https://embed.redditmedia.com/widgets/platform.js" charset="UTF-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MRJ6pg"&gt;Thankfully, considering &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EwUilIo036g"&gt;how hard superhero landings are on your knees&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn’t sound like squirrels actually pose like this after jumping out of a tree. Instead, as several Redditors have pointed out, they seem to assume this position when they want to scratch their stomach with a back leg. The single arm up in the air gives them space to itch. You can see what it looks like in motion &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNIu3MRPuSk"&gt;in this YouTube clip&lt;/a&gt; or via the GIF below. (Note the subtle bicep kiss.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Medal of Honor’s first VR spinoff falls apart when the shooting stops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="medal of honor above and beyond" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qszPDqbneILWZDfOEfHZtnR9vV0=/0x0:1440x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68496138/moh6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;EA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RNBk3b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond, &lt;/em&gt;the new VR-only title from Respawn Entertainment, can’t get by on authenticity alone. It has the weaponry and set dressing players have come to expect from a first-person shooter set during WWII. But for a console shooter making the jump to VR, it’s sorely lacking in intimacy — a necessary ingredient for any virtual reality experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M29zOZ"&gt;The environments you’ll visit in the campaign range in size from an attic to the sprawling beaches of Normandy, France, but they rarely feel like real places. Outside of your main objective, there isn’t much else to get distracted by, which is often what I find to be the most fun thing about exploring worlds in VR. I want to turn dials on old radios to listen to music of the time, open drawers, throw folders, and just generally make a mess of everything. Even the most polished detailed locales feel somewhat lifeless to walk around in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6el85U"&gt;That lack of depth extends to the game’s story and characters. When you aren’t shooting your way through the campaign’s six missions, you’ll be stuck listening to cliched banter. These sections that sandwich the action mostly drag on the momentum. There are more warranted breaks in the action along the way to make room for “Hey, we’re in VR” moments. This could involve having a weapon tossed at you to catch, solving a very simple puzzle, or pushing a button or turning a crank that, for no reason at all, only you are specifically qualified to do. I’ll take these over just standing still, but they feel forced.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="medal of honor above and beyond" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mnx7v7ev4kiWakTDAOqQVG9scVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22155467/moh4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: EA&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="crbTXP"&gt;Really, the only things you’ll become intimate with are your weapons. Unsurprisingly, given the studio’s pedigree for making games like &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Titanfall&lt;/em&gt;, this game is at its best when your objective is to simply gun down all of the enemies. The game’s frenetic shooting requires you to become adept at reloading and aiming down sights. Occasionally, the plot will cut you loose to battle in some of the largest VR environments I’ve played in yet, and that’s when all of the game’s movement and shooting mechanics feel like they’re at their best. The enemy AI demands a more aggressive playstyle than I’ve experienced in VR, resulting in some tense action sequences. For instance, enemies will often attempt to kick live grenades back at you if there’s enough time left on the fuse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6lkL82"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hte4Y_BnkpY?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kPwNuR"&gt;Some aspects of the gameplay need some refinement, though. For instance, it’s too hard to accurately throw a grenade right where you want it to land. I can understand there being a learning curve, but it feels like something is off with the tracking. Another problem area is scoped weapons, which are all but necessary to use at times in the story. Using one blacks out everything on the display except for what’s in sight through the scope. That was borderline nauseating, as was moving the reticle on turrets in planes and tanks with my head instead of being delegated to my hands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N8Yv46"&gt;The lack of movement options may be a usability issue for some. Teleporting to move around the map isn’t an option at launch, which is something I personally relied on in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21188291/half-life-alyx-review-valve-index-oculus-quest-vr-shooter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. You’ll instead move by tilting the left analog stick as you would in a console first-person shooter, which might trigger nausea with some people in VR. If you want to use the right analog stick to turn the camera instead of physically turning your body, that can only be done with snap turning, which moves the camera in a stilted way with each adjustment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61Mxoc"&gt;The campaign features six missions, that are broken up into about 12 smaller sections. Additionally, there’s a single-player horde mode along with several multiplayer modes, though I didn’t get a chance to play those during the review period. This game doesn’t warrant a second playthrough unless you’re someone who loves scouting out collectible items. It feels like it’s meant to be played as an on-rails shooter, moving quickly from one point to the next, like an unintended homage to the PS1-era &lt;em&gt;Medal of Honor&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a far cry compared to other VR experiences that offer far richer interactivity with a myriad of objects — pointless as it might seem — to ground you in the game’s world, which is what games like &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt; do so well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="medal of honor above and beyond" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P52UtvvaMHrW6DodG5jM0hNIvKQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22155469/moh6.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: EA&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0x05yX"&gt;There are some technical hurdles to even play &lt;em&gt;Above and Beyond&lt;/em&gt;. At launch, it requires a wired Oculus headset, like the Rift or Rift S, to play. The game is also available on &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1402320/Medal_of_Honor_Above_and_Beyond/"&gt;Steam&lt;/a&gt;, so any SteamVR-ready headset like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/28/19102584/valve-index-steamvr-headset-review-shipping-today"&gt;Valve Index&lt;/a&gt; or HTC Vive will work, too. Additionally, Respawn recommends a PC with an Intel Core i7-9700K processor (or comparable AMD model), 16GB of DDR4 RAM, an Nvidia RTX 2080 or higher, and a fast NVMe SSD. But regardless of what kind of storage you have, you’ll need to reserve a staggering 180GB to unpack the game’s files on it, which results in a slightly smaller, but still huge 173GB install size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9ED5m"&gt;I ran the game without a hitch on the “high” resolution setting on my PC, which contains an Intel Core i5 9600K processor, 16GB of RAM, Nvidia’s RTX 2070, and a SATA-based SSD. For PCs that aren’t as powerful as mine or the one Respawn suggests you have, you can switch on dynamic resolution to let the game adjust settings on the fly to stay smooth. It even ran fine wirelessly via &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455665/facebook-oculus-vr-indie-developers-power-monopoly-concerns"&gt;Virtual Desktop&lt;/a&gt; with my &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2&lt;/a&gt;, but your results will vary depending on your PC’s power and the quality of your internet connection and router. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYCmjG"&gt;Even with all the necessary specs, I wouldn’t call this game a stunner, visually speaking. The main character models are expressive, if cartoony in appearance, though most enemies and secondary characters could pass as something just above low-poly extras in a modern open-world game. Some of the smaller rooms are particularly impressive, though the graphical fidelity and attention to detail expectedly take a hit as the maps grow in size.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="medal of honor above and beyond" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y0swO9eqXE1lyuxWY1t0moP4Kz4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22155471/moh5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: EA&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HFlN5l"&gt;1999’s &lt;em&gt;Medal of Honor&lt;/em&gt; was the game that helped make wartime first-person shooters popular, though the franchise struggled to distinguish itself from &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; since it launched in 2003. With this VR game’s title, Respawn and EA seem to be bragging that &lt;em&gt;Medal of Hono&lt;/em&gt;r has finally gone where no &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; game has gone before — “above and beyond” it, in fact. Despite moving into new territory, &lt;em&gt;Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond&lt;/em&gt; feels like it’s traveling a well-worn path but doesn’t provide enough reasons to make it worth buying a headset. Even with all of the necessary equipment, this game doesn’t rise to being a must-play experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E0R8HV"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Medal of Honor: Above and Beyond releases on Friday, December 11th, on the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fexperiences%2Frift%2F3002462869834439%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22163762%2Fmedal-of-honor-above-and-beyond-virtual-reality-vr-review-steam-oculus#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oculus store&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1402320/Medal_of_Honor_Above_and_Beyond/"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; for $59.99.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Doom Eternal is another impressive Switch port</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hyqijqxSmR24WIDGk4ccyFPrBws=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68496115/doom_eternal_switch_screenshot01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cHhM2q"&gt;When the Switch version of the &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; reboot was released in the same year that Nintendo launched its hybrid console, it took quite a few people by surprise. Not only was it rare to see an ultraviolent first-person shooter on a Nintendo platform, but it was downright impressive to see such a technically advanced game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/9/16627782/doom-nintendo-switch-review"&gt;work on the mobile hardware in the first place&lt;/a&gt;. Sure, the resolution was a little blurry and it only ran at 30fps, but it was &lt;em&gt;Doom &lt;/em&gt;in your hands, which felt impossible at the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCsO87"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; was the first of several unexpectedly ambitious third-party Switch ports, a list that has grown to include the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/17/20919715/overwatch-switch-port-review-impressions-blizzard-nintendo-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21143520/nintendo-switch-steam-cross-save-witcher-3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. So this week’s release of its sequel, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186572/doom-eternal-review-xbox-ps4-pc-stadia-date-battlegrounds"&gt;the excellent &lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, doesn’t have quite the impact of the original &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; port. But in some ways, that’s to its credit: &lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt; feels like a completely viable Switch game now, rather than an improbable technical feat stretching the limits of the hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vAoN9b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Doom Eternal is gory, goofy, and metal as hell ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/19/21186572/doom-eternal-review-xbox-ps4-pc-stadia-date-battlegrounds"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Tdqcw2"&gt;I’ve played through the opening hours of &lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt; on the Switch, and it actually runs better than the original game did. It’s still locked to 30fps, of course, and it still makes use of much lower graphical settings and dynamic 720p resolution scaling to keep that frame rate locked in. But it generally stays sharper than the first &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; port, and the Switch has no problem keeping up with the fast-paced action, which is so hectic that it’s often difficult to pay attention to the resolution. Loading times are much improved, too, and you have the option to play with gyro aiming (which the original game also got in an update a few months after release). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L7kwJInAvFgT-1Mgc947lJRezF0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22162239/doom_eternal_switch_screenshot01.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D9o1Vv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt; is based on id Tech 7, the latest version of id Software’s in-house engine — which is to say that it’s a more technically advanced game than &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt;, so it’s great to see the Switch turning in a performance like this. A Switch version was planned from the start, unlike its predecessor, which may well have helped with optimization. The Switch version is also arriving pretty late after originally having been intended for release at around the same time as other platforms, so it seems like porting studio Panic Button made good use of the extra time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oNHJgt"&gt;The biggest noticeable cutback is in the cutscenes, which are quite a bit worse than on other platforms. They’re running in a letterboxed aspect ratio and at a lower framerate than the game itself, causing a jarring effect whenever control is taken away from you for a narrative sequence. It’s not a huge deal since it doesn’t affect the actual gameplay — and I didn’t like the cutscenes on PC in the first place — but it’s definitely a compromise. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EJ9E90-iErcdm3iaROgeEXIbJ7Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22162240/doom_eternal_switch_screenshot04.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VbcorK"&gt;A more powerful Switch console is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21400521/new-nintendo-switch-report-release-date-2021"&gt;rumored for release next year&lt;/a&gt;, and I do wonder what it could do for games like &lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt;. Since it uses dynamic resolution to maintain performance, theoretically, the game could look a lot better right away if it were running on a Switch with a faster GPU. For now, though, &lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt; on the current Switch is a perfectly reasonable way to play the game if it’s your only way to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lU3E5I"&gt;That brings me to the only other real problem I have with this version of &lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt;, which is that I don’t really have much reason to play it. It would be perfect on a long flight, but I obviously haven’t been spending much time on planes lately, and it’s hard to see me opting for the Switch version when I’m staying at home with other hardware available. &lt;em&gt;Doom Eternal&lt;/em&gt; is also selling at $59.99 on the Switch even though you can find it for cheaper on other platforms — or try it for nothing if you’re an Xbox Game Pass subscriber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHoFRV"&gt;But again, if the Switch is your only console or if your TV is constantly tied up, this is still a great option. While it doesn’t feel quite as miraculous as &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; did three years ago, it’s ultimately a better conversion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGSrEs"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Doom Eternal &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is out now for the Nintendo Switch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;.&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s old 29W chargers aren’t good enough for MagSafe Duo</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aKC8xJQE0JxirWITjx_iRneaXqY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68495649/dbohn_201109_4283_0009.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="px1WFU"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211925"&gt;Apple support page&lt;/a&gt; has confirmed that the company’s new MagSafe Duo wireless charger, which is designed to charge an iPhone and Apple Watch simultaneously, isn’t compatible with its older 29W USB-C power adapter. If you’re using an Apple power adapter it’s best to use one of the company’s newer 30W models, which &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2018/06/04/apple-29w-usb-c-power-adapter/"&gt;replaced the 29W model in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and retail for $49. It’s an unfortunate revelation for anyone with the old chargers since the MagSafe Duo doesn’t come with a charging brick in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rogl9"&gt;Apple’s page doesn’t say exactly what happens if you plug the MagSafe Duo into one of the older 29W bricks. &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/10/magsafe-duo-incompatible-with-apple-29w-charger/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that if you do it will only be able to charge a single device, an iPhone or an Apple Watch, rather than both at once. Although the 29W brick appears to meet the wattage requirements of the MagSafe Duo, it apparently doesn’t support the exact combination of volts and amps required.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3VkLm6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Working out MagSafe’s charging speeds is a little complicated&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WRBh1x"&gt;At this point, working out how fast each of Apple’s MagSafe accessories will charge your devices is a little bit complicated. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMHXH3AM%2FA%2Fmagsafe-charger&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F11%2F22169285%2Fapple-29w-usb-c-power-adapter-brick-magsafe-duo-incompatible#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;standard MagSafe charger&lt;/a&gt; charges iPhones at up to 15W, and Apple recommends pairing it with a $19 Apple 20W USB-C power adapter. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FMHXF3AM%2FA%2Fmagsafe-duo-charger&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F11%2F22169285%2Fapple-29w-usb-c-power-adapter-brick-magsafe-duo-incompatible#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MagSafe Duo charger&lt;/a&gt;, meanwhile, offers up to a slightly lower 14W of charging when paired with a 27W or higher brick, so long as that brick supports 9V/3A. You get 11W of charging by pairing it with a 20W power brick that supports 9V/2.22A, and Apple says you need “at least 15W (5V/3A or 9V/1.67A)” for the Duo to charge two devices simultaneously. If you’re charging an iPhone 12 mini, the maximum charge is capped at 12W with the Duo. Oh, and the maximum charge is also capped at 7.5W if you’re charging your phone with a Lightning accessory (like a pair of headphones) plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kteyRr"&gt;Plenty of devices have very specific requirements for the hardware you need to use to get the fastest charging speeds, so it’s hard to blame Apple too much here. But I think we can all agree that it could have made things much simpler for customers if it included a power brick in the box with its $129 wireless charger.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hyundai takes control of Boston Dynamics in $1.1B deal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TkahY_b9x3eNtletWS904OiN824=/0x55:1300x922/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68495498/MPM_0342.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;One of Boston Dynamics most famous robots is Spot, pictured.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Boston Dynamics&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fCYfFZ"&gt;Hyundai is officially purchasing a controlling stake in robot maker Boston Dynamics from SoftBank in a deal that values the company at $1.1 billion, the &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/hyundai-motor-group-to-acquire-controlling-interest-in-boston-dynamics-from-softbank-group-opening-a-new-chapter-in-the-robotics-and-mobility-industry-301191028.html"&gt;company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The deal has been in the works for a while, according to recent &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/softbank-is-said-to-be-in-talks-to-sell-robot-maker-to-hyundai"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and marks a major step into consumer robotics for Hyundai. Hyundai is taking approximately an 80 percent stake in the company while its previous owner, Softbank, will retain around 20 percent through an affiliate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ppjp6j"&gt;Hyundai says its investment will help its development of service and logistics robots, but that over time it hopes to build more humanoid robots for jobs like “caregiving for patients at hospitals.” Other areas of interest include autonomous driving and smart factories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GlwJwv"&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ehnkeBKpB2fLAAGR5BgilIkSME0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22162233/1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Boston Dynamics&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Atlas, another one Boston Dynamic’s robots.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JmmVzP"&gt;Boston Dynamics started as a spin-off from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The company has created robots using DARPA funding, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/1/4042708/bigdog-robot-sprouts-herculean-throwing-arm"&gt;BigDog&lt;/a&gt;, but is best known for the viral fame its robots have found online. Its two main stars have been Atlas, a humanoid bipedal robot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/16/16667376/boston-dynamics-atlas-backflip-video-watch"&gt;that can run and do backflips&lt;/a&gt;, and Spot, a smaller quadrupedal “dog” that’s been tested in a variety of scenarios, from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21267379/robot-dog-rocos-boston-dynamics-video-spot-shepherd-reaction"&gt;sheep herding&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231855/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-covid-19-coronavirus-telemedicine"&gt;assisting health care workers during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. The company started selling Spot in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292684/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-on-sale-price"&gt;June 2020 for $74,500&lt;/a&gt;, targeting businesses looking for an automated way to patrol and inspect warehouses. Despite the viral fame,  &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/boston-dynamics-needs-to-start-making-money-off-its-robots#lazy-img-366074900:~:text=It%E2%80%99s%20had%20bouts%20of%20profitability%20over,it%20did%20its%20previous%20owner%2C%20Google."&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt; that Boston Dynamics has not been profitable in recent years, which could change &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-17/boston-dynamics-needs-to-start-making-money-off-its-robots"&gt;under a new CEO and Hyundai’s guidance&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3Dn0p"&gt;It’s been a long journey from its start in 1992 to being valued at $1.1 billion. Boston Dynamics &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/14/5209622/google-has-bought-robotics-company-boston-dynamics"&gt;spent time under Google&lt;/a&gt;, primarily focused on research and development, and more recently had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/8/15766434/alphabet-google-boston-dynamics-softbank-sale-acquisition-robotics"&gt;a stint with SoftBank&lt;/a&gt;, a deal that former Boston Dynamics CEO Marc Raibert announced with the lofty “mission to push the boundaries of what advanced robots can do and to create useful applications in a smarter and more connected world.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4U4pFe"&gt;Hyundai’s own industrial robots have been focused on factories in its automotive comfort zone, including a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/9/18173742/hyundai-walking-car-concept-elevate-ces-2019"&gt;“car with legs” concept&lt;/a&gt; that the company imagined could be used by first responders to travel across difficult terrain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RR4QSJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction December 12th, 9:41AM ET :&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article originally stated that Boston Dynamics has never been profitable. This is incorrect. The company was profitable prior to its acquisition by Google through sales of software and research contracts.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 14 biggest trailers and announcements from The Game Awards 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fD_BvtTzGsHjKEDb4qIdS4y655Q=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68494816/TGA2020_PosterPack1_PosterB_HD.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9bT0yH"&gt;There weren’t any bombshells on the scale of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21016575/microsoft-xbox-series-x-next-xbox-console"&gt;last year’s Xbox Series X reveal&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22167464/geoff-keighley-game-awards-2020-covid-e3-cost"&gt;the 2020 edition of The Game Awards&lt;/a&gt; was still packed with news and trailers. There were game reveals like &lt;em&gt;Perfect Dark&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Open Roads&lt;/em&gt;, more characters for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros&lt;/em&gt;., and a lot more. If you missed the show, or just need a refresher, here are the biggest moments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WRQ41V"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166187/fortnite-master-chief-halo-the-walking-dead-the-game-awards"&gt;Master Chief comes to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p id="JKR7hM"&gt;As has been long-expected, Epic revealed that &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; star Master Chief is coming to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. He’s available today, and joining him later this season will be characters from &lt;em&gt;The Walking Dead&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="4R8D9M"&gt;The breakout social hit &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; is getting a bit bigger. At The Game Awards the development team revealed a brand-new map, which should give you even more ways to mess with your friends. It’s an airship, and it’s launching early 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="3dbAUL"&gt;A better look at &lt;em&gt;It Takes Two&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="BDPYvM"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ohClxMmNLQQ?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="9dj8sx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22166143/we-are-ofk-interactive-series-virtual-pop-group-the-game-awards"&gt;A new virtual pop group debuts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p id="bHqC3h"&gt;One of the night’s musical acts was also the announcement of a game. &lt;em&gt;We Are OFK&lt;/em&gt; is an interactive series slated to debut in spring 2021, covering the rise of an aspiring pop group called OFK, and fans got an early taste with a virtual performance at the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="6HH1GA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gone Home&lt;/em&gt; developer Fullbright is back with a new release, called &lt;em&gt;Open Roads&lt;/em&gt;, which is slated to launch next year. It tells the story of a mother and daughter on a road trip through a desolate landscape, and it stars both Keri Russell and Kaitlyn Dever.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fmVTa4"&gt;Another &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt; character is joining Cloud in battle: Nintendo made a surprise reveal that the game’s villain Sephiroth and his giant sword are coming to &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate.&lt;/em&gt; He may have even killed Mario.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aep1du"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Left 4 Dead&lt;/em&gt; has a spiritual successor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="YFtJ0S"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7RCgT-XOPr4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VKJX00"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Left 4 Dead&lt;/em&gt; studio Turtlerock previously revealed it was working on a similar zombie-themed co-op shooter, and the developer showed off just what it looks like in a new gameplay trailer. Really, it’s just what it sounds like: &lt;em&gt;Back 4 Blood&lt;/em&gt; features four players teaming up to fight off waves of the undead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="72XJCZ"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Dead Space&lt;/em&gt; also has a spiritual successor&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="ozsiPj"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WnVhgyLbC8A?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tAaKCB"&gt;Striking Distance Studios, a new team helmed by one of the creators behind the original Dead Space, announced its debut project: &lt;em&gt;The Callisto Protocol&lt;/em&gt;. As you’d imagine, it’s a horror-themed sci-fi game that looks plenty scary, though it’s not expected to launch until 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EUkRh2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168766/perfect-dark-microsoft-the-initiative-game-reveal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perfect Dark&lt;/em&gt; is back&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="66QvR5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S--lFTxAVs8?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DZbRkQ"&gt;We’ve been waiting to hear what new Xbox studio The Initiative is working on, and the studio finally revealed its debut game: a modern reboot of the classic &lt;em&gt;Perfect Dark&lt;/em&gt; series. No word on when it will be available, nor exactly which Microsoft platforms it will be playable on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7mrAuq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22167450/dragon-age-4-bioware-trailer-ea-game-awards-reveal"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dragon Age 4&lt;/em&gt; gets a(nother) tease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="GCtLTR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W7x685DxMcw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hoNjym"&gt;EA and BioWare just can’t stop teasing the next &lt;em&gt;Dragon Age&lt;/em&gt;, and at The Game Awards the showed the best look yet with a trailer that gives a good sense of the fantasy world. It’s still missing unimportant details like the release date, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4tJIuw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168973/mass-effect-returns-teaser-trailer-game-awards-2020"&gt;And a &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; tease&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="dlBAeY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Lg-Ctg6k_Ao?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uRadLI"&gt;If that wasn’t enough, BioWare also provided a very brief glimpse at the next Mass Effect. it doesn’t tell us much, but hey, at least we know the game is alive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8FsOwV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168860/vin-diesel-ark-2-trailer"&gt;Play as Vin Diesel, dinosaur hunter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bIBr2PNDsQXnOpCkEzjNwJCpsd4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22161667/Eo60we8XcAAVLzy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wm49zn"&gt;The latest trailer for survival game &lt;em&gt;Ark 2&lt;/em&gt; contained a nice surprise: Vin Diesel stars as the lead, so you can control him while taking on monsters and dinosaurs. He’ll even be in a new animated series set in the game’s fantastical world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="T1ooJS"&gt;A peaceful trip to the end of the world&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="RyCy4w"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZCMHnKpt4IM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YpyiqH"&gt;The gorgeous-looking Season has a premise that’s both peaceful and full of sorrow. It’s described as “a third-person atmospheric adventure game” where “you play as a young woman from a secluded village exploring the world by bike for the first time, collecting artifacts and memories before a cataclysm washes everything away.” No word on when it will be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nREd2c"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168892/microsoft-flight-simulator-xbox-release-date-announced"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt; is finally coming to console in 2021&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="t0oKIY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GdGB0cv6i8I?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TmTDab"&gt;One of this year’s biggest games, &lt;em&gt;Microsoft Flight Simulator&lt;/em&gt;, is coming to consoles next year. Microsoft officially revealed that the game will be on Xbox next summer — though it’ll only be on next-gen hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mass Effect returns with a mysterious new teaser</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B3IfCZ47oUXgs0rb9hCLBEU8py8=/211x0:2431x1480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68494811/Screen_Shot_2020_12_10_at_9.43.30_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TqqnFe"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; franchise isn’t done just yet, according to a strange new teaser at The Game Awards. In a short clip, a hooded figure uncovers a piece of equipment bearing the game’s N7 logo from the snow. The teaser closes with words “&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect&lt;/em&gt; will continue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7bsHV"&gt;On Twitter, BioWare said that the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/masseffect/status/1337227176131760128"&gt;next game&lt;/a&gt; is now in “early production.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hOHP8"&gt;Bioware’s beloved space series wrapped its original trilogy with &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect 3&lt;/em&gt; in 2012. Curiously, the teaser appears to feature Liara — or, at least someone bearing a strong resemblance to her — one of the game’s Asari shipmates and possible love interests. Asari live for hundreds of years, however, meaning any future games don’t necessarily have to take place during the Shepard era of the trilogy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CaqNNC"&gt;The last in the series,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/20/14961928/mass-effect-andromeda-review-xbox-ps4-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mass Effect: Andromeda &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;— a game featuring a new cast — was released in 2017 to mixed reviews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CogqE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The government just blocked another razor startup from getting acquired</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tKWQW3PRT35Zvql0v5mw3BZrclI=/0x86:592x481/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68494787/Screen_Shot_2017_11_14_at_14.42.19.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Billie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nRNCoD"&gt;The Federal Trade Commission announced it would &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/12/ftc-sues-block-procter-gambles-acquisition-billie-inc?utm_source=govdelivery"&gt;sue to block Proctor &amp;amp; Gamble’s purchase of razor and body care company Billie&lt;/a&gt; on December 8th, citing P&amp;amp;G’s existing dominance in the wet razor market. Billie &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/14/16648814/billie-womens-dollar-shave-club"&gt;originally launched in 2017&lt;/a&gt; but has grown since, likely prompting P&amp;amp;G’s interest and the FTC’s concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwWz4t"&gt;Like Dollar Shave Club (but aimed more at women), Billie tried to pitch its razors as a cheaper direct-to-customer alternative to the pricier razors sold at retail. It proved successful, &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2019/01/29/billie-shaving-25-million-series-a/"&gt;and investors were interested&lt;/a&gt;. But if P&amp;amp;G added Billie to its existing brands Gilette, Joy and Venus, it could have eliminated one of its fastest growing competitors, something the FTC feared would lead to consumers paying higher prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g0qIkM"&gt;This isn’t the first time the FTC has stopped a razor acquisition. In February 2020 it sued to block Edgewell Personal Care &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21120241/ftc-blocks-harrys-dollar-shave-unilever-schick-gillette-razors-edgewell"&gt;from buying Harry’s Razors&lt;/a&gt;, with similar concerns over consolidation. All this recent antitrust action makes the billion dollars &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/20/12234688/unilever-buys-dollar-shave-club-razor"&gt;Unilever spent on Dollar Shave Club&lt;/a&gt; odd in retrospect, because the FTC at the time had no issue with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lrXEok"&gt;The FTC can try to unwind a deal if it changes its mind, though. Yesterday, the FTC announced its plans alongside 47 state attorney generals to sue Facebook in an attempt to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22158483/facebook-antitrust-lawsuit-anti-competition-behavior-attorneys-general"&gt;unwind its purchase of both Instagram and WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook saw rapidly growing competitors in the social media and messaging spaces and chose to swallow them whole, before they could pose a real threat, like P&amp;amp;G might be trying to do with Billie. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0KieO"&gt;Obviously, competition between companies offering free social media products looks very different from companies selling cheap razors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sGv0eN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dune director Denis Villeneuve blasts AT&amp;T and Warner Bros. for ‘hijacking’ films </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/24T0kqh-vtUldXEfLqa6C8eENXU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68494669/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O1ndOe"&gt;Denis Villeneuve’s &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;is going to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;coming to HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; on the same date as its theater release, and &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/dune-denis-villeneuve-blasts-warner-bros-1234851270/#article-comments"&gt;the director is not happy&lt;/a&gt;. He’s written an article for &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt; blasting Warner Brothers and AT&amp;amp;T, saying that the the move to release movies on streaming on the same day as in theaters is “a desperate attempt to grab the audience’s attention.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cB6i7"&gt;“With this decision AT&amp;amp;T has hijacked one of the most respectable and important studios in film history,” he writes. “There is absolutely no love for cinema, nor for the audience here. It is all about the survival of a telecom mammoth, one that is currently bearing an astronomical debt of more than $150 billion.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDcQ59"&gt;He's not alone in his anger at WB and HBO Max — last week Christopher Nolan, director of &lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt;, also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22162918/christopher-nolan-tenet-hbo-max-warner-bros-streaming-service-cinematic-releases"&gt;complained about the move&lt;/a&gt;, repeating his frequently raised belief that movies “are meant to be big-screen experiences.” Villeneuve echoed this sentiment in his piece, saying that &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;’s “image and sound were meticulously designed to be seen in theaters.” Villeneuve says the original plan was to delay Dune to October 2021, and he supported that decision for public safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="We9jvR"&gt;Executives for AT&amp;amp;T, NBCUniversal, and ViacomCBS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22163583/streaming-theaters-hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-shows"&gt;have defended the release strategy&lt;/a&gt;, but with directors of the blockbusters starting to voice their disapproval, it’ll be interesting to see how Warner Bros. responds, if it does at all. It will also be interesting to see how audiences respond; whether they agree with the filmmakers that movies need to be seen on the big screen to be truly appreciated, or if they’re happy watching them from the comfort of their own homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ur3I5d"&gt;You can read Villenueve’s full editorial &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/dune-denis-villeneuve-blasts-warner-bros-1234851270/#article-comments"&gt;at &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="65ht1Z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 10th, 9:32PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Corrected the spelling of Christopher Nolan’s movie Tenet. It was previously misspelled as Tenant. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
