    <title>Tesla recalls more than 9,500 Model X and Y vehicles due to manufacturing issues</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aRmG8P"&gt;Tesla has issued recall orders for 9,537 of its vehicles in the US, including 9,136 Model Xs from 2016 and 401 Model Ys from 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-tesla-recall-idUSKBN2851KD?taid=5fbe949f585f620001900d23&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The issues were filed with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Tesla intends to recall the vehicles for testing and fixes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3X72o"&gt;The larger of the two orders affects 9,136 Model Xs from the 2016 model year. The &lt;a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCLRPT-20V710-9316.PDF"&gt;NHTSA report&lt;/a&gt; says the cars feature cosmetic appliques that may have been applied without a primer, which could cause the trim on the roof of the car to fall off while driving at high speeds. Tesla says it will apply a retention test to the potentially affected cars and reapply primers and adhesives so the trim attaches properly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOJxoE"&gt;It’s not the first time roof fixtures have caused headaches for Tesla. In one recent incident, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21502379/tesla-modely-roof-flies-off-convertible-quality-issue"&gt;Model Y lost its entire roof&lt;/a&gt; due to a poorly applied seal, although the failure seems to have been unrelated to the issues that spurred today’s recalls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWCzLx"&gt;A second, smaller recall was &lt;a href="https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2020/RCLRPT-20V709-8187.PDF"&gt;issued for 401 Model Y vehicles&lt;/a&gt; from the 2020 model year, which may feature loose bolts in the front upper control arm that connects to the car’s steering knuckles. Without the bolts properly tightened, the arm could detach from the steering knuckles, affecting the driver’s ability to steer the car. This is also not the first time steering has been an issue for Tesla cars — the company previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/29/17177888/tesla-recall-model-s-size-power-steering"&gt;recalled 123,000 cars from its Model S line&lt;/a&gt; over a power steering problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91qBGd"&gt;Tesla says in the NHTSA report that it knows of only three vehicles affected by loose bolts, and overall it’s not aware of any accidents or injuries tied to either recall. The recall is unlikely to have much impact on Tesla’s recent financial success, which saw the value of the company’s stock &lt;a href="https://www.afr.com/companies/transport/tesla-value-jumps-us40b-as-it-prepares-for-s-and-p-listing-20201118-p56fmh"&gt;increasing by more than $40 billion&lt;/a&gt; ahead of its anticipated listing on the S&amp;amp;P 500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fq4Kdk"&gt;Tesla says it will &lt;a href="https://www.tesla.com/support/annual-and-recall-service"&gt;test and fix affected vehicles free of charge&lt;/a&gt; if they are eligible for the recall. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Comcast to raise internet and TV prices nationwide next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0YnSIm45L_ZUYpP37l40psiTMfI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67983790/acastro_180525_1777_comcast_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HOFIvx"&gt;If you’re a Comcast TV and internet user, prepare for price hikes. The company is planning to increase the prices of a variety of services starting January 1st, 2021, according to &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2020/11/comcast-raising-tv-and-internet-prices-including-a-big-hike-to-hidden-fees/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and a document detailing the various price increases &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cordcutters/comments/jyi9nd/another_comcast_price_hike/"&gt;being shared on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9vmwFs"&gt;The increases include as much as $4.50 per month added to the “Broadcast TV” fee and up to $2 per month added to the Regional Sports Network (RSN) fee, which collectively would add as much as $78 per year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jf3lCL"&gt;In a statement to&lt;em&gt; Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;, a Comcast spokesperson confirmed the above fees, as well as a $3 per month increase for internet-only service and up to a $2.50 per month increase for TV boxes on the primary outlet, with a decrease of up to $2.45 per month for TV boxes on additional outlets. (This means the fee for someone’s primary TV box is increasing from $5 to $7.50 per month, while the fee for additional boxes will be lowered from $9.95 to $7.50 per month.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HirWAS"&gt;Some TV packages might also see increases, but Comcast tells &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; it depends on the service area. In Chicago, for example, the Choice TV package is increasing from $25 to $30 per month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Twbcr"&gt;At the same time as these price hikes, Comcast also said this week &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21591420/comcast-cap-data-1-2tb-home-users-internet-xfinity"&gt;it’d impose a home internet data cap&lt;/a&gt; of 1.2TB per month in more than a dozen states next year. If people go over this allotment, they’ll be charged $10 per 50GB, up to $100 in a month. That means it’s going to be an expensive year to be a Comcast customer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best wireless earbuds to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Whether you’re looking for an everyday pair or something for fitness, these are the best picks&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="19gGFr"&gt;It’s a good time to buy a pair of true wireless earbuds. Whether your top priority is sound quality, comfort, battery life, voice call quality, or noise cancellation, the current field of products is full of great options. I’ve spent a lot of time testing dozens of wireless earbuds from Apple, Samsung, Jabra, Sony, Anker, Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and the best wireless earbuds for you will depend on what you hope to get from them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPrf6v"&gt;There’s no one set of earbuds that is perfect at everything. For general everyday listening, the Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus are the best wireless earbuds. Got an iPhone? Nothing beats the AirPods Pro. If you’re focused on productivity and multitasking during these days of working at home, the Jabra Elite 75t are the best wireless earbuds for those jobs. If you’re after something sportier, that’s where the Powerbeats Pro win out. For people who demand the absolute best sound quality, Sennheiser is the go-to. And if you’re after earbuds that are great for the price, Sony’s WF-XB700s are a favorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vZpkO2"&gt;Remember that getting the most out of earbuds requires a good seal in your ear. Always try the various ear tip sizes that come with whichever buds you purchase — and don’t be afraid to experiment with different sizes in each ear. Ears are funny like that. Many of these earbuds have apps you can install on your phone to further personalize their sound and controls the way you want. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="L0uNYV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9734449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="pNy3BT"&gt;The best wireless earbuds in 2020&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="4hCfqL"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus are the best wireless earbuds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cp52EH"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="f3y5ZM"&gt;Best wireless earbuds overall&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Q6aefF"&gt;Samsung got so much right with the Galaxy Buds Plus that they’re an easy recommendation for anyone looking for a dependable set of true wireless earbuds at a fair price. With up to 11 hours of continuous battery life, they can outlast every other set of earbuds in this roundup. And whenever it does eventually come time to rejuice them, you can just drop the case onto a wireless charger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x4pn7Y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:9299208"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KLJIGc"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Plus feel light in the ears but stay seated firmly and are comfortable to wear for extended periods. They come in a range of colors — unlike Apple’s AirPods — and the sound quality is noticeably improved over their predecessors. Samsung’s two-way drivers deliver emphatic bass and highlight the mid frequencies in a way that other earbuds often skimp on. Music plays smooth across a variety of genres, from pop to EDM to classical. You can personalize that EQ tuning (and adjust ambient sound preferences) using Samsung’s companion mobile app, which is available on both Android and iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JzPVlZ"&gt;Samsung also improved the microphone system in the Galaxy Buds Plus; these are much better at handling voice calls than the original Galaxy Buds were. Their sweat resistance doesn’t quite reach par with other earbuds in this price range, and they lack noise cancellation, but those are about the only knocks I can direct at the Galaxy Buds Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="mJvWk3"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The AirPods Pro, the best wireless earbuds for people who use Apple products, pictured next to an iPhone 11 Pro Max and MacBook Pro." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PJCYyJb47PApJ-PTdVbfaAx2TaQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19336097/cwelch_191031_3763_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you use Apple products, the AirPods Pro are the best wireless earbuds you can get.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ht0eFb"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;Apple AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QpmRPm"&gt;Best wireless earbuds for iPhone owners&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="RcIRva"&gt;If you’re in Apple’s ecosystem, there’s no beating the AirPods Pro. From the seamless setup to quickly switching between your iPhone, iPad, or Mac, the experience is fantastic. The AirPods Pro fit more ears than the regular, one-size-fits-most AirPods, and the active noise cancellation helps to drown out your surroundings when you only want to hear your tunes. When it does come time to hear what’s happening around you, Apple’s transparency mode offers the most natural-sounding amplification of ambient noise that I’ve heard yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lC3quK"&gt;The AirPods Pro are known for balanced, clear audio. They can’t compete with Samsung, Jabra, or others (including Apple’s own Powerbeats Pro) in the bass category, however. With 4.5 hours of battery life with noise canceling on, battery life is decent if not a class-leader — but the case has enough juice to recharge them several times. Voice call quality is second to none, so these (and the standard AirPods) are the go-to pick if you’re often chatting with people through your earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rxwlZ"&gt;Apple plans to update the AirPods Pro with new features this fall, including seamless, automatic switching between Apple devices. (Don’t worry: incoming iPhone calls will always take priority even if you’re doing something on your iPad or Mac.) The other new addition is spatial audio, which will use head tracking to deliver a “theater-like” surround sound experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3Tv5p"&gt;Here’s a tip: if none of the included ear tips get you a perfect seal, I recommend a set of memory foam tips like those from &lt;a href="https://www.complyfoam.com/products/app-comply-foam-tips-compatible-with-airpods-pro/"&gt;Comply&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1565954-REG%2Fdekoni_audio_etz_app_md3_airpods_pro_tips.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21309820%2Fbest-wireless-earbuds#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dekoni&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Jabra Elite 75t are the best wireless earbuds if you want to pair with two devices simultaneously.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="W40xtb"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative"&gt;Jabra Elite 75t&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="uDVgDy"&gt;Best wireless earbuds for multitasking (and lots of bass)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ZHIA9R"&gt;Jabra’s earbuds have an advantage that remains rare among true wireless earbuds: you can use them with two devices simultaneously. Every other product on this list requires you to switch from one paired device to the other, but with the Jabras, you can listen to tunes on your laptop while staying connected to your phone in case a call comes in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2B4Zz0"&gt;The Elite 75ts offer full-bodied, powerful sound with an extra dose of bass. You can adjust the EQ using Jabra’s app, which also includes numerous other features for tailoring the earbuds to your liking. Their physical controls are easy to use, and the 75ts are comfortable over lengthy periods of time. Jabra backs them with a two-year warranty, a longer period of support than most, in the event you experience any hardware issues. (One of my 75t buds recently stopped taking a charge out of nowhere, so it can happen.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8xKAQg"&gt;Best wireless earbuds for fitness&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="H4ocO9"&gt;There’s still no beating the Powerbeats Pro if you’re looking for a set of earbuds for your workouts or runs. Their ear hook design keeps them planted on your ears during intense exercise, they can endure your sweatiest workouts, and the nine hours of continuous battery life should get you through just about any marathon. And the sound quality is killer, with plenty of bass and an immersive soundstage that will keep you motivated through every set. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l6ZYqy"&gt;This spring, Apple released a new batch of Powerbeats Pro colors. Though the company didn’t make any significant hardware changes, I haven’t run into some of the annoyances — like one earbud failing to charge or not turning out when removed from the case — that I have with my original pair. Maybe it’s luck, or maybe Apple quietly made some fixes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mRgq3W"&gt;Best wireless earbuds for sound quality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="QToDFF"&gt;If you deem yourself an audiophile and rank pristine sound above everything else, it’s worth taking a look at Sennheiser’s Momentum True Wireless 2 earbuds. The audio is lush, detailed, and sublime. Active noise cancellation helps keep you lost in your favorite albums, even if the Sennheisers fall behind our other top picks in areas like battery life and ease of use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FA40BX"&gt;The bigger downside is that Sennheiser charges a premium price for such premium sound: the True Momentum Wireless earbuds cost $300, which puts them on a higher pricing tier than everything else on this list. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Sony WF-XB700 are the best wireless earbuds if you’re not looking to spend much more than $100.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ldQHSa"&gt;6. Sony WF-XB700&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4qWQZj"&gt;Best wireless earbuds on a budget&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="NvJMbb"&gt;Sony’s entry-level earbuds were released without much fanfare a few months ago, but I think they’re a real standout. They’ve already seen sale prices of below $100, and for that, you get a pair of earbuds that can kick out powerful bass and latch into your ears with remarkable stability — no support fins or hooks required. There are no frills here: these earbuds don’t have an ambient sound mode, they won’t pause your music when you take them out, and they lack any kind of mobile app support for EQ adjustments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQKjfo"&gt;But in the time I’ve spent using them, I haven’t really cared about any of that. The WF-XB700 earbuds sound downright terrific for the price, the connection stability is rock solid (with no audio sync issues when watching videos), and their ingenious charging case always makes clear that everything is charging as it should, thanks to a slightly transparent lid. You can’t really ask for better battery life than the nine hours you’ll get from these, and they’re IPX4 water and sweat resistant. The textured finish probably won’t appeal to everyone, but it means you won’t have to put up with scratches or smudges on the earbuds or case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6r1Nsq"&gt;I can’t call them the best true wireless earbuds you can get, but I think a lot of people would be perfectly content with the WF-XB700s if they wanted to save some money. They’re a real gem and nail that price / performance balance terrifically. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="qSby2y"&gt;Most &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; deals will launch the day after Thanksgiving (November 26th) in the US as usual, but the pandemic has shaken things up in yet another way. The best deals will be happening online, with fewer in-person sales for the sake of safety. Better yet, some of those great deals are already available, so you can get started on your holiday gift (or personal) shopping. With this post, we’re rounding up the best early Black Friday deals from retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target, Adorama, B&amp;amp;H Photo, Newegg, and anywhere else we find deals you should know about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Kq7sS1"&gt;Smart speaker and audio deals&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MRx7v2iKWDhr2lI1LUX0smT9vN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19208402/dseifert_190915_3647_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sono’s portable Move speaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GbNCbs"&gt;If you are looking for a Dolby Atmos soundbar complete with rear surrounds and rotating speakers, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724766654076559156" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Vizio’s Elevate soundbar is $700 right now at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The Vizio Elevate features 18 speakerstota  and comes with a wireless eight-inch subwoofer. Normally, this product would set you back $1,000 dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="E8dr2S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733903"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3TO80R"&gt;Sonos has slashed the prices on several of its speakers ahead of Black Friday. Three of its popular models are $100 off right now, a savings of up to 25 percent. You can buy the Sonos Move, the company’s first portable speaker, for just $299 right now at Sonos and Amazon or $300 at Best Buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="APQVzv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9575913"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tWOj2e"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D4734HR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos Beam is $299 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (Usually $400). The deal is also available at &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/move.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos’ direct website&lt;/a&gt;. This is a great entry-level soundbar. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sNyRnl"&gt;You can also buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087CCZH4Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos Sub add-on speaker at a discounted price for $599 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (usually $700). The deal is also available at &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/sub.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos’ direct website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jIQou8"&gt;If you’re looking for a compact and inexpensive smart speaker, both of the latest Amazon Echo and Echo Dot devices are on sale. The 4th Gen Echo Dot is down to $29, which is the lowest price we’ve seen since its launch this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PJS3T7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rkA3Fv"&gt;The Echo Dot’s compact design might not be appealing to everyone, but if you are looking for an Echo Device but want something a bit bigger, you can grab the Amazon Echo’s fourth-generation speaker for $70 right now at a few retailers, including Amazon and Target. Like this year’s Echo Dot, the Amazon Echo has an updated design that makes it more spherical in shape. It also has much improved audio quality and the ability to connect Zigbee smart home devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s8yyuQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K1n5zT"&gt;Over at Adorama and Best Buy, you can buy a Google Nest Audio two-pack for $170 right now. A two-pack for this smart speaker would normally set you back $199.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="U1SnqO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503894"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="of9IqM"&gt;Headphone and earbud deals&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p id="61vp5x"&gt;You can get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;Bose’s excellent Noise Cancelling 700 Headphones&lt;/a&gt; for $299 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Cancelling-Wireless-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B07Q4QK379?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724213175001080094" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1475153-REG%2Fbose_794297_0100_headphones_700_noise_cancelling.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeals.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fmpp%2Fproductdetail%2F6b3f#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell&lt;/a&gt;. The price is only available in “soapstone white,” unfortunately, at all these retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IxWjk2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9586877"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OYOJJg"&gt;Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/apple-airpods-pro-18?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_campaign=CJ&amp;amp;cjevent=bf1dd84529dc11eb814400030a24060c&amp;amp;utm_source=Vox+Media" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AirPods Pro wireless earbuds are $190 at Woot right now&lt;/a&gt;. This is the lowest we’ve seen yet on Apple’s flagship earbuds. Compared to the standard AirPods, the Pro model features better sound quality and noise cancellation, plus support for Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ULP9BI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G47XoL"&gt;Over at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B08J3Y4W5J/ref=as_li_ss_tl?th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=4387f080251cd074ca147f7179f672d2&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1722751386730213452" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, you can buy the Samsung’s bean-shaped wireless earbuds the Galaxy Buds Live for just $140. Aside from an unorthodox design, my colleagues, Chris Welch and Becca Farsace, pointed out in &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/GwL-COqlauA"&gt;their&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;reviews&lt;/a&gt; that the Galaxy Buds Live also produce a powerful sound and come with a lengthy battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IhVQK2"&gt;Each retailer has four colors, but one color is exclusive to each site; if you want the Galaxy Buds Live in red, the sale is only available at Amazon. Over at Best Buy, you can buy them in blue for $140. Additionally, both retailers also have the earbuds on sale in black, bronze, and white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L89sjM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503020"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AhnjK1"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus wireless earbuds are down to just $110 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KVM9VW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724117005601449431" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This is the best price we’ve seen for this model, which usually costs $150 outside of any discounts. Compared to the standard Galaxy Buds, this upgraded model that launched alongside the Galaxy S20 series of phones has improved sound quality, microphones, and battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5zWQ0"&gt;If you are looking to buy two pairs of Galaxy Buds Plus, Best Buy has a few bundles, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724213386876980609" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;allowing you to buy sets for only $200&lt;/a&gt;. You can mix and match which color you want for both pairs and are available in blue, black, light blue, red, and white. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wo6p68"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9581901" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ArxGby"&gt;Alongside the Plus wireless earbuds, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds are discounted at Amazon and Best Buy. Normally, these earbuds would cost $130, but you can get them for $79 at Amazon or $80 at Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttnzGj"&gt;Unfortunately, the color options are limited at both retailers, so you can only buy these earbuds in either black or silver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o58dM6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9586872"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;MacBook Pro (late-2020).&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9wSrQ5"&gt;This month, Apple released new MacBook Pros powered by its own Apple silicon processors. If you are interested in buying the new MacBook Pro (late 2020) model with the new M1 chip, the base model, which comes with 8GB of RAM and 256GB of SSD storage for $1,249 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LLDSG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604809-REG%2Fapple_myd82ll_a_13_3_macbook_pro_with.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, knocking $50 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yKA0iQ"&gt;If 256GB of storage is not enough for you can buy the same model but with 512GB of storage for $1,449 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MacBook-13-inch-256GB-Storage/dp/B08N5LH3F7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1604810-REG%2Fapple_myd92ll_a_13_3_macbook_pro_with.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V4pCH7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733800"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Tf9DYs"&gt;If you are looking for an iPad in a smaller size, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-Mini-Wi-Fi-64GB/dp/B07PRD2NQ7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon has the latest iPad mini with 64GB of storage on sale for $379&lt;/a&gt;. The 2019 iPad Mini features a 7.9-inch display and all the same specs as the iPad Air. Nevertheless, this is the best tablet for people that want an Apple device to watch movies, read books or play games, but want a something that is bigger than a phone but not as big as a laptop.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dlyLDy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LmyLtf"&gt;If you are looking to pick up an iPad Pro this Black Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-256GB/dp/B08637NV8M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=Apple+iPad+11+inch+Pro&amp;amp;qid=1606161912&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=5f05426660dc58d28ae324183dffef5c&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724578293673083745" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have Apple’s high-end iPad Pro for $729 and $730 respectively. This model includes an 11-inch display and a 128GB storage configuration. If 128GB is not enough storage space for you, both retailers are taking $100 off the 256GB configuration, bringing the price down to $800, which is what you would normally pay if you bought the entry-level 11-inch iPad Pro with the lowest storage configuration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="88eK3q"&gt;The iPad Pro’s 12-inch model with 128GB of storage is also on sale for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-12-9-inch-Wi-Fi-256GB/dp/B0863D15R6/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=076df3f320798fd15e55e2336fa98314&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$899 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724674102959813551" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$900 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Normally this model and storage configuration would set you back $1,000. If you need a bit more storage, the same 12-inch iPad Pro, but with 256GB of storage is also discounted, bringing the price down to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-12-9-inch-Wi-Fi-256GB/dp/B0862HNWGK?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$999 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724674166117590966" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,000 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch SE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SyzhPO"&gt;If you like Fitbit’s wearables and prefer to have a smartwatch by the company, you can get the Fitbit Sense smartwatch for $280 at &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fitbit’s website&lt;/a&gt; or at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724580973739712242" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1590667-REG%2Ffitbit_fb512bkbk_sense_gps_smartwatch_carbon.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. Normally this model costs $330 and allows you to track your stress levels and measure your blood oxygen levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AAW1Mh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603483"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DlkbsX"&gt;The Apple Watch SE was already the most affordable Watch that Apple made at $279, but it’s even cheaper at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5W9QWZ/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=991c5b97a31528a6a07f9a0fae1bdb29&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724578867741826427" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. You can score the 40mm GPS version for $259 or the larger 44mm Watch for $289 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-44mm/dp/B08J5XTRZD/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=e39bfa3f763e4fa56204c59a62303c7a&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724578918898824263" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Each size looks similar to the more expensive Series 6 but lacks the always-on display and a few other features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Widfy"&gt;The Apple Watch SE aligns more with the Series 5 in terms of specs, but at $259, it’s a fantastic value. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438413/apple-watch-series-6-se-5-3-comparison-smartwatch-models-versus"&gt;Here’s an in-depth post&lt;/a&gt; on how the SE differs from other recent Apple Watch models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Ffa5rt"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 6 is also cheaper than usual at Amazon and Walmart. Normally $400 for the 40mm GPS model, it’s down to $330 — but there’s a catch. You must buy this model in either red at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J5RBMRN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-PRODUCT-RED-Aluminum-Case-with-PRODUCT-RED-Sport-Band-Regular%2F478251261%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="65HtKg"&gt;If you have a large home and want to make sure all of the rooms in it have internet and no dead zones, Amazon and Best Buy has discounted the Eero 6 mesh Wi-Fi router. You can get three units for just $479. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Jg0NxI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9599966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z8kPHL"&gt;Ahead of Black Friday, Google has discounted several of its products, including the Nest Wifi, and you can buy a two-pack for $219. The Nest Wifi system is easy to set up, and with two units, you can cover up to 4,400 square feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RtDGBK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603453"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qwgnwv"&gt;If you need a mesh router system that will cover more square feet in your home, you can buy a three-pack Eero 6 mesh router for $223. The mesh routers also include a built-in Zigbee smart home hub, allowing you to connect and control select devices with Amazon’s voice assistant Alexa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dACyX2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603441"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Av0Zih"&gt;If you prefer Netgear products, you can save 22 percent on a two-pack for the company’s Nighthawk mesh router system. It’s designed for homes that have up to 400Mbps of internet speeds. Netgear says its Nighthawk mesh router system provides up to 3,000 square feet in coverage and support for 25 or more devices.&lt;/p&gt;

Normally $290, this kit will only cost you $150. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WM5ndj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591273"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kp4b3f"&gt;Circling back to Netgear, its $450 flagship mesh router system is also discounted. You can buy the Orbi RBK752 Wi-Fi 6 mesh router system for $280 at Best Buy right now. This is a great product if you need something that will have the bandwidth to stream multiple videos in 4K or 8K resolution in your house. &lt;/p&gt;

Amazon and Best Buy have the charging pad on sale for $20 off, bringing the price down to $79. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mq2s89"&gt;The Trio wireless charging pad can also charge iPhones (iPhone X or newer), but its right pad only supports charging for Samsung Galaxy smartwatches. Fortunately, you can charge your AirPods on the pad if you have a wireless charging case. &lt;/p&gt;

It features optional password protection with AES 256-bit encryption and Samsung claims the T7 has up to 1,050MB/s transfer speeds. It’s compatible with a variety of operating systems, including Windows 10, macOS, and Android. Unfortunately, it will not work on iPad or iOS devices and it is not compatible as an external SSD for the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Blx9fM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt;, the latest installment in Ubisoft’s hack-anything, open-world game, the PS4 and Xbox One versions are down to $30 at Amazon and Best Buy. If you are looking for the PC it &lt;a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubi.com%2Fus%2Fwatch-dogs-legion-standard-edition%2F5cec2d5839798c0870c07698.html%3Flang%3Den_US&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;is down to $45 at Ubisoft’s official website&lt;/a&gt;. This title recently came out and this is still a good discount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="621nK9"&gt;What makes this deal even better is that if you buy the Xbox One or PS4 version of the game, you get an upgrade to the Xbox Series X / S or PS5 copies for free. Even if you don’t have much interest in the game, it’s an affordable way to check out what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556197/xbox-series-s-ray-tracing-watch-dogs-legion"&gt;impressive ray-tracing graphics&lt;/a&gt; look like on the new console hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ZvFCDQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II &lt;/em&gt;is one of the most popular PS4 games released this year.

&lt;p id="3mRedx"&gt;Speaking of popular PS4 games that released this year, &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt; is also on sale at its lowest price ever of $40 at Amazon and Best Buy. Even better? If you purchased a PS5, you can transfer your save data from your PS4 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21553494/sony-playstation-5-ps5-backward-compatibility-ps4-digital-foundry"&gt;experience the game in 60 frames per second&lt;/a&gt;, a feature exclusive to Sony’s next-gen console. &lt;/p&gt;

The list goes on, though one thing that isn’t eligible are first-party Sony games for the PS5, like the &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls &lt;/em&gt;remake, but you can pick up &lt;em&gt;Godfall, &lt;/em&gt;which is available on Sony’s next-gen console (and on PC.) Even &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077,&lt;/em&gt; a game coming out next month is eligible for this promotion. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="hzKrB2"&gt;On October 24th, 2020, an art trafficker in Darnah, Libya &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ATHARProject/status/1328876005201686534"&gt;posted a series of unusual ads&lt;/a&gt;. For sale: a Greco-Roman statue, its marble bust covered in a toga. If it looked like it belonged in a museum, that’s because it did. The seller posted photos of the piece in private Facebook groups dedicated to trafficking antiques. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KMDwFV"&gt;The black market for looted goods is flourishing on Facebook. While the company banned the sale of historical artifacts in June, many of the posts are in Arabic, and Facebook lacks the expertise to properly enforce its new policy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="OOPmSh"&gt;When Facebook &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; able to identify groups that flout its guidelines, experts say the company simply deletes them, expunging crucial documentation for researchers studying stolen art. “This is critical evidence for repatriation efforts and war crimes,” says Katie Paul, co-director of the &lt;a href="http://atharproject.org/"&gt;Athar Project&lt;/a&gt;. “Facebook has created a problem and rather than turning that into something they could contribute to, they are making it worse.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mm3LKX"&gt;The implications go far beyond art theft. Since 2014, looted antiques have been a major funding source for terrorist organizations like ISIS. The Middle East is rich with cultural artifacts, and the market for stolen goods isn’t as regulated as drug trafficking and arms sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gp3lCC"&gt;The seller of the Greco-Roman statue posted the ad in Facebook groups which had between 5,000 to 18,000 members. There, traffickers live stream their looting activities, giving each other tips on digging and finding buyers for pieces that are still in the ground. Athar is currently monitoring 130 groups dedicated to trafficking antiques.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J8ra8z"&gt;A group in Syria with 340,000 members has posts &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ATHARProject/status/1331627522010849280"&gt;showing looters uncovering a mosaic&lt;/a&gt;. In the comments, Athar documented one user saying the mosaic shouldn’t be removed, while another responded with laughing emojis saying: “Die of hunger for the history of the country.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1f_9eAdqdzMtaWOBWW0JYYiCpOg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22121782/Enrj6cZW4AI_qEw.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo courtesy of Athar Project&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vvo62U"&gt;The problem is particularly grave in active conflict zones where trafficking antiquities is a war crime. “It’s infuriating and problematic,” says Samuel Hardy, a research fellow at the Norwegian Institute in Rome who specializes in cultural heritage and conflict. “When Facebook pulls evidence that people are self-publishing, we lose not only the ability to track the cultural property and return it to the victimized community, but also any hope of identifying and stopping the criminals who are making money from it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2AvdWk"&gt;Facebook isn’t the only platform struggling with how to police content while preserving evidence for research groups like Athar. &lt;a href="https://time.com/5798001/facebook-youtube-algorithms-extremism/"&gt;YouTube has also received criticism for removing extremist content&lt;/a&gt; that researchers are trying to study. While both companies will sometimes preserve evidence at the request of law enforcement, this policy doesn’t help most academic researchers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EZB0di"&gt;“We’re not saying that all this content has to remain public forever,” &lt;a href="https://time.com/5798001/facebook-youtube-algorithms-extremism/"&gt;Jeff Deutch, a researcher at the Syrian Archive, told &lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, in relation to videos documenting human rights violations. “But it’s important that this content is archived, so it’s accessible to researchers, to human rights groups, to academics, to lawyers, for use in some kind of legal accountability.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cu9V8e"&gt;On Facebook, the issue has existed for years. Those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/15/17121854/facebook-data-research-api-privacy-impact"&gt;trying to study the company’s ad targeting tools&lt;/a&gt; have also been frustrated by its unwillingness to share data with academics. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pi9FFC"&gt;In the case of art traffickers, Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/3/6/18253922/facebook-privacy-meaning-implications-mark-zuckerberg-pivot-analysis-interface-casey-newton"&gt;pivot to privacy&lt;/a&gt; has had unintentional benefits, since criminals use secret groups and encrypted messages to conduct illicit activity. “This in turn has made Facebook the wild west of social media, providing opportunities for violent extremist organizations and criminal groups to operate in plain sight with little recourse,” &lt;a href="http://atharproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/ATHAR-FB-Report-June-2019-final.pdf"&gt;Athar wrote in a report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GsdJTt"&gt;Facebook would not comment on the record for this story. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The cockroach emoji proposal is a story about texting through the apocalypse</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Cockroach Emoji" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K9bQh3sI_XM6iPQiQUQWMcvcqbw=/50x0:950x600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67982161/cockroach_1fab3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mjw296"&gt;A slate of new emoji was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21547652/ios-14-2-available-now-download-new-emoji-wallpaper-airplay-2-iphone-ipad-update"&gt;announced in January&lt;/a&gt;. Months later, they’ve finally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21547652/ios-14-2-available-now-download-new-emoji-wallpaper-airplay-2-iphone-ipad-update"&gt;trickled onto most people’s phones&lt;/a&gt;... but in one case, it’s really more of a skitter. I’m talking about the cockroach, arguably the most shudder-inducing emoji of 2020 — and the product of a great little short story about the looming end of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RqHuio"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327599/how-to-make-emoji-yawning-face-waffle-proposal-unicode"&gt;my colleague Jay Peters&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/28/18514833/picture-character-emoji-documentary-movie-unicode-tribeca"&gt;excellent 2019 documentary&lt;/a&gt; explain, anyone can submit an emoji proposal to the Unicode Consortium. The proposal must convince the consortium that many people will use the emoji in a variety of ways. And for the authors of &lt;a href="https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2019/19095-cockroach-emoji.pdf"&gt;the cockroach application&lt;/a&gt; — Jason Li, Melissa Thermidor, and Amanda Hickman — that includes the aftermath of a nuclear war.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pq8auS"&gt;It starts with a line from the opening paragraph. After noting “strong global demand” for a roach emoji, the authors casually lay out one specific scenario: preparing our culture for the death of the human race. “Adding a COCKROACH emoji would not only benefit the currently small animal-bug collection, but also ensure that if cockroaches do outlive humans in the future, at least they have an emoji too,” they note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MiMtB6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If cockroaches do outlive humans in the future, at least they have an emoji too.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zujhUT"&gt;The authors concede that despite popular perception, cockroaches &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; couldn’t survive a nuclear war. But don’t worry — they could also reference humans who do! “COCKROACH will be a versatile emoji that can be used in a number of ways,” they reason. It could be used as “a visual signifier for a house pest,” for instance; or to symbolize “something that’s hard to get rid of”; or, naturally, “to reference a survivor in a nuclear winter.” There’s even a proposed sequence for nuclear winter itself: a cockroach, a radioactivity symbol, and a snowflake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWDzxr"&gt;The actual story behind the symbol is more sober. Last week, Jason Li &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonli/status/1329213493086662662"&gt;posted a Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; about its road to approval, starting with his childhood in roach-ridden Hong Kong. The emoji was meant as a tribute to an “arguably cute hometown pest.” But months after its submission, Hong Kong &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1706106/hong-kong-police-call-protesters-cockroaches/"&gt;police began calling&lt;/a&gt; pro-democracy protesters and local bystanders “cockroaches,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonli/status/1329213539450576898"&gt;turning it into&lt;/a&gt; “an anti-protester meme of police brutality.” (There’s also an ugly history of genocidal movements &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2011/03/29/134956180/criminals-see-their-victims-as-less-than-human"&gt;using “cockroach” as an insult&lt;/a&gt;.) Now, Li tweets that he’s got “very, very mixed feelings” about the roach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0zaVp"&gt;The Unicode Consortium application, however, continues to double as excellent science fiction. While the rest of us live in blissful ignorance, Godspeed to the people who will help us text through the apocalypse — and lace obscure bureaucratic filings with dire hints along the way.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best noise-canceling headphones to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Get some peace and quiet with the best noise-canceling headphones for a variety of uses&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PBr4KB"&gt;Noise-canceling headphones are an essential piece of kit during regular life when commuting to work, traveling, or if you’re trying to dull distractions at the office. But they’re also important as we continue to tally yet more weeks spent at home. It’s always nice to get a reprieve from the people you live with and be in your own private, serene bubble for a while — and noise-canceling headphones are a good way to find that peace and quiet. Since they envelop your ears, wireless headphones will always do better at erasing surrounding distractions than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;noise-canceling earbuds like the AirPods Pro or Sony WF-1000XM3s&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bhCylT"&gt;The criteria for picking the best noise-canceling headphones hasn’t changed: the most important measures are how well they can eliminate outside noise, sound quality, battery life, whether they support simultaneous pairing to multiple devices, and comfort. Aside from one general pick that does a lot of things really well, I’ve also gathered together some other recommendations if you want to stray from the popular choice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="QiKAdy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9734395"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="pNy3BT"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones in 2020&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="9ToLHX"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A photo of Sony’s WH-1000XM4, the best noise-canceling headphones for most people, resting on a table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nfnb67pDrZK7noQDhl7_IliL-CM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21699857/IMG_0620-1.0.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4 headphones are the best noise-canceling headphones for most people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FIBBVA"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356313/sony-1000xm4-noise-canceling-headphones-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Sony WH-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="e21VnC"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for most people&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="YnVAr7"&gt;It took nearly two years for them to arrive, but Sony’s WH-1000XM4 noise-canceling headphones were worth the wait. They might look identical to the previous fantastic 1000XM3s, but the company has made slight design tweaks for added comfort on those days when you find yourself wearing the M4s for hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ryf87h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:9355782"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iFvF1p"&gt;Noise cancellation has been further improved from the performance of the M3s, putting Sony neck and neck with Bose in overall effectiveness of silencing your surroundings. Sound quality is basically identical to the previous headphones — it’s still punchy, full, and very enjoyable — as is the 30-hour maximum battery life. But Sony has addressed two of the biggest issues with the M3s this time around: the 1000XM4s have improved voice microphone performance, and they can now connect to two devices simultaneously, so you can stay clued in to what’s happening on your phone when you’re working away on your laptop or tablet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyU7Qv"&gt;There are also new features intended for convenience: the optional “speak to chat” function will automatically pause your music and pipe in ambient audio when the headphones detect you’ve started talking. And the 1000XM4s can also tell when they’ve been removed from your ears, at which point, your audio will automatically pause. They still cost the same hefty $350, but you’re getting more for your money with the 1000XM4s than before. They will start shipping in mid-August. The &lt;a href="https://amzn.to/314elBg" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;previous M3 headphones&lt;/a&gt; are still a fine pick even now if you can snag them at a good sale price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="gGlUWP"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bose’s Noise Canceling Headphones 700 are excellent for all your Zoom and voice call needs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qq8iW7"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="b7jGRn"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for videoconferencing and making calls&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="tdSxzI"&gt;Bose is the brand synonymous with noise-canceling headphones, and the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 are another example of why that reputation is well-earned. They have satisfactory sound, excellent voice call quality, and great noise cancellation effectiveness. It’s really a flip of the coin between these and Sony’s 1000XM3 headphones in the eyes of many. Sony ekes out superior battery life and more lively, impactful sound, but Bose’s support for multipoint pairing with two devices at once is a big plus. The Noise Canceling Headphones 700 are comfortable to wear for long stretches of time, even if they aren’t as feather-light as the company’s less expensive QC35 II headphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9TYQUm"&gt;When it comes time to join a Zoom meeting or call someone, you’ll be heard loud and clear by whoever’s on the other end, which can’t be said for all wireless headphones on this list. Bose’s microphone setup on the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 is second to none, though Jabra also fares well here. Battery life is where Bose trails its competitors, with the Noise Canceling Headphones 700 rated at up to 20 hours — short of the 30 hours you can reach with Sony or other picks below. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shure’s first noise-canceling headphones offer fantastic build quality and support for codecs like apt-X HD and LDAC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="yj00sX"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for sound quality&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="rqLSMi"&gt;If you prioritize enjoying your music over drowning out the world, then both Sennheiser and Shure have fantastic options with superb sound quality and adequate noise cancellation. Sennheiser’s Momentum Wireless have detailed, bass-rich, and vibrant sound combined with sublime comfort. The same can be said for the newer Shure Aonic 50 headphones, which support advanced codecs like apt-X HD and LDAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SGZqkd"&gt;If you’re a stickler for audio quality, both headphones can be used wired with either a 3.5mm headphone jack or over USB-C. They each outdo Bose and other more mainstream picks in terms of build quality and materials. That premium feel does demand a bit more, with both of these selling for the same $400 price tag. Their noise-canceling isn’t on par with the best, but you still get convenient software features like ambient passthrough and customizable EQ on top of the brilliant sound.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer’s Opus are the best noise-canceling headphones for around $200.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="iJtZxh"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for around $200&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="b3zztw"&gt;Razer departed from its usual gaming headset formula with the noise-canceling Opus headphones, which are designed for a mainstream audience looking to spend less money than the $300 or more that Sony and Bose demand. The Opus headphones are a strong first showing, with good comfort, sturdy build quality, clear and balanced audio quality, and noise cancellation that’s a few rungs below the leaders but still performs well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7RzBr"&gt;Razer omitted features like multipoint Bluetooth pairing, and you’re limited to preset EQ settings instead of having full control, but those are really the only downsides of the Opus cans. And the company did at least include auto-pause for when you take them off. As long as you don’t confuse these for gaming headphones — they’re not meant to be — you should be pleased with what Razer is offering up for at least $100 less than the big competition.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beats Solo Pro headphones have an on-ear design and work best with Apple devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VroSfn"&gt;The best on-ear noise-canceling headphones&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ldtIVc"&gt;The Beats Solo Pro headphones rest on your ears instead of completely covering them, which some people might prefer. A popular choice at the gym, the Solo Pros have sweat resistance and a strong clamping force on your head so that they’ll stay put during a workout or run. As with most modern Beats headphones and earbuds, the Solo Pros are tuned to drive your day with some oomph to the bass, though they’re more well-balanced than Beats of old. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jadUXW"&gt;If you use an iPhone, the Solo Pros can take advantage of Apple ecosystem features like audio sharing and the same seamless setup / pairing process as AirPods. They’ll also be getting the new spatial audio feature coming in iOS 14, which will let you get a surround sound-like experience when watching movies on your iOS device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0phvUS"&gt;They’re not as great at noise cancellation as Bose or Sony, but the on-ear design and a snug fit help the Solo Pros offer good passive noise isolation even when NC is switched off. (You can hit up to 40 hours of battery life if you keep noise cancellation off.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="i7fV4Q"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for ease of use&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PsR02w"&gt;With the Surface Headphones 2, Microsoft retained the brilliant turning-dial control scheme of the first-generation pair and made important improvements elsewhere to sound quality and battery life. After you’ve gotten used to adjusting volume or noise cancellation levels simply by twisting the dial around each ear cup, you’ll never want to go back to hunting for button nubs again. The Surface Headphones 2 are also an excellent pick for productivity, as their multipoint pairing works seamlessly when a call comes in on your phone while you’re at work on your PC. And now, they come in black, so you’re no longer stuck with the stale light gray color. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Marshall Monitor II ANC headphones have a stylish design that ties into the company’s history.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mtvtN5"&gt;7. Marshall Monitor II ANC&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DO2V4l"&gt;The best noise-canceling headphones for style&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ht7uR3"&gt;Marshall’s wireless headphones have proven surprisingly popular, and the company’s most expensive pair is also its best yet. The Monitor II ANC headphones are priced at $320, which puts them on the same playing field as Bose, Sony, and other tech companies that have been making premium noise-canceling cans for many years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgMNhe"&gt;Marshall doesn’t quite match them in sound quality or NC effectiveness; the Monitor IIs have warm, textured sound and perform decently at cutting down on ambient noise. But they definitely stand out from the pack in looks, with a design that speaks to the company’s heritage &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/24/18018074/marshall-joystick-headphone-button-control-audio-bluetooth-wireless"&gt;and the signature gold joystick&lt;/a&gt; that makes the Monitor IIs simple to control. They can also last up to 30 hours with NC enabled or up to a staggering 45 hours if you’re already someplace quiet and can do without the feature. A lack of AAC codec support at this price stings, but I’ve enjoyed the Monitor IIs every time I’ve put them on. They’re more than just an amp brand stamped onto an average pair of headphones. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best smartphone you can buy for under $500 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cZYqwTfbX2vk4FqDWTzaFfIYSDU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67732462/vpavic_200805_4131_0086_1.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;You can get a great smartphone at this price, whether you want an iPhone, a big screen, or a great camera&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="B1aeyk"&gt;Buying a smartphone for under $500 is a lesson in setting priorities. It’s impossible to buy a phone that does everything at this price point, but luckily you will be able to buy a great phone that does the things that matter the most to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4qMTFV"&gt;Phones at this price point are better than ever, many coming with features that used to be reserved just for flagships. But instead of getting it all, you should think about the features that you care about and focus on finding a phone that nails them. Some phones emphasize a big screen, others a quality camera, and one of them emphasizes speed and longevity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="opZnVh"&gt;The trend of inexpensive phones getting better has been happening for a few years now, with companies like Apple, Google, and Samsung making devices that absolutely can meet your needs for less. Other companies like TCL have started trying to build their own brand by marketing directly, and OnePlus is also making a return to the lower end of the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O271rc"&gt;Our pick for the best inexpensive iPhone is the 2020 edition of the Apple iPhone SE. It serves the needs of most people and does a competent job at everything, but its standout feature is that it should last four or more years if treated well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="77wmze"&gt;If you prefer an Android phone or are looking to spend less, then the options start to bifurcate a little bit. The Google Pixel 4A has an excellent camera and good software, but it doesn’t have the large screen many people are looking for. To get that, your best bet is Samsung’s Galaxy A51 smartphone, which does boast a big, beautiful screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dAV1gP"&gt;Those phones are pretty much available worldwide, but if you’re in the markets where OnePlus has more presence, the OnePlus Nord is a newcomer that beats out the competition by hitting a higher baseline in all its categories rather than excelling at just one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ejzg03"&gt;What most people are looking for in a sub-$500 smartphone are the same things people want in a flagship: long battery life, good screen, good camera, and decent performance. It’s difficult to get high straight As in every single one of those categories, but if you’re able to decide where you’ll tolerate the occasional B grade, you’ll find a phone you’ll love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="2LdObD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9734342"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="xLIfAi"&gt;The best smartphone for under $500 in 2020&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="GatTSx"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBU6PLPRcKtVVTdfTrprm4mAigQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19916232/vpavic_042019_3980_0024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple iPhone SE is a great choice if you want a phone that lasts for years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PEjixV"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;Apple iPhone SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YvXuY9"&gt;The best smartphone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="xGSQd4"&gt;The phone that strikes the right balance of camera, build quality, speed, battery life, software, and longevity for most people is the Apple iPhone SE 2020. Specifically, we recommend upgrading to the model with 128GB of storage for $449, which is $50 over the base price but well worth it long term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yS33o"&gt;The iPhone SE follows a very tried and true formula. It has the same body and 4.7-inch LCD screen that Apple has been using since the iPhone 6. That puts the display on the smaller end of screen sizes today and also means the phone’s bezels are bigger than anything else sold on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJSrTq"&gt;But in exchange for that very familiar phone body, you get a lot of value. The best thing about the iPhone SE is its processor, Apple’s A13 Bionic. That matters because it is literally the fastest processor you can get on any phone, anywhere. It’s the exact same chip found in Apple’s $999-and-up iPhone 11 Pro. Normally speed isn’t something we prioritize on phones at this price point, but it’s nice to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFxDqg"&gt;Why that processor &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; matters, though, is overall longevity. Apple consistently supports its phones for four or more years with software updates. (That’s in opposition to Android, where getting software updates on anything but the Pixel is still a struggle.) So Apple’s choice of a fast processor means that in a few years the iPhone SE will still feel snappy and still be supported with iOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XX01cV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yPInwx"&gt;Battery life is good, but not best in class. It should last about a day. Luckily, this iPhone supports wireless charging, a relative rarity at this price point. And because it has the exact same shape of the iPhone 6, 6S, 7, and 8 there is a huge ecosystem of chargers and cases for it. Unlike many inexpensive Android phones, finding compatible accessories for the iPhone SE will be a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbhSVu"&gt;The iPhone SE has just one camera on the back and just one selfie camera on the front, 12 megapixels and 7 megapixels, respectively. Neither is great by 2020 standards, but both are significantly better than what Apple shipped in older iPhones. It’s also fairly good by the standards of sub-$500 phones, though the Google Pixel 4A continues to win this category by a knockout. You will get a lot of camera features on the iPhone SE, including portrait and HDR, but unfortunately there is no night mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wEIcsk"&gt;As a total package, the 2020 iPhone SE is the best smartphone under $500 for most people. If you think of it on a cost-per-year metric, it ends up being significantly less expensive than the competition because it’s likely to last four, five, or even six years if you take care of it. Just as importantly, it’s a great phone on its own merits. You get access to the vast array of iOS apps, Apple’s clean iOS software, and huge ecosystem of accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EF2MIg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556638"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ykrqeX"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 4A has an incredible camera." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uGMHIJ_EFkQE2rMcf3ISzHc3EYU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21691927/vpavic_4113_20200721_0041.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 4A has an incredible camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lIP45s"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PmYbc8"&gt;The best inexpensive Android phone with the best camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Ea8Tfu"&gt;If you prefer Android, want to spend a little less money, or just want the best camera, then the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice&lt;/a&gt;. It doesn’t have the largest screen or the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android that’s guaranteed to get software updates for at least three years. It only comes in one version: black with 128GB of storage for $349. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KxMxyh"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,500 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special. It means that the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XiTOqY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gMP3dB"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgAIi6"&gt;The Pixel 4A uses Google’s version of Android, which means it’s easy to navigate and free of extra stuff you probably don’t want. More importantly, it means that Google can supply the software updates directly instead of waiting for another manufacturer or carrier to approve it. That puts you first in line for Android updates and also guarantees you’ll get them for three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1EQNFx"&gt;Unfortunately, in three years, it’s quite likely that the Pixel 4A will be on its last legs. Android phones generally don’t last quite as long as iPhones do because Android tends to bog down on older hardware more quickly. The Pixel 4A’s processor is fast enough today to not be a bother, but over time it’s possible that it won’t age well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sbtrpB"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for less than $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bFMC0d"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21337235/oneplus-nord-review-specs-features-camera-performance-battery-life-90hz-screen-oled"&gt;OnePlus Nord&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PWBCf6"&gt;The best all-around Android phone outside the US&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uLYmxs"&gt;Technically, saying the OnePlus Nord costs less than $500 doesn’t make much sense because it’s not available in the US right now. But if you live in a market where it’s available, the OnePlus Nord is the kind of phone that aims for a solid B in every category instead of trying to ace one or two. For £379 / €399, it’s a safe Android bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jllZvZ"&gt;The OnePlus Nord has a couple of features that are normally reserved for much more expensive phones: support for sub-6 5G networks and a high-refresh-rate 90Hz display. If you live in an area where 5G is built out, you may notice faster download speeds. But it’s the display that’ll have a bigger impact on your day-to-day experience. It makes everything feel smoother and better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMIHtL"&gt;You will miss out on wireless charging and a headphone jack with the Nord, but they’re really the only big things that are lacking. Battery life is solid, the 6.44-inch screen is big and beautiful, and the software is less annoying than some competitors (though not as clean as Google’s). The £379 / €399 model comes with 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM, both plenty good for this price point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzsRwZ"&gt;As for cameras, there are a bunch of them — maybe even too many. There’s a standard, an ultrawide, and a macro camera on the back as well as a couple selfie cameras on the front. As is the norm with most smartphone cameras these days, they will get you decent photos in decent light but fall down a bit in the dark. You’ll mostly want to use the main camera, as the ultrawide has a noticeable drop in quality and the macro is only good for, well, macro or close-up shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQiNib"&gt;All too often, phones at this price point have some critical compromise you’re forced to make in order to get the feature you really want. With the OnePlus Nord, there’s no big flaw you’ll have to work around. Again, though, it’s not available in the US. You can import it, but it’s not recommended as it won’t support the right LTE bands.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy A51 has a huge screen and is otherwise a pretty decent phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fHeLLf"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21251569/samsung-galaxy-a51-review-price-screen-camera-battery-life"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A51&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="n49IDp"&gt;The best phone if you want a big screen&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9zHmts"&gt;Samsung’s $399 Galaxy A51 Android phone may well turn out to be the bestselling phone of 2020. Its predecessor, the Galaxy A50, outshone all expectations. For the A51, Samsung focused on nailing a big screen, good battery life, and the camera. It got the screen just right; the other two are just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCBvU5"&gt;The 6.5-inch OLED display on the A51 is bright and vivid, and you’d have to be pretty persnickety to find fault in it. It doesn’t offer the same high refresh rate you can get on the OnePlus Nord, but it makes up for that with Samsung’s great quality. If there’s one weird thing about the screen, it’s that Samsung put a chrome bezel around the hole punch for the front-facing selfie camera. It’s distracting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BPSfp"&gt;The A51 sports nice build quality, though you can definitely feel that it’s plastic on the back. It has a headphone jack and 128GB of storage, which is the number you should be aiming for on any phone these days. Battery life should be superb thanks to a 4,000mAh battery, but because it has to power that big screen, it nets out to being just so-so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ReiNOy"&gt;As is becoming a (weird) standard on this class of phone, the A51 has a regular wide angle, an ultrawide, a depth sensor, and a macro camera. And as is also standard, the regular wide angle will get you the best images. The A51 can’t beat the Pixel 4A for quality, but the different lens options might be more fun for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ot0H0"&gt;Samsung recently committed to providing the A51 with three generations of Android software updates, which is great news. Less great is that it usually takes Samsung longer than you’d like to get software updates out to the A-line of phones. Samsung has also started to junk up its previously elegant OneUI software interface with ads and other junkware, so be prepared to do some cleanup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zZjXl5"&gt;On the whole, though, what the A51 gets you is a very big, very beautiful screen. If that’s your highest priority — and for many people, it is — the A51 is a solid choice.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You probably don’t need 5G yet, but the Google Pixel 4A 5G has other strong benefits.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ARB606"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;Google Pixel 4A 5G&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="L6XTYh"&gt;If you really think you need 5G&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WqKDDc"&gt;If you live in the US, chances are the 5G networks in your area are not going to live up to the high-flying promises carriers have been making. But if you really do think you’d benefit from 5G, the best phone under $500 that supports it is Google’s Pixel 4A 5G. At $499, it comes in just under the wire on our price limit — but the Verizon version costs an extra $100.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbBb7l"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G is good for all the reasons that the Pixel 4A is good: it has a great still camera, solid battery life, and clean Google software. It has some other benefits, though. It uses Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 765G processor, which means it’s faster than the Pixel 4A and nearly all the rest of the sub-$500 Android phones you can find. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8W2PnU"&gt;It also has a larger screen, clocking in at 6.2 inches diagonally. It doesn’t feel too gigantic when you hold it, but you can tell it’s a larger phone. Google chose this size not to give you that bigger screen, but because it needed the extra space to hold all the components and antennas required for 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m13wf6"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G has a slightly better camera system compared to the Pixel 4A, thanks to the inclusion of an ultrawide sensor. Google has also made its excellent Night Sight mode automatic and improved video with some new stabilization modes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ajp1K5"&gt;Otherwise, it follows the standard low-cost Pixel formula. It has a plastic back with fingerprint sensor and a headphone jack. Google doesn’t load down the software with extra crapware you don’t want, but it does include some nice little Google touches like a voice recorder that automatically creates a transcription as it records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K241jf"&gt;Someday, not having 5G will be a serious downside for smartphones, but right now those networks still need to be built out a little bit more. Even if you ignore the potentially faster network speeds, the Pixel 4A 5G is a surprisingly great phone. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Moto G Power has incredible battery life, but the rest of it isn’t so incredible.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pxVQdv"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21222512/moto-g-stylus-power-review-price-features-specs-android-10-camera"&gt;Moto G Power&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pn815f"&gt;The phone with maximum battery life&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uP3407"&gt;Motorola makes a pair of phones that are siblings: the G Stylus and the G Power. The difference between them is right there in the names: the G Stylus comes with a stylus and the G Power has a larger battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3BFGL"&gt;We prefer the G Power because a 5,000mAh battery on a $249 phone is a shockingly good deal. You will, of course, notice a bunch of other compromises in exchange for that huge battery, but if you definitely need a phone that will last, the G Power is your best bet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pvfy9"&gt;The G Power has a 6.4-inch FHD+ display which looks decent, but it unfortunately only has 64GB of storage and 4GB of RAM. You’ll get by on both, but you’ll run into hassles just a bit more quickly than on phones with more. The processor is a Snapdragon 665, which will be enough to run whatever app you want, it just won’t launch it quickly and overall the phone may feel too slow in two or three years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GDBZ93"&gt;As for cameras, the G Power keeps the trend of a main sensor, an ultrawide, and a macro on the back. The main sensor is 16 megapixels and performs much better than the $250 price would lead you to expect. If you’ve used inexpensive Motorola phones before, you’ll likely find that the G Power offers a big step up in picture quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHrfLr"&gt;If you’re very confident you want a stylus, your best bet is to see if you can find a refurbished or gently used Samsung Galaxy Note. It does a much better job providing a software ecosystem of compatible apps for its stylus. If you can’t, the G Stylus pretty much matches what we’ve said about the G Power, just with less battery life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="FvN09U"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21257398/tcl-10-pro-review-release-date-specs-features-camera-screen"&gt;TCL 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aQnAQL"&gt;The phone that looks professional&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="woKhbI"&gt;TCL is probably best known for its televisions, but it has served as the white label manufacturer for smartphones for many years. Now, it’s trying to make a name for itself in smartphones with new, low-cost options like the TCL 10L and the TCL 10 Pro. The Pro is the upgrade pick and retails for $449.90, though you can often find it on sale for less.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CnR7sq"&gt;The 10 Pro looks like it means business. Instead of iridescent colors and big camera bumps, it’s thin, flat, and gray. It has a 6.47-inch display, but overall feels smaller than some phones on this list. You also get a headphone jack and a big, 4,500mAh battery that should get you through a full day without issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ikA6Gl"&gt;The best spec on the 10 Po is its 6GB of RAM, which is plenty for multitasking and should keep your most recent apps from shutting down in the background. There’s the appropriate 128GB of storage, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uQsKq"&gt;The 10 Pro’s understated looks also extend to the Android software, which has a few extra little features but generally tends to stay out of your way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6q4BYj"&gt;As for cameras, they’re somewhat uninspiring: there’s a 64-megapixel main sensor, a 16-megapixel ultrawide, and a 5-megapixel macro. The photos you’ll get have that over-processed look that sometimes makes images look artificial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OWbWI"&gt;Overall, the best thing about the TCL 10 Pro is that it has plenty of RAM for multitasking and a thin shape that isn’t bombastic. If you can find a good deal on one, it’s worth a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SqJJAi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556659"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The best laptop you can buy in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13, Dell XPS 15, HP Elite Dragonfly, Surface Laptop 3, MacBook Pro, and Lenovo Yoga C740. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C554ZjlwY7R1hgqzx9H7bhxKvWA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66770456/VRG_4013_Best_Laptop_Grid.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best laptop for you, from ultraportables to high-powered editing machines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="x1Etox"&gt;The best laptops to buy in 2020 come with a variety of brands, prices, and features. Our current pick for the best laptop of 2020 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221003/dell-xps-13-2020-review-core-i7-specs-features-price"&gt;Dell XPS 13&lt;/a&gt;. Here, we’ve got the rest of the top laptops, business notebooks, gaming rigs, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1 convertibles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNThzL"&gt;We live in a world where smartphones are ubiquitous, tablets are commonplace, and even smartwatches are a thing that people talk about on the regular. But throughout all of these advances, the humble laptop has persevered — and for good reason. When it comes time to work, whether that's editing photos, writing a lot of emails, composing documents, or staying in touch with colleagues and family, we’re here with our top picks to help you find the best laptop for the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31HnuI"&gt;It's getting harder to buy a bad laptop, but what separates the best laptops of 2020 from good laptops is how they balance power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. The top laptop should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad — after all, those are the two biggest reasons you'd choose a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. Its display should be easy on the eyes, bright, and sharp enough that you aren't distracted by jagged edges and visible pixels. It should be powerful enough for most anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. It should be easy to carry around from place to place, and it should be able to last all day without needing to be plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMjpsX"&gt;That’s why the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221003/dell-xps-13-2020-review-core-i7-specs-features-price"&gt;Dell XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; is the best laptop in 2020. It’s a device that does just about everything right. While it’s certainly not a perfect device, there are no major flaws. It’s a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even light gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hnoYs"&gt;In our view, the best laptop for Mac users is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195008/apple-macbook-air-review-2020-new-keyboard-processor-battery-life-camera-price"&gt;MacBook Air (2020)&lt;/a&gt;. Apple fixed the Air’s biggest problem — the keyboard — and upgraded to more modern processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ABV8A"&gt;Our other picks for the best laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1s of 2020 include the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, the MacBook Pro 16, and the HP Elite Dragonfly. Check out the full list of best laptop picks below. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is the best laptop of 2020. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="o08WOA"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21221003/dell-xps-13-2020-review-core-i7-specs-features-price"&gt;Dell XPS 13 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jR28pD"&gt;The best laptop you can buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="9OL54u"&gt;If you’re looking for a laptop that does just about everything right, we recommend Dell’s latest XPS 13. It features a sturdy build, 10th Gen Intel processors with powerful integrated graphics, and a nearly bezel-free 16:10 panel.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xo9G8X"&gt;The display is what you’ll likely notice first. It has a 91.5 percent screen-to-body ratio with a bottom bezel of just 4.6mm. You can configure the XPS with a 1920 x 1200 pixel or 4K display, but the lower-resolution model should be adequate for anyone who’s not doing creative work. It delivers up to 500 nits of brightness (plenty for working in a bright room or even outdoors) and accurate, vivid colors. It’ll also give you significantly better battery life, in addition to the lower cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s28WZ3"&gt;You can customize a number of other specs; the current base model has a Core i5-1035G1, 8GB RAM, a 256GB SSD, and a 1920 x 1200 non-touch display. (There’s allegedly a model with a Core i3 and 4GB RAM floating around, but it’s not currently listed on Dell’s website. You should avoid it if you see it.) We recommend this base model to anyone who just wants to browse; if you plan on gaming or creative work, it’s worth upgrading for more storage and RAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hHTO4Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The latest XPS 13 excels at productivity and even has enough power for light gaming&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P3jXCE"&gt;The Ice Lake processor features Intel’s new Iris Plus integrated graphics, which delivered exceptional performance for an integrated GPU. You’ll still want a discrete graphics card for serious gaming, but you’ll have no problem running lighter fare like &lt;em&gt;Overwatch &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Rocket League. &lt;/em&gt;On those games, it delivers comparable performance to some lower-tier graphics cards, such as Nvidia’s MX150 that came in older versions of the Razer Blade Stealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gioe4U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505833" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_portrait_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eILiSH"&gt;When it comes to the other basics, the XPS beats its competition in just about every way. We got an acceptable seven hours of battery life and even three hours of light gaming. (&lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;was playable for about 85 percent of that time.) The keyboard and touchpad are among the best in their categories as well. And at just 2.8 pounds and 0.58 inches thick, it’s quite portable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbhhcH"&gt;The biggest knock against the XPS 13 is its limited port selection. With just two Thunderbolt 3 ports, a headphone jack, and a microSD slot, it’s getting into MacBook territory (though it does ship with a USB-C to USB-A dongle). The 720p webcam is also pretty terrible, though, in Dell’s defense, it had to squeeze the thing into a 2.25mm top bezel.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jEkaV"&gt;These are legitimate concerns that may drive some users to look elsewhere. But for most users, they won’t be as important as the fundamentals: build quality, keyboard, touchpad, display, and performance. The XPS excels in all of those areas, earning it our top recommendation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnB0cF"&gt;Dell recently released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/28/21456034/dell-xps-13-2in1-2020-features-price-release-date"&gt;new version of the XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; with Intel’s 11th-Gen Tiger Lake processors. It starts at $999. We’ll be reviewing that shortly, and will update this page to let you know how it compares. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="L8pJhA"&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: HP Envy x360 13" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-3n_PDQBp_EOIUDusfA7A_LYGZA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/20069599/mchin_200705_4086_0006.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The HP Envy x360 is the best laptop you can buy for under $1,000.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GKEDzx"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best budget laptop you can buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="f0RP9c"&gt;You don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a laptop that looks and feels premium. The HP Envy x360 2020 is the best budget laptop you can buy, thanks to its sturdy and compact build, chic convertible design, and excellent performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TwdF5"&gt;Part of what makes the Envy so great is that HP has ported over a number of elements from its excellent 2019 flagship, the Spectre x360, including the thin and light chassis, and nearly bezel-free display with an 88 percent screen-to-body ratio. The touchscreen (which supports HP’s MPP2.0 pen) is bright and looks great. (You can choose a 300-nit, 400-nit, or 1,000-nit panel). And HP has added a row of convenient hotkeys to the keyboard, including kill switches for the microphone and webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRbztF"&gt;But the most exciting feature is inside: The new Envy x360 is powered by AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series. The Ryzen 5-4500U in my model did an outstanding job with a fairly heavy load of multitasking. And AMD’s integrated Raedon graphics delivered good gaming performance comparable to what you’d expect from a lower-powered discrete GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MacBook Air is the best laptop for Mac users. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aPQg4I"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195008/apple-macbook-air-review-2020-new-keyboard-processor-battery-life-camera-price"&gt;MacBook Air (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best laptop for Mac users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="TTZ97L"&gt;The 2020 MacBook Air is the best option for most people who prefer the Apple ecosystem. The Air comes with 10th Gen Intel processors (though in a lower power variation than the XPS 13), a sharp Retina display, and a new scissor-switch keyboard. The base configuration (including a Core i3, 8GB RAM, and 256GB storage) comes in under $1,000, but we recommend that you go for, at minimum, the upgraded model with a Core i5 processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t7NICD"&gt;MacBook keyboards have been almost universally maligned for the past few years. But the 2020 Air inherited the new-and-improved keyboard from the latest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features"&gt;16-inch MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which brings back the “inverted T” arrow layout and keys with 1mm of travel. There’s no Touch Bar, but that’s a controversial feature already, and most users should be fine with the standard top row and function keys. It does retain the Touch ID fingerprint scanner for easy logins and payment authentication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bZabCT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The MacBook Air is the default Apple laptop for most people&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vEpmEO"&gt;You can configure the Air with three different Y-series chips, maxing out at a 1.2GHz quad-core Core i7. We had no problem with the 1.1GHz Core i5, though; it handled Chrome, Slack, Zoom, and Lightroom just fine, and had single-threaded Geekbench scores in line with those of the 16-inch MacBook Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcULBm"&gt;Where you might run into trouble is with heavy workloads that need to run for long periods of time, such as rendering graphics or exporting video. We witnessed some thermal throttling in these cases, and clock speeds were capped at less than half of the processor’s boost. That means if you’re doing heavy creative work or other tasks that really push the CPU, you’re likely to experience slowdown and a very loud fan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D7dwP5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505855"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CkuvWk"&gt;The MacBook Air does have a few other significant weaknesses. The primary one is battery life. We got about five hours using a workflow of Chrome, Slack, Zoom, and Lightroom with the screen on maximum brightness. You’ll probably get more juice if you dim the screen and stick with Apple’s apps, but we expect most people will want to keep the brightness high (it only gets up to 400 nits), and third-party programs are necessities for many. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bE7hg5"&gt;Despite those downsides, though, the MacBook Air will serve as a competent and reliable device for most users. It has the excellent design, display, performance, and (finally) keyboard that we expect from Apple. Power users who need the Pro probably know who they are; everyone else should be just fine with the Air. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Best Laptops 2020: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NKgtx_4xZAjnNx7xRifo47bgVlw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19855768/awhite_200319_3954_6.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is a brilliant gaming laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ncv6I8"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;An excellent gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kJ5hNb"&gt;The Zephyrus G14 is an astonishingly powerful gaming laptop for a low price (relative to other notebooks with comparable hardware). It pairs AMD’s new Ryzen 9 4900HS with an Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q GPU and a 120HZ display, and it can run demanding games at their highest settings without a problem. It’s also quite light for such a powerful laptop, weighing just over 3.5 pounds. Its battery life is also impressive for a gaming rig; we got almost nine hours of multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWOpxK"&gt;But you don’t need to be a gamer to appreciate the Zephyrus G14. It’s also a great notebook for business and everyday multitasking with a unique retro design. Plus, the keyboard and touchpad are exceptional and quiet enough not to bother officemates. On the flip side, if you need to use your laptop for videoconferences, the G14 would not be a great choice, as it lacks a webcam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2WSPjS"&gt;A great choice for Mac power users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TfAFYg"&gt;The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the best Apple laptop for power users. Apple dealt with the biggest complaints that people have historically had about MacBook Pros, and if you can stomach the price, there’s not a lot else to complain about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIH5ZZ"&gt;Most importantly, the keyboard is good again. The keys have a full millimeter of travel, and while the typing experience isn’t exceptional, it’s a world away from the maligned butterfly keyboard of MacBooks past. It’s fairly quiet, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjExSY"&gt;This MacBook also features the best sound you’ll find on a laptop. Apple has crammed three speakers into each side, including two woofers. The result is balanced audio with audible bass and great stereo separation. For those who need a laptop that can crank through editing video, working with multiple audio tracks, or processing large batches of photos, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is the king of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="t0EL7n"&gt;A business laptop with solid security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MrOD1p"&gt;If you’re a business professional and money is no object for you or your company, you can’t do better than the HP Elite Dragonfly. The 2020 model is the first Dragonfly that features HP’s super-secure SureView Reflect technology, which tints the screen so that snoops can’t see what you’re doing while you’re working in public. When it’s not tinted, the display gets quite bright (over 700 nits) and has great viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzVcoU"&gt;The new Dragonfly is also the first laptop to include a built-in Tile tracker. That means if you lose the device, you can use the Tile smartphone app to set off an alarm (if it’s in Bluetooth range) or locate it anywhere in the world using Tile’s crowd-finding network. The tracker can work for a limited time even when the laptop is off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXS6n7"&gt;Almost everything else about the Dragonfly is good; it has some of the best battery life of any laptop on the market (we got over 11 hours), a sleek and stunning 2-in-1 design, and an exceptional keyboard. Plus, it incorporates sustainable material, including ocean-bound plastics and recycled DVDs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEHKpz"&gt;The Dragonfly is pricey, and there are cheaper business laptops that will suit the needs of most professionals just fine. But if you’re looking for the best of the best, it’s the unambiguous winner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WpIKDR"&gt;A great budget laptop for kids&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5khaPj"&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is a great convertible laptop for kids, or anyone who wants a reliable secondary driver for browsing and games. It’s a nice-looking, well-made 10-inch device that comes with a detachable keyboard and kickstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV5DZN"&gt;The Duet is tailor-made to be used around the house and on the go, weighing just 2.03 pounds and delivering over 11 hours of battery life. Its MediaTek processor isn’t designed to shoulder heavy loads, but it’s just fine for browsing in a couple tabs, watching Netflix, or playing Android games — it even handles photo editing pretty well. The Duet also features a new “tablet mode” for Chrome OS, which supports an Android-inspired gesture navigation system and a unique Chrome layout optimized for tablet use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiBrWO"&gt;The Chromebook Duet is an absolute steal for its low price, and is the Chromebook to buy if you’re on a tight budget. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Razer Blade Pro 17 is a powerful gaming laptop with few compromises.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="g8zMV8"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sky6IZ"&gt;The best portable gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="S5SM7Z"&gt;Usually, if you want a 17-inch laptop that can pull playable frame rates out of today’s most demanding games, you’d expect some compromises on portability and design. Notebooks of this size often weigh north of seven pounds and require multiple power bricks to charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whz2V3"&gt;But while the Blade Pro 17 doesn’t have quite the gaming chops of some bulky desktop replacements, it makes up for that by sporting the compact and attractive design that’s a trademark of the Razer Blade line. At just over six pounds, it’s not too difficult to move around (as 17-inch workstations go). You get an RTX GPU (up to Nvidia’s 2080 Super Max-Q) an eight-core CPU (Intel’s Core i7-10875H) and either a 300Hz screen or a 120Hz touchscreen. There’s even an RGB keyboard with color effects tailored to the game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Spectre x360 is our favorite convertible laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZGYHSb"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21022770/hp-spectre-x360-13-2019-laptop-2-in-1-convertible-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Spectre x360 13 (late 2019)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ff7WtW"&gt;Our favorite 2-in-1 laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BGSdq5"&gt;The Spectre x360 is a premium-level 2-in-1 Windows laptop with the latest processor options from Intel, a vibrant touchscreen, and more port options than are found on other laptops in this segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bL9pqG"&gt;The x360 weighs less than three pounds and is about two-thirds of an inch thick when closed, which makes it very easy to travel with. The latest model has a smaller footprint than before, thanks to shrunken bezels above and below the screen, but it still maintains a full-size keyboard and spacious trackpad. In addition, it provides both facial and fingerprint biometric authentication, so you can choose which way you prefer to log in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxQyU1"&gt;HP updated the trackpad drivers it uses in the latest model to Microsoft’s Precision set and the experience is improved over the older versions to the point where it’s no longer an issue. The x360’s trackpad is now right up there with the best Windows trackpad options (which are still a tick behind what you get on a MacBook) in terms of scrolling, multifinger gestures, and palm rejection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msO0V8"&gt;The biggest argument against the x360 is that it has a 16:9 display, as opposed to the 16:10 or 3:2 screens you’ll find on Dell or Microsoft’s computers. Those taller aspect ratios are much better for productivity work, whether that’s working in two documents side by side or researching on the web without having to scroll as much. But unless you are very particular about your screen’s aspect ratio, most people won’t find this to be a deal-breaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best MacBook Pro for everyday users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XYBklz"&gt;If you’re looking for a MacBook that’s more powerful than the Air, but isn’t as pricey as the 16-inch Pro, the MacBook Pro 13 hits the sweet spot in the middle. It has a bright 500-nit screen, excellent speakers and — finally — a keyboard that’s actually reliable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fGeBR6"&gt;There are two models you can consider depending on your needs: the “base” model has 8th-Gen Intel processors and two Thunderbolt 3 processors, while the pricier version has 10th-Gen processors and four Thunderbolt 3 ports (as well as 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD). If you can afford it, we recommend stepping up to the pricier version, as the performance difference between the two generations is noticeable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="D6FnVC"&gt;The best Chromebook of 2020&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="me0TJU"&gt;For high school and college students, or anyone else who needs an affordable, portable machine, a Chromebook can be a great option. Though it’s not the cheapest model available, Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 offers top-notch performance at a lower price than many competing Chromebooks (and other laptops). It can be equipped with a Core i3, Core i5, or Core i7 — the i5 model we tested handled a heavy multitasking load without any slowdown, heat, or noise. Add all-day battery life, an excellent keyboard, and a generous port selection that includes a full-size HDMI, and there’s very little not to like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dip68g"&gt;But where the 713 really shines is its display. The 3:2 gives you extra space for comfortable multitasking, and the sharp panel delivers a really excellent picture — I actually preferred it to my MacBook Pro’s screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0Lk4Q"&gt;Between its standout performance, peripherals, and portability, this is really the Chromebook to beat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lyHJR1"&gt;A great laptop for creative work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4221H3"&gt;The Gigabyte Aero 15 is a colorful, powerful laptop for creative professionals. This 15.6-inch workstation pairs a bright OLED screen with an eight-core i7-10875H processor and Nvidia’s cutting-edge GeForce RTX 2070 Super Max-Q GPU. It also comes with a laundry list of ports, including a full SD-card slot, so you’ll be able to plug in all kinds of projectors, monitors, and other equipment without a problem. We also found that it was able to run demanding games on their highest settings at acceptable frame rates, and export 4K video as fast as any other laptop we’ve tested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dh2pBE"&gt;This is an expensive machine, and if you just want to play games, it’s probably not worth spending so much money on an OLED screen. But if you need the combination of the high resolution and the high-powered specs, the Aero 15 is for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gDadWS"&gt;A great laptop for video editing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uBbGA0"&gt;You can configure the XPS 15 with up to an eight-core Core i7 processor, Nvidia’s GTX 1650 Ti graphics, and a 3840 x 2400 touchscreen. Those specs are overkill for most people, but they’re ideal for anyone who needs to edit video or do other heavy creative work with Adobe Premiere. We recommend that anyone who’s just browsing and streaming go for the 1920 x 1200 screen and a Core i5, which will save you significant money. (We also experienced some heat management issues and disappointing battery life with the i7 unit.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lMPwHh"&gt;The XPS 15 isn’t a serious gaming rig, but the GTX 1650 Ti can help out with creative tasks. Our model was able to export a five-minute, 33-second video in Adobe Premiere Pro in just four and a half minutes — which is faster than we got with the 16-inch MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7VtZD"&gt;If you’re looking for a large, attractive Windows laptop that packs decent power, this is the one for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bETnOf"&gt;The best affordable gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HVIMz4"&gt;AMD rewrote the rules of gaming laptops with its debut in the Zephyrus G14, but it’s made a splash in the budget gaming range as well with the G5 15 SE. This laptop ran every popular title we threw at it at very playable frame rates — and the games looked great on our model’s 144Hz FreeSync screen. (You can choose a 60Hz panel as well). The Radeon RX 5600M GPU gets a boost from AMD’s SmartShift feature, which pushes power between the CPU and GPU depending on where it’s needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpPFDl"&gt;For times when you’re not gaming, the G5 also makes a good daily driver. It does a great job with graphically intensive work as well as general multitasking, and the fans stayed quiet throughout our testing. And there’s a better port selection than we’d generally expect to see at this price point, including an SD card reader, an audio jack, two USB 2.0 Type-A, a Mini DisplayPort, HDMi 2.0, a USB 3.2 Gen 1, an Ethernet, and a USB-C with DisplayPort. Ultimately, the G5 15 SE delivers outstanding performance for its price, and is the budget gaming rig to beat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;The 17-inch laptop to buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="GAaGi6"&gt;The XPS 17 is a workstation for professionals who need a huge screen and huge power. Its 17-inch 3840 x 2400 display allows you room to comfortably work in multiple tabs and apps, and it’s also bright enough to use for outdoor work without much obtrusive glare. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LEG0dl"&gt;It contains H-series Intel processors, and can be configured with discrete RTX GPUs — our model had an RTX 2060 Max Q. That system flew through gaming benchmarks and complex video work — and didn’t burn itself up in the process, thanks to a new cooling system from Dell that includes a chassis-wide vapor chamber. Best of all, those specs and screen manage to function without decimating the XPS’s battery life; our unit (with a 97Wh brick) was able to last a full work day. &lt;/p&gt;
