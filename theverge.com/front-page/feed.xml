    <title>Bose QuietComfort Earbuds review: noise-canceling champion</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Good sound quality and best-in-class noise cancellation come in an awkwardly big case&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="AWRAyO"&gt;Bose’s original true wireless earbuds, the SoundSport Free, sounded fantastic but were foiled by connectivity problems and audio / video sync issues that the company never fully resolved. They also lacked active noise cancellation, which is the feature that Bose built its entire brand around. This allowed Apple, Sony, and others to seize the market with products like the AirPods Pro and WF-1000XM3 earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWYsbq"&gt;But Bose is tired of ceding ground to its competitors, and it’s returned with the QuietComfort Earbuds. Thanks to their completely redone design, the QuietComfort Earbuds are free from the frustrations that came with the SoundSport Free buds. They still sound terrific — and now, they’ve got ANC. It took Bose a while to get here, but the QuietComfort Earbuds deliver the best noise cancellation you can get in true wireless earbuds right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KAf2tu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:9517646"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rpuVm8"&gt;The big question is how much that’s worth to you. At $279, the QuietComfort Earbuds are a $30 increase over the AirPods Pro and in striking distance of Sennheiser’s $300 Momentum True Wireless 2. And while Bose has avoided any inherent flaws with the earbuds themselves, there are still minor annoyances like an awkwardly large carrying case and limited onboard controls that lack much customization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4EAQJY"&gt;At 0.3 ounces (8.5 grams) each, the QuietComfort Earbuds weigh about the same as Sony’s 1000XM3 buds in the ear, but the AirPods Pro (0.19 ounces, 5.4 grams) have them beat for all-day comfort. Bose’s earbuds are also larger than the AirPods Pro in every dimension and stick out further from the ear — though not to the same silly degree as the SoundSport Free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds next to the Apple AirPods Pro." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xp7wo8Nybo4rSmbfEqlbLFJPvFc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21946558/IMG_0719-1.0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro are smaller and lighter than the QuietComfort Earbuds, but their noise cancellation isn’t as good.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qshKMy"&gt;But even if they’re not the most discreet or svelte, the QuietComfort Earbuds still feel very good in my ears, thanks to Bose’s StayHear Max ear tips, which have an integrated, flexible silicone wing that tucks into the ridge of the ear for added stability. Both the medium and large-sized ear tips worked for me and created a tight seal, but I ultimately found that mixing the two led to the best extended comfort. (There’s a reason manufacturers suggest trying that!) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXxTDN"&gt;Once they’re in place, the QuietComfort Earbuds aren’t going anywhere, and I’d be confident taking them for a run or through an intense gym routine. They’re rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance, so sweat and the occasional splash of water should be fine, but avoid rainstorms. One thing worth mentioning is the occlusion effect; since Bose didn’t go for a vented design like the AirPods Pro or Pixel Buds with natural airflow, if you have a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; tight seal with the QuietComfort Earbuds in, your inside voice might sound louder than normal, and in silent environments, you can hear yourself breathing. I noticed this when I first started using them, but it’s since gone away — either because the fit changed slightly or I’ve gotten used to it. Some people are more sensitive to this stuff than others. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds case next to cases for the AirPods, Pixel Buds, Powerbeats Pro, and Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 2." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m28qW_kthuHo3SjzMrnXmG3-1Ww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21946564/IMG_0725-1.0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bose’s case is substantially thicker than charging cases for many other true wireless earbuds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZWYmqh"&gt;The charging case for the QuietComfort Earbuds is… &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt;. It’s nowhere near as compact as the AirPods Pro case or the cases for Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus or Google’s Pixel Buds. (The aforementioned Sennheisers also win out here.) I realize this is mostly due to the Bose earbuds’ larger size, but it still makes for an awkward bulge in whatever pants pocket you put them in. The case’s chonk factor isn’t a deal-breaker for me, as I always have a backpack with me for stowing it in. But at twice the thickness of an AirPods case, it could be for some. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eBDBKg"&gt;Opening the case is more of a process than usual since Bose put in a latch that you’ve got to release by pressing the button on front. This takes firmer pressure than expected and can get annoying at times. On the plus side, you won’t have to worry about your pricey earbuds skittering across the floor if you drop the case. The front of the case has five LEDs to indicate battery charge level; Bose estimates up to six hours of continuous listening time for the earbuds themselves, plus two additional charges from the case. Those numbers are all very par for the course. The case supports wireless charging and has a USB-C port if you prefer to plug in for faster top-offs. (Fifteen minutes of charging can give you two hours of playback time.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fHFzFF"&gt;Bose retakes the noise cancellation crown&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="SYmldI"&gt;The audio quality and noise cancellation of the QuietComfort Earbuds easily outweigh the headaches from dealing with their awkward case. Bose has taken a noticeable lead over competitors and is nearing the noise cancellation effectiveness of full-size headphones. Instead of a simple on / off toggle like the AirPods Pro, Bose lets you choose between 10 levels of noise canceling. At 10, these earbuds do an astonishing job of hushing the world around you — better than Apple, Sony, and other competitors. Street noise just fades away; the constant hum of an air conditioner or the whir of a fan all but disappears. I’m not traveling much by plane at the moment, but I’m certain these would do a better job at muting cabin noise than other earbuds. You can even use the QuietComfort Earbuds in noise-canceling mode even when there’s no audio playing if you’re just looking for some peace and quiet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Bose QuietComfort Earbuds on a table beside the carrying case." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GX7Eavn5STJHPP8dHUF-M_SfkR8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21946562/IMG_0722-1.0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ear tips have an integrated silicone fin for added stability.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="QqXfoe"&gt;On the opposite end, dropping down to zero puts the earbuds into full transparency / ambient mode. Bose has managed to tie Apple at making it &lt;em&gt;almost&lt;/em&gt; feel like you’re not wearing earbuds at all. The transparency mode on the QuietComfort Earbuds sounds incredibly natural and will appeal to people who want a better sense of their surroundings when outside. When you take out either earbud, the one in your other ear automatically goes into full transparency — since Bose figures you’re probably trying to hear something. (Music also automatically pauses when an earbud is removed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7472BI"&gt;You can double tap on the left earbud to switch between three “favorite” levels of noise cancellation. The defaults are 10, 5, and zero. I didn’t see any need to switch those up, but you can set them to whatever you want in the Bose Music app. Bose also lets you choose your preferred action for a long-press of the left bud: it can either announce battery status or skip to the next song. Unfortunately, that’s where customization of the controls end. These are the controls you’re left with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="mCG8Zc"&gt;Double tap on the right earbud to play or pause audio / answer a phone call&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7KcPih"&gt;Touch and hold the right earbud to activate Siri or Google Assistant / decline a phone call&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wlVhTx"&gt;Double tap on the left earbud to switch between noise cancellation presets&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qgtl4g"&gt;Long press on the left earbud to check battery level or skip to the next song&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BoxATS"&gt;Swipe up or down on the right earbud to increase or lower volume&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="A5dZKh"&gt;Bose introduced the onboard volume controls a couple months after the QuietComfort Earbuds originally shipped, and you’ve got to enable them in the Bose Music app before you can use them — otherwise nothing will happen. I haven’t had any problems with the swipes to adjust loudness, so it’s a nice addition. There’s still no way of going back to the last song with the earbud controls, however. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds pictured worn in a person’s right ear." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CZLiRPQ8WlHTi_Dg75ZbCnB_Os4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21946555/IMG_0717-1.0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The QuietComfort Earbuds don’t stick out of your ear as far as Bose’s previous SoundSport Free.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0iMseF"&gt;In my time testing the QuietComfort Earbuds, connection stability between the buds and my phone has been mostly flawless. Maybe that’s the result of upgrading to Bluetooth 5.1 or other internal changes, but either way, it’s a major improvement over the SoundSport Free, which suffered frequent audio dropouts. That’s not a concern this time around. Nor did I notice any audio / video sync mismatches when watching content from YouTube, Netflix, or Prime Video on my phone and laptop. Bose has successfully tackled the main flaws of its original true wireless earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="G6Rq2L"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9517686"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="46EVb1"&gt;Sound quality is still top notch. Bose isn’t shy about sculpting the audio; the company’s Active EQ boosts low and high frequencies at lower volumes so that music still feels dynamic even when you’re not cranking it. The QuietComfort Earbuds are very bass-forward and pack a wallop for hip-hop and EDM tracks. But the powerful low end also translates well to other genres. To my ears, these have a wider, richer soundstage than the competition (perhaps with the exception of Sennheiser). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A close-up photo of the ear tips for Bose’s QuietComfort Earbuds." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CiGkcHYKo8zt8mG5oB4QAfbxu_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21946556/IMG_0718-1.0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Three sizes of ear tips come in the box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A close-up photo of the microphones on the Bose QuietComfort Earbuds." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ilaZtseGmb2hV2Ryhgp-Ql0o_a4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21946557/IMG_0726-1.0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An array of microphones help the QuietComfort Earbuds pull off their fantastic noise cancellation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wnyHnq"&gt;Regardless of what genre you’re playing, the highs are detailed without ever coming off as harsh or shrill. Unfortunately, Bose’s app doesn’t offer any way to adjust the EQ for people who don’t love the default sound signature. Custom EQ is an option on the over-ear Noise Canceling Headphones 700, so it’s a bummer not to see it on these premium earbuds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aO9YEh"&gt;The QuietComfort Buds also handle voice calls well. They have a “self voice” feature that lets you adjust how much you can hear your own voice on a call so you don’t end up speaking too loudly, and they do a nice job of picking up your voice and reducing background noise so that others can clearly hear you. Only the right earbud can be used standalone for calls and audio.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7-vCgZO9eA3I4L0V5utP4EF7-oQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21946563/IMG_0723-1.0.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The case provides two additional charges (12 hours) of battery life.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GSG9Pk"&gt;Unfortunately, Bose didn’t include multipoint in these earbuds, so they can only pair with one device at a time. Simultaneous pairing is still rare for earbuds — and a unique strength for Jabra — but when you consider that Apple’s AirPods Pro can now automatically and instantly switch between Apple devices, the QuietComfort Earbuds definitely take a usability hit. Multipoint is a longtime feature on Bose’s headphones, but for whatever reason, the company’s engineers couldn’t make it work here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="qSCLN7"&gt;So yes, Bose’s new, almost-$300 QuietComfort Earbuds still have downsides. The earbuds are on the larger side, and their case is an absolute unit. They lack multipoint. But there’s also plenty of good: Bose has leap-frogged everyone in noise cancellation (establishing itself as a leader once again) and come up with great-sounding earbuds that work reliably. Once the world is back to office life and boarding planes regularly, I think that’ll be a compelling combo — assuming you’re not already carrying around a pair of AirPods Pro or Sony 1000XM3s, that is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L0dNC7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 7th 2:30PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The review has been updated to reflect the new onboard volume controls that Bose added to the QuietComfort Earbuds after their release. The overall score remains unchanged. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tK0LbEtEShHQh97Hs1ENU1d_fQg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66899976/bking_200322_3945_0023.5.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E6t41"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the most affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Sometimes, there just isn’t a deal happening. In that case, we’ve mentioned how much the most recent sale price was for, so you know when to take the plunge. But most of the time, there’s some sort of deal going on, be it on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think is worth telling you about, you’ll find it mentioned with any and all context you need to hear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLLRFN"&gt;If you need a little help figuring out exactly which iPad is best for you, we’ve got you covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21280856/apple-ipad-mini-air-pro-comparison-how-to-choose"&gt;with a comparison post featuring all of the latest models here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;This is Apple’s most affordable iPad, usually costing $329 for the tablet with 32GB of storage or $429 for the 128GB model. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="T559mJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The new 2020 iPad isn’t enough for Zoom school","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;Right now, Amazon and Best Buy have a ton of deals on Apple’s most affordable tablet. You can buy the base model, which includes 32GB of storage and supports WiFi only for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J65DST5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$299 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725891876032187286" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEPjki"&gt;If you want more storage, you can get the 128GB of storage model for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J61NFNR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$380 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725892081629772202" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released a new iPad mini in early 2019, carrying forth the same 7.9-inch display and design from previous iterations with refreshed internal specs within. It has the A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad. Apple makes a 64GB and 256GB model of the iPad mini with Wi-Fi support, set at $400 and $500, respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $530.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The 2020 iPad Air has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to last year’s 10.5-inch display and features thinner bezels around the display and has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, which is located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="u6ZCyC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple iPad Air 2019 review: happy medium","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18282956/apple-ipad-air-2019-review-ios-features-specs-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;Like its predecessor, this year’s iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. However, the model that also supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fzykEb"&gt;If you’re looking for the latest iPad model, B&amp;amp;H Photo has select colors on sale. You can get the 64GB configuration in &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594485-REG%2Fapple_myfn2ll_a_10_9_ipad_air_wi_fi.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Silver for only $569&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1594484-REG%2Fapple_myfm2ll_a_10_9_ipad_airwi_fi_64gb.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Space Gray model for $579&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="oBFocq"&gt;If you don’t mind the last generation model, Best Buy is discounting the 3rd Gen 2019 iPad Air by &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724958762425958680" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$70 off for the 64GB model&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $430.

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VbsKiA"&gt;Apple’s 2020 iteration of the iPad Pro looks a lot like the one that came in 2018, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less-expensive models, this one ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of Lightning. It also has Face ID to unlock instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor and has a high refresh display. The iPad Pro has the most stacked spec sheet of Apple’s entire iPad lineup, and that comes through in the price. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Master Chief is a DJ cat in Taika Waititi’s Xbox short film</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K930kUXqXXNlcfcz9Msi3bdXKio=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68471878/Screen_Shot_2020_12_07_at_9.47.26_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uewjAM"&gt;Microsoft’s marketing tagline for the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S is “Power Your Dreams,” and the &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/dQldgaMtdNg"&gt;newest Xbox ad&lt;/a&gt;, a short film by &lt;em&gt;Thor: Ragnarok&lt;/em&gt; director Taika Waititi, takes the tagline to a whole new level.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZewOep"&gt;The ad takes place in a “dream incubation lab,” where a woman plays an Xbox Series X before being guided into a dream state. She then explains her dreams, featuring things like a neon-outlined bunny hopping through a forest and a flying whale in space, all of which appear on-screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMWBVn"&gt;That’s pretty standard dream stuff, if you ask me. But eventually, the woman dreams that a giant Master Chief in space DJs using an entire &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; ring. That would be enough to solidify this as a pretty odd commercial, but the woman then reveals that Master Chief is, in fact, a cat, and then cat-Chief takes off his helmet and starts dancing. I can’t say I’ve ever dreamed anything quite like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JeFtCc"&gt;If you ask me, though, the ad fits right in with some of the others Microsoft has used to help promote its new consoles. One, released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21508979/microsoft-xbox-series-x-tv-commercial-ad-marketing-campaign-power-your-dreams"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;, featured actor Daniel Kaluuya flying through ever-changing virtual worlds. The company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150065/microsoft-holiday-2020-commercial-dogs-halo-minecraft-flight-simulator"&gt;holiday commercial&lt;/a&gt; features dogs dreaming that they are dropping grenades at Master Chief’s feet and playing &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; together. Maybe Master Chief actually being a DJ cat isn’t so weird after all. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s latest Pixel feature drop adds even more battery optimizations and Adaptive Sound</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Pixel 5 (top) and the Pixel 4A 5G (bottom)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y7UHP-04rqgeqYRjUjrzUYv_jBI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68471519/akrales_201012_4137_0010.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AcS1vl"&gt;Google’s latest Pixel feature drop, where the company brings a slew of new software tricks to its smartphone lineup, is being announced today. Alongside some brand-new functionality like Adaptive Sound, which “improves the sound quality of your phone speaker based on your surroundings,” the December drop is also bringing many of the latest software features from the Pixel 5, 4A 5G, and 4A to older devices; Google says the Pixel 3 and newer will be included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNJH7E"&gt;That means features like Hold for Me, where the Google Assistant waits for a real person to hop on the customer support line instead of making &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; do it, and others like Extreme Battery Saver mode and screen sharing on Duo calls will soon hit older devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ARbAYt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google Pixel 5 review: new phone, old tricks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"},{"title":"Google Pixel 4A 5G review: more than just a bigger budget phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"},{"title":"Google Pixel 4A review: back to basics for $349","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="dtU84j"&gt;Extreme Battery Saver seemed like an over-correction from the company after last year’s Pixel 4 and 4 XL got average (at best) battery life; this year’s Pixels all have great endurance, and most people will never need to consider using it. But Extreme Battery Saver, which “only runs the essentials so your battery lasts as long as possible,” definitely makes more sense on those Pixel 4, 3A, and 3 devices as their batteries continue to age.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6j1UgesFZc6r1gsvVGXom5LZq90=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150452/Screen_Shot_2020_12_07_at_9.44.50_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The helpful Hold for Me feature from the 2020 Pixel lineup is coming to older models.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cZHbVt"&gt;Several Pixel phones receiving this feature drop will be getting a new feature to preserve the battery’s long-term health: Adaptive Charging. Similar to the implementations we’ve seen from other smartphone makers, Google says Adaptive Charging “helps preserve battery health over time by dynamically controlling how quickly a Pixel device charges” when plugged in overnight. This is coming to Pixels 4 and newer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tg9PIM"&gt;And the company’s first 5G-capable phones, the Pixel 5 and 4A 5G, will now default to using 4G for simple tasks like web browsing and texting, but they will flip on the 5G connection for streaming movies or watching large files. That sounds familiar to the system Apple has in place for the iPhone 12 series, though Google notes this “Adaptive Connectivity” feature isn't available on all carriers or for all apps. Like in Apple’s case, you’ll be able to turn it off if you prefer full 5G speeds at all times when there’s a signal. (Google also says the GPS accuracy on the Pixel 5 and 4A 5G is improved after this update.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VU0O4lDZi0rXXGRmwUJXfS490Ag=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150428/E805_PhotosGifs_Video01_v03_Twitter.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel phones are first to get new suggestions in Google Photos to enhance sky photos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MzoRCL"&gt;Pixel owners will also find new suggestions in Google Photos, including “Dynamic, which enhances brightness, contrast and color, and a set of sky suggestions, which help you create stunning sunset and sunrise images in just one tap.” For now, it sounds like those options are Pixel-exclusive. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SxyllSTKCjmLBYRCWU0OMrKhq-E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150462/Screen_Shot_2020_12_07_at_9.47.07_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adaptive sound uses your Pixel’s microphone to tune the speaker quality for whatever room you’re in.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UdKYcS"&gt;As for that interesting Adaptive Sound trick, which seems like an attempt to improve the Pixel 5’s mediocre speaker output, it “uses the microphone to assess the acoustics near you, then adjusts the sound equalizer settings in certain apps.” So the phone will tune audio differently in your bathroom compared to the bedroom. Consider me skeptical that this will fix one of the Pixel 5’s few hardware downsides, but we’ll see. Google notes that “all microphone data” recorded for speaker optimization is deleted shortly after being recorded, and the company says this feature always runs locally on your device and doesn’t send any audio to the cloud. Adaptive Sound is only coming to the Pixel 5 and 4A 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bPL6i"&gt;And last, the home screen on Pixel phones is getting more customizable with this update. You’ll be able to choose “new icons, grid views, and app shapes” as seen below.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fmZx2qlPpi0V3tZHLUNde5Ip8oY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150418/Screenshot_20201204_161411.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The home screen on Pixels is getting more customizable.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AERqDf"&gt;All of this, plus smaller stuff like the option to export the Pixel’s “Now Playing” automatic music recognition to a YouTube Music playlist, will roll out as part of the December feature drop beginning today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Co9i8F"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction December 7th, 2:40PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The article original stated that the Pixel 3A and newer would receive the new Adaptive Charging feature. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/87395744"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s table on this page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; clarifies that it’s only coming to the Pixel 4 and newer. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GTA Online is getting an underground nightclub featuring real-world resident DJs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RE4qKAWWBjBLfcifoL147Ba2MLM=/0x126:1080x846/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68471157/GTA_Online___12_7_2020___The_Music_Locker___Moodymann.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Rockstar Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="heSwTZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto Online &lt;/em&gt;is soon getting its own concert venue with the planned opening of The Music Locker, an underground nightclub that will feature real-world DJs in residence. The &lt;a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/61822/the-music-locker-the-underground-club-for-everyone"&gt;announcement on Monday&lt;/a&gt; means developer Rockstar Games is taking cues from other savvy multiplayer games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Roblox. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfF7MM"&gt;Those games and many others in the online social scene have begun transforming their virtual spaces into entertainment destinations that, amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, have become vital ways to fill the gap left by the lack of live music and other real-world events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ifVqfp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rockstar is following ‘Fortnite’ and ‘Roblox’ in turning its online virtual world into a live music space&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hQcYgQ"&gt;Epic’s approach with &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;has been to book big-name acts in electronic music and hip-hop, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/1/21244874/fortnite-diplo-concert-jordan-fisher-party-royale"&gt;Diplo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt;, to perform surreal sets on its virtual island, all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21423004/fortnite-party-royale-concert-series-dominic-fike"&gt;as part of its new Party Royale mode&lt;/a&gt;. But Rockstar is aiming for a more realistic approach grounded in the real-world underground electronic music scene. The developer is designing The Music Locker like a venue you might actually attend in real life, located beneath The Diamond in-game casino and resort in its fictionalized version of Los Angeles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9INE8C"&gt;The Music Locker has also secured iconic names in DJing like Detroit-based producer Moodymann and Berlin collective Keinemusik to be its first artists in residence, each seemingly getting their own custom &lt;em&gt;GTA Online &lt;/em&gt;avatars. Rockstar will even let you enjoy high-roller status with VIP perks you can only obtain if you’ve purchased a penthouse suite at The Diamond. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M8o_1mE6i1fMnfCGfWd-pRJk-Tw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150859/GTA_Online___12_7_2020___The_Music_Locker___Club.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Rockstar Games&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Gchfbm"&gt;This isn’t a big departure for the &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt; franchise. The open-world crime series has always secured high-profile artists for its in-game radio stations. One of its most prominent additions to 2013’s &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V &lt;/em&gt;was producer Flying Lotus, who was given his own radio station (FlyLo FM) and the liberty to curate his own track list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NhoNfe"&gt;But given the current environment around events and entertainment, it makes sense Rockstar would want to find ways to give fans of &lt;em&gt;GTA Online &lt;/em&gt;a way to experience at least some of the sensations of live music. And it’s also doing so in a way that gives artists a chance to perform again, specifically DJs and producers (and not just huge mainstream ones) who have been hit hard by the complete evaporation of real-world nightlife during the coronavirus pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="10NpM3"&gt;Google Stadia is expanding internationally, adding eight more countries in Europe today. The new markets include Austria, Czechia, Hungary, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, and Switzerland, bringing the total number of countries the cloud gaming service supports from 14 to 22. The service should be available in the newly added locations within the next 24 hours, and Google says you just need a Gmail address to sign up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kWoouB"&gt;Stadia just celebrated its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575100/google-stadia-one-year-anniversary-cloud-gaming-cyberpunk-2077-launch-test"&gt;anniversary last month&lt;/a&gt; with a slew of new announcements, including the addition of its first two free-to-play games (&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Super Bomberman R Online&lt;/em&gt;) and its plans to introduce an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21571908/google-stadia-apple-ios-iphone-web-app-testing-safari-cloud-gaming"&gt;iOS version of Stadia delivered via mobile Safari&lt;/a&gt; in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OxzCHJ"&gt;Google is now gearing up for its biggest game launch ever: CD Projekt Red’s &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; arriving on consoles, PC, and Stadia simultaneously on December 10th. The company is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2020/11/19/21572301/cyberpunk-2077-google-stadia-free-premiere-kit-preorder-deal"&gt;running a limited promotion&lt;/a&gt; that gives users who preorder the game (or buy it within its first week) a free Stadia Premiere Edition, which includes a Google Chromecast Ultra and Stadia controller. With new next-gen consoles out from Microsoft and Sony, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; will be a big test for Stadia’s viability as a PlayStation and Xbox alternative. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyberpunk 2077 is huge, ambitious, and safe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A Night City too big to get weird&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="GbykyP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Night City was like a deranged experiment in social Darwinism, designed by a bored researcher who kept one thumb permanently on the fast-forward button.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3F82W5"&gt;That line, from William Gibson’s 1984 novel &lt;em&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/em&gt;, helped define the genre now known as cyberpunk. The book conjures a world where today’s cutting-edge trends are tomorrow’s embarrassing cliches and where desperate hustlers can rise overnight and fade without a trace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5iNjDR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, the long-awaited game by &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; studio CD Projekt Red, is about a place called Night City. But in its version, the past is never far away. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/2012/6/12/3080660/cyberpunk-2020-getting-not-just-a-video-game-but-a-new-tabletop-game"&gt;announced in 2012&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s based on a tabletop series that launched in 1988. After years of work and &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/4/21575914/cyberpunk-2077-release-crunch-labor-delays-cd-projekt-red"&gt;reportedly months&lt;/a&gt; of brutal crunch time, CD Projekt Red has delivered on an incredibly ambitious vision: a vast virtual city with a complex narrative and roleplaying system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Z7NqF"&gt;It’s done that by playing all those elements extremely safe and straight. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; is a frequently satisfying and sometimes impressive game, but despite its setting in the fast-moving future, it’s almost never a surprising one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div id="C5B4sn"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BO8lX3hDU30?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="10GwJi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;takes place in the eponymous year 2077 and the aforementioned Night City, a California megalopolis where interlocking freeways thread between skyscrapers and street markets. (Imagine Los Angeles with mile-high holo-billboards and pedestrian-friendly urban planning.) Following a de facto breakup of America, this failed urban utopia has become an autonomous zone dominated by gangs and multinational corporations. Every street-level surface has been plastered with sexed-up ads and nihilistic graffiti, while the ultra-rich have retreated into cavernous hotels and apartments with a literally gilded servant class. Most citizens are disposable, and all bodies are malleable, ripe for dramatic cybernetic modding that blends flesh with chrome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mu0RZr"&gt;Your protagonist is a mercenary named V, hailing from one of three possible backgrounds: 2077’s small corporate overclass, Night City’s teeming slums, or the nomadic groups outside the city. My V was a neon-haired corporate raider, for instance, and got a short origin-story mission about being dragged into a bloody interdepartmental conflict. After this introduction, V becomes one of countless freelancers drifting through Night City’s demimonde. Then they join a heist arranged by a flinty femme fatale, and naturally, the job falls apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="6450Ae"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Sexed-up billboards, nihilistic graffiti, and a literally gilded service class&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mwffiN"&gt;V witnesses a cold-blooded crime by one of Night City’s biggest power players. In the ensuing chaos and coverup, they end up with a piece of dangerous experimental technology. They also resurrect the digital ghost of a Night City legend: metal-armed punk rocker terrorist Johnny Silverhand, voiced by Keanu Reeves. While suffering Johnny’s cynical quips and frustrated outbursts, they have to figure out who built the tech and how to stop its deadly effects, appealing to criminals and corporate loyalists who will all but inevitably stab them in the back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3fEjPQ"&gt;This is just one thread in a narrative that’s big even by the standard of most open-world games. I finished &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; in 40 hours, which covered most of the major side missions and a fair amount of cruising around Night City, but left a lot of smaller tasks undone. Every neighborhood is packed with jobs to discover, conversations to overhear, and random crimes to stop. As you get more powerful, local fixers and crime bosses start reaching out for help. (They also keep trying to sell you secondhand cars, which, frankly, seems like something a decent capo should delegate.) Beyond the divergent opening missions, you’ll find a couple of major endgame story branches, depending on where you place your loyalties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A Night City overhead view in Cyberpunk 2077" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YrjuV8r1c7AYh_6FrfObA7rMvm4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150423/Cyberpunk2077_Above_it_all_RGB.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QooZmf"&gt;Looking at &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077’s&lt;/em&gt; map is an overwhelming experience, with waypoint icons packed so tight that selecting any given item requires zooming in. But the game does a great job of spinning extended side arcs from a few core missions. After its calamitous first act, you’re given multiple leads that can advance the main goal. Tracking them down requires cutting deals with new characters and contacting the heist’s other participants. These partners ask for help with their own problems, which might continue a subplot from the main story or open the door to a fresh Night City subculture. You’ll find a lot of quick one-off gigs, but also several optional sections that feel key to V and Johnny’s saga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eNzHwm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Modern cyberpunk is both a broad vibe and a specific retro-future setting&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yuu92A"&gt;Unfortunately, much of this saga feels extremely rote. In the way that &lt;em&gt;Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons&lt;/em&gt; codified Tolkienesque fantasy, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; distills the most recognizable elements from influential fiction like &lt;em&gt;Blade Runner&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Neuromancer&lt;/em&gt;. The loosely defined cyberpunk genre began as a grounded alternative to space operas and post-apocalyptic wastelands, heavily influenced by hardboiled fiction. In the decades since, it’s so thoroughly permeated science fiction that its innovations have become cliches. Today, “cyberpunk” has two contradictory meanings: tech-heavy futuristic media that feels organically grown from present-day social conditions, and a specific set of 1980s and ‘90s-influenced retro-future noir conventions. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; is a version of the latter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPzcAr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; sits in an alternate timeline where the Soviet Union still exists, Japan is a cultural and economic superpower, and big cities are chaotic warzones. The game is set several decades after the original tabletop release, and CD Projekt Red tones down its retro aesthetic enough to avoid ostentatious anachronism. But there are periodic flashbacks to an earlier era, creating a strangely hilarious setup where 2077 looks sort of like real-world 2020, and the fictional 2020s were actually the sci-fi 1980s, right down to vinyl records and eye-mounted camcorders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8JSVpk"&gt;Modern fantasy stories, including CD Projekt Red’s &lt;em&gt;Witcher&lt;/em&gt; games and the novels on which they’re based, have distinguished themselves by subverting older genre tropes. That’s often meant producing grittier stories with more realistic social dynamics. But ice-cold, swaggering grittiness was cyberpunk’s stereotypical starting point, and &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; almost never deconstructs, examines, or builds on its basics. Corporate executives are masters of cold-blooded power games. Fixers do business from smoke-filled bars. Cybernetic escorts haunt the streets. Artists are comfortable sellouts or sociopathic geniuses, including one played by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21019945/cyberpunk-2077-soundtrack-grimes-run-the-jewels-cd-projekt-red-game-awards-trailer"&gt;soundtrack contributor Grimes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="3xx2Si"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Parts of Night City’s future are eternally relevant&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PML4t2"&gt;Despite being well-worn, plenty of cyberpunk tropes have survived because they ring true. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; depicts a hyper-stratified society that rewards cruelty, exploits vulnerability, and commercializes absolutely everything, something that resonates as much today as it might have decades ago. The game’s conventions sometimes seem to help it avoid facile current-event references while still feeling contemporary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vzKhDu"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; also falls into irritating caricature. V’s partner, Jackie, is a well-developed blend of streetwise cynicism and deeply buried hopefulness, except that his dialogue is overladen with &lt;a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/feature/7363-i-m-all-in-on-cyberpunk-2077-but-one-element-of-the-e3-demo-disappointed-me"&gt;random and awkward Spanish asides&lt;/a&gt;. The game straightforwardly reproduces ‘80s cyberpunk’s &lt;a href="https://www.fanbyte.com/features/fear-of-a-yellow-planet-why-we-need-to-actually-understand-cyberpunk/"&gt;surface-level fascination&lt;/a&gt; with Japan and China, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/bringing-a-katana-to-a-gunfight-1845257825"&gt;arming Japanese gangsters with katanas&lt;/a&gt; and building Japanese characters around archetypes like the honor-bound samurai.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HCVHqC"&gt;Like the USSR hanging together, &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077’s&lt;/em&gt; race and gender worldbuilding can feel like an alt-history relic instead of a wild new future. It matter-of-factly lets you customize V’s voice, body shape, and genitalia separately, but nonbinary people apparently don’t inhabit what’s supposedly a weird gender-bending society, so characters will just read your voice as male or female and respond to you accordingly. And despite extreme body modding being totally ubiquitous, transgender women are seemingly still an &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/e3/2019/6/12/18662443/cyberpunk-2077-trans-advertisement-cd-projekt-red-e3-2019"&gt;exotic oddity&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Jackie, your partner in Cyberpunk 2077, in front of a table dancer at a nightclub." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jO04j0kPbeInarM70TADaoeBmY8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150438/Cyberpunk2077_Ladies_And_Gentleman_The_US_Cracks_RGB.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dnMbFu"&gt;All of these details were noted before &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077’s&lt;/em&gt; release, and they’ve granted the game &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/4/22058784/cyberpunk-2077-marketing-cd-projekt-red-transphobia"&gt;a culture war hotbed status&lt;/a&gt; that it deeply does not merit. As &lt;a href="https://www.vg247.com/2020/06/24/cyberpunk-mike-pondsmith-games-politics/"&gt;tabletop series author Mike Pondsmith&lt;/a&gt; has stated, building the rules of a detailed fictional society is inherently political. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk &lt;/em&gt;imports social conflicts for dramatic effect, like a long subplot about sex workers — a &lt;a href="https://www.fanbyte.com/news/cyberpunk-2077-a-game-i-dont-trust-has-thoughts-on-protecting-sex-workers/"&gt;vulnerable class of real people&lt;/a&gt; — trying to overthrow their bosses. But these conflicts don’t feel like successful &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; failed social commentary, just stock neo-noir conceits that happen to involve oppression. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; is a particular brand of exploitation: a piece of fiction that doesn’t add much to the stories and ideas it’s borrowing, but uses them effectively to deliver crowd-pleasing fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YdGlT3"&gt;And seriously — &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; is fun. CD Projekt Red has created a sprawling yet densely populated world where even meandering freeways, outlying deserts, and rows of factory-farm greenhouses feel beautifully crafted. It turns the already eerie and dystopian California road network into a veritable maze, with cross-borough trips sending you through a tangle of cement overpasses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KBFsjz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I can destroy you with my brain four different ways&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O2vWIh"&gt;On top of that, the game includes open-ended roleplaying and some elements reminiscent of immersive sims like &lt;em&gt;Deus Ex&lt;/em&gt;. Scavenged or purchased clothes and weapons are supplemented by a complicated upgrade tree for the game’s key stats, which include strength, dexterity, and “cool” (which roughly corresponds to sneakiness). You can also visit back alley technicians called ripperdocs, who install bionic weapons and swappable upgrades with specific perks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t5Tz31"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, you can approach many areas by slipping past enemies undetected, or you can shoot everyone in sight. There’s a fairly clever hacking minigame that provides blanket benefits, making enemies more vulnerable or glitching out security cameras. There are also instant “quickhacks” for specific actions. On the stealth side, that includes deactivating turrets or making vending machines chirp to distract enemies. In combat, you can literally fry enemies’ brains by making their implants malfunction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AEIoQp"&gt;All of these systems help carry &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk’s&lt;/em&gt; considerable length. Instead of rewarding hyper-specialization, the game encourages versatility, mixing up firefights with sneaky sections. Quickhacks add a touch of much-appreciated absurdity to combat. It’s remarkably satisfying to infiltrate a criminal hideout, incapacitate a cluster of mooks by uploading some kind of contagious poison brain virus, wait for their buddies to notice, start a shootout with your futuristic-looking “tech pistol,” then knock the final gangster out with mind powers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="BfDpff"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Cyberpunk 2077’ is a powerful machine with a million slick toggles, but a lot of them feel disconnected&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yXwqv0"&gt;Like the setting, though, most of these features feel borrowed from other, more thoughtfully constructed games. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; areas have shortcut doors that high-tech or high-strength players can unlock, but not the clever puzzle-box design you’d find in &lt;em&gt;Deus Ex&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Dishonored&lt;/em&gt;. You can choose to kill enemies or incapacitate them, but beyond a thread of missions where you have to bring targets in alive, this option barely affected my gameplay style or character interactions. (My chosen weapon was a normal pistol fitted with a special non-lethality chip from a gun vendor, and I’m still puzzling over how that’s supposed to work.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VewJi"&gt;Similarly, your stats and background in &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; produce occasional extra dialogue choices, but they rarely changed how my conversations unfolded. Many games’ roleplaying choices are obviously crude binaries or illusions. Even so, those illusions — like Telltale’s infamous warning that &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/7/6/8900975/telltale-games-parenting"&gt;&lt;em&gt;someone will remember that&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — help draw players into a story. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; is a powerful machine with a million slick toggles, but a lot of them feel conspicuously disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1sCo2"&gt;This had a silver lining for me as a reviewer, granted, because &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077’s&lt;/em&gt; pre-release PC build was full of unpredictable bugs. One mercenary would repeatedly reappear behind me when I knocked him unconscious, forcing me to simply shoot him. Some unconscious enemies clipped through floors and exploded when I tried to move their bodies. I reloaded one intense boss fight after all participants were mysteriously rendered immortal. Oversensitive collision physics made perfect stealth almost unviable since walls and boxes would occasionally decide I was invading their personal space and push me into an enemy’s sights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bO98BO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Forgiving gameplay made weird bugs less frustrating&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JJOa8R"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; were a game for perfectionists, I’d consider these serious problems. And I obviously hope CD Projekt Red will fix them quickly; it’s already rolled out one round of pre-release bug patches. But in a huge sandbox with a generous autosave system, they weren’t actually dealbreakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HdNVDI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk&lt;/em&gt; has been hyped as a triumph of next-generation gaming, and its sheer size certainly takes advantage of modern computer and console specs. (My PC was&lt;em&gt; barely &lt;/em&gt;powerful enough for the game’s &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/11/20/21581393/cyberpunk-2077-pc-system-requirements-specs-ray-tracing-gpu-rtx"&gt;vaunted ray-tracing options&lt;/a&gt;, and I mostly left them deactivated. My colleagues will be delving into its graphics after release.) I’ve been cautiously excited about &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; for years, and it’s almost exactly the game I expected: not terribly memorable, but campy and entertaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="566hy4"&gt;Given just how much crunch and controversy &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;has generated, though, I can’t deny being a little disappointed — especially when the game delivers fragments of something more compelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnNz55"&gt;Reeves’ character Johnny Silverhand, for instance, is almost purely a leather-clad 20th century counterculture sketch. But there’s lots of potential in any belligerent idealist getting to see his legacy and mostly hating what he finds. In my favorite minor side mission, Johnny’s hologram stops to listen to a busker, prompting you to hunt down a bootleg from his old band Samurai. You get the record by finding a street vendor who’s a Samurai superfan, then reciting some trivia to prove you’re worthy of the goods. Johnny watches the whole nostalgia-drenched conversation with obvious embarrassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FxpLkD"&gt;This encounter never really goes anywhere, although Samurai plays a significant role in the story. But it’s an oddly self-aware moment for a game built on capturing a bygone era’s cool factor. Instead of trying to drop players in an archetypal cyberpunk setting, CD Projekt Red could have pushed the idea further, imagining how an alternative retro-future might evolve — and it might have turned out more interesting than &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077’s&lt;/em&gt; chain-smoking gangsters and console cowboys. But maybe this Night City was too big to get truly weird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Qba36P"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;will be released December 10th on PC, Google Stadia, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S, and Xbox Series X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ETofBz"&gt;You know good and well what you did. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YXEl3g"&gt;Back in 2003 or whatever, you took young, innocent Neopets under your wing. A Gelert, a Jetsam, a Scorchio, or whatever the hell the penguin one was called. You promised that under your tutelage, they would thrive. You promised you would feed them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="73vZOK"&gt;And yet you didn’t feed them, did you? Your Neopoints piled up and you spent them on plushies, faerie quests, paintbrushes, and you watched your pets deteriorate right before your eyes. Their pictures saddened; tears appeared in their eyes. Their hunger status changed over time — “very hungry” to “famished” to “starving” to “dying.” Every time you logged onto that cursed site, even if just to hammer out a few levels of &lt;em&gt;Typing Terror&lt;/em&gt;, you were emphatically reminded that your beloved pets were on the brink of death.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cjx7VMAXyAW_5ev5RRfWeA_VKDs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22150640/Screen_Shot_2020_12_07_at_10.48.26_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Hot Topic&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SWChBk"&gt;This practice, of course, begs a number of philosophical questions. Does it give Neopets users a purpose in life, something to strive for in the Neo-world? Probably. Does it help prepare kids for adulthood, where they’ll someday have to face their own mortality? It’s possible. Does it warn people not to put themselves in charge of living things that they can’t care for? Undoubtedly. Is it &lt;em&gt;ethical &lt;/em&gt;to plague children with guilt over the wellbeing of an entity that is — to be clear — entirely not real, fictional, and made-up? Well, who’s to say? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kBEEiH"&gt;Hot Topic is, apparently. The store is selling a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hottopic.com%2Fproduct%2Fneopets-sad-shoyru-t-shirt%2F14953163.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2020%2F12%2F7%2F22158653%2Fneopets-hot-topic-shirt-price#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new T-shirt&lt;/a&gt; that’s clearly meant to remind us all just how careless we’ve been. It’s one of a number of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hottopic.com%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dneopets%26cm_mmc%3DSOC-_-EXT-_-ORG-_-DMY-_-POD-_-NEOPETS&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2020%2F12%2F7%2F22158653%2Fneopets-hot-topic-shirt-price#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Neopets-themed shirts&lt;/a&gt; that the store is selling. This one is emblazoned with the slogan “Your Neopets are dying,” as well as a picture of the most depressed-looking Neopet I’ve ever seen. The shirt costs between $22.90 and $26.90 depending on your size, but there’s a 30 percent off sale if you order one today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L64I6R"&gt;I don’t know about you, but I’m going to go ahead and order this, and wear it in every public place I can find. We early-20s denizens have screwed the pooch when it comes to our own Neopets — but maybe we can redeem ourselves if we ensure that future generations never make our mistakes. Leisure time? Recreation? No such thing in the capitalist productivity machine that is &lt;a href="http://Neopets.com"&gt;Neopets.com&lt;/a&gt;. Your Neopets are dying, children. Feed them. &lt;em&gt;Feed them!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best Buy’s video game sale is an easy way to build your new PS5 or Xbox Series X library</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PdUZe2"&gt;Gaming is an expensive hobby, especially if you recently purchased a new console. If you are looking to buy some new games but don’t want to burn a major hole in your pocket, Best Buy’s current promotion focuses on next-gen games: if you &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725883399713243224" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy two eligible next-gen titles, you get a third title free of charge&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zoaz7R"&gt;This is an ideal way to add three new games to your collection. The games’ pricing varies anywhere between $10 to $100. Many of these games are last-gen titles and include free next-gen upgrades, so they can work with both older consoles and the new ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nd0J2e"&gt;Some highlights in this deal include &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725881560814179116" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Control: Ultimate Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725881612897257275" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725881683012320033" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the latter being released on December 10th. If you own a Nintendo Switch, the retailer is also offering a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725883737997928539" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy one, get a second title for 50 percent off&lt;/a&gt; deal on select titles available on Nintendo’s hybrid console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uPFmtM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10197689"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TvoPhB"&gt;With the holiday season just around the corner, this is not a bad option if you already have in mind which titles you want to play on your PS5 or Xbox Series X. Both consoles are quite difficult to purchase right now, but if you already own one, Best Buy’s promotion is a great way to start building your library. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Timnit Gebru’s team at Google is going public with their side of the story</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="TechCrunch Disrupt San Francisco 2018 - Day 3" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G41JM5rdJtnisERN9tPc9Ld4GRY=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68470766/1028811898.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Kimberly White / Getty Images for TechCrunch&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xjBLMY"&gt;Google employees who worked with Timnit Gebru are coming out publicly to dispute claims against the star AI ethics researcher. On Monday, the team &lt;a href="https://googlewalkout.medium.com/"&gt;published a letter on the Google Walkout Medium account&lt;/a&gt; firmly stating that Gebru was fired and did not resign &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2kYWDXwhzYnq8ebVtuk9CqQqz7ScqxhSIxeYGrWjK0/edit"&gt;as Google’s head of artificial intelligence, Jeff Dean, said&lt;/a&gt;. They also said the publication review policy that Gebru was supposed to follow was applied “unevenly and discriminatorily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlZ0wx"&gt;“Dr. Gebru’s dismissal has been framed as a resignation, but in Dr. Gebru’s own words, she did not resign,” the letter says. It notes that Gebru asked for certain conditions to be met in order for her to stay at Google, including transparency around who wanted her paper retracted. Ultimately, the leaders of the ethical AI team said they could not meet these conditions and preemptively accepted her resignation. &lt;a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3469738016467233&amp;amp;id=100002932057665&amp;amp;comment_id=3470470943060607&amp;amp;notif_t=mentions_comment&amp;amp;notif_id=1607192244022022&amp;amp;ref=m_notif"&gt;Her own manager said he was “stunned.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFmTPq"&gt;The paper that got Gebru fired detailed potential risks associated with large language processing models, including over-relying on data from wealthy countries that have more internet access. “The result is that AI-generated language will be homogenized, reflecting the practices of the richest countries and communities,” &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/12/04/1013294/google-ai-ethics-research-paper-forced-out-timnit-gebru/"&gt;wrote &lt;em&gt;MIT Technology Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQn78I"&gt;This research could have been problematic for Google, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931657/google-bert-search-context-algorithm-change-10-percent-langauge"&gt;which created a large language model called BERT in 2018, which has changed how it queries search results&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mq7EpR"&gt;Gebru was planning to present the paper at a computer science conference in March. On October 7th, she submitted it for review internally at Google. Shortly after midnight on October 8th, it was approved. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNCbG1"&gt;In his statement, Dean said the research team requires two weeks for review. “Unfortunately, this particular paper was only shared with a day’s notice before its deadline,” &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f2kYWDXwhzYnq8ebVtuk9CqQqz7ScqxhSIxeYGrWjK0/edit"&gt;he wrote&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4ZoL7"&gt;But Gebru’s team is pushing back on that assessment, saying the review policy is meant to be flexible, and most people do not follow the structure Dean laid out. The team collected data showing the vast majority of approvals happen right before the deadline, and 41 percent happen &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the deadline. “There is no hard requirement for papers to actually go through this review with two weeks notice,” they wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYNvHP"&gt;Google managers asked Gebru to retract the paper or take her name off it, a request she said felt like censorship &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/prominent-ai-ethics-researcher-says-google-fired-her/"&gt;in an interview with &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “You’re not going to have papers that make the company happy all the time and don’t point out problems,” she said. “That’s antithetical to what it means to be that kind of researcher.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WjNbB7"&gt;Gebru &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-withering-email-that-got-an-ethical"&gt;sent an email to the Brain Women and Allies listserv at Google&lt;/a&gt; detailing the pushback she’d gotten on the paper. She also voiced exasperation with the company’s diversity, equity, and inclusion efforts. “The DEI [objectives and key results] that we don’t know where they come from (and are never met anyways), the random discussions, the ‘we need more mentorship’ rather than ‘we need to stop the toxic environments that hinder us from progressing’ the constant fighting and education at your cost, they don’t matter,” she wrote. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3AdqH"&gt;This frustration was shared by members of her team who felt the company’s goals to create a more diverse and equitable workplace were weak. “They’re really paltry demands,” says Alex Hanna, a senior researcher who worked under Gebru. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3b2AgW"&gt;More than 1,500 employees have signed &lt;a href="https://googlewalkout.medium.com/standing-with-dr-timnit-gebru-isupporttimnit-believeblackwomen-6dadc300d382"&gt;a Google Walkout petition protesting Gebru’s dismissal&lt;/a&gt;. “Instead of being embraced by Google as an exceptionally talented and prolific contributor, Dr. Gebru has faced defensiveness, racism, gaslighting, research censorship, and now a retaliatory firing,” the petition says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNwVn4"&gt;But it’s members of her team who feel the loss most acutely. “We’re pretty deflated,” Hanna says. “When someone who is the heart and soul of your team gets fired ostensibly for doing ethics research, what can you do?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXqHLK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this article stated the letter was signed by more than 1,500 Google employees. That was the Google Walkout petition. We regret the error. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
