    <title>Robinhood’s IPO roadshow answered questions I wasn’t asking</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DoOOJs"&gt;“What’s your favorite planet?” is a real question that Robinhood execs really picked to answer during the Q&amp;amp;A section of its retail investor roadshow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lj2TJB"&gt;“Definitely Pluto,” says long-haired CEO Vlad Tenev. He is having a good time. He goes on to explain that there will be a great view of Venus tonight after sunset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FJc0dQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The first meme IPO&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I7CkXc"&gt;Many of the questions the management picked have been lackluster; asked if Robinhood will add a customer support line, Tenev cheerily explains there already is one. Another question is wasted on whether the stock will pay dividends — anyone who &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001783879/000162828021013986/robinhoods-1a1.htm"&gt;read the prospectus&lt;/a&gt; knows the answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjNXJJ"&gt;I am watching this roadshow — my first, and the first, I suspect, of many who are watching — because Robinhood plans to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/21/technology/robinhood-ipo.html"&gt;sell as much as a third of its IPO&lt;/a&gt; to its users. The roadshow is part of a plan to put retail investors on an “equal footing” (per the prospectus) with institutional investors. At the top of the presentation, I’m told that this is basically the same set of materials institutional investors get. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LdA2Rp"&gt;And why am I spending my Saturday on this? Well, it’s going to be the first meme IPO. And if this works, other companies may choose to boost the proportion of their shares they allocate to retail investors, says Pitchbook’s Robert Le, a senior analyst. Most IPOs allocate only 1 percent to 3 percent of their shares to retail investors, he says. If Robinhood ends its first day of trading higher than where it started, other companies may follow in its footsteps. However, if the stock trends down, institutional investors may steer clear of IPOs that include a large chunk of retail traders, Le says in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDTiK9"&gt;Robinhood hasn’t offered its investors IPO access before, and that concerns David Erickson, who was co-head of global equity capital markets at Barclays until he retired in 2013. (He is now a lecturer at &lt;a href="https://fnce.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/davider/"&gt;Wharton Business School at the University of Pennsylvania&lt;/a&gt;.) “They don’t have the best internal controls,” Erickson says in an interview, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21163048/robinhood-outages-major-2-days-leap-year-investing"&gt;pointing to&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/9/21171584/robinhood-outage-week-us-stocks-third-market"&gt;Robinhood’s history&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22388447/robinhood-app-dogecoin-rally-failed-trades"&gt;of outages&lt;/a&gt;. “For a company supposed to be in the business of keeping your money secure, they aren’t necessarily doing a good job of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eupHew"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There were real, substantive questions eventually&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ykfcso"&gt;During the roadshow, Tenev, his cofounder Baiju Bhatt — who is also rocking some lustrous locks  — and CFO Jason Warnick appear to be in an expensive and uncomfortable facsimile of a living room. They are seated on a white couch, with random wooden slats behind them; plants hang from the slats. In front of them, there are small wooden tables. Bhatt and Warnick are clearly reading from teleprompters. Many speakers featured on the call wore a pin of Robinhood’s feather logo — but not Tenev.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tLSpNt"&gt;There were real, substantive questions eventually. Though Robinhood doesn’t give a timeline, it is apparently working on creating wallets for its cryptocurrency users, allowing them to transfer in their crypto from elsewhere. Eventually there will be a beta, but because it’s impossible to recover cryptocurrency if it’s been handled wrong, Robinhood is proceeding slowly, Tenev says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3Ule2"&gt;And as for payment for order flow, which makes up 81 percent of the first quarter revenue in 2021, Robinhood plans to work with regulators to answer concerns. This sounds suspiciously like Robinhood is planning to lobby — and it may also explain the&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-14/robinhood-hires-ex-regulators-to-help-address-compliance-issues?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt; former SEC employees hired at Robinhood&lt;/a&gt;. As for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;angry meme stock customers&lt;/a&gt; that might leave? Tenev dodges the question. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419159/robinhood-dogecoin-outage-crypto-trading-crash"&gt;Outages&lt;/a&gt;? Well, Robinhood says it’s investing resources to create redundancies so they won’t keep happening. (We’ll see!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esPCRu"&gt;The most interesting remarks are saved for the end. First, Robinhood is considering IRAs and Roth IRAs, two types of retirement accounts, as products it may offer. (Whether people want to save for retirement on their&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-07-02/robinhood-ipo-filing-is-a-lesson-in-meme-finance-kqmkzfxc"&gt; fun gambling app&lt;/a&gt; is an open question, but sure!) Second,  Robinhood thinks that retail investors are in the market to stay; it’s working to diversify by building out Robinhood Gold, its paid product, as well as cash management, more cryptocurrency offerings and fully paid securities lending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cRszvA"&gt;There is one notable omission in the roadshow. Despite its lovey-dovey mission statement about democratizing finance, the founders’ Class B stock gets 10 votes per share, while IPO investors’ Class A stock gets just one vote per share. Erickson, the Wharton lecturer, doesn’t like that, either. “This one bothers me like WeWork bothered me,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM, Cruise suing to stop Ford from using the name ‘BlueCruise’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gHy1hBQijfmfdYI27WuMciJCPns=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69627021/acastro_200406_1777_ford_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;GM is suing Ford over the BlueCruise name for its hands-free driving system | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2D5VZi"&gt;General Motors has filed a lawsuit to try to prevent Ford from using the name “BlueCruise” for the hands-free driving feature it announced earlier this year. First reported by the &lt;a href="https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/general-motors/2021/07/24/gm-sues-ford-claiming-trademark-infringement-over-bluecruise-hands-free-name/8079309002/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detroit Free Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, GM claims the name is too close Super Cruise, the name of is own hands-free driving technology introduced in 2017, and to its autonomous vehicle subsidiary Cruise. GM is suing Ford for trademark infringement and unspecified damages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1JoMT"&gt;In the lawsuit filed Friday, GM said in that the companies had been involved in “protracted discussions” over the name but were unable to resolve the matter. “Ford knew exactly what it was doing,” GM alleges in its complaint, adding that if Ford “wanted to adopt a new, unique brand, it easily could have done so without using the word ‘Cruise.’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZ6AWb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383460/ford-bluecruise-hands-free-adas-f150-mustang-mache"&gt;Ford announced BlueCruise as the name&lt;/a&gt; for its hands-free driver assist system in April, and said it would begin pushing the feature via an over-the-air software updates to select vehicles later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7HyCP9"&gt;GM didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Saturday. The company told the &lt;em&gt;Free Press&lt;/em&gt; that it would have preferred to resolve the situation amicably but was “left with no choice but to vigorously defend our brands and protect the equity our products and technology have earned over several years in the market.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JMfy1J"&gt;A Ford spokesperson called GM’s Cruise claim “meritless and frivolous,” in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, saying that cruise control is a well-known term. “Every automaker offers it, and ‘cruise’ is common shorthand for the capability. That’s why BlueCruise was chosen as the name for the Blue Oval’s next evolution of Ford’s Intelligent Adaptive Cruise Control,” the spokesperson added (the “Blue Oval” refers to Ford’s logo).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmcSQ9"&gt;Indeed, there are several other automakers who use the word “cruise” to describe their hands-free driving features, including Hyundai’s Smart Cruise Control, and BMW’s Active Cruise Control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I4skXp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CLHGH7"&gt;

    <title>New job posting shows Amazon seeking a digital currency and blockchain expert</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T219TlBo7rGI4aDkXuKMG4f93EA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69626712/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon may be testing the cryptocurrency waters | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GNPvkV"&gt;Amazon is hiring a digital currency and blockchain product lead for its payments team, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.jobs/en/jobs/1644513/digital-currency-and-blockchain-product-lead"&gt;new job listing&lt;/a&gt;. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-cryptocurrency-seeks-new-blockchain-leader-customers-payments-ecommerce-2021-7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the ecommerce giant is looking for an “experienced product leader to develop Amazon’s Digital Currency and Blockchain strategy and product roadmap.” The listing, which Amazon has confirmed is legitimate, continues:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="E2ZC8R"&gt;You will leverage your domain expertise in Blockchain, Distributed Ledger, Central Bank Digital Currencies and Cryptocurrency to develop the case for the capabilities which should be developed, drive overall vision and product strategy, and gain leadership buy-in and investment for new capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="F8Fxv7"&gt;Amazon.com doesn’t accept cryptocurrency as payment, but a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; that the company was “inspired by the innovation happening in the cryptocurrency space and are exploring what this could look like on Amazon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZP2RrZ"&gt;Amazon’s cloud division, Amazon Web Services (AWS) already has a &lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/managed-blockchain/"&gt;managed blockchain&lt;/a&gt; service. But CEO Andy Jassy said in 2017 when he was head of the AWS division that the company was “watching” the space  but that Amazon didn’t see “a lot of practical use cases for blockchain that are much broader than using a distributed ledger,” &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/aws-not-buying-into-the-blockchain-hype/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ZDNet&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; at the time. That would appear to be changing if this new listing is any indication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="koPjir"&gt;Apple posted a &lt;a href="https://jobs.apple.com/en-us/details/200247094/business-development-manager-alternative-payments?team=MKTG"&gt;similar listing&lt;/a&gt; in May for a business development manager for “alternative payments,” and among the key qualifications for the role was five years of experience “working in or with alternative payment providers, such as digital wallets, BNPL, Fast Payments, cryptocurrency and etc.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tpTjDj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i6K9zQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Genki ShadowCast review: a clever but limited capture card</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A viable option for streamers and gamers on the go&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="9WxLoT"&gt;The ShadowCast from Genki is a dongle-size video capture card that might provide all that some gamers and streamers need. It’s $45, a relatively low price for a no-frills device that can get your console games onto your PC. But it has some limitations. The video quality isn’t great, and there’s a noticeable amount of lag if you’re trying to play along with the stream. These compromises aren’t a surprise, considering the ShadowCast costs a fraction of the price of something more capable like &lt;a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/game-capture-hd60-s-plus"&gt;Elgato’s HD60 S+&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YspjMR"&gt;You can actually go a bit cheaper than Genki’s $45 if you’re willing to roll the dice on quality control. Last year we covered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21346571/cheap-cam-link-capture-card-streamer-clone-review-test-price"&gt;an affordable (between $10 and $30, usually) no-brand HDMI capture card&lt;/a&gt; that’s very similar to this one, and perhaps its port arrangement may be more convenient for you. Unlike the ShadowCast, which plugs into an HDMI port and has a USB-C-in port on its other end, the cheaper alternative has HDMI-in and USB-out, so you can just plug in an HDMI cable you may already own. Genki gets the nod, though, both in terms of build quality and its companion software. I’ll get into the latter part below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kvTkVw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10666378"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DLxVns"&gt;It’s easy to get the ShadowCast up and running on PC or macOS. It’ll work with any device with an HDMI-out port, so the PS5, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch and some older consoles are covered. That also includes DSLR or mirrorless cameras that you might want to use as a high-end webcam. The ShadowCast has a USB-C port on its other side, which you can connect to your PC with the included six-foot USB-C-to-C 2.0 cable, or your own C-to-A cable. It also works seamlessly with streaming applications like OBS Studio. If you’re using the ShadowCast as an interface for a camera, it’ll work with Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and other popular video conferencing apps. You might need a dongle if your camera doesn’t have a full-sized HDMI port. A micro or mini HDMI dongle should get the job done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IZNMP3"&gt;When I hooked up the ShadowCast to my Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark II camera to use it as a webcam, it worked well, with negligible latency issues.. It produces far better colors and clarity than a traditional webcam, though in my case, I could only get an image through HDMI by bumping the camera’s output resolution down to 720p. That may be an issue with my camera, and not the ShadowCast, so your camera may be able to output to higher resolutions without issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tyu29e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10666381"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8Dmv92"&gt;The ShadowCast’s specs are competitive for sub-$50 capture solutions, and its flaws are generally similar, too. It supports up to 1080p input resolution at 30 frames per second, or a 720p image at a faster 60 frames per second. Both modes offer varying levels of graininess, so this device isn’t for people aiming to show all of the granular visual details in PS5 games — or really any game — with pixel-perfect representation. Fidelity aside, I noticed that colors from some sample images and footage look less vibrant and have less contrast than I’d see by directly connecting my console to a monitor. Neither flaw is that surprising, given the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="viEETg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10666385"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bktjSW"&gt;The lag while gaming is another issue. The delay in the incoming video feed is perceivable to the point that it may be game-breaking depending on your preferences. Lag is really only an issue if you’re playing strictly through the feed coming in from the ShadowCast; most streamers who want to play and stream at the same time from a console use an HDMI splitter and instead play their games on a screen that has a direct connection to their console, thus avoiding latency. I used the ShadowCast with other cables, as well as USB-C and USB-A ports on two different computers, but the latency issues were the same no matter what.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hzAki7"&gt;The ShadowCast is a viable but limited option for streamers compared to pricier options. But it’s more user-friendly than some other competitors if all you want to do is record yourself talking over gameplay and upload the video to your channel later on. Genki makes that easy to do &lt;a href="https://www.genkithings.com/products/shadowcast"&gt;through its free Arcade app for macOS&lt;/a&gt; and Windows 10 machines. More impressively, it works &lt;a href="https://arcade.genkithings.com/"&gt;through Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge, too&lt;/a&gt;. Once your console is connected, you can hit record and chat through your microphone as you play, and the recording will pick up both game audio and your voice. You can take snapshots, too, which is handy if you’re making guides for game walkthroughs. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A snapshot taken from the browser version of Genki Arcade shows the full suite of tools, including voice recording, screenshots, and video recording." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wDoZ0j5G5J3IzArd-Qsj5MgyJrY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22736641/genkishadowcastbrowser.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A snapshot taken from the browser version of Genki Arcade shows the full suite of tools, including voice recording, screenshots, and video recording.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AwZ8H5"&gt;The app on macOS and the browser-based versions offer all of the features above. But on Windows, it’ll let you play your games, but you can’t record footage or mic audio currently. The macOS app also outputs different types of files than the browser version. On macOS, you’ll get an .mp4 file, but the browser-based version outputs a .webm video file that’s viewable (and can be converted to .mp4) in VLC Player. It’s not a huge deal, but it’s an extra step, since you’ll likely need to convert it to a more compatible video file format before uploading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DMDscr"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FDiGOMTJXPQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QyF9JB"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s a clip recorded through the Genki Arcade software in “Favor Performance” mode, which sets the ShadowCast to 720p at 60 frames per second.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="knqZhG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MS2868hTmK8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4V91Cu"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s a clip recorded through the Genki Arcade software in “Favor Resolution” mode, which sets the ShadowCast to 1080p at 30 frames per second.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fhl4Lz"&gt;Genki is also touting that its app and the ShadowCast should appeal to people who casually use their laptops or desktops as a display for their game consoles. There’s little reason to do this if you have a nearby TV, since you’ll get less latency with a direct connection. This method makes a lot more sense if you’re in, say, a hotel with just your laptop, or if you don’t own a dedicated TV and the biggest screen you’ve got is your desktop all-in-one. If those highly specific circumstances describe your situation, this isn’t a bad way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZsbKHO"&gt;Whatever your use cases are, Genki claims that its Arcade app has less latency than if you were to run the ShadowCast as a video source through OBS Studio, when tested on a 2020 base model M1 13-inch MacBook Pro. At most, it says the reduction in latency can be up to 50ms, but that it varies and may be less than that. But on my setup, the reduction in latency with the Arcade app wasn’t too noticeable. Genki told me that latency can be impacted by factors like whether you’re using a laptop that’s being charged versus running off the battery, and whether your PC’s specs can keep up. In my case, it feels similar to playing games via cloud streaming over a so-so internet connection. Like I mentioned above, that might be a deal-breaker for some, or not a concern for others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mscdGM"&gt;If you’re skeptical about the ShadowCast, $45 isn’t that much to gamble, compared to pricier solutions. I like the companion software (including a web-based solution), which simplifies putting your game on a PC or laptop screen. And as a streaming solution, its video quality is serviceable, so long as capturing high-fidelity footage isn’t essential.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Senate’s E-BIKE Act could make electric bikes a lot cheaper</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="E-bikes popularity grows" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/11eT2n79qkGRUxsgs6AhMjTt38s=/332x0:5027x3130/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69626458/1311180591.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h0RxGd"&gt;A bill that would offer Americans a refundable tax credit on the purchase of a new electric bicycle was just introduced in the Senate by Ed Markey (D-MA) and Brian Schatz (D-HI). The bill is called the Electric Bicycle Incentive Kickstart for the Environment, or E-BIKE Act for short, and it’s the companion bill to one introduced in the House of Representatives &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22295115/ebike-tax-credit-congress-bill-blumenauer"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WbH59m"&gt;E-bikes are more expensive than normal bikes, typically costing anywhere from $1,000 to $8,000 for some of the more high-end models. But they also have the potential to replace car trips for a lot of people, with a recent study finding that if 15 percent of car trips were made by e-bike, &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.bicycling.com_news_a33798099_e-2Dbikes-2Dcan-2Dreduce-2Dcarbon-2Demissions-2Dstudy_-23-3A-7E-3Atext-3DTake-2520an-2520E-252DBike-2520to-2Cemissions-2520would-2520drop-252012-2520percent.-26text-3DResearch-2520from-2520a-2520recent-2520study-2Creducing-2520carbon-2520emissions-2520in-2520cities.&amp;amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;amp;c=L93KkjKsAC98uTvC4KvQDdTDRzAeWDDRmG6S3YXllH0&amp;amp;r=Kaw85Xe8TfA6OxCjbhxHHlKZN2OTQje-DKAJWPsTvmQ&amp;amp;m=TGIC8E3VcNB9fNV9rlqspnybSAaSvRDYUI4CaLwl9B4&amp;amp;s=pn6j7tb5RRf9wPkw9K3jBBueYbBKOGZTr8pdj7KdhkQ&amp;amp;e="&gt;carbon emissions would drop by 12 percent&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GEAPQk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“the electrification of transportation is not just about cars”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ElWXUP"&gt;This afternoon, I conducted a brief interview with Senator Schatz over text message to get a sense of the legislation’s goals, its chances in Congress, and whether he himself would ever consider buying an e-bike. (He said no, but I think I got him to reconsider.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I1Lhvg"&gt;“The idea is simple,” Schatz said, “the electrification of transportation is not just about cars, it’s about every way to get around.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MN7t2A"&gt;At its core, the bill is about accessibility, the senator said. More people should be riding e-bikes than just those who can afford them. Driving is already highly subsidized across the country. We build cheap — often free — areas for parking, we invest in highways, drivers don’t pay for congestion or CO2 emissions, and zoning laws and taxes favor sprawl. We need to start accommodating bikes — and especially e-bikes — if we want more people to switch to greener forms of transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FJWBKt"&gt;“The bill makes a clean alternative more accessible to more people,” Schatz said. “E-bikes make lots of sense for working people, young people, and others who either cannot afford or don’t want a car.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DoPIkN"&gt;Much like the House bill, Schatz and Markey’s legislation would offer Americans a refundable tax credit worth 30 percent of a new e-bike’s purchase price, capped at $1,500. All three e-bike classes would be eligible for the tax credit, but bikes with motors more powerful than 750W would not. The credit would also be fully refundable, which would allow lower-income individuals to claim it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NivS6h"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A common refrain you hear from critics of this legislation is that people won’t switch to bikes without safer infrastructure to support it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XXRJ62"&gt;A common refrain you hear from critics of this legislation is that people won’t switch to bikes without safer infrastructure to support it. Protected bike lanes are still in short supply in the US, and it’s unclear whether a surge in demand for e-bikes would necessarily lead to better policy decisions on the local level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uw39r3"&gt;Schatz said there needs to be a “major infusion of physical infrastructure for bike lanes and safe streets” for this bill to have the desirable outcome, which is more people switching from cars to e-bikes. There is &lt;a href="https://www.peopleforbikes.org/news/what-could-bidens-infrastructure-plan-mean-for-bikes"&gt;$20 billion in President Biden’s infrastructure proposal&lt;/a&gt; for safe street improvements, which include bike lanes. But whether that money survives in the final deal — if there is a final deal — remains to be seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMkBns"&gt;“I’m optimistic,” Schatz said about the potential passage of the E-BIKE Act, “but this overall package will face multiple near-death experiences before it becomes law. We plan to get it through in the coming package, but if we don’t, we will keep pushing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HrAg2"&gt;The House version of the bill has 21 co-sponsors — all Democrats — while the Senate version is just now making the rounds. But Schatz said he doesn’t think it will be a tough sell with his colleagues. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X1d0Lw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We anticipate that we will be able to build momentum for this”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jTeLxX"&gt;“We anticipate that we will be able to build momentum for this,” he said. “It’s one of those rare ideas that is both revolutionary and noncontroversial.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H47yR5"&gt;And while Schatz said he’s only tried riding an e-bike once, while on vacation, and doesn’t have any immediate plans to buy one for himself, he would reconsider, given his newly acquired position as an advocate for this mode of transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ztznwM"&gt;Capital Bikeshare in Washington, DC, has a number of pedal-assist e-bikes in rotation. Just sayin’. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Blizzard exec calls sexual harassment allegations ‘extremely troubling’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Activision Blizzard logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uianmWaBQvUiIhudH32jPptAe4c=/106x0:3742x2424/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69626424/1233534678.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A new lawsuit alleges widespread sexual harassment at Activision Blizzard | Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H4axai"&gt;The president of Blizzard Entertainment sent an email to staff calling allegations of sexual harassment at the company “extremely troubling.” First reported by Jason Schreier at &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, J. Allen Brack wrote that “the fight for equality is incredibly important to me,” and that he has spent his career fighting against “bro culture.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaRfgc"&gt;The California Department of Fair Employment and Housing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;(DFEH) filed suit against Blizzard&lt;/a&gt; and owner Activision Blizzard on Tuesday, alleging a culture of “constant sexual harassment” existed at the company.  The complaint describes a “frat boy culture” that included male employees drinking and sexually harassing female employees without repercussions. Brack is named in the complaint as being one of the people at the company who was allegedly aware and enabling of the behavior.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XPib1p"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Blizzard president J. Allen Brack sent out an email to staff last night addressing the allegations from this week's explosive lawsuit, calling them "extremely troubling" and saying that he'd be "meeting with many of you to answer questions and discuss how we can move forward." &lt;a href="https://t.co/NsMV6CNdTE"&gt;pic.twitter.com/NsMV6CNdTE&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1418512291218264065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bt8zyB"&gt;According to the DFEH complaint, “male employees would play video games during work, engage in banter about their sexual encounters, talk openly about female bodies, and make numerous jokes about rape.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29qX1E"&gt;Women were subjected to numerous sexual advances and comments, the lawsuit states, including groping and other forms of harassment:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="e1dC9U"&gt;A female employee noted that random male employees would approach her on Defendants’ work site and comment on her breasts. Female employees working for the World of Warcraft team noted that male employees and supervisors would hit on them, make derogatory comments about rape, and otherwise engage in demeaning behavior. This behavior was known to supervisors and indeed encouraged by them, including a male supervisor openly encouraging a male subordinate to “buy” a prostitute to cure his bad mood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A2ABhl"&gt;Alex Afrasiabi, the former Senior Creative Director of World of Warcraft at Blizzard Entertainment, was permitted to engage in blatant sexual harassment with little to no repercussions. During a company event (an annual convention called Blizz Con) Afrasiabi would hit on female employees, telling him he wanted to marry them, attempting to kiss them, and putting, his arms around them. This was in plain view of other male employees, including supervisors, who had to intervene and pull him off female employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="4rjYuV"&gt;Activision Blizzard executive Fran Townsend sent an email to staff the same day as Brack, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1418619091515068421?s=20"&gt;according to Schreier&lt;/a&gt;, but with a different tone, saying the lawsuit presented an “untrue picture” of the company, adding that it was “meritless.” Her comments echoed an official statement released by the company that called the DFEH lawsuit “irresponsible behavior from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State’s best businesses out of California,” and said the suit included “distorted, and in many cases, false descriptions of Blizzard’s past.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TIvruf"&gt;Activision Blizzard didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super Mario 64 probably won’t be the last million-dollar video game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xQOr_3LYR6AultfQV43tpdqyL4Y=/0x15:955x652/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69626180/screenshot01.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Super Mario 64. | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gD80Lj"&gt;Earlier this month, a sealed copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; sold for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572688/super-mario-64-most-expensive-video-game-ever-heritage-auctions"&gt;$1,560,000&lt;/a&gt; at auction, a staggering price that nearly doubled a record set &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22570401/legend-of-zelda-nes-sealed-copy-heritage-auctions-most-expensive-game"&gt;just two days before by a similarly pristine copy of &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The auctions could mark just the beginning of even more eye-poppingly large video game sales. It seems very likely that Mario’s first 3D adventure won’t be the last game to command a million-dollar sum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUpy3B"&gt;“I think we’ll see more million dollar games, probably sooner rather than later,” Chris Kohler, editorial director at Digital Eclipse, a developer that works on rereleases of classic video games, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eDDdt8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Collecting and selling stuff has become a popular trend&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9URY8z"&gt;Collecting and selling stuff — both physical and virtual — for expensive prices has become a popular trend. &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; cards are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276738/pokemon-trading-card-game-printing-short-supply-high-demand"&gt;massively popular&lt;/a&gt;. Some NFTs, a form of digital collectible, have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;sold for millions of dollars&lt;/a&gt;. And people have been pouring huge amounts of money into assets like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255955/robinhood-cryptocurrency-restrictions-dogecoin-wallstreetbets"&gt;cryptocurrencies&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;GameStop’s stock&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jS4Nve"&gt;Video games continue to be hugely popular — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215786/video-games-covid-19-animal-crossing-among-us"&gt;more than half of Americans turned to video games during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; — and retro games have already had a recent history of becoming collectors’ items. Just over a year ago, a sealed copy of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; claimed the record of being the most expensive video game ever &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21320274/super-mario-bros-sealed-copy-auction-record-most-expensive-game-ever"&gt;by selling for $114,000&lt;/a&gt;, a figure that was huge at the time but is less than a tenth of what &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; just auctioned for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uhAsK"&gt;Kohler expects that the next game to break the million-dollar threshold could be a very early printing of The &lt;em&gt;Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt;, like what sold this month, or another &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; Danielle Smith, owner of Nerdy Girl Comics, agrees. “I think that the market has kind of spoken for itself and that Mario is king and Zelda is queen of video games,” she said. Smith also said that &lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; for the Sega Genesis could potentially be a valuable title. That’s not only because of his &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21133092/sonic-the-hedgehog-movie-review-paramount"&gt;cultural cache right now&lt;/a&gt;: “&lt;em&gt;Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt; sealed is really hard to come by,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RDgMDu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The supply of sealed video games is much lower than many other collectibles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Aqad2v"&gt;It’s not just &lt;em&gt;Sonic&lt;/em&gt;. People who are coming into collecting top-notch games may find that supply is much lower than it is in other collectibles markets. “I think that we are going to continue to see record breaking sales [in games],” said Deniz Kahn, president and founder of Wata Games, the company that evaluated both &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; for quality before they were listed for auction. “At the end of the day, there’s just simply not enough supply of these high end, high grade, sealed, vintage video games to satiate the demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7QKHV"&gt;That’s slightly different than other collectible categories. “Over the last few years there have been a lot of people who have started collecting other areas, like comics or coins or cards, and their markets are very mature,” he said. In comics, “at this point all of the copies of &lt;em&gt;Action Comics #1&lt;/em&gt; have been flushed out of attics into collectors’ hands. People in the [gaming] hobby — collectors, investors — we’re all realizing that the populations of these sealed games are so incredibly low when you compare them to, say, sports cards or comic books,” he added. “There aren’t hundreds of these in high, perfect grade out there. In some cases, there’s one, or 10, or five.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUTa9Z"&gt;Another thing that may be driving up prices is that the games are selling at public auction, meaning that everyone can see the price of an eventual sale. Before that, according to Kahn, “when a five figure video game sale would occur, which was a big deal four or five years ago, I knew about it and maybe 10 other guys knew about it. It all happened behind closed doors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="C0GIgk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The company that graded the million-dollar copy of Super Mario 64 has a new owner","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577409/wata-games-acquired-collectors-universe-video-game-grading-super-mario-64-legend-of-zelda"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="PnGd8U"&gt;All of the recent record holders have been sold on Heritage Auctions, and the games sold have been graded for quality by Wata Games &lt;a href="https://www.watagames.com/what-we-do/wata-scale"&gt;on a 10-point scale&lt;/a&gt; similar to what’s used for comics. According to Kohler, the partnership between Wata and Heritage makes it safer for people to have confidence that the game they’re bidding on is of the quality that’s advertised. “You’re not just buying it from shadyguy123 on eBay,” he said. “You know you’re buying from Heritage Auctions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWJ9XC"&gt;“The sales that occur [on Heritage] are now almost an indicator of health,” Kahn said. “It’s a pulse on the market.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52z4cb"&gt;The person who bought the million-dollar &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; hasn’t come forward publicly, so it’s unclear exactly why they dropped such a huge amount of money on the one game. But Valarie McLeckie, consignment director of video games at Heritage Auctions, said that those who have been buying ultra-rare games are driven by nostalgia. “The types of people who are buying these games are seeking mint-condition examples of the games they played as a kid,” she said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVTO1C"&gt;Kahn speculates that for some, Nintendo 64 games may hit that nostalgia sweet spot that encourages them to buy. “I think [for] the generation that’s really heavily getting involved in alternative assets, the Nintendo 64 era, for example, resonates a lot more with that demographic,” he said. “I think that might also be the reason that we’re all very surprised that the first million-dollar-plus video game was a Nintendo 64 game. I don’t think anyone could have predicted that. But it goes to show the power of emotion and nostalgia and how much of a role that plays despite all the other factors that drive demand.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FLDh3m"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The high prices could have a positive impact on video game preservation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LUp170"&gt;These record-breaking sales could have a positive impact on video game preservation, which is already a challenging problem due to the way &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/15/21516254/video-game-history-foundation-secret-of-monkey-island-code"&gt;technology changes and decays&lt;/a&gt;. If more people try to sell their video games to get in on the market, treasures that had been buried could see the light of day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQ2xbw"&gt;“What I think that people do not understand is that so much stuff, even to this day, gets thrown in the trash,” Kohler said. “If there’s one really great beneficial impact that something like this is going to have — especially because it passed that magical million dollar number where everybody, the mainstream news, is all paying attention to it — the beneficial impact this has is [that] fewer people will throw away their video games.”&lt;/p&gt;

Amazon is honoring this deal, too, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08J5RBMRN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;even going a bit lower with a $265 price&lt;/a&gt; (though, act fast as Amazon’s stock tends to sell out faster than Best Buy’s). The thing is, this price cut is limited to the Product Red colorway that has a red aluminum case and a red sport band. This is great news for people who can’t get enough of the color red in their lives, but it’s probably not most people’s first choice in terms of how they’d like their Apple Watch to look. It’s hard to argue with the price, though. We’ve seen it sell for $20 less than this, but not since late in April. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review of the Apple Watch Series 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

You can pick up a set for $170. These originally sold for $230, but have dropped down to $200 on occasion. This model has active noise cancellation, and their ability to pair with two devices at once via Bluetooth makes them unique among competitors like the AirPods Pro and Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HDyhWB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10369683"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M5ZGw4"&gt;In other headphone news, if you happen to be in the market for a pair of noise-canceling, wireless headphones that are good, but not too expensive, look no further than Sony’s WH-1000XM3. Their name doesn’t roll off the tongue, but the value at this price is indisputably great. These are comfy, over-ear headphones that sound wonderful and block out all sorts of noise. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743780474724360893#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;They’re on sale at Best Buy for $170&lt;/a&gt; through Sunday, their most affordable price to date. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/11/17844914/sony-1000x-m3-review-noise-canceling-headphones" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="euUcED"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326538"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xy3Y8h"&gt;At Best Buy, you can land a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747056866988464304" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;complimentary 128GB microSD card when you purchase a Nintendo Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt; at MSRP ($200). That’s a solid promo, as a microSD card is something that a large percentage of Switch owners will likely find themselves in need of quickly. The Switch Lite has 32GB of storage built-in, and that’s only enough for a few games. So, if you’re shopping for a Switch Lite, get it at Best Buy to have this freebie added to your cart at checkout.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="JxRwjn"&gt;Nomad, a company that makes leather goods to both protect and make your tech look more spiffy, is hosting its summer sale through Sunday.

It’s a fantastic deal for a game of its size and quality, but it’s an even better deal if you were hoping not to shell out the full amount to get the enhanced director’s cut for the PS4 or PS5 when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559264/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-sony-ps4-ps5-sucker-punch-iki-island" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;launches on August 20th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt; owners will need to spend $29 to upgrade if playing on either console, so you’ll have spent $60 in total by taking advantage of this deal instead of $70. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21323144/ghost-of-tsushima-review-ps4-game-developer-samurai" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1L3M8j"&gt;Deals on Apple’s iPad are more common than you might think. Whether you’re after the affordable iPad, the high-end iPad Pro, or something in between like the iPad Air or iPad Mini, there’s usually some sort of price cut happening somewhere. Of course, it’s difficult to know exactly where you can find those deals unless you’re looking around at all of the major retailers. But that’s what we’re doing each day when we hunt for deals, so let us help you out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzVhpS"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each of the current iPads available for purchase. Most of the time, there’s some sort of discount happening on a new or refurbished model. When there is a deal we think worth telling you about, we’ll let you know, along with any info you need to keep it in context. If there isn’t a current deal, we’ll tell you how much the most recent sale price was for, so you’ll know when to take the plunge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FhF14P"&gt;Just to let you know up top, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fus-hed%2Fshop%2Fback-to-school&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21280354%2Fbest-ipad-deals-apple" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s back-to-school promotion has already kicked off&lt;/a&gt;, meaning you can snag a free set of AirPods with the purchase of either an iPad Air or iPad Pro. Granted, you have to be a student who’s eligible to check out at Apple’s educational storefront. If you prefer the AirPods Pro, you can also upgrade for an additional $90.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DMtl0v"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="hb2n3u"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;iPad (2020)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q5ZrvP"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;2020 iPad&lt;/a&gt; is Apple’s most affordable tablet, usually costing $329 for the model with 32GB of storage or $429 for the model with 128GB of storage. Each has a 10.2-inch display and features the A12 Bionic processor, a Touch ID fingerprint sensor, and a Smart Connector for connecting a Smart Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hDQ0n6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508346"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5m6ZrK"&gt;Currently, you can purchase the base iPad with 32GB of storage for $299 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-10-2-inch-iPad-8th-Gen-Wi-Fi-32GB-Space-Gray%2F989344107%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeiPadDeals3292021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-10-2-inch-Wi-Fi-32GB/dp/B08J65DST5/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=ipad+2020&amp;amp;qid=1621350979&amp;amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzSkVCMDZaTjVCV0VFJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMDM2OTM2RjNHV0xNUDNHUDk1JmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTAyMjg1ODkyMVFXT0lITjVaR0hZJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h2 id="fmPtFu"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;iPad mini (2019)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgBOt3"&gt;Apple released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18274477/ipad-mini-2019-review-apple-ios-pencil-lightning-specs-price-tablet"&gt;latest iPad mini&lt;/a&gt; in early 2019, equipped with the same 7.9-inch display and design as previous iterations, but with refreshed internal specs. It has the same A12 Bionic processor found in the base iPad, along with Wi-Fi support. Apple sells 64GB and 256GB models of the iPad mini, with prices set at $399 and $549 respectively. If you want LTE connectivity, the starting price is $529 for the 64GB model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rG7i7T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515887"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QD0sMe"&gt;Sales on the basic Wi-Fi model are rare, but if you want to buy the 64GB iPad mini right now, it is available for &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB%2F207104625%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$369 in space gray&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-iPad-mini-Wi-Fi-64GB-Gold%2F430392594%3Fselected%3Dtrue" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;rose gold&lt;/a&gt; at Walmart. There is also a sale on the 256GB model, which is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ8XKZC?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for $490 in rose gold&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="66nPkj"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;iPad Air (2020)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5sW0N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;2020 iPad Air&lt;/a&gt; has a slightly larger 10.9-inch display compared to the prior model’s 10.5-inch screen and features thinner bezels around it. It has relocated the Touch ID fingerprint sensor to the power button, located on the top of the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGT87b"&gt;The fourth-gen iPad Air model comes in 64GB or 256GB storage configurations. The Wi-Fi models start at $599 and $749, respectively, making the starting price slightly more than last year’s models. The model that supports LTE starts at $729. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JhHVno"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546269"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FkUXn4"&gt;Fortunately, if you’ve been waiting for a sizable discount on the iPad Air, the 64GB model with Wi-Fi is available for $499 — $100 off the list price — in all colorways at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J61FCVN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fapple-10-9-inch-ipad-air-latest-model-4th-generation-with-wi-fi-64gb-sky-blue%2F5985620.p%3FacampID%3D0%26cmp%3DRMX%26irclickid%3DQJaSroQtuxyLRzW0UfQwQyYMUkBU1gykExnTVM0%26irgwc%3D1%26loc%3DNarrativ%26mpid%3D376373%26ref%3D198%26skuId%3D5985620&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Both retailers are also currently knocking $100 off the 256GB model with Wi-Fi (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J63W44Q/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747064649800318667#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;), with the former taking an additional &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08J6FTH75/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$10 off the rose gold configuration&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7PfM3l"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro (2020)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9tR4OQ"&gt;The fifth-gen, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M1-equipped iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is now widely available, which means there are plenty of deals to be had on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192146/apple-ipad-pro-review-2020-lidar-a12z-processor-speed-camera-trackpad-keyboard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;2020 iteration of the iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. The fourth-gen iPad Pro looks a lot like the 2018 model, aside from its dual-lens rear camera array. Unlike the less expensive iPad models, the 2020 iPad Pro ditches the headphone jack and uses a USB-C port instead of a Lightning port. It also features a high refresh display and Face ID to help you unlock the tablet instead of relying on the Touch ID fingerprint sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dnrxd6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9515999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lvMKy"&gt;If you’re looking for the 11-inch, 2020 iPad Pro, it’s currently available on clearance in multiple configurations at Best Buy and Target. As far as the Wi-Fi models go, the 128GB model is &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/3PjGgM" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounted to $700 at Target&lt;/a&gt;, and the 256GB model is available for $800 at both &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/3PjGgM" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747067025091069041#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The latter retailer is also selling the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065575324374726#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065628094129232#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB&lt;/a&gt; variants for $1,000 $1,200, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQi2tt"&gt;The same $100 discount at Best Buy applies to the 12.9-inch model, too. If you prefer the Wi-Fi model, the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065737279860353#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model&lt;/a&gt; is discounted to $900, the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065769538440219#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model&lt;/a&gt; to $1,000, the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065793668725731#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB model&lt;/a&gt; to $1,200, and the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747065843218873803#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;1TB model&lt;/a&gt; to $1,400.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Zobp6q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9737960"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0LPHck"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iPad Pro (2021)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="M0IoQA"&gt;The 2020 iPad Pro is great, but if display quality is the most important thing to you, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;12.9-inch iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt; is the way to go. The larger, fifth-gen model makes use of a Mini LED display, which is engineered to bring about deeper blacks and better contrast, much like OLED technology. Additionally, both the 11- and 12.9-inch iPad Pros tout Apple’s blazing-fast M1 chip — the same processor found in the latest Mac computers — and new features like Center Stage, a software innovation that zooms and pans to keep you centered in the frame while participating in video calls. They’re the most impressive and expensive iPads to date, with the 11- and 12-inch configurations typically starting at $799 and $1,099, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5hP3e"&gt;If you do want the latest model, however, the 11-inch, 128GB iPad Pro with Wi-Fi is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-11-inch-Wi-Fi-Cellular-128GB/dp/B09328WZPR/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for $50 off&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $749. The 12.9-inch model with Wi-Fi is also &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932D45W8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $999&lt;/a&gt;, the second-best price we’ve seen on Apple’s high-end tablet to date.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LeOAFFIkXYozdeIB8E_xA9aqhlg=/110x0:1330x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/joy_con_01.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch was, like most consoles during the pandemic, once in short supply. Thankfully, retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart now routinely stock the Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite in multiple color configurations and models, giving those who struck out ample opportunity to purchase Nintendo’s versatile console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DW6Flb"&gt;We’re keeping an eye across the web to find where you can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;Nintendo Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt; (the portable-only version of the console), and the forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;Nintendo Switch OLED model&lt;/a&gt;, as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — new, preowned, or otherwise — may still occasionally sell out as a result of the pandemic. However, we’ll do our best to keep this article current with the latest in-stock offers. When something gets sold out, we’ll try to let you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch or Switch Lite right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qcOiY9"&gt;Over at Amazon, you can buy an updated Nintendo Switch model with gray Joy-Cons, plus a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YMM3RHZ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;64GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $314&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re looking to upgrade, Amazon is offering two additional bundles, one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YBVJRD7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $326&lt;/a&gt; and one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YMJ4XBP?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $344&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ueoxw3"&gt;You can purchase the updated Nintendo Switch model &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07VJRZ62R?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with gray Joy-Cons&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07VGRJDFY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red and blue Joy-Cons&lt;/a&gt; for $300 at Amazon, &lt;a href="http://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;veh=aff&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fquery%3Dnintendo%2520switch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746299173080046926" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy,&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-with-neon-blue-and-neon-red-joy-con%2F11095819.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Gamestop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/AomY2j" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li id="fiSvia"&gt;If you’re not against buying a preowned or refurbished console, you’ll want to check out &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fswitch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-with-gray-joy-con%2F206007.html%3Fgclid%3DCjwKCAiAt9z-BRBCEiwA_bWv-HzeKt4-dsaWdi9G9SGmxFTUUEAxrCA4NxZS0xEWCkIacwTZ_cUKPRoCEYUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. Another good place to look is &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo’s online store, where you can often find refurbished Switch consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, Nintendo is offering the &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch-gray-gray-joy-con-refurbished-2.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen Nintendo Switch with gray Joy-Cons&lt;/a&gt; for $260, in addition to most color configurations of the Switch Lite for $170.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tL1zU6"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch OLED right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FefR8R"&gt;The forthcoming Nintendo Switch OLED model &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578368/nintendo-switch-oled-preorder-time-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;opened for preorders on July 15th&lt;/a&gt;, with the initial preorder stock selling out within minutes. The higher-end Switch model — which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;officially goes on sale on October 8th&lt;/a&gt; for $350 — offers a slew of improvements, most notably a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22566479/oled-nintendo-switch-vs-lite-screen-size" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;vibrant 7-inch OLED display&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564942/nintendo-switch-oled-screen-new-kickstand" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;improved kickstand&lt;/a&gt; that offers far greater stability. The speakers get a bit louder and offer a touch more clarity, too, and there’s a wired ethernet port built directly into the dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AJPPsv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo Switch OLED hands-on: a small upgrade that makes a big difference","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="sxXvjE"&gt;Although preorders for both models have come and gone since initially opening, as of the time of this writing, both configurations of the Nintendo Switch OLED are unavailable for preorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8hV7z9"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Nintendo Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hgAR00"&gt;Frankly, the Switch comes with everything that you need to get started and have fun. However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jnXhNd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556339"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9sHCpf"&gt;First off, a MicroSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage. Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers regularly sell cards with up to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GXXKY6P/ref=asc_df_B08GXXKY6P/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for around $60&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GYG5SVQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;400GB microSD card will cost you around $45&lt;/a&gt;, and with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes, the card has enough space to store several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Agp45r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10397609"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdvLy"&gt;Let’s talk quickly about controllers. The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some Super Mario Party titles require the Joy-Cons to play. If you are looking for a Switch Pro controller, both &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-black-wireless-pro-controller%2F141756.html%3Fgclid%3DCj0KCQjw0emHBhC1ARIsAL1QGNchiWTVbB56sBuEbLjc76K169WZpHUSFCnyWf2W_sbAwyKf3XbqzX0aAiS9EALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Black%2F55485228&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; also have the Switch Pro controller for $59, knocking $11 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2BZPIqmUqpLcZoV5GVxdxMULT3I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9537475/akrales_171025_2091_0010.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UODwlY"&gt;Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ulULMw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N3ASPNV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A two-pack of amFilm tempered glass protectors for the Nintendo Switch is $6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="cx5X9k"&gt;If you want to play online with friends, ensure that your saves are backed up in the cloud, and get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era, you’ll want to get a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $20 per year for a single user&lt;/a&gt; on a console or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KY69YFM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35 a year for up to eight users on different consoles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlFlVd"&gt;Right now, Eneba offers a discounted &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergeGameSubscriptionDeals2021&amp;amp;clickref2=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fnintendo-nintendo-switch-online-membership-12-months-eshop-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-year, individual membership for around $19&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
