    <title>The Raspberry Pi Pico is a tiny $4 microcontroller running off the company’s very own chip</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Raspberry Pi Foundation&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bfMCrH"&gt;The Raspberry Pi Foundation’s tiny computers can be used for anything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21306907/diy-camera-raspberry-pi-high-quality-how-to-build-video-c-cs-mount-lenses"&gt;homemade cameras&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/now-added-cucumbers/"&gt;cucumber sorters&lt;/a&gt;, and now, the group is branching out into microcontrollers and custom silicon. &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-silicon-pico-now-on-sale/"&gt;The Raspberry Pi Pico&lt;/a&gt; is the first step. It’s a new $4 microcontroller that’s smaller than the average Pi, features a custom chip powerful enough to be used in machine learning projects (according to The Raspberry Pi Foundation), and is on sale now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQ949x"&gt;In its &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/raspberry-pi-silicon-pico-now-on-sale/"&gt;introductory blog post&lt;/a&gt;, the company explains that today’s Raspberry Pis are already often used alongside a smaller microcontroller: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="9c8SeO"&gt;The Raspberry Pi takes care of heavyweight computation, network access, and storage, while the microcontroller handles analogue input and low-latency I/O and, sometimes, provides a very low-power standby mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZzLkdv"&gt;Now, the company has one of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Les6Wt"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o-tRJPCv0GA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yyd1nJ"&gt;In a first for the microcomputer maker, the Pico is powered by a custom chip designed in house called the RP2040. The Pico board features the new chip, 2MB of flash memory, a clickable button, and a Micro USB Type B port. Here are the RP2040’s full specs:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="UOji8r"&gt;Dual-core Arm Cortex-M0+ @ 133MHz&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ARe7Se"&gt;264KB (remember kilobytes?) of on-chip RAM&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRIfVW"&gt;Support for up to 16MB of off-chip Flash memory via dedicated QSPI bus&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BP8CB"&gt;DMA controller&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGGVkK"&gt;Interpolator and integer divider peripherals&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PqDJyz"&gt;30 GPIO pins, 4 of which can be used as analogue inputs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NHWRLp"&gt;2 × UARTs, 2 × SPI controllers, and 2 × I2C controllers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6VnZ5"&gt;16 × PWM channels&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPoDRQ"&gt;1 × USB 1.1 controller and PHY, with host and device support&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgPQOu"&gt;8 × Raspberry Pi Programmable I/O (PIO) state machines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RjXH9o"&gt;USB mass-storage boot mode with UF2 support, for drag-and-drop programming&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="9cZHMz"&gt;Those specs might go in one ear and out the other, but the best way to illustrate the potential for a new Raspberry Pi product is to see it used in something cool. The Raspberry Pi Foundation is partnering with companies like Arduino, Adafruit, and Pimoroni to integrate the new RP2040 chip into other boards and gadgets. There’s a whole list in the blog post announcing the Pico, but a few notable ones are &lt;a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/picosystem"&gt;Pimoroni’s PicoSystem&lt;/a&gt; game console, Adafruit’s &lt;a href="https://adafruit.com/feather2040"&gt;Feather RP 2040 board&lt;/a&gt;, and the Arduino &lt;a href="https://blog.arduino.cc/2021/01/20/welcome-raspberry-pi-to-the-world-of-microcontrollers/"&gt;Nano RP2040 Connect&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4jrAR"&gt;The Raspberry Pi Pico is available now from &lt;a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-pico/"&gt;approved resellers&lt;/a&gt; for $4. The microcontroller will also be given away for free in February issues of &lt;a href="https://hackspace.raspberrypi.org/issues/39"&gt;&lt;em&gt;HackSpace magazine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden orders masks to be worn on airplanes, trains, and public transportation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Subway Train in New York City" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eQuIh_EXAXE4y-WtzHdwByzgrSE=/0x0:5472x3648/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68701876/1257624396.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Gary Hershorn / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gP1uTd"&gt;President Joe Biden issued an executive order Thursday requiring masks to be worn on public transportation. It was the latest abrupt change from his predecessor Donald Trump, who actively blocked the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from issuing a similar order last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyFpw5"&gt;The order mandates that passengers and employees wear face coverings on planes, trains, buses, subways, and other modes of public transportation. “Ensuring that people can safely travel will be critical for families and to jump starting the economy,” the Biden administration writes in its &lt;a href="https://int.nyt.com/data/documenttools/national-strategy-for-the-covid-19-response/c7bd8ecb9308d669/full.pdf"&gt;COVID-19 response plan&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4DXbb"&gt;The Trump administration killed an earlier effort to require masks on transportation, arguing the decision should be up to individual states and localities. Trump also spent many crucial months of the pandemic implying face masks were unnecessary, effectively politicizing the issue of mask-wearing. The CDC had proposed requiring face coverings, but the White House coronavirus task force, headed by former Vice President Mike Pence, refused to discuss it, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/09/health/coronavirus-covid-masks-cdc.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7JYtl3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Trump administration killed an earlier effort to require masks on transportation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Cuya5"&gt;Public health officials have uniformly recommended the wearing of masks to curb the spread of the coronavirus, particularly in crowded, poorly ventilated areas. &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/face-masks-public-transportation.html"&gt;On its website&lt;/a&gt;, the CDC “strongly recommends” wearing masks on transportation to reduce the chance of getting and spreading COVID-19 — though now that recommendation will be backed up with the force of a presidential mandate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avCkVP"&gt;Mass transit ridership has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179032/public-transportation-coronavirus-covid19-ridership-nyc-sf-la-dc"&gt;plummeted&lt;/a&gt; in the year since the coronavirus was first detected in the US. For example, ridership on New York City’s notoriously packed commuter trains &lt;a href="https://new.mta.info/coronavirus/ridership"&gt;dropped&lt;/a&gt; 92 percent in mid-April when the city emerged as an epicenter of the global health crisis. Riders have begun to return to public transportation, but ridership numbers are still lagging behind their pre-pandemic levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmOlCP"&gt;Some municipalities took steps to enforce their own mask rules. The MTA, for example, over the summer began imposing a $50 fine on riders who refused to wear a mask. But the New York Police Department rarely hands out tickets: as of November, the department had only fined 15 people for noncompliance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfbs1q"&gt;There is little evidence that mass transit poses a particular risk for COVID-19 outbreaks. While the US lags behind other countries with regard to contact tracing, &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/there-is-little-evidence-that-mass-transit-poses-a-risk-of-coronavirus-outbreaks/"&gt;experts agree&lt;/a&gt; that riding trains and buses is much safer if all of the passengers and employees are wearing masks.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mIEDJA"&gt;Airlines have also been left to enforce their own mask rules. Most major airlines have eliminated any medical exemptions to their rules, and several are cracking down on the types of face coverings allowed. All airlines insist passengers wear a mask as soon as they enter an airport and to keep it on throughout the travel journey except to briefly remove it to drink or eat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUhzaS"&gt;The new order was issued on the same day that Biden’s nominee for transportation secretary, former Mayor of South Bend, Indiana, Pete Buttigieg, will sit for his Senate confirmation hearing. Buttigieg is expected to play a pivotal role in Biden’s push for a bipartisan infrastructure deal. The president has vowed to spend $1.3 trillion to build new schools, roads, bridges, railroads, and pipes, while also expanding broadband access and attacking climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KhFpx5"&gt;During the hearing, Buttigieg said Biden was prepared to enforce its new mask mandate across multiple federal agencies. “We were prepared to make sure that we use all relevant authorities to enforce the president’s executive order,” he said, “to ensure that across every mode of transportation, workers, passengers, and commuters are protected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJkfr8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Otter.ai’s new Chrome extension can transcribe Google Meet calls in real time</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h8FuOr49gjn1nckVi09bNk6LoUA=/3x322:960x960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68701806/Otter_Google_Meet.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A render showing how Otter.ai’s Chrome extension works in Google Meet.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Otter.ai&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JVSaMk"&gt;You can now use automated transcription service Otter.ai to transcribe and provide closed captions for Google Meet calls with the help of a new Chrome extension. Meetings will be transcribed in real time, and transcripts will be saved right to your Otter account so you can access and share them later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkdaRd"&gt;Otter.ai says the extension works with all of its plans, meaning even free users will be able to take advantage of the tool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RCZYZO"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iu2N44Por-4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PfDO2M"&gt;To set it up, first download the Otter.ai &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/otterai/bnmojkbbkkonlmlfgejehefjldooiedp?hl=en"&gt;Chrome extension here&lt;/a&gt;. Once you’ve installed it, head over to &lt;a href="http://meet.google.com"&gt;meet.google.com&lt;/a&gt; and then click on the Otter extension. (You might need to click the puzzle piece icon to open the extensions menu to find it.) Then, you may be prompted to log in to use the extension, though I was already logged in when I tested it. From there, log into your meeting, tap the “record” button from the Otter extension, and you should see the transcription start to fill out in real time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFvTTw"&gt;You can also activate closed captions by clicking the button with “cc” surrounded by a box in the Otter window. But Google Meet already offers a closed captions feature, which you can turn on by clicking a similar icon in the menu at the bottom of a Meet window, so picking which to use will be a matter of personal preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJSi1a"&gt;Otter.ai doesn’t just do live transcriptions of Google Meet calls; the service also integrates &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21232385/otter-ai-live-video-meeting-notes-zoom-transcription-annotation-teams"&gt;directly with Zoom&lt;/a&gt;. But to use Otter’s integrated live transcriptions in Zoom, you’ll need to be on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21232385/otter-ai-live-video-meeting-notes-zoom-transcription-annotation-teams"&gt;paid Otter and Zoom plan&lt;/a&gt;, unlike with Google Meet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>President Biden to use Defense Production Act for masks, vaccines</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="N95 Masks Production In Mexico City" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n2I4xpmy1lUFYwgPflRCVam4Gho=/0x2:5200x3469/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68701764/1214498089.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo credit should read Carlos Tischler / Eyepix Group/Barcroft Media via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Icj1fz"&gt;President Joe Biden will direct federal agencies to use the Defense Production Act to ramp up the supply of masks, testing kits, and vaccine materials. The action is part of a blitz of executive orders Biden has issued during his first few days in office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IlVWEZ"&gt;“We’ve already identified suppliers and are working with them to move the plan forward,” Biden &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1352342243441426432"&gt;said in a briefing today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KIDuAS"&gt;The administration hopes the DPA can accelerate vaccine production. &lt;a href="https://www.law360.com/compliance/articles/1346836/how-defense-production-act-may-affect-vaccine-supply-chain"&gt;The plan&lt;/a&gt; highlights the need for more vials that hold the vaccine doses, syringes to deliver it, and dry ice critical to their transport. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pq2p5Z"&gt;“We’ll do whatever we need to do to ensure that we have an adequate supply of vaccine,” &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/21/biden-10-executive-orders-pandemic-460996"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; Tim Manning, Biden’s COVID-19 supply coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PGoCmD"&gt;The administration will also direct the act to target masks and personal protective equipment (PPE). Shortages of these products aren’t quite as dire as they were early on in the pandemic, but health care workers are &lt;a href="https://getusppe.org/ppe-shortage-briefing-fair-distribution-algorithm-and-equitable-vaccine-delivery/"&gt;still in need of more N95 masks&lt;/a&gt;, which protect the wearer in high-risk situations like when treating COVID-19 patients. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DnrFTy"&gt;Increasing production of masks could also improve protection for the general public. Most Americans are &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/01/why-arent-we-wearing-better-masks/617656/"&gt;still wearing cloth masks&lt;/a&gt;. Those types of masks can help blunt the spread of the virus, but they aren’t as effective as surgical or N95s. Other countries are making medical-grade masks &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jan/20/france-may-follow-germany-in-making-clinical-masks-mandatory"&gt;mandatory&lt;/a&gt;. As the more contagious coronavirus strain starts to spread in the US, experts worry cloth masks won’t offer enough protection. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hPJzAp"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/cloth-face-cover-guidance.html"&gt;still says&lt;/a&gt; members of the general public should not buy surgical masks or N95s to conserve supply for health care workers. “Hopefully this gets utilized to bring better personal protection to the general public,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AbraarKaran/status/1352101961336721408"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Abraar Karan, a physician at Harvard Medical School working on the COVID-19 response, in response to news about the DPA. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0z5S92"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yes, vaccines are here, but so is B.1.1.7. We need to up our mask game, as &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AbraarKaran?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@abraarkaran&lt;/a&gt; emphasizes below: N95s for all. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MonicaGandhi9?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@MonicaGandhi9&lt;/a&gt; and I also wrote about better masks in &lt;a href="https://t.co/qzKPoQp7kf"&gt;https://t.co/qzKPoQp7kf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/AAGhfe9CDr"&gt;https://t.co/AAGhfe9CDr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/x9aA53CWBx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/x9aA53CWBx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Linsey Marr (@linseymarr) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/linseymarr/status/1347223352725876740?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S2NONl"&gt;Nurses and doctors have been calling for the White House to invoke the DPA to improve the supply of masks since early on in the pandemic. The American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association, and the American Nurses Association wrote to former President Donald Trump &lt;a href="https://www.aha.org/lettercomment/2020-03-21-aha-ama-and-ana-letter-president-use-dpa-medical-supplies-and-equipment"&gt;in March&lt;/a&gt; asking for him to use the act. The nurses &lt;a href="https://www.mcknights.com/news/clinical-news/nurses-ask-feds-to-invoke-defense-production-act-for-n95-masks-survey-finds-unacceptable-reuse-levels/"&gt;asked again&lt;/a&gt; in September after surveys found continued shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfYLhL"&gt;Trump invoked the DPA a handful of times while in office, but experts and industry leaders say he didn’t use it to a degree sufficient enough to make a dent in the supply needs of the COVID-19 pandemic. “The Trump administration’s use of the DPA has been sporadic, vindictive and too late,” Scott Paul, president of the industry group the Alliance for American Manufacturing, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/22/health/Covid-Trump-Defense-Production-Act.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; this fall. “They have not wielded the tool very effectively.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge refuses to reinstate Parler’s Amazon account</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Parler logo seen displayed on..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4JVjXZiDe0q-k-7eej824oQacoY=/347x0:3368x2014/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68701756/1230527730.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tTkjMw"&gt;A Washington judge has &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wawd.294664/gov.uscourts.wawd.294664.34.0_2.pdf"&gt;denied social network Parler’s demand&lt;/a&gt; to be reinstated on Amazon Web Services. Following a hearing last week, Judge Barbara Rothstein declined to grant a preliminary injunction in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225072/parler-amazon-web-services-lawsuit-antitrust-twitter-capitol-riot-incitement-moderation"&gt;a lawsuit against Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, saying Parler provided “dwindlingly slight” evidence for an antitrust complaint and “failed to allege basic facts” of improper business activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qHTel4"&gt;While the case isn’t over, the ruling bodes ill for Parler’s chances in court. “Parler’s allegations at this time are both inaccurate and unsupported, and are disputed by evidence submitted by [Amazon Web Services],” Rothstein wrote in an order. Parler will need to find another web host or remain dormant while it continues its legal battle with Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y20deK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Parler’s allegations at this time are both inaccurate and unsupported.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5zcpRx"&gt;Rothstein was also unmoved by Parler’s claims that the suspension posed a devastating financial blow. She noted that Parler hadn’t denied that its users posted violent, detailed threats on the platform before and around Trump supporters’ January 6th attack on the US Capitol. While it promised to change its moderation policies, “forcing [Amazon] to host Parler’s users’ violent content would interfere with AWS’s ability to prevent its services from being used to promote — and, as the events of January 6, 2021 have demonstrated, even cause — violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bxOSF"&gt;Parler promotes itself as a more lightly moderated alternative to Twitter and Facebook, and it’s attracted supporters of former President Donald Trump, who lambasted those larger sites for labeling false claims that he won the 2020 election. But after the attack on the Capitol, web infrastructure companies cut ties. Apple and Google pulled Parler’s app from their app stores, and Amazon Web Services suspended its account, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;knocking the site offline&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMgFXy"&gt;Parler retaliated by suing the cloud hosting giant. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225072/parler-amazon-web-services-lawsuit-antitrust-twitter-capitol-riot-incitement-moderation"&gt;claimed Amazon had banned it&lt;/a&gt; from “political animus” and a desire to protect its competitor Twitter, which also uses Amazon Web Services. (Twitter is not a party to the lawsuit, although Parler has suggested it may sue companies besides Amazon.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MNtiJ8"&gt;Amazon, in turn, claimed Parler disregarded repeated warnings about violent threats. “We made our concerns known to Parler over a number of weeks and during that time we saw a significant increase in this type of dangerous content,” a spokesperson said. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22228675/amazon-parler-takedown-violent-threats-moderation-content-free-speech"&gt;That included&lt;/a&gt; detailed calls to violence against teachers, professional athletes, Black and Jewish people, and a swathe of specific politicians and tech executives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jpXGHH"&gt;Parler’s future remains uncertain, although much of its user content was &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7vqew/the-hacker-who-archived-parler-explains-how-she-did-it-and-what-comes-next"&gt;backed up by archivists&lt;/a&gt; before deletion. &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/parler-ceo-platform-strong-changes-free-speech"&gt;CEO John Matze told &lt;em&gt;Fox News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the platform wanted to “come back strong,” and its home page relaunched with a promise to “resolve any challenge before us and plan to welcome all of you back soon.” However, the network itself remains offline.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter’s decentralized social network project takes a baby step forward</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zEcvBUg2yiQRjDaUd9Ps32N5vkY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68701704/acastro_180130_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c7EIkH"&gt;Bluesky, Twitter’s decentralized social networking effort, has announced its first major update since 2019. The Bluesky team released a review of the decentralized web ecosystem and said it’s hoping to find a team lead in the coming months. The review follows Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510780043988992"&gt;discussing Bluesky&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, when he called it a “standard for the public conversation layer of the internet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPeahZ"&gt;The review &lt;a href="https://matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/twitter.modular.im/981b258141aa0b197804127cd2f7d298757bad20"&gt;outlines a variety&lt;/a&gt; of known decentralized systems. It includes ActivityPub, known for powering the social network Mastodon; the messaging standard XMPP, which powers WhatsApp and the now-defunct Google Talk; and Solid, a decentralization project led by World Wide Web creator Sir Tim Berners-Lee. The report covers how these systems handle key social network elements like discoverability, moderation, and privacy, as well as how services based on them can scale up, interoperate, and make money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gWusPr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Working virtually through the pandemic, this group self-organized, invited additional experts, and created a review of the ecosystem around protocols for social media. You can read it here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/U5DczWX1qb"&gt;https://t.co/U5DczWX1qb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— bluesky (@bluesky) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bluesky/status/1352302821140549632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="orec2v"&gt;This doesn’t tell us how Bluesky itself might operate. Dorsey said that Bluesky would “take time to build.” If it results in a protocol, that system might be created from scratch, or it might build on an existing standard like ActivityPub — a possibility Dorsey mentioned in 2019 upon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21010856/twitter-jack-dorsey-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-research-moderation"&gt;unveiling the initiative&lt;/a&gt;. “We are trying to do our part by funding an initiative around an open decentralized standard for social media. Our goal is to be a client of that standard for the public conversation layer of the internet,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510780043988992"&gt;he tweeted&lt;/a&gt; simply.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uvAgWf"&gt;However, the report offers a snapshot of who’s been working on Bluesky. It was authored by Jay Graber, creator of event-organizing platform Happening. Other contributors include Mastodon developer Eugen Rochko, peer-to-peer Beaker Browser co-creator Paul Frazee, ActivityPub standard co-editor Christopher Lemmer Webber, and InterPlanetary File System project lead Molly Mackinlay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WtubMD"&gt;It also hints at the fact that decentralization often isn’t profitable. The report focuses on monetization options like membership fees and cryptocurrency microtransactions, but it also notes that “many decentralized projects run on volunteer work and donations” — something that isn’t ideal for a platform supporting commercial networks like Twitter. That said, platforms have worked on systems like the Brave browser’s &lt;a href="https://brave.com/brave-rewards/"&gt;Basic Attention Token&lt;/a&gt;, a cryptocurrency-based system for sharing ad revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCvsh7"&gt;Given the long gap between Bluesky’s announcement and this early step, we may not see Twitter’s plans for a universal standard anytime soon, let alone see Twitter adopt that standard. As some decentralized developers mentioned in 2019, Twitter could also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21012553/twitter-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-developers-reaction-mastodon-activitypub"&gt;potentially do more good&lt;/a&gt; by contributing resources to existing projects — not trying to spearhead a unified standard. However, the new paper signals that Bluesky is trying to build on what people in the field have already discovered... even if we don’t know where it might go from there.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden appoints Jessica Rosenworcel as acting FCC chair</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="FCC Hearing" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pDl4EsX4-lyaZNte9Z4IcKwHvj4=/0x1:5501x3668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68701650/1144011213.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Williams / CQ Roll Call&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MQ2SCe"&gt;President Joe Biden &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/acting-chairwoman-rosenworcel-designation-lead-fcc"&gt;has appointed&lt;/a&gt; Democratic commissioner Jessica Rosenworcel to lead the Federal Communications Commission until an official chair is confirmed. Rosenworcel is the second woman to lead the agency as acting chair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFp4Qz"&gt;Rosenworcel was first nominated to the FCC by President Barack Obama and served from May 2012 to January 2017. She was later confirmed for an additional term in August 2017 where she currently serves as the most senior Democratic commissioner at the FCC. Over the course of her tenure at the FCC, Rosenworcel voted to impose and maintain net neutrality and pushed to close what she’s called the “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/17/21183589/fcc-commissioner-jessica-rosenworcel-homework-gap-editorial-wifi-hotspots-coronavirus"&gt;homework gap&lt;/a&gt;,” an effort to extend broadband to every child in the country.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YEbIEl"&gt;“I am honored to be designated as the Acting Chairwoman of the Federal Communications Commission by President Biden,” Rosenworcel said in a statement Thursday. “I thank the President for the opportunity to lead an agency with such a vital mission and talented staff. It is a privilege to serve the American people and work on their behalf to expand the reach of communications opportunity in the digital age.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DuAcB6"&gt;Over the last few weeks, advocacy groups have been pushing the incoming Biden administration to nominate Democratic commissioner Geoffrey Starks as the next FCC chair. Biden has focused on appointing diverse members to serve in his cabinet and agencies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F2H0Cq"&gt;“Starks has demonstrated and recently reaffirmed his commitment to digital equity through Net Neutrality and Title II, broadband expansion via the Lifeline program, and expanding the FCC’s E-rate program to ensure children have the access they need for online learning,” Rashad Robinson, Color of Change president, said in a statement last week. “The pandemic has underscored the reality that internet access is a clear equity issue — failing to meet this fact with policy will leave Black people behind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zjxunj"&gt;After Democrats took control of the Senate due to huge wins in the Georgia runoff elections, Biden has a better chance at quickly confirming whomever he chooses to lead the agency. &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/fcc-democrats-set-to-move-on-net-neutrality-broadband-subsidies"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg Law&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Democrats plan to reinstate net neutrality and expand broadband subsidies. The coronavirus pandemic has shined a light on broadband disparity in the US, and &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;said that Democrats at the FCC plan to move quickly in order to extend new funding for schools to purchase Wi-Fi hotspots and laptops for students.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4VSIb"&gt;Still, Rosenworcel may have difficulty pushing forward on the Biden administration’s agenda until the president’s third Democrat is confirmed in the Senate. It’s unclear who Biden will appoint to create a Democratic majority and whether that person would take over chairmanship once confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2auChY"&gt;Former FCC Chairman Ajit Pai stepped down on Wednesday after announcing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726572/ajit-pai-fcc-step-down-date-trump-telecom-net-neutrality"&gt;his plan to retire from the agency&lt;/a&gt; late last year. In his departing remarks, Pai said: “Serving the American people as Chairman of the FCC has been the greatest honor of my professional life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FIx61b"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cjkT5k"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Lhezox"&gt;If you are looking for a smartphone with a good camera but don’t want to spend a ton of money, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1615542-REG%2Fgoogle_ga1296_us_pixel_3_xl_64gb.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo is selling a 64GB unlocked Google Pixel 3 XL for $300&lt;/a&gt;. The phone was released in late 2018, but it is still a solid contender for people who prefer Google smartphones and want a camera that offers solid image quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIRiCl"&gt;The Google Pixel 3 XL includes a 6.3-inch QHD OLED screen display, a 12.2MP dual-pixel camera on the back, and two 8MP front-facing cameras. While this phone is almost three years old, it does come equipped with the latest Android 11 OS and will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200925/google-pixel-3-xl-discontinued-store-sales-phone-camera"&gt;also receive Android 12&lt;/a&gt;, which will launch sometime this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4DpoXd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10295850"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="j9zaOm"&gt;The Google Pixel 3 XL was one of the tech giant’s two flagship smartphones released in October 2018, with both phones being praised at the time for their front and rear cameras, larger displays, and clean designs. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21200925/google-pixel-3-xl-discontinued-store-sales-phone-camera"&gt;discontinued both phones last March&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aROE7p"&gt;For $300, the Pixel 3 XL seems like a great deal that delivers a ton of features and is ideal for people who are unconcerned about not having 5G support. If you’re looking for more information on the Pixel 3 XL, &lt;em&gt;The Verge’s&lt;/em&gt; Dieter Bohn gives an in-depth look &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17973484/google-pixel-3-xl-review-camera-features-screen-battery-price-photos"&gt;in his review&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this report about the US military endangering passenger jets by blocking GPS  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cFo7x-GLuQcYwJCjvhIzea05-BU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68701377/acastro_200327_3953_boeing_computer_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3dR9wz"&gt;Mark Harris, writing for&lt;em&gt; IEEE Spectrum&lt;/em&gt;, has come out with &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/aviation/faa-files-reveal-a-surprising-threat-to-airline-safety-the-us-militarys-gps-tests"&gt;a chilling report about how military testing is leading to confusion among pilots&lt;/a&gt; — and sometimes putting them in danger. The piece goes into why the US military is jamming GPS in American airspace and recounts some of the times it’s almost gotten civilians killed. If you’re a frequent flyer or are interested in when military testing bleeds into everyday life, it’s well worth the read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cOzScM"&gt;The military is carrying out the testing, ironically, to help develop technology to counteract GPS jamming. To be fair, it’s an understandable goal, as the article details the troubles that pilots face when a technology they heavily rely on goes away. But when that happens, the pilot at least has visual cues and other instruments. The article also goes into how, instead of completely cutting out the pilot’s GPS signal, the testing can end up feeding the pilot incorrect information, leading to thinking they’re somewhere they’re not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUzjdr"&gt;Each tangent the article goes on reveals worrying new details, like how pilots are warned that testing &lt;em&gt;may&lt;/em&gt; be happening, often leading to smooth flights and a “Chicken Little” situation where pilots have heard false warnings so many times that they’re not prepared for when it actually happens. There are also hints that the problem may be happening more often than even the Federal Aviation Administration realized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kdyitj"&gt;It’s some necessary reporting. Without the public being aware of the problem, there won’t be any calls to stop or bring greater transparency to the testing. When the military &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/15/14937904/declassified-nuclear-test-movies-youtube"&gt;carried out tests of nuclear bombs&lt;/a&gt;, it was at least obvious to people that something was happening, even if they were unaware of the radioactive particles (literally) raining down on them. Sometimes, pilots don’t even know that the military carries out GPS-jamming tests. So far, it doesn’t seem like the tests have killed anyone, but &lt;a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/aerospace/aviation/faa-files-reveal-a-surprising-threat-to-airline-safety-the-us-militarys-gps-tests"&gt;reading about the close calls described in the piece&lt;/a&gt; is harrowing, and it’s definitely worth your time. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="MbP9mO"&gt;Starting this week in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, you can have the Predator doing a Pelé victory dance while wielding TheGrefg’s gamepad pickaxe. On Thursday, a Faze Clan streamer played &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; with a Manchester City star while wearing Manchester City skins. The battle royale hit has long been known as a cross-promotional juggernaut, but developer Epic Games has recently taken things to a whole new level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="zaWkCp"&gt;Crossovers like these are by no means a new thing for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite.&lt;/em&gt; The game’s last season was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402707/fortnite-chapter-2-season-4-marvel-nexus-war-thor-iron-man"&gt;a multimonth Marvel mashup&lt;/a&gt;, there have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21027970/fortnite-winterfest-challenges-presents-star-wars-skins-emotes-gliders"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21019726/fortnite-star-wars-the-rise-of-skywalker-rey-finn-sith-trooper-skins-buy-now"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436283/fortnite-star-wars-x-wing-glider-epic-games-crossover"&gt;themed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/15/20966222/fortnite-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-crossover-event-stormtroopers"&gt;cosmetics&lt;/a&gt;, other real-world streamers added to the game include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21065235/ninja-fortnite-skin-announced-stream-tyler-blevins-available-date"&gt;Tyler “Ninja” Blevins&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/loserfruit-joins-the-fortnite-icon-series"&gt;Kathleen “Loserfruit” Belsten&lt;/a&gt;, and there have even been concerts (and accompanying in-game cosmetics) featuring huge artists like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18234980/fortnite-marshmello-concert-viewer-numbers"&gt;Marshmello&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IgOHCv"&gt;To me, the crossovers are part of the continuing appeal of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; — where else can I play as Kratos and face off against Iron Man? — and each new addition helps Epic build the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21068938/fortnite-ninja-skin-icon-series-metaverse-tyler-blevins-ultimate-virtual-world-star-wars"&gt;ultimate virtual world&lt;/a&gt;. But the crossovers also give Epic opportunities to bring in more cash, which might help make up for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21409351/apple-fortnite-ios-iphone-reinstall-how-to-terminate-developer-account"&gt;game’s absence on iOS&lt;/a&gt;. The battle royale hit is free to play, so each new brand appearance is a chance for Epic to get people to pay for items from the in-game store or sell one of its seasonal battle passes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Atdue"&gt;Don’t expect the crossovers to stop anytime soon. The Predator just joined &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, but Epic is already &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1352239528711344129"&gt;teasing the arrival&lt;/a&gt; of Sarah Connor from &lt;em&gt;The Terminator &lt;/em&gt;franchise. That probably means there will be a &lt;em&gt;Terminator&lt;/em&gt; cyborg skin, too — and if there is, that means you’ll be able to pit the Terminator against the Predator in a fight for the ages. Just hope that Mando doesn’t butt in.&lt;/p&gt;
