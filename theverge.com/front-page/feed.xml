    <title>Researcher says he found terrorist watchlist exposed online</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NHPNZz"&gt;Nearly 2 million terrorist watchlist records, including “no-fly” list indicators, were purportedly exposed online. The list was indexed across multiple search engines on July 19th, but the Department of Homeland Security did not remove it until three weeks later, &lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/secret-terrorist-watchlist-with-2-million-records-exposed-online/"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;Bleeping Computer &lt;/em&gt;Monday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttYGdl"&gt;Security Discovery researcher Volodymyr “Bob” Diachenko discovered the watchlist, which appears to be the product of the Terrorist Screening Center, last month. The files were indexed by multiple search engines in an easily readable format. Records included information like full names, citizenship status, date of birth, passport numbers, and no-fly indicators. No password or separate authentication was necessary to access it, Diachenko wrote in a &lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/americas-secret-terrorist-watchlist-exposed-web-report-diachenko/"&gt;LinkedIn post&lt;/a&gt; Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lFeAy1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I immediately reported it to Department of Homeland Security officials”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dt4K2D"&gt;“I immediately reported it to Department of Homeland Security officials, who acknowledged the incident and thanked me for my work,” Diachenko wrote. “The DHS did not provide any further official comment, though.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jW4ZKj"&gt;The server was indexed by search engines like Censys and ZoomEye on July 19th. Diachenko discovered the data that day and reported it to the Department of Homeland Security. It wasn’t until August 9th that the server was taken down. It’s unclear if any unauthorized users accessed the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxzKvC"&gt;The Terrorist Screening Center is a multi-agency center led by the FBI and responsible for managing the US’s terrorist watchlist. It produces a watchlist used by screening agencies like the DHS and Transportation Security Authority (TSA) to identify known or suspected terrorists attempting to enter the country by boarding aircrafts or obtaining visas. Databases like these contain extremely sensitive information related to US national security concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HEsjfk"&gt;It’s not unusual for&lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna25612748"&gt; innocent people&lt;/a&gt; to be put on the FBI’s no-fly list. In 2008, NBC reported that one US airline recorded 9,000 false positives in a single day. In 2010, the American Civil Liberties Union &lt;a href="https://www.aclu.org/cases/kashem-et-al-v-barr-et-al-aclu-challenge-government-no-fly-list?redirect=national-security/latif-et-al-v-holder-et-al-aclu-challenge-government-no-fly-list"&gt;filed a legal challenge&lt;/a&gt; on behalf of 10 US citizens or permanent residents who were falsely added to the no-fly list. In 2014, a court ruled that the government must notify citizens and permanent residents when they are placed on the list. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After Apple rejections, FlickType gives up on popular iPhone keyboard for the blind</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ehPF9Mv6r-SkJs0p-Rf_L-oS06g=/0x84:2016x1428/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69733034/flicktype_photo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9Upup9"&gt;If you’re a blind or low-vision iPhone user who relies on &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/flicktype-watch-keyboard/id1359485719"&gt;the FlickType keyboard&lt;/a&gt; to type, I’ve got some bad news — you’re about to become a casualty of the fight between Apple and one of its staunchest critics. Developer Kosta Eleftheriou has announced that he’s discontinuing the iPhone keyboard portion of his app, and says that keyboard will automatically be removed in a future update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HZuEIQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It's with a heavy heart today that we're announcing the discontinuation of our award-winning iPhone keyboard for blind users.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Apple has thrown us obstacle after obstacle for years while we try to provide an app to improve people's lives, and we can no longer endure their abuse. &lt;a href="https://t.co/cH1HCQzeP1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cH1HCQzeP1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FlickType Watch Keyboard (@FlickType) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlickType/status/1427292830523744257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="52ZqXA"&gt;You might have heard the entire app is going away, and that’s not actually true, Eleftheriou tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;In January 2020, he added a swipe-to-type Apple Watch keyboard to FlickType that saw the app skyrocket to the number one paid app in the entire Apple App Store for a time, and that app will continue to exist and continue to contain that Apple Watch keyboard.  Eleftheriou says the app has nearly half a million downloads, but he doesn’t have a breakdown for how many of those users rely on the iPhone keyboard specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The screenshot says “please enable full access for FlickType under the iOS Settings app.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nNV7oi5-nRWEhBwZwSWfE_mixVs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22786073/13_twS_I.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple provided Eleftheriou with this screenshot “proving” the app doesn’t work without access.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eXfm4m"&gt;If his name sounds familiar, that’s because Eleftheriou is the same developer who’s been poking holes in Apple’s App Store image for months, pointing out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;how egregious scams&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395907/apple-match-three-game-gambling-marina-misko-vegas-pirates-lucky-stars"&gt;secret gambling dens&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454468/ios-app-scam-review-3-star-force-review-process-apple"&gt;review fraud&lt;/a&gt; keep making it through the company’s filters even though they’re pretty easy for anyone to root out. His fight became personal long before today: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22336380/apple-app-store-scam-lawsuit-kosta-eleftheriou-flicktype-ios-developer"&gt;he sued Apple in March&lt;/a&gt; for some seemingly shady behavior, alleging that Apple erected roadblocks to his FlickType keyboard in order to convince him to sell the technology to Apple for a discount, all while scammy mobile keyboard apps flourished on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfBxvV"&gt;Now, says Eleftheriou, Apple has suddenly decided to reject FlickType yet again — and for a reason that he’s already successfully argued with them in the past. He shared the rejection letter with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s a pretty simple dispute: Apple says the keyboard needs to work even if a user doesn’t give it “full access” to network access and other iOS features. But Eleftheriou says that if Apple actually tried to use the app, or consulted their earlier discussions, they’d see that the keyboard works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="N9YGH5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We tried reaching out to Apple a total of 9 times last week, with no success. At this point they seem to be ignoring our attempts to contact them directly, despite previously explicitly telling us to "feel free" to contact them if we need "further clarification".&lt;/p&gt;— FlickType Watch Keyboard (@FlickType) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlickType/status/1427292841676398596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aqyvCH"&gt;To be clear, Apple’s &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Conceptual/ExtensibilityPG/CustomKeyboard.html"&gt;own developer guidelines specify&lt;/a&gt; that “full access” isn’t a problem: the only dispute here is whether the app continues to work if a user turns it off — which it does, says Eleftheriou, if you turn VoiceOver on. “They’d have to try it as a VoiceOver user, something that they don’t seem to bother doing. I’ve had several rejections in the past because the reviewer didn’t know anything about VoiceOver,” Eleftheriou says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KuUMt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FlickType/status/1427292843928821765"&gt;As his Twitter thread explains&lt;/a&gt;, Eleftheriou sees this as the final straw for this specific feature:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NEntkf"&gt;“Our rejection history already spans more than FOURTY pages filled with repeated, unwarranted, &amp;amp; unreasonable rejections that serve to frustrate &amp;amp; delay rather than benefit end-users. And dealing with App Review isn’t just time-consuming. It’s also very emotionally draining,” he writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nE4HhJ"&gt;Eleftheriou stops short of accusing Apple of retaliation, in a separate chat over Twitter DM. “I can only speculate about this rejection, but I’ve recently had many more rejections I haven’t talked about yet, and them ignoring my attempts to reach them is also new,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dg4tQe"&gt;“I can’t really know, but definitely feels like some kind of ‘special’ treatment going on,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnhdju"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter’s decentralized social network project finally has a leader</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5JF82CnR1GAYMnsKRU7c0TOsfuo=/186x0:1566x920/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69732847/Screen_Shot_2021_08_16_at_12.06.33_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bluesky&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a5TRaZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bluesky"&gt;Bluesky&lt;/a&gt;, the Twitter-funded effort &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21010856/twitter-jack-dorsey-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-research-moderation"&gt;to create a decentralized social network standard&lt;/a&gt;, has finally found a project lead — the creator of Happening, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/arcalinea?s=20"&gt;Jay Graber&lt;/a&gt;. Bluesky and Graber have also begun hiring for the project’s first developers, meaning the slowly gestating project might finally become a bit less “blue sky” and a bit more real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNcqU7"&gt;Besides experience leading the work on &lt;a href="https://happening.net/"&gt;Happening’s event organizing features&lt;/a&gt;, Graber worked on &lt;a href="https://z.cash/"&gt;Zcash&lt;/a&gt;, a cryptocurrency created by the Electric Coin Company that uses zero-knowledge cryptography to secure transactions. Graber was also one of the authors of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242718/twitter-bluesky-decentralized-social-media-team-project-update"&gt;a report Bluesky published in January&lt;/a&gt; detailing its research into decentralized web systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RDqoyR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I’m excited to announce that I’ll be leading &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bluesky?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@bluesky&lt;/a&gt;, an initiative started by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Twitter&lt;/a&gt; to decentralize social media. Follow updates on Twitter and at &lt;a href="https://t.co/Sg4MxK1zwl"&gt;https://t.co/Sg4MxK1zwl&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jay Graber (@arcalinea) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/arcalinea/status/1427314482154414080?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="izih4G"&gt;While the report didn’t explain how Bluesky itself would work, it did highlight some of the areas Graber and her team will have to address once the project brings on a &lt;a href="https://blueskyweb.org/Bluesky-Protocol-Developer.pdf"&gt;protocol developer&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blueskyweb.org/Bluesky-Web-Developer.pdf"&gt;web developer&lt;/a&gt; full time, like standards for moderation, privacy, and monetization. What’s less clear is if Bluesky will build on existing decentralized projects like ActivityPub, the social networking standard used in Mastodon, or create something new.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9rVVyc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Twitter wants to decentralize, but decentralized social network creators don’t trust it ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21012553/twitter-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-developers-reaction-mastodon-activitypub"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="bfp8ln"&gt;If you’re invested in Bluesky’s ongoing work in the space, especially now that there’s a leader to kick things into gear, Graber also shared that the project has &lt;a href="https://discord.com/invite/YmrHBhCuFa"&gt;a dedicated Discord to follow along with development&lt;/a&gt; and discuss elements of the project as they’re announced. Hopefully that happens more frequently now that Graber’s in charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f34fhJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tinder will make its ID Verification option available to all users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rYW02K6NPIfOSZym4lup82s1LkM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69732744/acastro_180822_1777_tinder_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Tinder is adding ID Verification option for all users  | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JEu6KZ"&gt;Tinder said on Monday that it will make its ID Verification feature available to all members around the world “in the coming quarters,” &lt;a href="https://www.tinderpressroom.com/2021-08-16-Tinder-Commits-to-ID-Verification-for-Members-Globally,-a-First-in-the-Dating-Category"&gt;according to a news release&lt;/a&gt;. The feature will allow users to verify their identities by uploading documentation; in Japan, where the feature has been live since 2019, a passport or license is typically used, but that may vary from place to place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8BXXC"&gt;The company said it will take into consideration recommendations from experts and input from Tinder members about which documents would be used in each country as well as local regulations and laws while it rolls out the feature. Tinder says it will use the feedback to ensure the process is inclusive and “privacy-friendly.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="stDxvj"&gt;Rory Kozoll, head of trust and safety product at Tinder, said the company is taking a “test-and-learn” approach to the ID verification launch. “We know one of the most valuable things Tinder can do to make members feel safe is to give them more confidence that their matches are authentic and more control over who they interact with,” Kozoll said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PTELt"&gt;ID Verification will initially be voluntary except as required by local law, and Tinder acknowledges that some users may not want to share their identities online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JkKODM"&gt;“We know that in many parts of the world and within traditionally marginalized communities, people might have compelling reasons that they can’t or don’t want to share their real-world identity with an online platform,” said Tracey Breeden, vice president of safety and social advocacy at Tinder parent company Match Group. “Creating a truly equitable solution for ID Verification is a challenging, but critical safety project and we are looking to our communities as well as experts to help inform our approach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ymgw5P"&gt;Tinder has continued adding safety-focused features to its app; last year it added a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/23/21077423/tinder-photo-verification-blue-checkmark-safety-center-launch-noonlight"&gt;photo verification system&lt;/a&gt; that adds a blue check mark to users’ dating profiles. And in March, Match Group announced an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22327854/match-group-garbo-tinder-background-check-update"&gt;investment in background check firm Garbo&lt;/a&gt; and said it would make the technology available to Tinder users, although it hasn’t done so yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szFz4k"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Peloton says a fix is ready for one of its treadmill recalls</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UvGeXho1-x0DLhmkjzfef2g6TiY=/120x0:1080x640/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69732608/PELOTON_TREAD.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Peloton&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0YnZ0T"&gt;Peloton is ready to address at least one of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420918/peloton-treadmill-recall-tread-accidents-cpsc-voluntary-refund"&gt;treadmill recalls&lt;/a&gt;. Regular Tread owners can now get their equipment fixed, which will involve a technician coming to users’ homes. They can schedule the visit starting this month. The company recalled both the Tread Plus, its more expensive first treadmill, and the Tread, its newer, cheaper device, in May after reports of multiple injuries and at least one death on the Tread Plus. There were 18 incidents of the regular Tread’s touchscreen falling and causing minor cuts and bruises in the UK and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xk8dXO"&gt;Peloton and the Consumer Product Safety Commission haven’t said exactly what was wrong with the Tread — only that the touchscreen could loosen — or how it’s being fixed. Only 1,050 units of the Tread exist right now, so it’s not a massive recall, but still an undertaking for Peloton. The company was supposed to widely launch the device in the US in late May but hasn’t provided an updated timeline since the recall. It also hasn’t said when the Tread Plus might be fixed, of which there are 125,000 impacted units. On a call with investors in May, CEO John Foley &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22423745/peloton-recall-timeline-tread-plus-john-foley"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; the Tread Plus “could take months” to return to market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FTgq8V"&gt;He also added that the company needed to be a “leader in safety in the industry” and that the repaired products would be “one of the safest if not the safest treadmills in the world.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Local and anonymous social media app Yik Yak is back</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3BQsWfGP4HEdBIJluaFa0viqaFo=/94x0:1107x675/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69732537/YikYakApp_2021_Aug_16.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="knVMtm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://yikyak.com/"&gt;Yik Yak&lt;/a&gt; — the anonymous, local social media app that only shows posts from people in your immediate area — has &lt;a href="https://yikyak.com/the-yak-is-back"&gt;returned from the grave&lt;/a&gt; with new ownership after shutting down four years ago. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N5ryfF"&gt;According to the app’s relaunched website, the new incarnation of Yik Yak bought the rights to redevelop the service in February 2021, with the aim of providing a local social media network that’s free from the “labels” that dominate communication on other platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMk0hp"&gt;The new app resembles the original version of Yik Yak from 2014: users can post and comment on short text posts that are only able to be viewed within a five-mile radius. Like Reddit, posts can be upvoted and downvoted, and a separate “hot” feed compiles the top post from the past 24 hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WFVnUx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;  ICYMI: After a 4 year hiatus, Yik Yak is available in the App Store again!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Anonymity, location-based, the hot feed &amp;amp; more — everything you used to love about Yik Yak&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Now available on iPhone in the US — more countries and devices coming soon!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/2B2NCKamdV"&gt;https://t.co/2B2NCKamdV&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/HUAKh4elcA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HUAKh4elcA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Yik Yak (@YikYakApp) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/YikYakApp/status/1427310464585900035?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H7OIAS"&gt;Originally launched in late 2013, the app was a flash-in-the-pan success (particularly at college campuses) for most of 2014, when it was valued at $400 million by investors. But while the anonymity made it popular for college students, Yik Yak also was rife with bullying and harassment. In early 2016, in an effort to get things back on track, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/3/8/11175886/yik-yak-handles-usernames"&gt;Yik Yak added optional social media handles&lt;/a&gt;, which were made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/16/12492152/yik-yak-redesign-local-yakkers-status-updates"&gt;mandatory in August&lt;/a&gt; of that year, effectively removing what had made the service unique. The original incarnation of Yik Yak ended up shutting down in early 2017, when it was sold for $1 million to Square for its engineering talent and IP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYUghr"&gt;The new Yik Yak looks to be taking a serious stance on bullying and harassment on its platform, though — something that the original incarnation of the app failed to do. The new owners have posted an extensive list of its “&lt;a href="https://yikyak.com/community-guardrails"&gt;community guardrails&lt;/a&gt;,” which include prohibiting sharing of personal information, “anything that could be construed as bullying, abuse, defamation, harassment, stalking, or targeted hate or public humiliation,” and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yvctrq"&gt;The company also notes that bullying, hate speech, threats, or other violations of any the community guardrails or terms of service can lead to an immediate ban from the platform. And posts that receive a total score of -5 will be hidden from view, too, to ensure that negative or harmful content isn’t surfaced further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ub5lhG"&gt;The new Yik Yak is currently only available to download on iOS for users in the US, but the developers are promising to expand to more countries and devices soon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox Series X is getting a new 4K dashboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XKI0PpfevMTlO_mgyLPDqh3GgkU=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69732494/twarren_xboxseriesxhandson.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RNpOnR"&gt;Microsoft is starting to test a new 4K dashboard for the Xbox Series X today. Xbox Insiders in the Alpha and Alpha Skip-Ahead rings will get access to the increased resolution for the Xbox dashboard later today, designed to improve UI elements for 4K displays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lonqDb"&gt;“This change means Home, Guide, and other areas of the UI will be displayed in a higher native resolution for increased sharpness and text readability,” &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/08/16/xbox-insider-release-notes-alpha-skip-ahead-2109-210813-2200/"&gt;says Microsoft’s Xbox testing team&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YmvjRG"&gt;Until this new 4K dashboard, Xbox Series X consoles had been running dashboard UI elements at 1080p. Native 4K elements for Home, Guide, and other parts of the dashboard will greatly improve how the Xbox Series X appears on 4K TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqSQr5"&gt;It’s not yet clear whether HDR will also be supported as part of this new resolution bump, and whether the Xbox Series S will also see improvements to its dashboard resolution. The smaller Xbox Series S can technically output at 4K, so it’s possible this console will also see dashboard improvements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTDOuA"&gt;These new Xbox dashboard changes come just days after Microsoft also started testing a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22613617/microsoft-xbox-night-mode-feature-dim-screen-controller-led"&gt;new night mode for various Xbox consoles&lt;/a&gt;. The new night mode allows Xbox owners to dim their screens, controller LED brightness, and even the Xbox power button. Both the 4K dashboard and night mode should start rolling out to all Xbox Series X consoles later this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OpenTable adds a new ‘verified’ tag for restaurants to check vaccine status</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CMalcUJWrvgjENHErHygBt87Q4U=/90x0:1167x718/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69732251/Screen_Shot_2021_08_16_at_12.24.39_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yASg7t"&gt;OpenTable is &lt;a href="https://blog.opentable.com/verify-diners/"&gt;adding a new feature&lt;/a&gt; that will let restaurants tag diners as “verified” for meeting entry requirements. The initial — and obvious — use of the verification feature will be for restaurants to log guests who are vaccinated for COVID-19, but the feature could also be used to do things like confirm a diner is of legal drinking age or other requirements for entry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wuZmYS"&gt;The feature should be rolling out to restaurants later this month, and it aims to help make it easier for restaurant owners to better serve repeat customers, especially with cities like New York City &lt;a href="https://ny.eater.com/2021/8/16/22626847/proof-of-vaccination-indoor-dining-first-day-august-16-nyc"&gt;starting to roll out vaccination requirements&lt;/a&gt; for restaurants as the delta variant continues to rise. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="yMVbRS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;OpenTable wants to make things easier for repeat diners&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bqxBgQ"&gt;The verification tag only applies to a single restaurant or restaurant group and doesn’t actually log any vaccination data or personal information. Actually checking the vaccine status of a diner will fall to the restaurant, in line with whatever policies a location has for vaccine requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3DEDoJ"&gt;But in theory, the OpenTable system would allow for a diner to show proof of vaccination on their first visit, and then make future reservations easier. Since OpenTable isn’t extending the “verified” status between different restaurants, you’ll still have to meet that verification status at each new place you go (unless they’re operated by the same group), but it still could be a convenient feature for customers who frequent the same places often.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Walmart is on the hunt for someone to develop cryptocurrency products</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Inside A Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Location Ahead Of Black Friday" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5_aWQ6-_r4uY5PtGE0ZmSR8cUIg=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69732045/875075340.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gdtN6W"&gt;Walmart is looking to hire a new senior director to develop new digital currency products, possibly including cryptocurrency payments, according to &lt;a href="https://careers.walmart.com/us/jobs/WD704706-usa-senior-director-ii-corporate-development-and-integration"&gt;a listing on the company’s job site&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-16/walmart-seeks-a-crypto-expert-to-oversee-digital-currency-push?utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_content=tech&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;cmpid%3D=socialflow-twitter-tech&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The move mirrors a similar interest shown by Walmart’s sworn enemy Amazon, which wants &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/24/22591754/amazon-hiring-cryptocurrency-aws-payments-jassy"&gt;to hire someone&lt;/a&gt; to head up cryptocurrency products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Dj94o"&gt;The new Walmart senior director position will serve as the company’s “Cryptocurrency and Digital Currency Product Lead,” in charge of “developing the digital currency strategy and product roadmap.” Among other responsibilities, the listing says this new role will also be focused on “identify[ing] crypto related investment and partnerships,” suggesting Walmart might buy its way into preexisting cryptocurrency businesses as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PzklJG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Everyone’s playing with speculative digital assets&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8afUtu"&gt;This shouldn’t be too surprising. Even though Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595684/amazon-bitcoin-payments-denial"&gt;denied claims&lt;/a&gt; it was preparing to start accepting Bitcoin payments — while reiterating it’s interested in crypto — cryptocurrencies and the blockchain in general have had a bit of a moment during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CHUwo"&gt;Whether it’s the rise of blockchain-linked collectibles like NFTs (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;non-fungible tokens, remember them?&lt;/a&gt;) or major theater chains like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617594/amc-bitcoin-memestock-apple-google-pay"&gt;AMC deciding they’ll accept crypto payments&lt;/a&gt; to appeal to their new, very online audience, people seem very interested in playing with speculative digital assets. Walmart and Amazon might just be making sure their bases are covered, but a future where they do accept alternative payment methods also feels increasingly possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6rmWh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nJWeI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spin’s electric scooters are coming to Google Maps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Spin E Scooter" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oQUjYKWLZ2OCF5wGGiOl0PFeT5c=/0x2:5016x3346/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69731934/1219078283.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Horst Galuschka/picture alliance via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="azukfR"&gt;Google Maps users will be able to find and rent Spin’s electric scooters after the Ford-owned company announced a new global integration on Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="frYEaJ"&gt;Starting Sunday, anyone who uses Google Maps will be able to see the nearest available Spin e-bike or e-scooter in real time, including how long it will take to walk to the vehicle, as well as battery range and expected arrival time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c11d8S"&gt;But to pay for the scooter, unlock it, and take their ride, users will be redirected to Spin’s app. Google Maps users will be able to see Spin’s availability in 84 cities, campuses, and towns in Europe and North America, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="184vNn"&gt;“Our goal is really to make it just as convenient or even more convenient to get around with alternative transit, bikes, buses, scooters, public transportation, as it is to get around with the car,” Spin CEO Ben Bear told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “And until you’re able to do that, you’re not going to really drive the mode shift that we’re all focused on in the micromobility industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SKfVMb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Our goal is really to make it just as convenient or even more convenient to get around with alternative transit”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I0x1q3"&gt;Spin’s scooters will appear on Google Maps when users select the bicycle option after looking up directions to a specific location. They will also appear under the public transportation tab, Bear said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIK0cF"&gt;Spin is the latest e-scooter company to integrate its products into Google Maps. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/3/18248555/google-maps-lime-scooters-bikes-integration-expansion"&gt;Users have been able to find and rent Lime’s scooters since late 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Depending on the city, the popular navigation app also includes available bike-share, public transportation schedules, and fare information for using Uber and Lyft vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLZjVg"&gt;Alphabet — which owns Google — is an investor in Lime, having contributed to a $170 million investment in the scooter company in May 2020. As part of that deal, Lime acquired Uber’s bike and scooter-sharing company, Jump. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B2S-KgsiM4mkyOgJM3S6pBqKv_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22785627/SF_GoogleMaps_Press.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HUMscP"&gt;The Google Maps integration will help level the playing field for Spin in terms of competition with its rivals, Bear said. “Whichever is the fastest, most convenient option is what’s going to surface first, right?” he said. “So it’s really done in a fair way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="suwP0m"&gt;Spin, which was acquired by Ford for $100 million in 2018, has seen its own shake-ups. Earlier this summer, co-founder and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/06/03/ford-owned-spin-shakes-up-scooter-business-with-new-ceo-e-bikes-and-city-strategy/"&gt;CEO Derrick Ko stepped down&lt;/a&gt; to assume a strategic advisor role, while the company’s chief business officer, Ben Bear, became the new CEO. Spin announced plans to add electric bikes to its fleet of shared vehicles, while also expanding to multiple cities in the US and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmcRn9"&gt;Possibly spurring all this activity was a report that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-20/ford-is-said-to-weigh-exit-of-electric-scooter-unit-spin?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Ford was considering divesting itself from Spin&lt;/a&gt;, or perhaps merging the scooter sharing firm with a special purpose acquisition company, also known as a SPAC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMH0qT"&gt;A spokesperson for Ford declined to comment on &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s report regarding divestment, but since its publication, the automaker’s top executives have expressed confidence in Spin’s business. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="um1TqY"&gt;“I’m excited about all we’ve accomplished under the leadership of Derrick, Zaizhuang, and Euwyn to advance micromobility solutions in our cities and as a capability for Ford,” said Ford CEO Jim Farley said in a recent statement. “They’ve built a terrific business, and we look forward to continued progress under Ben, who is strongly positioned to grow Spin and give more people the freedom to move and pursue their dreams.”&lt;/p&gt;
