    <title>Another Amazon-first gadget brand has suspiciously vanished: Choetech</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JdYSdZloacI-EBnDj-JyS7sH6Bk=/0x0:1024x683/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69553722/choetech.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MtCLY9"&gt;If you’re in the market for a new charger or cable, you might find fewer brands on Amazon than you’d expect — because at least six of them have mysteriously disappeared. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536976/amazon-ravpower-battery-charger-removed-amazon"&gt;giant retailer confirmed last month&lt;/a&gt; that it had removed Aukey, Mpow, RavPower, Vava and TaoTronics, but now a sixth gadget maker has similarly vanished in a puff of smoke: Choetech, a company perhaps best known for inexpensive wireless charging pads. (A few &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers have them sitting around right now.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RopcYq"&gt;Amazon isn’t talking this time, but the modus operandi is the same: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/Choetech/Choetech/page/AAB8B7E6-B653-46D8-8CC7-702A6FCA805D"&gt;if you visit Choetech’s seller page on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll see the same telltale empty boxes where the company’s products used to be. Searches for Choetech only surface products from other sellers instead (via &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/choetech-delisted-on-amazon-for-alleged-fake-reviews"&gt;&lt;em&gt;xda-developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). As far as I can tell, the store was removed several days ago, with reports on social media of its disappearance dating back to July 3rd.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l7mV6nGtZjAB6ox_AXMVQPudX4M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22704510/choetech_blank_spaces.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choetech’s seller page on Amazon has holes where products used to be.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nqcRgP"&gt;It’s not hard to imagine why this might have happened. Amazon’s in the middle of a crackdown on fake five-star reviews, and quite a few gadget sellers &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nicnguyen/status/1405202548760334339"&gt;have been caught red-handed&lt;/a&gt; trying to pay customers to inflate their score. (Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/3/13155578/amazon-incentivized-reviews-ban-vine-program-product-bias"&gt;banned incentivized reviews &lt;/a&gt;in 2016.) When we asked about Choetech, Amazon would only point us &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/how-amazon-works/creating-a-trustworthy-reviews-experience"&gt;to its June 16th blog post&lt;/a&gt; that discusses the new crackdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4JoJoU"&gt;Choetech, aka Shenzhen Dak Technology, didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="YZU2Ke"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon-first gadget brands Aukey and Mpow are suddenly, suspiciously disappearing","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428858/amazon-aukey-mpow-listings-disappearing"},{"title":"Amazon confirms it removed RavPower, a popular phone battery and charger brand ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536976/amazon-ravpower-battery-charger-removed-amazon"},{"title":"Not just RavPower — Amazon has yanked Vava and TaoTronics, too","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538779/amazon-sunvalley-tek-ravpower-vava-taotronics-pulled-store"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="DzNjhj"&gt;We also haven’t gotten comment back from any of the earlier gadget brands that Amazon did confirm removing — but it seems like some of them may be trying to dodge the ban with slightly different seller names. While Aukey and Mpow no longer have a direct presence on Amazon, you can still find &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Key+Series&amp;amp;ref=bl_dp_s_web_0"&gt;some of Aukey’s wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; under the “Key Series” brand there, and Amazon is also currently selling &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-xMpow-Bluetooth-Earphones-Headphones/dp/B0924DCSYS"&gt;the “xMpow MFly&lt;/a&gt;,” which appears to be an Mpow product. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2OzVU"&gt;If you’re received any inserts in your Amazon packages, suspicious or no, electronics or no, can you send me pictures at sean@theverge.com? I’m collecting them for a future story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SYAzKw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Today is Amazon Prime Day. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Humble request: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you get any insert cards in your new purchases (they don't need to look this suspicious), please send me photos of them at sean@theverge.com for a story. &lt;a href="https://t.co/7337ookNPp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7337ookNPp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Sean Hollister (@StarFire2258) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/1407416198623494144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Dota 2’s The International will now take place in Bucharest in October</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CHINA-ESPORTS-GAMING-INTERNET" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NOQ7VM9IsMCkIXmKoH_jyVLwM78=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69553614/1163941109.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: STR/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sDl0RB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt;’s prestigious The International tournament will now be taking place in Bucharest, Romania in October, &lt;a href="https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/2968417243145568913"&gt;Valve announced on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. The event had been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432042/dota-2-international-esports-tournament-stockholm-date"&gt;originally set&lt;/a&gt; to take place in Stockholm, Sweden in August, but Valve had announced in June it had started looking for other locations because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22545319/dota-2-the-international-valve-sweden-europe"&gt;restrictions on esports events in Sweden&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbYqYY"&gt;The rescheduled event, which will be hosted in Bucharest’s Areana Nationala, will kick off on October 7th, with the Group Stage running through October 10th. Main Stage events start on October 12th, and the final match taking place on October 17th. Players will be competing for an eye-poppingly large prize pool of more than $40 million. Tickets aren’t on sale yet, but information about that “will come shortly,” Valve says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g19IJe"&gt;The October event marks The International’s return after a one-year hiatus &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21175145/the-international-2020-valve-dota-2-coronavirus-delay"&gt;due to the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. But Valve wasn’t the only company with big news about an esports event on Wednesday; the Call of Duty League announced that its championship weekend, which will be an in-person event at the Galen Center in Los Angeles, California, will &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CODLeague/status/1412818756536000512"&gt;take place starting August 19th&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google faces new antitrust lawsuit over Google Play Store fees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/o3HxwIv1H43f0Ui9m8Fcg0QLZRw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69553458/acastro_201005_1777_googleAntiTrust_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q2jOLc"&gt;On Wednesday, a coalition of state attorneys general launched a new antitrust lawsuit against Google, accusing the search giant of abusing its control of the Android app store, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-07/google-play-store-goog-antitrust-suit-to-be-files-by-states"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kotdS9"&gt;The lawsuit, filed by 36 states and Washington, DC, in California federal court, challenges Google’s policy forcing Google Play app developers to pay a 30 percent commission fee on sales made through the app. Google &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/09/listening-to-developer-feedback-to.html"&gt;recently expanded&lt;/a&gt; the fees to cover more digital goods purchased on the Play Store, taking particular aim at a number of prominent apps that had previously been able to sidestep the tax.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzK286"&gt;As of press time, the lawsuit was visible on the court’s website, confirming Bloomberg’s reporting. The central complaint has yet to be published, but the site listed the defendants as Google, Alphabet, and subsidiaries in Ireland and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJTtuI"&gt;In August, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;developer Epic Games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21368363/epic-google-fortnite-lawsuit-antitrust-app-play-store-apple-removal"&gt;sued Google on similar grounds&lt;/a&gt;, claiming that the company’s practices have raised prices for consumers online, although the lawsuit was largely overshadowed by Epic’s parallel case against Apple and its App Store. Still, the state AGs’ lawsuit is likely to have more force, coming from designated state-level regulators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QaHZoF"&gt;The lawsuit comes amid mounting federal pressure on Google, which is already facing three federal antitrust lawsuits, including &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/atr/case/us-and-plaintiff-states-v-google-llc"&gt;an ongoing Justice Department case&lt;/a&gt; accusing the company of monopoly practices in search advertising.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EeN5By"&gt;Android has typically been seen as less of an antitrust threat than Apple’s iOS, since it does not require Google Play as the sole source of software on the phone. However, the growing pressure on Apple has called many aspects of the Play Store’s fee structure into question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEIbIM"&gt;In recent hearings, lawmakers and regulators have repeatedly questioned Apple and Google’s abilities to make their app stores the defaults on mobile devices, a practice that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22549338/apple-google-apps-comscore-study-facebook"&gt;often extends to specific apps&lt;/a&gt;. More recently, Google joined Apple in lowering its fee to 15 percent for smaller developers, a move widely seen as a response to mounting public pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfWF8K"&gt;Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Calendar adds RSVP options for attending events virtually</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rRTHYLnKGNhjqEu1yWVBqpVc2yk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69553343/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TCX3zD"&gt;As companies large and small settle on how they’ll return to working in-person, a hybrid work future, where working from home is common and expected, is beginning to seem like more of a reality. To accommodate hybrid workplaces, &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/07/join-meeting-virtually-or-in-person-google-calendar.html?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+GoogleAppsUpdates+%28Google+Workspace+Updates+Blog%29"&gt;Google plans to expand RSVP options&lt;/a&gt; over the next few weeks to let users say whether they’ll attend an event virtually in Google Calendar invites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oORWVo"&gt;Virtual attendees will specify their status through a new drop-down menu that is viewable by the host and other guests in the event details. The company hopes that listing how people plan to attend an event will help organizers know what to expect, and presumably accommodate attendees who won’t physically be in the room. While the new options are currently limited to invites in Calendar, Google plans to bring them to invites that appear in Gmail in the future as well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h9-Hr3qIq9J5HhooN13q4Cbs3Tc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22704229/RSVP_with_location.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s new event details cards showing virtual and in-person attendees.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uQaMvd"&gt;People who use Outlook or iCal as their primary calendar app won't see the new features, however. Google says the RSVP options are limited to Google Calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qht1a"&gt;Facilitating in-person and virtual work is more complicated than turning on Zoom (or to Google’s delight, Meet) and going about your day. It’s very easy to forget about coworkers, friends, or classmates who are coming in over the internet rather than sitting next to you. Acknowledging virtual attendees means common-courtesy things, like turning video on so everyone can see you and sharing information both physically and digitally, might actually happen without a work-from-home colleague complaining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDdIhV"&gt;It also fits with the vision Google seems to be pushing for Workspace &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiRoprF4tHxAhWIFzQIHVb8ATAQFnoECBcQAw&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F18%2F22440226%2Fgoogle-workspace-smart-canvas-features-docs-updates&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1QQHH4ncu4TdfNjFuc68c8"&gt;as a more fluid, interoperable space for productivity&lt;/a&gt; to happen, connecting products together (allowing Meet video calls to be nestled right next to a Google Doc), letting you @ tag someone, and accommodating flexible work schedules &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307087/google-workspace-status-meet-calendar-frontline-split-screen"&gt;with statuses and custom notifications&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0YmzA"&gt;Google says the new RSVP options will appear gradually over the next couple weeks, starting on July 8th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best gaming laptops in 2021: seven laptops to get your game on</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Gaming Laptops 2021: Asus ROG Zephyrus G15" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dFgjUrUVReawUz4BcRUID8XTWDI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856650/akrales_210226_4440_0019.9.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our top picks from Asus, MSI, Razer, and more.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales/ The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best gaming laptop at every size and price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="SKtFh9"&gt;The best gaming laptops are changing every year. The early days of mobile gaming were largely desktop replacements — clunky chassis, multiple power bricks, and RGB lighting galore. But the top gaming laptops now are different. Manufacturers are finally putting powerful specs in sleeker, more portable, and more professional builds. They have excellent, fast refreshing screens that are necessary for a great gaming experience. These laptops aren’t just great for gaming, but for everyday work as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qiHviH"&gt;Our pick for the best gaming laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt;. It can handle the most demanding games on the market today and also makes a great daily driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VRi2QJ"&gt;We’ll be updating this page regularly as new best gaming laptops hit shelves throughout this year. Some exciting updates are on the way. AMD and Nvidia have announced their next-gen series of mobile processors and mobile graphics cards — the Ryzen 5000 series and the GeForce RTX 3000 series, respectively — and we’re already seeing them in premium gaming laptops across manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGRnFN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;QHD screen&lt;/a&gt; is another feature to watch for in the best gaming laptops. A growing number of manufacturers are releasing configurations with 1440p displays, even in gaming laptops under $2,000. These options can hit a sweet spot for many gamers: a better experience than 1080p without the price premium or raw horsepower required for a 4K display. You can expect decently high refresh rates from these panels as well, depending on the model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5KtNO"&gt;One more thing to keep in mind with the best gaming laptops is the power you can expect. Not all chips with the same name are created equal — the RTX 3070 in one laptop may not deliver the same frame rates as the RTX 3070 in another laptop due to its wattage (as well as other factors like the processor and cooling). Nvidia now requires companies to disclose clock speeds and graphics power on each model’s product page, but plenty of manufacturers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;haven’t done that yet&lt;/a&gt;. Your best bet, if you can’t find those numbers on a company’s website, is to read some reviews and make sure the model you’re considering will deliver the frame rates you’re looking for. We will note the wattage used in any laptops we review with the new RTX graphics cards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best gaming laptop of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dqOSgQ"&gt;Asus’s ROG Zephyrus G14 was our top gaming laptop pick for quite a while. It did just about everything right, and we weren’t sure whether Asus could ever replicate its resounding success. But somehow, the company managed to make the G14 just a bit bigger, and a heck of a lot better. In doing so, it’s created the ROG Zephyrus G15, the best 15-inch rig you can buy.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsXGzm"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not making any compromises on performance for that portability: it’s powered by the top mobile chips that AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and includes a fast 165Hz QHD (1440p) display. Together, those components can handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. The panel has excellent color reproduction as well, so your games will look great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HMlhzT"&gt;But it’s not just the gaming; almost everything else about the G15 is great, too. The audio (pumped from a six-speaker array) has strong percussion and bass, the keyboard and touchpad have a satisfying click, the port selection leaves little to be desired, and the battery can last for a whopping eight and a half hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MktsFD"&gt;The G15 won’t be the laptop for everyone. There’s no webcam, which is a significant oversight, and some may prefer something more affordable, or with a flashier aesthetic. But as a package, the G15 is the one to beat. Not only is it the best gaming laptop you can buy, but it’s also one of the best laptops you can buy, period. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is the best gaming laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gXl1tL"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ibDYbq"&gt;The best gaming laptop in a 14-inch chassis&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PjVXGI"&gt;The ROG Zephyrus G14 is the best 14-inch gaming laptop you can buy. We most recently reviewed last year’s model, which includes AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series up to the eight-core Ryzen 9 4900HS and an Nvidia RTX 2060 GPU. There’s a brand-new model out featuring the Ryzen 5000 series and Nvidia’s RTX 30-series graphics, which we’re looking forward to getting our hands on ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvmPMM"&gt;For well under $2,000, the Zephyrus crams one of the most powerful mobile processors on the market into a super portable 14-inch chassis. With capable cooling to boot, the laptop delivers frame rates we’ve never seen in a laptop of this size before. It handled every game we threw at it without breaking a sweat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRoiIm"&gt;But aside from its excellent gaming performance, the G14 makes a great daily driver. The keyboard, touchpad, display, and port selection are all excellent. Even the battery life is good — something we almost never get to say about gaming laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yypId"&gt;There are a few downsides to the G14, but they’re fairly small and user-dependent. The most significant note is that it lacks a webcam; you’ll need an external one if you plan on taking video calls. There’s also some bleed in the backlighting, there’s no Thunderbolt connectivity (since it’s an AMD system, and that’s an Intel standard), and the fans can get louder than most under load. But these are very much nitpicks that won’t have a large impact on plenty of people’s gaming experience. Overall, we have very few complaints. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="jT5h16"&gt;The best big-screen gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E8Fdz3"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 delivers some of the best gaming performance you can find in a laptop — but that’s not even its superpower. What makes Razer’s 17-inch flagship so impressive is it packs that unbelievable power into a thin and attractive chassis. It’s just 0.8 inches thick and only requires one charging brick — so you can carry it around in a backpack or briefcase without compromising on power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaBYbX"&gt;Gaming enthusiasts can opt for a model with a 300Hz screen — the highest refresh rate you can get on a laptop — while folks who want to combine gaming with some creative work can opt for a 120Hz touchscreen configuration. Both models come with a customizable per-key RGB keyboard, which adds a touch of color to the Pro’s design without being too obnoxious for the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsGaDN"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 certainly isn’t cheap, but it’s the laptop to buy if you want the best of the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="2kvoth"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465565/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G15 Advantage Edition&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SAASF8"&gt;The best big-screen gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HhOl4t"&gt;The ROG Strix G15 Advantage Edition is one of the few gaming laptops you’ll find that includes both an AMD processor and an AMD GPU. Not to worry — it delivers gaming performance on par with what you’ll see from laptops with Nvidia’s top GPUs. It also delivers one of the best gaming battery experiences we’ve ever seen — it was able to maintain playable frame rates on &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2 &lt;/em&gt;for over an hour with no charger attached. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JHVLju"&gt;Speaking of battery, we averaged nine hours and 16 minutes of work use between charges, which makes the Strix G15 far and away one of the longest-lasting gaming laptops on the market. That’s doubly impressive because it’s powering a ton of flashy LEDs, including a per-key RGB keyboard and a colorful light strip around the front edge of the deck. If you’re looking for a jazzy, bold design and you’re all-in on AMD, the Strix G15 Advantage edition is the best gaming laptop for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DMtcRV"&gt;The best budget gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hCCjrZ"&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE offers a great gaming experience at a price range far below that of many competitors. It’s the best gaming laptop you can buy for around $1,000, and it doesn’t ask too many compromises for that price. While it only comes with a 60Hz screen, the hardware inside (especially AMD’s Ryzen 7 processor) is capable of maxing that out on all kinds of demanding games at native 1080p resolution, so you can reliably expect a playable experience from your favorite titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6ozmE"&gt;We’re also impressed by the G5’s connectivity. It includes a Mini DisplayPort, an HDMI, and an Ethernet jack — all ports you don’t see every day on laptops at this price point. Overall, if you’re looking for great value for your money, the G5 is your best bet. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="wzRw2D"&gt;A great thin and light gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="EcPuJg"&gt;The Blade 15 isn’t as powerful as its 17-inch sibling, but it may be a more pragmatic purchase for many people. If you’re looking for a balanced combination of performance and portability, the Blade 15 may hit that sweet spot. It still packs the top chips on the market and can come with a 300Hz display, but at just 4.7 pounds and 0.7 inches thick, it’s comparable in size to a number of 15-inch productivity machines like the Dell XPS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8vpQe"&gt;In addition to its reliable gaming performance, the Blade 15 works well as a productivity machine. We’re big fans of its keyboard, which is quite comfortable to use and has per-key RGB lighting, and the touchpad, which is roomy with a satisfying click. Our primary complaint is that this Blade got quite hot during our game testing — not only did the processor reach 99 degrees, but the hinge and palm rests were uncomfortable to touch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7lPrCK"&gt;The best laptop with flashy RGB&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SK7elL"&gt;If you’re looking for a “traditional” premium gaming laptop with colorful, flashy panache, the ROG Strix Scar 15 is for you. The Strix’s keyboard isn’t just one of the most comfortable that we’ve ever tested on a gaming laptop; it also has some of the coolest per-key RGB lighting we’ve ever seen with all kinds of effects. There’s also a colorful light strip wrapped around the front of the deck (customizable as well) and a colorful glowing logo on the lid. In short: if you use this in public, people will notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZuwqX"&gt;Of course, the Strix is great on the inside as well, delivering some of the best frame rates you’ll find from a 15-inch laptop with Intel’s and Nvidia’s top chips. You’ll get the full benefit of their power with a 300Hz screen option as well. And the Strix comes preloaded with various programs to help customize your gaming experience. You can personalize color profiles, bandwidth allocation, and more based on the type of game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tCRMB0"&gt;A gaming laptop with desktop-class parts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="SH9RLt"&gt;If money and desk space are no objects for you, you might be interested in the Alienware Area-51m. This hefty rig is essentially a desktop in laptop form. It pairs a desktop-class processor and a full-power mobile GPU with a 17-inch display and a full-size keyboard, delivering true desktop performance in a chassis that’s still (technically) portable. PC enthusiasts will also appreciate that you can update many of the components yourself, including the processor, RAM, and storage. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now apply for a job through TikTok</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/686xQ7R4PrM0Y0MSRzomy6cY7us=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69552683/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z6N92L"&gt;TikTok is testing a job application tool that allows its users to directly apply with video resumes to companies like Chipotle, Target, and Shopify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvpCXw"&gt;The short-term pilot program, called &lt;a href="https://tiktokresumes.com/"&gt;TikTok Resumes&lt;/a&gt;, stems from content that has organically popped up on the platform, like #CareerTok, and the company’s deliberate initiatives to influence college students and younger users. There are more than 30 companies signed up to accept resumes for &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/find-a-job-with-tiktok-resumes"&gt;the pilot&lt;/a&gt;, which will last until July 31.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LPVxgK"&gt;Users will have to create a video resume, post it to TikTok, and then send that video to recruiters through the app. An instructional video for the pilot program recommends applicants don’t include personal contact information like their email address in the publicly-shared video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kjMGHZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If you are extremely strong, you can also apply to be a WWE superstar&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UEJ2qP"&gt;Some of the jobs currently listed include generating content for TikTok, which means more  brands adopting the platform with already-savvy content developers. For instance, Alo Yoga is hiring a &lt;a href="https://tiktokresumes.com/social-media-manager/"&gt;social media manager&lt;/a&gt; through TikTok Resumes who will develop a TikTok strategy for the brand and partner with influencers. Others are looking for hosts and video producers who will span multiple platforms, like a Detroit Pistons’ listing for a &lt;a href="https://tiktokresumes.com/producer-editor/"&gt;video producer&lt;/a&gt; or an &lt;a href="https://tiktokresumes.com/allrecipes-on-camera-host-producer/"&gt;on-camera host listing&lt;/a&gt; for Allrecipes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ZrS2z"&gt;Companies like &lt;a href="https://tiktokresumes.com/target/"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://tiktokresumes.com/chipotle/"&gt;Chipotle&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://tiktokresumes.com/sweetgreen/"&gt;Sweetgreen&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://tiktokresumes.com/great-clips/"&gt;Great Clips&lt;/a&gt; are also using the platform to find entry- and mid-level employees to work in stores and warehouses, with some full-time and corporate roles sprinkled in. Shopify is looking to hire a &lt;a href="https://tiktokresumes.com/senior-data-scientist/"&gt;senior data engineer&lt;/a&gt; through the pilot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxUp2n"&gt;If you are extremely strong, you can also apply to be a &lt;a href="https://tiktokresumes.com/wwe-superstar/"&gt;WWE superstar&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wy2A2H"&gt;While the pilot is temporary, it showcases how TikTok is thinking about training and installing an ecosystem of professional content creators to further its influence. It’s an easy way to match corporations looking to cash in on Gen Z with adept and influential creators looking for a full-time role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lI13qR"&gt;TikTok Resumes will be open to submissions from July 7 to 31. And for those with a long resume, luckily, TikTok is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22558856/tiktok-videos-three-minutes-length"&gt;rolling out three-minute videos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android app tests your phone’s waterproof seals without a drop of water</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XCS5gxdAqWXzkLdSSTgiXlDoeXk=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69552625/cat-s60-5945.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Water Resistance Tester is designed to check waterproofing, which can degrade over time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rxsGxm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ray.waterresistancetester"&gt;Water Resistance Tester&lt;/a&gt;, available on the Google Play store and &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/07/07/app-claims-to-test-your-phones-water-resistance-without-a-plunge/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, falls firmly into the category of “neat stuff we didn’t know you could do with an app.” It tests the integrity of your Android phone’s IP67/IP68 rating by accessing the device’s barometer. Just download the free app, follow the prompts to press down firmly on the screen, and you’ll get a swift pass/fail grade. It’s simple, geeky, and practical, which is a combination we love.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QgsEMX"&gt;Developer Ray Wang says he created the app to help people check the state of their devices’ waterproof sealing after a repair or as it degrades over time. Obviously, don’t take a passing grade as a free pass to chuck your phone into a lake. That said, it appears to work reliably, based on &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/oev1rt/app_water_resistance_tester_app/"&gt;feedback from Reddit users&lt;/a&gt; and Play store reviewers — as well as our own quick testing. An IP68-rated Galaxy Note 20 Ultra passed the test at first, but when we popped out the SIM card tray, it failed — as you’d expect. A TCL 20 Pro 5G, which has no IP rating, failed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P6q89K60ouf5x0LGd_Onz3YT2p8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22704069/water_resist_screens.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In our testing, a TCL phone (left) without an IP rating failed, as expected, while the IP68-rated Galaxy Note 20 Ultra (middle and right) passed.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="43xJs7"&gt;This app &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/search?q=waterproof%20test&amp;amp;c=apps&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;gl=US"&gt;isn’t the first of its kind&lt;/a&gt;, but some of the existing waterproof test apps on the Play store appear to have been designed for older phones with a different style of waterproofing than used in phones today, and may not work accurately now, according to user reviews. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFMhNp"&gt;In any case, this new app seems to work well, and it’s free unless you want to tip the developer $1 to remove a small ad at the bottom of the screen. Not a bad price to pay for a little bit of geeky fun.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roblox, explained</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QOuE-0fDP4-OCMQBXnHbjzZDdVM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69552518/VRG_ILLO_4472_RobloxExplainer.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="tbxYNj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is one of the biggest apps in the world, and you’ve probably been hearing its name: the company &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/10/roblox-rblx-starts-trading-at-64point50-after-direct-listing.html"&gt;recently went public&lt;/a&gt;, and its stock price climbed so high it was temporarily worth more than gaming giants EA and Take-Two combined. &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; has come up as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436014/apple-roblox-epic-fortnite-trial-what-is-game-name-change"&gt;contentious topic&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;em&gt;Epic Games v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkMIc3"&gt;But it’s also just an astonishingly popular app: 42.1 million people play &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;daily&lt;/em&gt;. And its popularity is surging during the pandemic. Daily active users were up 85 percent in 2020, compared to the year before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nUKT9a"&gt;Until recently, though, I didn’t really understand what &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; actually was, despite the app having been around since 2006. (Just to give you an idea of how long that is in tech years, the App Store for iOS launched in 2008.) So I spent some time in the world of &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; to help explain what all the fuss is about.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WYo5EjSrbBJADgbQl0RApXiKMyo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22544249/Showcase_Filmstrip_1920x1080.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A promotional image from Roblox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eKqRrK"&gt;What is a Roblox&lt;em&gt;?&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IXnLFp"&gt;I… don’t actually know! I don’t think there’s any one &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; object, like a &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; block. I guess it could refer to the fact that &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; lets you build games that you can then explore? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="siu2Wq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a game, even? Apple has me wondering these days. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4MSlXd"&gt;According to an Apple exec who took the stand during the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial, a game has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22425774/epic-apple-roblox-fortnite-store-game-trial-day-5"&gt;beginning, an end, and challenges&lt;/a&gt;. Glad I could solve that one quickly for you. Roblox (the company), for what it’s worth, says &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; (the app) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22436014/apple-roblox-epic-fortnite-trial-what-is-game-name-change"&gt;offers “experiences.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bnn3Vj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roblox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; then?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H1hQk3"&gt;It’s a platform where you can play millions of different... experiences... specifically created for the platform. A vast majority of those experiences are games, but you can also do things like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21502149/roblox-virtual-music-events-concerts-ava-max-interview"&gt;attend concerts&lt;/a&gt; or visit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22546657/stranger-things-roblox-starcourt-mall-experience"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stranger Things’&lt;/em&gt; Starcourt Mall re-created in &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I even went to a &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; awards show — &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/sFU4T52yX18"&gt;built inside &lt;em&gt;Roblox &lt;/em&gt;itself&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqwxlL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That all sounds complicated. How do you win?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yu1Xyo"&gt;It is! And you don’t win at &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, really. Sure, there are individual games you could win, but the real draw of &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; is just to be a place to hang out, play lots of stuff, and maybe do so with your friends.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CvbSaGkOODSZKAZbL7XH2yzO3XY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702947/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_10.05.01_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Here’s my avatar at the beginning of a &lt;/em&gt;Roblox&lt;em&gt; obstacle course game, or an “obby.”&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2ylbq"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roblox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; where the cool kids hang out? The nerd kids? (Are the cool kids the nerd kids now?)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UNdFB"&gt;Likely all kinds since it’s played by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21333431/roblox-over-half-of-us-kids-playing-virtual-parties-fortnite"&gt;more than half of all US kids under 16&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Cl15r"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wow. How is that even possible? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F7nXZe"&gt;I’m not entirely sure. That’s a tremendous number! But since Roblox put that stat in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1315098/000119312520298230/d87104ds1.htm"&gt;the documents it had to file&lt;/a&gt; before going public, it seems like a safe bet. If Roblox lied to shareholders, there’d probably be hell to pay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZqet5"&gt;And while &lt;a href="https://qz.com/1949710/roblox-is-getting-kids-attention-next-stop-an-ipo/"&gt;more than 50 percent&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; players are under the age of 12, it’s not just kids playing it; 30 percent of players are older than 17. Roblox told me that ages 13–17 and 17–24 are its fastest-growing demographics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrskB5"&gt;The need for entertainment and virtual connection during the pandemic brought a huge number of new players as well, especially with additions like &lt;a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2020/07/updates-to-private-servers/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox’s&lt;/em&gt; dedicated space for virtual birthday parties&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdjVLu"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, color me intrigued: what would a &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roblox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; birthday party look like?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0KwnXo"&gt;You could set up a private party in &lt;em&gt;Roblox’s&lt;/em&gt; dedicated space, which can almost feel like a virtual rave. But I’d expect that more &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; birthday parties look like a bunch of friends opening up the app, partying up, and just jumping from game to game and world to world right from the launcher. In the span of an hour, you can hop through all kinds of different experiences because the app loads everything really quickly, which means it’s pretty easy to replicate the chaotic energy of a real kids’ birthday party.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vvh950Exhi_SVkDbLQIBFMwotXw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702935/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_9.53.03_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;My &lt;/em&gt;Roblox&lt;em&gt; avatar in a psychedelic party space.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uYqe8b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oh, yeah. I heard people do that kind of thing in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fortnite&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; and &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Minecraft,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; too. Is this like that? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2O5q08"&gt;Sort of. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241414/fortnite-party-royale-ltm-mode"&gt;the violence-free Party Royale mode&lt;/a&gt;, which lets you run around a small island with your friends shooting paintball guns at each other, and, like in &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, you can attend concerts at a huge virtual concert stage. &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; Creative Mode lets you build entire worlds and game modes using buildings, weapons, and other assets created by Epic. And &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; lets you build whatever you want with its blocky cubes and make games in your own private servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PP11uX"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; largely offer fixed experiences around set mechanics. &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, on the other hand, lets developers make whatever type of games they want — whether that be a third-person action game, a first-person shooter, or that time Lil Nas X threw a concert — and players can grab their friends and hop from game to game and world to world with almost no friction at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vlE3r1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wait, hold up. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Lil Nas X? “Old Town Road”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="53XhvK"&gt;Yes, him. He put on an &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/f12ukZuUwWI"&gt;epic, nearly 10-minute performance&lt;/a&gt;, towering over crowds of tiny dancing Roblox avatars and teleporting them to new virtual stages for each song. (Yes, including that one.) You can watch the whole show right here, if you’d like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Tvtx2h"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f12ukZuUwWI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SU0NCi"&gt;The concerts were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570454/lil-nas-x-roblox-concert-33-million-views"&gt;a smash hit&lt;/a&gt;, garnering 33 million views across two days and four shows. (By comparison, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; huge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott concerts&lt;/a&gt; in April drew &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9422287/travis-scott-fortnite-billboard-cover-story-interview-2020"&gt;45.8 million viewers over five shows&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HcP1ah"&gt;Roblox &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21502149/roblox-virtual-music-events-concerts-ava-max-interview"&gt;has big plans&lt;/a&gt; for other virtual music events as it works to realize its version of a metaverse. At the end of March, rock duo &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ese3QtoWfkg"&gt;Royal Blood performed during the in-game “Bloxys” awards&lt;/a&gt; and premiered a new song. Also, Roblox would &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; like not to get sued over music rights, so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564922/roblox-sony-music-partnership-lil-nas-x-collaboration-licensing"&gt;it just signed deals with Sony&lt;/a&gt; and BMG.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvQOYR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Probably wise. So what’s a metaverse? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyiJ4p"&gt;I think of a metaverse as a collection of virtual worlds, landscapes, and characters that you can experience in one shared space. One example is &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, which lets players dress up as characters from a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22242696/fortnite-predator-marketing-brands-cross-promotion"&gt;huge range of popular franchises&lt;/a&gt; across movies, other video games, and even sports. &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; has a huge range of virtual worlds that you can go to and games to play that can take place in any kind of environment that a developer can imagine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2aUih"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, let’s say I just want to play the games, though — what can I play? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zk3WEr"&gt;In &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, in the span of 15 minutes, you can easily check out a handful of games in just about any genre you can think of. In a popular third-person horror game called &lt;a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/4623386862/Piggy-BOOK-2-Egg-Hunt?refPageId=4c5be575-45f0-4acf-9e83-43e5efe022c6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Piggy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I had to flee from a terrifying pig wielding a baseball bat. One of the top &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; genres is “&lt;a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/?Keyword=obbys"&gt;obbys&lt;/a&gt;,” short for “obstacle courses,” where you have to navigate precarious platforms and avoid, well, obstacles. I even found a clone of &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt; called &lt;a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/301549746/Counter-Blox?refPageId=4c5be575-45f0-4acf-9e83-43e5efe022c6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Counter Blox&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QElUod"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are they good?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9tHv5O"&gt;That’s a tough question to answer, actually. Often, playing a “good” &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; game or even being good at a game is secondary to just hanging out with your friends. A lot of games lean into this more relaxed vibe by focusing heavily on roleplaying elements — and I mean roleplaying in the most literal sense of the term. In one game I tried, &lt;a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/192800/Work-at-a-Pizza-Place?refPageId=4c5be575-45f0-4acf-9e83-43e5efe022c6"&gt;I worked at a pizza parlor&lt;/a&gt;. In another, &lt;a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/5712833750/Animal-Simulator?refPageId=41371707-4429-4e79-a225-acfe7fb6c395"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Simulator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, I galloped around a virtual world as a horse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eegsyw"&gt;One of the top games on &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/4924922222/Brookhaven-RP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Brookhaven&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, drops you in a small town, lets you pick a house and car, and gives you free rein to just be a person in the town you loaded in. (It reminded me of a kid-friendly version of a &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt; roleplaying server.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YnYNHHoVxaCYV1DMie3LHMFVt4U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702930/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_9.47.22_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Me in front of my new house in &lt;/em&gt;Brookhaven, &lt;em&gt;a popular &lt;/em&gt;Roblox&lt;em&gt; game. I have no idea who the cool skateboard person is. They photobombed me.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNDFsq"&gt;You shouldn’t hop into &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; expecting to play games with the production values of something like &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; or even &lt;em&gt;Fall Guys&lt;/em&gt;. Many of the &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; games I’ve tried feel somewhat rudimentary, offering simple controls and graphics. But the point isn’t really to go pro in any one &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; game — it’s more that there are millions of virtual spaces to hang out, and many of them have the added benefit of being games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I6BCiY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your favorite game you’ve played?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUnqJ8"&gt;Thanks for asking. &lt;a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/69184822/Theme-Park-Tycoon-2"&gt;It’s &lt;em&gt;Theme Park Tycoon 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;em&gt;Roller Coaster Tycoon&lt;/em&gt; clone that brought back a lot of my capitalist theme park-building instincts from my childhood. I’ve been going out of my way to avoid playing it so that I can actually finish this article. I also like jumping into random obbys, &lt;a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/6174369490/Escape-Mcdonalds-Parkour?refPageId=12a47271-4f5b-49c2-849f-d5edb3a54bed"&gt;like this McDonald’s-themed one&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="II5bz9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do I pick what to play? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EuK7L2"&gt;There’s not a single &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; experience that you can enter in the way you can hop into a world of vanilla &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; and immediately start building houses and crafting tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEQXRo"&gt;Think of &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; instead like an app store. The “storefront” recommends games for you to play, and you can also search through the games available or browse through different categories and genres. A lot of players also share games among themselves or find things recommended online by creators and YouTubers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0CDhyW"&gt;Because there’s so much to choose from, it can be overwhelming at the start. But since it’s so easy to jump into a game, you’ll probably be able to find something fun just by exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dBAvUJWauNQWLH8TXj6Wt4gmzH0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22544266/Screen_Shot_2021_05_27_at_1.07.40_PM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox’s Discover tab.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zoLA5c"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who makes these games? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJQYf5"&gt;Anyone. Everyone! Kids do, and you can, too. &lt;a href="https://www.roblox.com/create"&gt;Roblox has free development tools&lt;/a&gt; to get started, and it &lt;a href="https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/learn-roblox/studio-basics"&gt;offers extensive documentation and guides&lt;/a&gt; to help you learn how to make games for the platform. Unlike &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;, where you’re literally building the environments around you using blocks, Roblox offers developers a more traditional suite of game development tools along the lines of Unity or Unreal Engine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhDtZs"&gt;And it’s not just amateurs making &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; games — there are entire studios dedicated to &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;. I spoke with one, The Gang Stockholm, while writing this article, and they’ve now built &lt;a href="https://blasterhub.com/2021/05/roblox-nerf-strike-beta-thoughts/"&gt;an official Nerf battle arena game&lt;/a&gt; for toymaker Hasbro. One of &lt;em&gt;Roblox’s&lt;/em&gt; top games, &lt;a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/920587237/Adopt-Me"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adopt Me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, grew from a two-person development team to being supported by a full development studio that &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/z3xn4e/how-these-developers-hope-to-build-a-100-person-game-studio-inside-roblox"&gt;has ambitions to hire 100 developers&lt;/a&gt; by the end of next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2I8IqV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So there’s money to be made in &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roblox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; games?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IakPY4"&gt;Developers can make money by selling things like items, cosmetics, or avatars (often in their own in-game stores similar to those in mobile apps) in exchange for &lt;em&gt;Roblox’s&lt;/em&gt; in-app currency, Robux. And it seems like some of the most successful games can pay out nicely, once they’ve reached critical mass. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WMHfkU"&gt;But if you’re considering developing games for Roblox, you should know that Roblox (the company) can take an &lt;a href="https://developer.roblox.com/en-us/articles/developer-economics"&gt;up to 73 percent&lt;/a&gt; cut of revenue from Robux players spend on your games if you decide to cash out Robux into real money. That’s much higher than the 30 percent cut taken by Apple and Google’s app stores (in most cases) and the 12 percent cut Epic Games takes from games on the Epic Games Store. The company will take less if you spend within the Roblox ecosystem, though, such as on ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WXEVcE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Say I want to try &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roblox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; now. Where can I download it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lyghqZ"&gt;It’s on PC, Mac, iOS, Android, Xbox One (and, by extension, Xbox Series X / S), and you can even play in VR using &lt;a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/208260046-Roblox-VR"&gt;the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive&lt;/a&gt;. It’s free to download, though buying Robux costs real money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18lJRA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roblox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; for PS4 or PS5? What about Nintendo Switch? Or Oculus Quest?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TmPkk"&gt;Right now, no, but Roblox hasn’t shut the door on the possibility of the app coming to those devices in the future. On the company’s most recent earnings call, Roblox co-founder and CEO Dave Baszucki &lt;a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/roblox-corporation-rblx-q1-2021-earnings-call-tran/"&gt;said that&lt;/a&gt;, in the long term, the Switch, PlayStation, and Quest all make “perfect sense for Roblox” but that “we won’t share any ship dates for them.” So it sounds like &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; could come to your Switch someday, but it’s hard to say exactly when.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeyW0M"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You said &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Roblox&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is hugely popular with kids — how does Roblox protect them from bad actors?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTCzSq"&gt;There are a number of settings parents can toggle to help control what their kids can do in the app and even who they can talk to. Parents can also toggle a switch to require a PIN to change settings, and they even turn on a restricted mode that limits a user to only accessing content curated by Roblox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5E829C"&gt;Roblox also says that players who are 12 or younger have posts and chats filtered not just for inappropriate content but also to prevent personal information from being shared. That way, a child theoretically can’t share a home address with a &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; friend using &lt;em&gt;Roblox’s&lt;/em&gt; chat, for example. Players can also block and report users. You can read more information on &lt;a href="https://corp.roblox.com/parents/"&gt;Roblox’s parents guide&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/203313120-Safety-Features-Chat-Privacy-Filtering"&gt;in this support article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ddfy0Y"&gt;Roblox is also working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/17/22389637/roblox-content-ratings-games-kids"&gt;content ratings for games&lt;/a&gt;, though hasn’t said when the ratings system might become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PeZw6k"&gt;It seems there are still some potential gaps, though. &lt;em&gt;Wired’s &lt;/em&gt;Cecilia D’Anastasio, as part of an article with the headline “&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/roblox-online-games-irl-fascism-roman-empire/"&gt;How Roblox Became a Playground for Virtual Fascists&lt;/a&gt;,” detailed a Roblox experience she visited earlier this year where she spoke with someone who roleplayed as the Confederacy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LpfsGs"&gt;And I don’t know how Roblox can stop kids from finding this &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/theres-a-creepy-clown-video-hidden-in-roblox-1846804469"&gt;terrifying clown video hidden in the game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxFKVV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I could do without the clown thing, but Roblox seems like a big deal. So: should I invest in the stock? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y40OjQ"&gt;I can’t give financial advice, so you’re on your own for that one. With &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323839/gamestop-stock-price-dramatic-rise-fall-stonks-return"&gt;how wild the stonks market has been&lt;/a&gt; this year, though, I suppose Roblox, like anything else, has a lightning-in-a-bottle chance of being the next GameStop. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22349242/nft-metadata-explained-art-crypto-urls-links-ipfs"&gt;Better than spending that money on NFTs, right?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Melinda French Gates will leave foundation if she and Bill Gates can’t ‘work constructively’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="INDONESIA-IMF-WORLD BANK-DIPLOMACY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UfopBOBcHCfxDmt8Uhgb8SS6bdc=/0x42:4000x2709/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69552418/1051872980.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3TxH9o"&gt;Melinda French Gates and Bill Gates &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22418019/bill-melinda-gates-marriage-separation-charity-foundation"&gt;recently announced their divorce plans&lt;/a&gt; but largely left the question of how the co-chairs would continue to work together at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation unanswered. Now, &lt;a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/media-center/press-releases/2021/07/bill-melinda-gates-foundation-mark-suzman-plans-evolve-governance"&gt;a new statement from the foundation&lt;/a&gt; has offered some clarity: they might not (via &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/07/business/gates-foundation-divorce.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The foundation says Melinda French Gates will resign from her position as co-chair and trustee if either she or Bill Gates decides they are unable to work together after two years. It’s not clear how the organization settled on that timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qoBvoh"&gt;Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman announced the two-year post-divorce trial period along with the commitment of an additional $15 billion from Melinda and Bill toward the foundation’s efforts to fight poverty, disease, and inequity. Suzman also writes that the co-chairs have decided to expand the charitable foundation’s number of trustees:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="y3YUos"&gt;The additional trustees will bring new perspectives, help guide resource allocation and strategic direction, and ensure the stability and sustainability of the foundation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="38On7J"&gt;Per the statement, Melinda and Bill are “are fully committed to continuing to work constructively together at the foundation,” but if Melinda does resign after two years, Suzman suggests she’ll keep giving under her own brand:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="t679yR"&gt;Melinda would receive personal resources from Bill for her philanthropic work. These resources would be completely separate from the foundation’s endowment, which would not be affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2N8rTv"&gt;The amount of those resources are unknown, but given Melinda’s &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rachelsandler/2021/05/05/melinda-gates-now-a-billionaire-after-she-gets-stock-transfer-from-bill-gates/?sh=2da61953e5a5"&gt;reportedly significant personal wealth&lt;/a&gt;, her philanthropic work might not be hindered much either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UjqUCD"&gt;Melinda and Bill &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/13/21179214/bill-gates-steps-down-microsoft-board-philanthropy"&gt;long ago resigned from their positions at Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; but have continued to have an outsized impact on the world through the work of their foundation (being billionaires helps, too). The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has recently focused its efforts on combating the COVID-19 pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/26/21237482/coronavirus-pandemic-gates-foundation-microsoft"&gt;donating $250 million&lt;/a&gt; toward the development of vaccines and other treatments in 2020. Last month, the foundation committed &lt;a href="https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/media-center/press-releases/2021/06/gates-foundation-commits-2-1-billion-to-advance-gender-equality-globally"&gt;$2.1 billion over the next five years&lt;/a&gt; toward women’s economic empowerment, health, and leadership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEGvxU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiCPdc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pgFCYI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon has its own version of spatial audio and it’s already pushing it on phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XdA7Nx_txiaOx-y7u2tg4yvul0g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69552002/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h7fivc"&gt;You know spatial audio is having quite a moment when wireless carriers decide to create their own implementations of it. Verizon has announced a new sound feature it’s calling “Verizon Adaptive Sound,” and the company claims it “produces a brilliant spatial surround experience regardless of what headphone, soundbar, or earbud brand you use or what application you’re watching or listening to.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QNuXwO"&gt;The audio trick, which Verizon says has been in the works since 2019, is coming to Motorola phones first, including the new Motorola One 5G UW Ace that goes on sale July 8th. The Motorola Edge Plus also just received a firmware update that seems to add this feature, &lt;a href="https://www.droid-life.com/2021/07/05/motorola-edge-update-adds-something-called-verizon-adaptive-sound/"&gt;as noted by &lt;em&gt;Droid Life&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6jFwE"&gt;Verizon Adaptive Sound is integrated right into the settings menu on Android devices in the sound section. From there, you can adjust sliders for treble, bass, voice enhancement, and spatial surround sound. For those who’d prefer to ignore VAS completely and hear everything as normal, it can toggled on or off in settings. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lrjWt6xY5uE9XG2fHYt6KgndHCA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22703786/Screen_Shot_2021_07_07_at_12.57.02_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Verizon&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YhXV3I"&gt;“While some technology solutions have attempted to provide premium sound experiences to some specific (usually expensive) devices and to a limited subset of content, most devices and content experiences have been relegated to a disjointed, sub-optimal, and lowest-common-denominator-like experience,” a Verizon spokesperson said by email, in an obvious reference to Apple, Sony, and Amazon. “We wanted to change that.” Some devices that offer 360-degree audio do indeed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22360437/sony-srs-ra5000-speaker-review-360-audio-features"&gt;come at a premium&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gHGt2H"&gt;Verizon Adaptive Sound is based around “an innovative software and cloud-based solution,” a spokesperson said. That’s on the vague side, so I’ve asked the carrier for more specifics on exactly how it works and what it does. Is this just some kind of gimmicky, fake virtual surround effect? Or does it mix down Dolby Atmos channels (when available) to make the sound profile, similar to Apple’s spatial audio? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vLxleo"&gt;Apple spatial audio works with AirPods earbuds and the AirPods Max headphones to create immersive surround sound — with head tracking — when watching TV shows and movies in supported apps. The company has more recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525028/apple-music-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-hands-on"&gt;added spatial audio to its Apple Music service&lt;/a&gt;, though the results are very inconsistent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWaUx8"&gt;Verizon’s big talking point seems to be universal support across hardware and streaming services. But until we can give Verizon Adaptive Sound a try ourselves on one of these Moto devices, we can’t say how it compares to existing approaches. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h9kqCY"&gt;The feature “will be made available on a broader portfolio of new devices in the future, as well as some existing devices via an over-the-air software update,” according to Verizon. My initial hunch was that we’ll mostly see this on entry-level and midrange 5G phones, but the carrier told me it won’t be specific to budget devices. Does that mean Verizon will force this into the sound settings of something like Samsung’s Galaxy S21? For now, Motorola is the only partner being named. &lt;/p&gt;
