    <title>Microsoft wants Chrome OS users running Office web apps, not Android apps</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4yZrWg"&gt;Starting September 18th, Microsoft will end support for the Office and Outlook Android apps on Chrome OS and start pushing Chromebook users to its web apps instead, according to &lt;a href="https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/microsoft-ending-chromebook-support-for-office-android-apps-in-september/"&gt;a statement it gave &lt;em&gt;About Chromebooks&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. As recently as July 31st, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210731012201/https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-to-install-and-run-microsoft-office-on-a-chromebook-32f14a23-2c1a-4579-b973-d4b1d78561ad"&gt;Microsoft’s support documents&lt;/a&gt; recommended installing the Android versions of Office, Outlook, OneNote, and OneDrive, but &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/how-to-install-and-run-microsoft-office-on-a-chromebook-32f14a23-2c1a-4579-b973-d4b1d78561ad"&gt;now those documents say&lt;/a&gt; that the apps are unsupported for Chrome OS users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkzoaY"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;About Chromebooks&lt;/em&gt;’ Kevin Tofel points out, though, the move to web apps makes the offline situation for Office users more complicated. While certain Office web apps, &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/using-outlook-web-app-offline-3214839c-0604-4162-8a97-6856b4c27b36"&gt;like Outlook&lt;/a&gt;, have a dedicated offline mode, Tofel reports not being able to open existing documents using Microsoft’s progressive web app for Chrome OS while offline. While Chrome OS &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/answer/2481498?hl=en#zippy=%2Cupdate-your-document-or-edits-will-not-be-automatically-saved"&gt;does offer&lt;/a&gt; some offline editing capabilities for Office files natively, it doesn’t offer the real Office experience &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/can-i-work-offline-3cdc0690-7332-4d4b-8884-ba2a353a42d8#ID0EAABAAA=Android"&gt;like the Android apps did&lt;/a&gt; while disconnected from the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CHBELl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;For the most part, the web version of Office does the job&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RTZkpf"&gt;Microsoft wasn’t immediately available to answer questions about what offline functionality the Office web experience for Chrome OS offered, or whether it would be making improvements before the September switchover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7vytv"&gt;For those who are always online, though, the move from Android to web app may not make too much of a difference. For the most part, the web version of Office offers many of the features that you’d need for basic word processing, spreadsheeting, and presentation making — though I’m certainly not one to judge those who don’t prefer web apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="phvYCv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Microsoft says the web apps will let Chrome OS users access “additional and premium features.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IoN2in"&gt;Microsoft’s statement to &lt;em&gt;About Chromebooks &lt;/em&gt;doesn’t really go into why the company is making the change, though it does say that it will let Chrome OS users access “additional and premium features.” (It’s worth noting that Chrome OS users could already use the Office web apps if they chose.) Tofel reports that this change doesn’t mean that Office for Android will be going away for phone users. We’ve reached out to Microsoft to confirm this and will let you know if we hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rXLwJo"&gt;There is some irony in Microsoft pushing Chromebook users away from using Android apps on their laptops, as Windows 11 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22548428/microsoft-windows-11-android-apps-support-amazon-store"&gt;will have support for running Android apps&lt;/a&gt;. That said, Android apps’ functionality on Chrome OS has long been criticized, and even Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/13/21219075/google-chrome-os-android-apps-webs-chromebook-replacing-progressive-twitter-youtube-tv"&gt;has replaced some of its own apps with PWAs&lt;/a&gt; on the platform. Most PWAs are only useful while you have a live internet connection, but that’s not really the case for apps like Office. Hopefully, Chromebook users will get the option for an offline experience back after the switch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s New World MMO is getting an open beta on September 9th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vTzlm565KVMDrIxkbunk6ajORu4=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69775452/ss_45594186d0784865980a9c8b009675b5c5e8c0ac.1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon Games’ &lt;/em&gt;New World&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SFYIp3"&gt;Amazon’s upcoming PC MMO, &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;, is getting an open beta ahead of its September 28th release date, Amazon Games announced at Gamescom’s Opening Night Live on Wednesday. The open beta will take place from September 9th to September 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06vVzB"&gt;The public beta will give players a chance to try out the game before its official launch just a few weeks later on September 28th, even if it’s only for a few days. In addition to the open beta, Amazon Games also revealed a new trailer for the upcoming MMO showing off more of the supernatural world of &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wHgUxe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;’s open beta follows a &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-07-28-theres-a-real-buzz-about-amazons-new-world-mmo"&gt;well-received closed beta&lt;/a&gt; and should give more people a chance to try out the game before it officially launches. The game, like others from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21510190/amazon-crucible-canceled-game-studios-closed-beta"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/2/17187836/amazon-game-studios-breakaway-status-canceled"&gt;Games&lt;/a&gt;, has had a troubled history — a recent delay to September 28th from August 31st &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609898/new-world-mmo-amazon-delayed-release-launch-date"&gt;was the game’s fourth&lt;/a&gt; — but the open beta could be an opportunity for Amazon to iron out as many issues as possible before &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;’s release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxMQqJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New World &lt;/em&gt;is available for preorder now &lt;a href="https://www.newworld.com/en-us/game-editions"&gt;starting at $39.99&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike some other MMOs, the game won’t have a monthly subscription. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Horizon Forbidden West delayed to February 18th, 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4pt0UTq6oUWX6A5oZISDDpf2e5M=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69775414/Horizon_Forbidden_West_Dive_Logo_TM_LegalLine.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SZtVtz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;, the sequel to &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;, has officially been delayed until February 18th, 2022, according to &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/08/25/horizon-forbidden-west-arrives-on-february-18-2022/"&gt;a PlayStation blog post&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Guerrilla/status/1430611047308677123"&gt;Guerrilla Games&lt;/a&gt;. The game was expected to release near the end of 2021, but it was clear that timeframe was more of a target than a fixed date — the &lt;a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/horizon-forbidden-west/"&gt;game’s page on PlayStation.com&lt;/a&gt; had its release date listed as “to be confirmed,” and PlayStation Studio head Hermen Hulst &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/06/02/hermen-hulst-qa-whats-next-for-playstation-studios/#sf246401757"&gt;said during an interview&lt;/a&gt; that the developers thought they were “on track” for a holiday 2021 release but couldn’t be sure. He also said that part of the uncertainty was due to developers’ access to motion-capture equipment and actors during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0AcLt"&gt;Sony’s PlayStation Studios, which &lt;em&gt;Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;’s developer Guerrilla Games is a part of, is currently involved in making a lot of games: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432601/sony-playstation-studios-ps5-games-25-new-ip-interview"&gt;more than 25, according to Hulst&lt;/a&gt;. Other titles included in this initiative have been delayed as well, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297059/gran-turismo-7-ps5-playstation-5-release-date-delay-2022"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo 7&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the next &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465232/god-of-war-ragnorok-ps5-ps4-delay-2022"&gt;&lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xd5Rvg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Horizon Forbidden West is coming to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 on 18 February 2022! Pre-orders will begin next week, on 2 September. Are you ready to continue Aloy's journey?&lt;a href="https://t.co/aMD8LIWbf8"&gt;https://t.co/aMD8LIWbf8&lt;/a&gt; ​&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HorizonForbiddenWest?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#HorizonForbiddenWest&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/bRP3kToGji"&gt;pic.twitter.com/bRP3kToGji&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Guerrilla (@Guerrilla) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Guerrilla/status/1430611047308677123?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 25, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y5g7oE"&gt;Companies outside of PlayStation Studios have also had some of their PS5-exclusives delayed — Arkane’s &lt;em&gt;Deathloop&lt;/em&gt; (a timed exclusive for the platform) has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373588/bethesda-deathloop-ps5-delayed-date"&gt;pushed back to September 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Ghostwire: Tokyo &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373588/bethesda-deathloop-ps5-delayed-date"&gt;also won’t see a release until 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uxb56J"&gt;At this point, the PlayStation 5 still has relatively few games that really take advantage of its next-gen hardware, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523093/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-review-ps5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22408468/returnal-ps5-dualsense-3d-audio"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. With the delays stacking up, it seems like this may still be the case come holiday season of this year. How much that will affect console sales, though, is hard to tell — Sony has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597784/sony-ps5-playstation-5-sales"&gt;already sold 10 million PS5s&lt;/a&gt;, and they’re still hard to get due to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;ongoing silicon shortage&lt;/a&gt;. The good news for those who haven’t managed to snag a PS5 yet is that, when it comes out in February, &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22455008/horizon-forbidden-west-gameplay-ps5-sony-state-of-play"&gt;will be available on the PS4 as well&lt;/a&gt;. The studio says preorders will start on September 2nd and that more info will be coming next week.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Horizon Zero Dawn’s newest update unlocks 60fps on PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y_LTu3Pot32Uw2kUKTCGsfpXb6k=/53x0:794x494/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69775391/horizon_zero_dawn_screenshot_01_pc_campaign_en_us_01jul20.5.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BqMBXA"&gt;Sony has released a new update for &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; enabling 60fps on PS5. The game was previously locked to 30fps on Sony’s newest console, so this update should help the game feel that much smoother. A &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; colleague has confirmed that the update, 1.53, is available to download and install now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBXQNH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XWgwFc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; is the latest game to get a 60fps boost on the PS5 — Sony has slowly been adding higher frame rates for some of its biggest PS4 hits since the PS5 was released. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443868/the-last-of-us-part-2-ps5-patch-update-60fps"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II&lt;/em&gt; got one in May&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260829/god-of-war-2018-ps5-patch-free-update-playstation"&gt;&lt;em&gt;God of War&lt;/em&gt; got one in February&lt;/a&gt;, and Sucker Punch &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SuckerPunchProd/status/1314641549406265346"&gt;added a 60fps option for &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that was available when the PS5 launched in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VaS4gc"&gt;Sony also announced that its sequel to &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22455008/horizon-forbidden-west-gameplay-ps5-sony-state-of-play"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, will be released on &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/08/25/horizon-forbidden-west-arrives-on-february-18-2022/"&gt;February 18th, 2022, on PS4 and PS5&lt;/a&gt;. Previously, the developers had been targeting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465232/god-of-war-ragnorok-ps5-ps4-delay-2022"&gt;a holiday 2021 launch&lt;/a&gt; for the game, but &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Jason Schreier reported in July that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-30/playstation-video-game-horizon-forbidden-west-delayed-to-2022"&gt;the game had been delayed&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft announces $549 Halo-themed Xbox Series X console</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XSFySXKNyOOCoEu5SoDRDot3Mw8=/68x0:1049x654/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69775214/xboxconsole.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w5f8iS"&gt;Microsoft’s first custom &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-branded Xbox Series X console will arrive on November 15th. The $549.99 console includes dark metallic paneling, gold accents, and a star pattern to match the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; universe. It even powers on and off with custom &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-themed sounds, and Microsoft has changed the top fan section of the Xbox Series X from a green color to blue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mPWFy"&gt;The console bundle will also include a custom &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-branded controller that matches the console, and Microsoft says this will be a very limited edition that will be &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fxbox-series-x-halo-infinite-limited-edition-bundle%2F8rpm8t9ck0p6" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for preorder from Microsoft’s site today&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JEG-q33AZBinDco78szkH34v1Ug=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805320/Halo_gamescom_Inline1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s Halo-themed Xbox Series X console.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CmQ8q3"&gt;This is the first custom Xbox Series X console, but Microsoft has previously launched many custom Xbox consoles. A limited edition &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17989078/taco-bell-xbox-one-x-console-contest-microsoft"&gt;Taco Bell Xbox&lt;/a&gt; included the famous ring when you powered on the console, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/20/16175552/xbox-one-s-minecraft-limited-edition-leak"&gt;special &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; Xbox One S&lt;/a&gt; looked like it had come straight out of the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FfrqQ"&gt;Alongside a custom &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-branded console, Microsoft is also launching a &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-themed Xbox Elite 2 controller. It’s designed to match the metallic green found on Master Chief’s armor, and it even has a custom case and D-pad. The Halo Infinite Limited Edition Elite Series 2 controller will also be available on November 15th, priced at $199.99.

    <title>Persona 5’s Morgana is coming to Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BIjoygDu2PZv4V8qAVBIYKMjCWE=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69775194/morganamonkeyball.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Morgana can’t catch a break&lt;/em&gt; | Sega&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IK7v0b"&gt;In an effort to build up excitement for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22530302/super-monkey-ball-banana-mania-remaster-three-games"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that’s releasing on October 5th, 2021, Sega has been plucking characters from its roster of games, past and present. Not only will &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22631024/yakuza-kazuma-kiryu-super-monkey-ball-banana-mania"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Kazuma Kiryu&lt;/a&gt; serve as an unlockable character, Morgana from &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt; will appear as post-launch content on November 2nd, except it’ll cost $4.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUWu4f"&gt;Morgana plays a pivotal role in &lt;em&gt;Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;, serving as the gutsy feline sidekick to the protagonist and your rag-tag team of Phantom Thieves. In &lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania&lt;/em&gt;, Morgana will collect chests instead of bananas. Sadly, there’s no mention of &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt;-themed stages or music mentioned in the press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s5FTon"&gt;Sega is really wringing out its IP to include characters that’ll appeal to as many people as possible. So far, Sega has confirmed that Beat from &lt;em&gt;Jet Set Radio &lt;/em&gt;and Sonic and Tails will join the squad of monkeys, along with the aforementioned Kiryu and Morgana. That’s a potent amount of fan service. But I’m not sold until we get &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/6/20850674/yoot-saito-interview-seaman-sega-dreamcast-ai-20th-anniversary"&gt;Seaman&lt;/a&gt; in the game. Thankfully, Sega is promising that “more iconic additions” will be announced soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3A9whS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania&lt;/em&gt; will be available on October 5th, 2021 on all consoles for $39.99, or on Steam for $29.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Midnight Suns is a new Marvel tactics RPG from XCOM studio Firaxis</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lPl_rrKfK8lS9-yGU1J-f5WgDxk=/276x0:2298x1348/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69775155/Screen_Shot_2021_08_25_at_2.14.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XWtHmV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://midnightsuns.2k.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marvel’s Midnight Suns&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is a newly revealed tactical RPG from Firaxis Games that was just announced at Gamescom’s opening night event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UQJ6SS"&gt;The game is said to take place in the “darker side of the Marvel Universe,” and it will have players take on the role of a new hero, The Hunter (which Firaxis created with Marvel). In &lt;em&gt;Midnight Suns&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll team up with classic heroes like Iron Man, Wolverine, Ghost Rider, Blade, Captain America, and Captain Marvel as part of the &lt;a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Midnight_Sons_(Earth-616)"&gt;Midnight Suns superhero team&lt;/a&gt; to battle a supernatural foe: Lilith. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lPFajmSOHyE2oNrbSJja4nOVxJ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22805244/Screen_Shot_2021_08_25_at_2.16.46_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ob0KEX"&gt;There’s not much information on the actual gameplay yet — although, given Firaxis’ work on the rebooted &lt;em&gt;XCOM&lt;/em&gt; series and the fact that &lt;em&gt;Midnight Suns&lt;/em&gt; will be a tactical RPG, it seems like players should expect some sort of superheroic spin on its &lt;em&gt;XCOM&lt;/em&gt; formula here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w0nrHC"&gt;Fans won’t have to wait long for more information: a gameplay reveal is planned for September 1st, and &lt;em&gt;Midnight Suns&lt;/em&gt; will be released on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, Steam, and the Epic Games Store in March 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Saints Row is getting a reboot that’ll be out in February 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l3ePCzG64ySK1LFGXww13z-03Po=/140x0:1660x1013/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69775031/07.SAINTS_ROW_Los_Panteros_Street_Fight_4K.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Saints Row&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Volition&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tOhw7i"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1428718469596471302"&gt;As teased by Geoff Keighley last week&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Saints Row&lt;/em&gt; is the next video game series to get a reboot. Developer Volition has announced that the newest title, which is just called &lt;em&gt;Saints Row&lt;/em&gt;, is scheduled to be released on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X / S, and PC on February 25th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ST03av"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Saints Row&lt;/em&gt; titles are renowned for their over-the-top open-world gameplay that feels more inspired by cartoons than &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto&lt;/em&gt;. Originally a rip-off of &lt;em&gt;GTA&lt;/em&gt;, the franchise quickly grew into a consistently funny spoof of franchises, including — oddly enough — &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect &lt;/em&gt;and Michael Bay’s &lt;em&gt;Armageddon&lt;/em&gt;. This reboot looks to eject some of the more indulgent references but maintain the core gameplay that prioritized fun over silly things like “reality.” There appear to be weird outfits, cool cars, and absurd weapons aplenty. It also appears to have adopted another very welcome hallmark of the original franchise: a diverse cast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0hrnCV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YgjzDJA1o1E?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oIoa2j"&gt;The game takes place in Santo Ileso, a city inspired by the American Southwest, and a CGI trailer showed off gritty desert roads, a Las Vegas-like district, and more. The story stars three main characters and your customizable protagonist as you build a criminal empire and take on three opposing factions inhabiting the city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sc9Ev0"&gt;It looks like a strong new entrant in the &lt;em&gt;Saints Row&lt;/em&gt; franchise, and fortunately, we won’t have to wait too much longer to play the game.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Theater owners are already taking a victory lap in the fight for where movies screen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W3znjdD-IFvAQPCzZjk9phbnhus=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69774883/acastro_210813_1777_theater_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bi8fGw"&gt;A year of chaotic movie releases made the future of theaters look uncertain. But as cinemas reopen, hybrid releases that studios so warmly embraced amid COVID-19 are now having to answer in earnest to theater owners and talent attached to high-stakes films.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvPVzi"&gt;During this week’s CinemaCon, the National Association of Theatre Owners’ annual convention, prominent figures from the film and exhibition industry rebuked the simultaneous release models and insisted that theaters and exclusive windows will survive after being pummeled during the pandemic. Speaking during this week’s event in Las Vegas, NATO boss John Fithian said that exclusive theatrical release windows “remain vital to the survival and success of the theatrical experience,” according to &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/theater-owners-chief-john-fithian-cinemacon-1235047830/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBiLxQ"&gt;“What the future holds is up to our members and distributors to decide, but let us be clear about one thing: Simultaneous release does not work for anyone,” Fithian said, per the publication. He added that exclusive theatrical releases are “essential” to the recovery of both theaters and the greater movie ecosystem at large.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="28MHer"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Simultaneous release does not work for anyone.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9RmgMP"&gt;AMC boss Adam Aron, meanwhile, said during the event that the only way to curb “massive piracy” is to distribute films in cinemas first, according to &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/08/cinemacon-nato-chief-john-fithian-amc-adam-aron-opening-remarks-1234820889/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Sony Pictures Motion Picture president Josh Greenstein was &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/08/sony-cinemacon-windows-brad-pitt-bulett-train-spider-man-no-way-home-1234819844/"&gt;cited by the outlet&lt;/a&gt; as committing to distributing Sony films exclusively in theaters first, adding that cinemas “and the theatrical movie experience will triumph.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRGP9Q"&gt;“Debuting movies simultaneously in theaters and in the home is devastating to our collective business,” Greenstein said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o11dRF"&gt;While perhaps unsurprising that a convention centered on theatrical distribution would rally so much support for theatrical exclusivity, the comments come at a pivotal moment for the theater industry. As lockdown orders lift and vaccinations allow moviegoers to return to cinemas, studios have begun &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22622638/movie-theaters-streaming-amc-cinemark-regal-exclusive-windows"&gt;renegotiating contracts&lt;/a&gt; for exclusive theatrical windows, albeit much shorter ones than the 90-day period of exclusivity theaters often had pre-pandemic. It follows a dramatic standoff between theaters during the earliest days of COVID-19, with AMC — the largest distributor in the nation — threatening at one point to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/28/21240637/amc-theaters-universal-trolls-world-tour-disney-warnermedia-digital-streaming"&gt;ban Universal movies&lt;/a&gt; from its screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Sz9J3"&gt;But studios that have taken their films straight to streaming have also had to answer not just to theater owners, but to frustrated talent and directors as well. Most recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600396/scarlett-johansson-suing-disney-black-widow-release"&gt;Scarlett Johansson sued Disney&lt;/a&gt; over the day-and-date release of its Marvel film &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt;, with the actress claiming its hybrid release cost her millions in box office bonuses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eXIzRC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These leading creatives know better, and they are on the right side of history.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HvolYt"&gt;Denis Villeneuve, the director of arguably one of the year’s most anticipated titles, &lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/dune-denis-villeneuve-blasts-warner-bros-1234851270/"&gt;wrote an open letter&lt;/a&gt; last year castigating WarnerMedia’s decision to make its 2021 film slate available on HBO Max the same day the films premiered in theaters. WarnerMedia &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/warner-bros-legendary-nearing-deal-to-resolve-clash-over-godzilla-vs-kong-exclusive-4113497/"&gt;was also reported&lt;/a&gt; to have ponied up for potential losses for the hybrid release of &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt; with Legendary, which financed the majority of the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rDQhfX"&gt;Theaters are still worse off post-pandemic in terms of theatrical exclusivity, with windows in many cases shrunk to just 45 days or fewer. Netflix, the biggest player in the streaming game right now, still bypasses major exhibitors by releasing its films on its service. And Disney’s commitment to theatrical releases remains unclear, with Disney boss Bob Chapek saying &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/12/22622604/black-widow-lawsuit-disney-defends-release"&gt;earlier this month&lt;/a&gt; that “distribution decisions are made on a film-by-film basis.” Warner Bros. will still produce films that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590727/hbo-max-warner-bros-films-hbo-max-2022"&gt;head straight to HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, even while it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618697/amc-warner-brothers-theater-window-45-days-movies-streaming-battle-hbo-max"&gt;returns its movies&lt;/a&gt; to theaters with exclusive theatrical windows. So while theaters are back and the criticism of hybrid releases feels louder than ever, the threat to theatrical still remains — for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emxCx9"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;, Fithian commended support for theatrical exclusivity in Hollywood during this week’s event.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLSu6m"&gt;“I applaud artists who refuse to accept the false narrative that movie theaters are a thing of the past and that the future will be one in which every movie is consumed at home,” Fithian said, according to the outlet. “These leading creatives know better, and they are on the right side of history.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Airbnb says it will temporarily house 20,000 Afghan refugees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7uSkyzRigeFZ-YKvo7dKFwjfF3I=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69774845/airbnb_keys1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Emma Hardy, Airbnb&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4l399j"&gt;Airbnb and Airbnb.org &lt;a href="https://news.airbnb.com/afghan-refugees/"&gt;announced on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that they will temporarily house 20,000 Afghan refugees for free. The effort, an evolution of the home renting platform’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195307/airbnb-free-first-responders-hosts-coronavirus-rentals"&gt;“Frontline stays” program&lt;/a&gt; for housing first responders, is in response to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/7/18/22582355/operation-allies-refuge-afghanistan"&gt;the refugee crisis&lt;/a&gt; caused by the US military’s withdrawal from Afghanistan and &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/8/15/22626082/kabul-capital-fall-afghanistan-government-taliban-forces-explained"&gt;the Taliban’s takeover of the country&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yz2Dqi"&gt;“It has become abundantly clear that the displacement and resettlement of Afghan refugees here in the United States and elsewhere is a significant humanitarian crisis – and in the face of this need, our community is ready to once again step up,” the company wrote in its announcement. This is of course dependent on Airbnb’s existing hosts agreeing to help out. In a tweet thread &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/1430067315228352512?s=20"&gt;announcing the plan&lt;/a&gt;, Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky put out a call for Airbnb hosts interested in housing Afghan families on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BTQxJz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If you’re willing to host a refugee family, reach out and I’ll connect you with the right people here to make it happen!&lt;/p&gt;— Brian Chesky (@bchesky) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bchesky/status/1430067720427425793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vl8TNF"&gt;For participating hosts and homes, the free refugee housing will be available globally, paid for by Airbnb, Airbnb.org (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158434/airbnb-nonprofit-essential-workers-coronavirus-refugees"&gt;Airbnb’s nonprofit counterpart&lt;/a&gt;), Chesky, and donors from the Airbnb.org Refugee Fund. Airbnb didn’t offer a specific timeline for how long the program will last, but the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; “we are planning to support the 20,000 refugees for as long as is needed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSohEq"&gt;Other companies have also made attempts to alleviate some of the harm caused by the US exit from Afghanistan. Facebook and Clubhouse have taken steps to secure accounts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/20/22634209/facebook-hides-friends-lists-instagram-safety-afghanistan-taliban-security"&gt;by hiding friends lists&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/21/22635378/clubhouse-removes-personal-info-user-accounts-afghanistan-taliban-safety"&gt;removing personal info&lt;/a&gt;. The US Department of Defense &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/8/22/22636498/pentagon-afghan-airlift-evacuation-american-kabul-taliban"&gt;has also called on airline companies&lt;/a&gt; to help with further evacuations from Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;
