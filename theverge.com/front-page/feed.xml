    <title>HalloApp is a private ad-free social network from two early WhatsApp employees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3UJfDaIP80W70tzujQ82FVVARTA=/0x167:4000x2834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69604234/mockup_phone.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A screenshot of HalloApp. | HalloApp&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GDOZAL"&gt;Two of the earliest employees behind WhatsApp have emerged with a new private social network called HalloApp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5W2EMY"&gt;Starting Monday, anyone can download and sign up for HalloApp in &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/halloapp/id1501583052"&gt;Apple’s App Store&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.halloapp"&gt;Google Play&lt;/a&gt; on Android devices. There are many parallels between HalloApp and WhatsApp: the app is designed for group or individual chats with close friends and family, the only way you can find people is by knowing their phone number, the messages are encrypted, and there are no ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M65akw"&gt;While other startups have over the years tried and failed to build successful social networks for close friends (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/28/8683885/daum-kakao-buys-path"&gt;RIP Path&lt;/a&gt;), the pedigree of HalloApp’s two cofounders, Neeraj Arora and Michael Donohue, makes this particular effort notable. They both worked at WhatsApp before and after Facebook bought it for $22 billion. Arora was WhatsApp’s chief business officer until 2018 and a key figure in negotiating the Facebook deal. And Donohue was WhatsApp’s engineering director for nearly nine years before he left Facebook in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dm4R3J"&gt;Both Arora and Donohue declined to be interviewed for this story, citing a desire to avoid press attention so early in the app’s lifespan. But they did recently sit down for an interview on Christopher Lochhead’s &lt;a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/christopher-lochhead-follow-your-different/id1204044507?i=1000529348315"&gt;“Follow Your Different” podcast&lt;/a&gt;, in which Arora said, “I think the best way to grow is to create an amazing product that people love to tell their friends and family about.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="eGdtF6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Imagine not being treated like a product.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WAfISg"&gt;HalloApp is broken up into four main tabs—a home feed of posts from your friends, group chats, individual chats, and settings—and its overall aesthetic is very minimal. There are no algorithms sorting posts or group chats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EtEUtO"&gt;Arora laid out the philosophy behind HalloApp &lt;a href="https://halloapp.com/blog/real-relationship-network/"&gt;in a company blog post&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, in which positions it as the antidote to traditional, engagement-driven social media, or “the 21st century cigarette.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8dDN8"&gt;“Imagine your friends online were your real friends,” he wrote. “Imagine your feed wasn’t filled with people and posts you didn’t care about. Imagine scrolling through meaningful moments and seeing what you wanted you to see—not what the algorithm wanted you to see. Imagine not being treated like a product.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1SMVB"&gt;While the blog post doesn’t name Facebook specifically, it’s no secret that WhatsApp’s two cofounders, Jan Koum and Brian Acton, left Facebook over disagreements about plans to monetize WhatsApp with ads. Acton, who now funds the encrypted messaging app Signal, famously tweeted “#deletefacebook” during the height of the Cambridge Analytica scandal. WhatsApp still doesn’t have ads, but Facebook has recently made a push to get businesses selling goods and interacting with customers on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i1bafc"&gt;Eventually, HalloApp plans to charge users for features with a subscription, mimicking how WhatsApp originally monetized before Facebook bought it. For now, the 12-person company is running off an undisclosed amount of money the cofounders raised from investors.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will end onsite COVID-19 testing at its US warehouses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/brCts2kGA03tArfq4DNloDA_1wE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69603733/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nuyzTQ"&gt;Amazon has informed workers that it will end on-site COVID-19 testing at its US warehouses, as first &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/amazon-to-stop-covid-testing-in-u-s-warehouses"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The company confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it will begin ramping down its testing operations in the US by July 30th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SkJBIi"&gt;Although many in the US are vaccinated — 48 percent of the country is fully vaccinated, according to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/us/covid-cases.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times’&lt;/em&gt; data as of Monday&lt;/a&gt; — the change comes as case rates around the country &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/15/us/covid-cases-rise.html"&gt;are going up&lt;/a&gt;. The significant majority of new cases have been found &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-covid-19-cases-united-states-almost-all-among-people-unvaccinated/"&gt;among unvaccinated people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYrxjm"&gt;Amazon informed staff Monday about its plan to end COVID-19 testing, according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;. “Free COVID-19 testing is now widely available and our employees have many options available to them, including through health providers and public testing sites,” part of the message reportedly said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ezbvaC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The company had instituted a massive testing operation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o4cyio"&gt;The company had instituted a massive testing operation, &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/update-on-covid-19-testing"&gt;saying in October&lt;/a&gt; that it planned to handle 50,000 tests per day across 650 sites by November. And as of May 19th, Amazon no longer required masks for fully vaccinated warehouse workers unless otherwise mandated by local laws, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/19/amazon-says-vaccinated-workers-can-ditch-masks-starting-next-week.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Although the company hasn’t required that warehouse workers be vaccinated, it is encouraging it by offering bonuses of up to $80 for getting vaccinated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aKfn7B"&gt;But workers at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199942/amazon-warehouse-coronavirus-covid-new-york-protest-walkout"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202745/amazon-coronavirus-walk-out-detroit-protests-warehouse-cleaning"&gt;warehouses&lt;/a&gt; walked out early in the pandemic to protest the company’s handling of the virus at its facilities. Sometimes, Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/tech/amazon-workers-coronavirus/index.html"&gt;left workers in the dark&lt;/a&gt; when their colleagues had tested positive for the virus, for example. In June, the company also started selling a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535453/amazon-covid-test-consumers-available"&gt;$39.99 at-home COVID-19 test&lt;/a&gt; that is available for consumers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d82b9L"&gt;Amazon will resume its employee testing program if there is a change in guidance from local or national public health officials, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Louis Vuitton’s $2,890 light-up speaker looks like something Thanos would steal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yztDz0l_5RmyYPGWyoRsgp9rg8M=/0x124:1674x1240/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69603136/Screen_Shot_2021_07_19_at_3.11.06_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tZgyG3"&gt;Louis Vuitton has revealed its next foray into tech products: the $2,890 Horizon Light Up Speaker, which looks less like either a gadget or a piece of high fashion, and more like an artifact of untold cosmic power from the next Marvel movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7E5qkW"&gt;According to Louis Vuitton, the idea is that the Horizon speaker will serve as an artistic centerpiece of your living room or outfit, a unique blend of fashion and technology that aims to challenge what a portable speaker should look like, a goal in which it undoubtably has succeeded. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WnquotRtWDZQNrWjUbPeScV21N8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22727080/Screen_Shot_2021_07_19_at_4.33.37_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PJLrrI"&gt;But between the glass, stainless steel, and leather construction, 35 LEDs, and the brand’s traditional symbols and logos plastered on virtually every surface of the speaker, the overall effect is less the kind of discreet, high-end speaker that companies like Bang &amp;amp; Olufsen are known for and more “eldritch space artifact.” Seeing as I don’t have a cool $2,890 lying around to buy and dismantle a Horizon speaker, I can’t confirm with 100 percent certainty whether one of the Infinity Stones is housed within, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zl1xT8"&gt;The company says that the Horizon speaker is inspired by its similarly extraterrestrial-ly shaped Toupie handbag, which comes in a similar, UFO-esque design (and, incidentally, sold at a similar $2,000-plus price range). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-M6h6Eq7WHGoK2NO48EWliFzocI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22727081/Screen_Shot_2021_07_19_at_4.34.20_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zczBXI"&gt;Despite its bizarre appearance and astronomical price tag, Louis Vuitton does appear to have actually built a pretty nice speaker, at least technically speaking. The Horizon features a three-inch subwoofer, two 0.75-inch tweeters, three microphones for voice calls, up to 15 hours of playback off a charge, an included charging / display dock, and both Bluetooth 5.1 and AirPlay 2 for wireless audio. It even charges via USB-C. Of course, those are all things that you’d hope to see at a bare minimum on a speaker that costs almost $3,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbZdXv"&gt;The Louis Vuitton Horizon Light Up speaker is available to order now from Louis Vuitton’s website, although it won’t ship until July 31st — assuming the Mad Titan doesn’t seize them all first. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Olympics are approaching a danger zone of extreme heat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="OLY-2020-TOKYO-JPN-HEAT" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f4Dr3L1ZRmW9hLHlOnQJgxbygdg=/0x0:4611x3074/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69602825/1157638808.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A man cools off at a mist station installed at Shiokaze Park during the beach volleyball test event for the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo on July 25, 2019. - Tokyo 2020 Olympics organisers tested everything from misting sprays to air-conditioned tents on July 25 as they trialed heat mitigation measures a year before the Games gets under way.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Behrouz Mehri / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NwMFjV"&gt;Olympic athletes are grappling with another public health threat on top of the pandemic: extreme heat. This year’s summer&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Olympics are&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/17/weather/olympics-heat-forecast-climate/index.html"&gt;forecast&lt;/a&gt; to be the hottest in decades. Temperatures expected to rise above 30 degrees Celsius (close to 90 degrees Fahrenheit) this week could put even the strongest athletes in danger of heat stroke or illness. They’ll also have to contend with oppressive humidity, which interferes with the body’s ability to regulate its temperature by sweating, on top of the scorching heat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="TTbCmH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The training is brutal, and the conditions that the athletes are training for are dangerous&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Bnp6hT"&gt;Athletes have tried to acclimate themselves to the weather in advance of the games. Team USA, for example, even took inspiration from how the US military gets soldiers ready for desert deployments, according to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2021/07/18/tokyo-olympics-heat-extreme-weather-conditions/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A training regimen might include donning a sweatshirt and beanie while working out in the summer heat. Canada’s women’s rowing team trained indoors and turned the heat all the way up to 35 degrees Celsius inside the sports dome at the Canadian Sport Institute Pacific in Victoria, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/heat-training-athletes-1.6090826"&gt;CBC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s6fVlf"&gt;The training is brutal, and the conditions that the athletes are training for are dangerous, as &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; points out: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qPIALi"&gt;While seeking an advantage, the USOPC also must protect athletes from heat stroke, dehydration and other conditions caused by overexertion. Elite athletes are at acute risk of suffering from those conditions. They separate themselves by their capacity to train and compete through discomfort that would cause others to quit. In extreme heat, such doggedness can transform from admirable to life-threatening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TilIkB"&gt;Heatwaves and heat-related illnesses are on the rise as a result of human-caused climate change. In Tokyo last year, 4,759 people required emergency transportation because of heat illness in July and August. That’s thousands more compared to the same time period in 2008, when there were just 905 (&lt;a href="https://graphics.reuters.com/OLYMPICS-2020/SUMMER-HEAT/bdwvkogrzvm/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has helpful data visualizations on the magnitude of the problem). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="feFN5W"&gt;We can see some similar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/21/20826524/extreme-heat-and-humidity-are-putting-athletes-at-greater-health-risk"&gt;trends in the US&lt;/a&gt;. The Pacific Northwest struggled with extreme temperatures for the region last month, which led to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580120/emergency-department-visits-spiked-june-heat-wave-us-northwest"&gt;huge uptick in emergency room visits&lt;/a&gt;. The late June heatwave interfered with Olympic trials in Eugene, Oregon, where competitions were delayed. Heptathlete Taliyah Brooks&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://thegrio.com/2021/06/27/track-olympics-heat-taliyah-brooks/"&gt;fainted&lt;/a&gt; before the javelin throw and had to be taken off the field in a wheelchair.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4Bqop"&gt;Some events have been moved this year from Tokyo to nearby Sapporo, where temperatures are typically a little cooler. But experts warn that athletes will need to keep preparing for hotter temperatures in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="C0hAjN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s a horrible moment when you see athletes cross the line”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kuDV4Q"&gt;“I think we’re certainly approaching a danger-zone,” Melissa Wilson, an Olympic rower from Great Britain, said in a recent &lt;a href="https://basis.org.uk/rings-of-fire"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by the British Association for Sustainable Sport on how heat could affect the 2021 Olympics. The 2019 Tokyo trials had already left three rowers requiring &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2019/aug/12/concerns-rise-with-tokyo-heat-after-rowers-treated-at-olympic-test-event"&gt;medical treatment for heat exhaustion&lt;/a&gt;, according to the report. “It’s a horrible moment when you see athletes cross the line, their bodies fling back in total exhaustion, and then not rise up.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zz3OB0"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzvkZS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dish cuts a 10-year, $5 billion deal to make AT&amp;T the primary service provider for its MVNO</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vqQWkZfflK3-Dud_Zc1jQyamkjE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69602744/acastro_200804_1777_dish_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dish is on a mission to become the US’ fourth wireless carrier.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D5m5WV"&gt;Dish Network has a new network operator partner for its MVNO brands: AT&amp;amp;T. The companies &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001001082/000100108221000019/dish-20210714x8k.htm"&gt;have signed a network services agreement (NSA)&lt;/a&gt; that will see Dish pay AT&amp;amp;T at least $5 billion over the course of the next ten years to use its 4G and 5G networks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295777/dish-network-5g-q3-2021"&gt;as Dish brings its own 5G network online&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N1A6h6"&gt;The deal takes effect immediately and comes at a time when relations between Dish and T-Mobile — currently a major network partner — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409800/dish-charlie-ergen-t-mobile-cdma-shutdown-grinch"&gt;are particularly strained&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a nonexclusive agreement, and Dish says that some of its customers will likely continue to connect to T-Mobile’s network. The arrangement also gives AT&amp;amp;T the right to request access to use some of Dish’s wireless spectrum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Se1Rrl"&gt;Dish owns Boost Mobile, Ting, and Republic Wireless MVNOs, which operate on other carrier networks. Dish &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;acquired Boost Mobile&lt;/a&gt; in the T-Mobile / Sprint acquisition deal, as part of a scheme to set the company up as the fourth wireless carrier in the US. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352496/dish-ting-mobile-acquisition-tucows-network-tech"&gt;Dish’s Ting and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319621/dish-network-acquires-republic-wireless-5g-cell-carrier-mvno-t-mobile"&gt;Republic Wireless acquisitions&lt;/a&gt; also gave the company access to backend infrastructure and subscribers in anticipation of its launch as a full-fledged mobile carrier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wWwqet"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile’s responses on the matter have had strong “stop hitting yourself” vibes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QK2dvs"&gt;Things haven’t exactly gone smoothly. There’s the impending T-Mobile CDMA shutdown — a network many Boost customers still rely on — that Dish says is happening sooner than expected (T-Mobile’s responses on the matter have had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;strong “stop hitting yourself” vibes&lt;/a&gt;).  Dish has also been &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/financial/dish-sheds-363k-wireless-subs-warns-t-mobile-3g-shutdown"&gt;losing wireless subscribers&lt;/a&gt; in the hundreds of thousands over recent financial quarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YpZqw"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T doesn’t operate a CDMA network, so this new deal isn’t meant to address that problem. At the very least it does include a two-year transition period when the agreement ends during which AT&amp;amp;T must cooperate to help users continue their service, so Dish can hopefully avoid additional potential setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRqZce"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap buys another company to make AR shopping a reality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1YngSmx-JtlK3DZ60nzTkJBoHB4=/0x624:3204x2760/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69602719/Gucci_x_Snap_Shoe_Try_On_Women_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snap and Gucci recently partnered to let users virtually try on a limited edition pair of shoes. | Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ntRwo0"&gt;Snap is making a big bet on AR shopping.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0PMYnt"&gt;The parent company of Snapchat has bought Vertebrae, a company that lets brands create and manage 3D versions of their goods. Vertebrae’s 50-person team will keep developing the platform for existing and new clients, according to a Snap spokesperson. The idea is that a company can easily upload visuals and other information about an item into Vertebrae and have a 3D version made for shoppers to access, and potentially buy directly, within Snapchat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVYRK1"&gt;While Snap first used its augmented reality tech for silly effects like puking rainbows and dancing hotdogs, the company increasingly sees AR as a way to shop. Early tests of AR shopping experiences, such as a recent collaboration with Gucci to let people virtually try on a pair of limited-edition sneakers, have shown Snap that people are &lt;a href="https://downloads.ctfassets.net/inb32lme5009/hSj5P9vzaox79vlTqXZfj/d6094404212f1327e8b7d69535337941/Snap_Consumer_AR_Research_GlobalReport.pdf"&gt;more likely to buy something&lt;/a&gt; after they interact with it in 3D.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yD07WF"&gt;“We’re thrilled to join Snap, where we will strengthen and scale our world class 3D asset platform for retailers and brands,” Vertebrae CEO Vince Cacace said in an exclusive statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The future of AR commerce is bright, and we’ll continue to make it easy for our partners to create, manage, and deploy AR experiences across all customer touch points.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X_9WDt77TkBgpJ3PS31ei7hlOHs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726724/Axis_Press_V2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Vertebrae&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vertebrae’s interface for brands.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jjHg70"&gt;Snap declined to say how much it paid for Vertebrae, but the deal was likely small relative to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447150/snap-waveoptics-acquisition-500m-spectacles-waveguides"&gt;$500 million acquisition of WaveOptics&lt;/a&gt;, which makes the AR displays in its Spectacles smart glasses. Vertebrae raised about $10 million in venture funding to date. It lists Toyota, Adidas, CB2, and other well-known brands as clients on its website. It also &lt;a href="https://sparkar.facebook.com/blog/getting-started-ar-commerce/"&gt;worked with Facebook&lt;/a&gt; — Snap’s biggest competitor — on AR shopping tech in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wh9znP"&gt;When you piece together Vertebrae with Snap’s other shopping-related acquisitions and features, including &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/17/snap-is-taking-a-significant-step-into-fashion-e-commerce-with-its-acquisition-of-fit-analytics/"&gt;Fit Analytics&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/snaps-screenshop-scan-shop-clothing-outfits-2021-5"&gt;Screenshop&lt;/a&gt;, it’s easier to get a sense of its ambitions to be a shopping destination. For brands, the company is setting up a self-service system to easily upload and manage AR versions of their goods that people can discover in Snapchat. For Snapchat users, imagine being able to scan just about anything in the real world and turn it into a virtual object that you can manipulate, resize, and then buy without leaving the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MQ3tjA"&gt;If people really take to AR shopping with their phones, it will make Snapchat more of a utility in the near term while also making its ads more effective, since someone’s purchases are a strong indicator of other items they’d be interested in. And looking beyond smartphones, AR shopping is more compelling in a future world when more people are potentially wearing smart glasses with displays in them, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445481/snap-spectacles-ar-augmented-reality-announced"&gt;Snap’s latest Spectacles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Jeff Bezos get launched into space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hsh0N8nmaZU9KBuntn4q83O7nCM=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69602639/Blue_Origin_New_Shepard_launch.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Blue Origin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VYKuOT"&gt;Jeff Bezos, the richest man in the world, is flying to space Tuesday morning on his company’s suborbital rocket. He’s riding with a motley crew of three other passengers: his brother Mark, 82-year-old aviation icon Wally Funk, and 18-year-old Dutch high school grad Oliver Daemen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szOpG9"&gt;The mission, called NS-16, will mark the first time Blue Origin sends humans to space. Bezos will become the second billionaire to fly a rocket he helped fund, after Virgin Galactic founder Richard Branson launched on his company’s rocket-plane to space on July 11th. Daemen will be the youngest person to fly to space and Funk, a lively firebrand aviator who trained as an astronaut in the ‘60s but never made it to space, will be the oldest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Wdzia4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The launch crew is ready, the vehicle is ready, the crew is ready...”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4ZSebE"&gt;What time is Jeff Bezos going to space?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="h2WWhE"&gt;New Shepard’s liftoff is on track for 9AM ET. Some early Tuesday morning storms are predicted to clear up before then, the company said on Sunday. The whole mission should last about 10 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eGPlP6"&gt;“The launch crew is ready, the vehicle is ready, the crew is ready, and the flight director is ready,” Blue Origin’s NS-16 flight director Steve Lanius told reporters on Sunday. The 6-story-tall New Shepard will lift off from Blue Origin’s rocket facilities in Van Horn, a remote town in the western desert of Texas. The crew capsule will detach from the New Shepard booster at an altitude of roughly 62 miles to spend a few minutes in the weightlessness of microgravity where the crew can see the curvature of Earth. By about that time, the rocket booster will have landed vertically not far from where it launched. The crew capsule will return minutes later under a set of parachutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8TCWTb"&gt;The youngest passenger, Daemen, is filling in for the mystery winner of Blue Origin’s New Shepard seat auction that closed at $28 million last month. That wealthy winner had “schedule conflicts” and wasn’t able to fly, according to Blue Origin. Daemen’s father Joes Daemen, the founder and CEO of a private equity firm based in the Netherlands, participated in the Blue Origin auction and was poised to fly on the next New Shepard mission, but gave his seat to his son.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcZBF7"&gt;For other launch companies like SpaceX and Virgin Galactic, a rocket’s first crewed launch usually includes heavily trained test pilots to monitor the crew cabin and stand ready if things go awry. But Blue Origin decided to throw its founder Bezos and its first paying customer, Daemen, on board because its New Shepard crew capsule is fully autonomous, requiring no input from humans during the mission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JnQS84"&gt;“We know the vehicle is safe. If the vehicle is not safe for me, it’s not safe for anyone,” Bezos told CNN in an interview Monday morning. Blue Origin wouldn’t have had any use for test pilots on its crew capsule, the company’s CEO Bob Smith said. “We didn’t see any value, quite honestly, from doing things step wise in that approach ... Seeing that this is an autonomous vehicle, there’s really nothing for a crew member to go do.” He added that there were some evaluations that Blue Origin has tasked some of the passengers to undertake during the flight (it’s unclear which passengers, though).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Zulrp6"&gt;How to watch Bezos’ spaceflight&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BOEhBj"&gt;Blue Origin will have a &lt;a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/"&gt;Youtube livestream beginning at 7:30AM ET Tuesday ahead of liftoff posted on its website.&lt;/a&gt; Tune in before 9:00AM ET to make sure you don’t miss the action. For other mission updates leading up to launch, you might want to check &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CRgaxboHIIQ/"&gt;Bezos’ Instagram&lt;/a&gt;. He’s been uploading all sorts of pre-launch video reels with him and his crew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WJap4N"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best free apps for video calling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Italy Continues Nationwide Lockdown To Control Coronavirus Spread" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sBOloN_0dkwsgGMSI0vJ1f76A3Y=/0x1111:2667x2889/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66922524/1214094439.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Stefano Guidi/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jz5xAw"&gt;Things are starting to open up, but for now, the COVID-19 pandemic is still with us and many are still relying on video calls to keep in touch with work colleagues, family, and friends. And for most of us — especially those who are facing financial difficulties — free is best. Zoom continues to top the list of videoconferencing apps, but there are a bunch of applications out there that will allow you to meet others online for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBifoi"&gt;We’ve listed a few of the best known videoconferencing apps, along with a couple of popular text chat apps that include video calling features. While most of these already have free versions, some are offering access to additional features for those who are currently working from home or who want to check up on friends and relatives online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bCcs6d"&gt;There are a number of apps we have not included, such as Facebook, WhatsApp, and FaceTime, that allow you to do video chats. We’ve left them out because they require that all participants be members of a specific social network (Facebook, WhatsApp) or that you use a specific type of device (FaceTime, which is Apple-only). We’ve also tried to concentrate on applications that allow you to participate without having to download the app (unless you’re the host), and that allow at least ten or more participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8yIwt"&gt;A good idea is to try one or two out for yourself to see how well they fit in with your style and those of your friends. This list is a good place to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6libON"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="LQuFKh"&gt;The most popular video meeting app&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Zoom is one of the most widely used video meeting apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t5zsGsMM_zzRUfccXF_2EdkoflI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22491368/Screen_Shot_2021_05_04_at_1.20.14_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zoom is one of the most widely used video meeting apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CYiJpA"&gt;Zoom has become one of the most well-known videoconferencing apps — in fact, its name is quickly becoming synonymous with video meetings. Before the pandemic hit, the company pushed Zoom mostly for corporate use, but it also provides a free basic version for individuals. At first, because Zoom didn’t expect its sudden popularity among non-business users, there were several missteps involving privacy and security; the company quickly instituted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230962/zoom-update-security-privacy-features-improvements-download"&gt;a number of changes and updates&lt;/a&gt; to address these issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66nndg"&gt;The free version of Zoom allows up to 100 users to meet, but there is a 40-minute limit on meetings of more than two people, which can be pretty limiting. As of this writing, Zoom was not offering any special deals for those now working at home, but it does have a page &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fdocs%2Fen-us%2Fcovid19.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;offering help and advice&lt;/a&gt; to new users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BYNFVw"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="RHNl6l"&gt;Maximum participants: 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="b91yn2"&gt;One-on-one meetings:  No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JIlwSK"&gt;Group meetings: 40-minute limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="XpI4G1"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kF9xF4"&gt;Record meetings: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="81FqBb"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skype.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Skype&lt;/a&gt; Meet Now&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h3 id="StW6sf"&gt;A longtime go-to for online calls&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Skype’s Meet Now feature supports up to 50 people with a four-hour time limit. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DjOAVSTCxLE9SAzc8jmS5cISMQQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489407/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_2.42.55_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skype’s Meet Now feature supports up to 50 people with a four-hour time limit. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WfOsT4"&gt;Skype has been the go-to platform for one-on-one conversations since the beta was released in 2003. Its Meet Now feature (which is accessed by choosing the “Meet Now” button on the left side of the app) allows for videoconferencing; up to 50 people can meet with a generous four-hour time limit on meetings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JB02lU"&gt;There is also a separate page that lets you &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.skype.com%2Fen%2Ffree-conference-call%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;create a free video meeting&lt;/a&gt; without having to actually sign up for the service. However, you get more features using the app, so if you’re okay with registering for a free account, you’re better off doing that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FQrF4L"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lgPZGp"&gt;Maximum participants: 50&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PS5plA"&gt;One-on-one meetings:  No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3x7cKx"&gt;Group meetings: Four hours per call, 10 hours per day, 100 hours per month&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oFvVzA"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sDu0pA"&gt;Record meetings: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="4k2CRu"&gt;A corporate app with a solid freemium version&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Webex, a videoconferencing app that has been around since the ‘90s, has a useful free version." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ah3jKqqaHJRvvLdrj0b-aTaTz0U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489405/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_2.49.49_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Webex, a videoconferencing app that has been around since the ‘90s, has a useful free version.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XcIFOJ"&gt;Webex is a videoconferencing app that has been around since the ‘90s; it was acquired by Cisco in 2007. While it’s been mainly known as a business application and continues to focus on serving companies, it does have a &lt;a href="https://cart.webex.com/sign-up-webex?experienceType=Unified&amp;amp;ft=selfsignup"&gt;fairly generous free version&lt;/a&gt; that’s worth checking out. During the current pandemic, it has widened the features of the freemium version from 50 to 100 participants, and you can meet for up to 50 minutes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="iVgdLr"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="B6FO7y"&gt;Maximum participants: 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZhF2Xh"&gt;One-on-one meetings:  50-minute limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gTTnlh"&gt;Group meetings:  50-minute limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ruv0bm"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3aAMO5"&gt;Record meetings: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7pIZFI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://meet.google.com/"&gt;Google Meet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5QusdH"&gt;Now featured on your Gmail page&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="msl2WU"&gt;Meet offers a very simple and efficient way to video chat with colleagues, friends, and family — assuming they all have Google accounts, which is a requirement for both hosts and participants. In fact, Google is not only pushing people to use &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21265533/google-meet-gmail-hide-video-call-email-shortcut"&gt;its Meet videoconferencing app&lt;/a&gt; instead of Zoom, but also instead of its own soon-to-be-sundowned Google Hangouts app. (We previously included Google Hangouts in this roundup, but Hangouts users are now being actively urged from within the app to use Google Meet for their video chats.) You can find a Meet link in the Gmail app and in every appointment you make using Google Calendar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="v1Sc5Q"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ndFlQU"&gt;Maximum participants: 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9l2AqB"&gt;One-on-one meetings: 24-hour limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4Vykzc"&gt;Group meetings: 60-minute limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="a6cOEo"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JUU1Sr"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id="0gleS7"&gt;Not just for business&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

&lt;p id="celGBu"&gt;Microsoft Teams was built as a competitor to Slack and is an especially good idea if you’re part of the Office ecosystem. While the application is mainly focused on business use, Microsoft has stepped out of its three-piece suit and unveiled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21349783/microsoft-teams-texting-calls-videoconferencing-how-to"&gt;a free personal version of Teams&lt;/a&gt;, which lets anyone chat, talk, or have video meetings — you just have to create an account with Microsoft in order to use it. Currently, due to the pandemic, Microsoft has extended the maximum number of participants from 100 to 300, and it has pushed the time limit from 60 minutes to 24 hours, which gives it an edge over most other free videoconferencing apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="z7fDpG"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="VPM1Xz"&gt;Maximum participants: Normally 100; extended to 300 during pandemic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3OY8iA"&gt;One-on-one meetings: Normally 60-minute limit; extended to 24 hours during pandemic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MaDoxu"&gt;Group meetings: Normally 60-minute limit; extended to 24 hours during pandemic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OU4H3U"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lqJ1wZ"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZdqxTy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://duo.google.com/about/"&gt;Google Duo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kdg4C0"&gt;A mobile app best suited to one-to-ones&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ycUHduEC2TCTGPyGnIbxdxIf4Ew=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489396/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_3.01.40_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="S0KN9x"&gt;You don’t really expect Google to only offer one simple videoconferencing app, do you? Besides Google Meet, Google also has its mobile app Duo, which was built as a consumer app (whereas Meet was originally designed as a business app). While Duo was first touted as the app to use for one-to-one conversations and could only be used on phones, it now allows you to create groups of up to 32 participants and includes a web app. All participants must have Google accounts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="hrdSff"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="aqu3zn"&gt;Maximum participants: 32&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="k4gNud"&gt;One-on-one meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Rd9Yef"&gt;Group meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3Tah4o"&gt;Screen sharing: Mobile only&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bdHECg"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dSGznj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.starleaf.com/resources/remote-working-hub/"&gt;StarLeaf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="05W8yJ"&gt;A corporate meeting app with a free basic version&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_xVXExpwfdFlYEda9IYnq6kfTQM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489394/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_3.08.31_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XSzst4"&gt;If you’re not a company, you may not have heard of StarLeaf. It’s really a platform for companies rather than individuals; its lowest-cost paid plan starts with five licenses suitable for a small business. But it is now offering a basic video and messaging product free of charge for those trying to keep in touch during the pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="PWyY2P"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="W5dlgk"&gt;Maximum participants: 20&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0hGcJD"&gt;One-on-one meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Gtv4JL"&gt;Group meetings: 45-minute time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uPfKjn"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gxuvie"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TzLjf1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://meet.jit.si/"&gt;Jitsi Meet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4Zxxcw"&gt;Open source with plenty of features&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3MVwxTZMGAegmePx6edtBU9gdi0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489390/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_3.11.38_PM__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YYifcw"&gt;Another “you probably haven’t heard of it” videoconference app, Jitsi Meet is an open-source platform that lets you easily meet online by simply navigating to the site and clicking on “Start meeting.” If you’re a developer, you can build your own conferencing app via &lt;a href="https://jitsi.org/jitsi-videobridge/"&gt;Jitsi Videobridge&lt;/a&gt;, but most people will be happy with the quick web version, which offers many features found in more well-known apps, such as fake backgrounds, chat, session recording (to Dropbox), and the ability to “kick out” unruly participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VhdHjO"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="JlbkKB"&gt;Maximum participants: 100&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bN9uN0"&gt;One-on-one meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3n0cX0"&gt;Group meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GpB4PM"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wCwVWj"&gt;Record meetings: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="GEZRsM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://whereby.com/"&gt;Whereby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="0tRyD7"&gt;Single meeting rooms with up to 50 participants&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/47xmn6lLGej9EWf2brZ_EXrP7f0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489313/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_3.13.49_PM__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Yb3ZHs"&gt;Whereby’s free version gives you the use of a single meeting room with up to 50 participants, along with the ability to lock rooms (participants have to “knock” to gain entrance). Each room has its own URL that you get to choose, which is great — assuming that nobody else has already taken that name. (For example, I first tried &lt;a href="http://whereby.com/testroom"&gt;whereby.com/testroom&lt;/a&gt; and found it was already taken.) But it also has a chat function, lets you share a screen, allows you to mute or eject users, and offers breakout groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="NQQ6g6"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="kgniVF"&gt;Maximum participants: 50	&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rbf1TD"&gt;One-on-one meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bJgo7v"&gt;Group meetings: 45-minute limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MknVjh"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="EXQvVY"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bZ2xUb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ringcentral.com%2Fringcentral-video.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RingCentral Video Pro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YTpiKZ"&gt;A wide range of free features&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VsGToiLppKzDnrooRK78tgpe8E8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22489298/Screen_Shot_2021_05_03_at_3.18.20_PM__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AYVdrv"&gt;Formerly known as Glip Pro, RingCentral Video Pro offers a nice range of features for a free video meeting app. You get 24 hours of meeting time (as long as you sign up by December 2021), screen sharing, recordings (stored up to seven days), chat, and virtual backgrounds, among others. It even offers closed captions (although, as with a lot of AI transcription software, some of the captions leave something to be desired).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="d0yA3C"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="u3cQbc"&gt;Maximum participants: 100 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Mm37EN"&gt;One-on-one meetings: 24-hour limit (for signups by December 2021)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hVRYgE"&gt;Group meetings: 24-hour limit (for signups by December 2021)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OxL6TK"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PWP4sP"&gt;Record meetings: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZLto1d"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.spikenow.com/blog/team-collaboration/spike-a-free-video-conferencing-solution-for-everyone/"&gt;Spike&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FU8i90"&gt;A simple web-based system&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Spike can be used without having to download anything." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e8slY15BZb4EfX-9Tc_mSoiiyuY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22496903/Screen_Shot_2021_05_06_at_3.49.27_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spike can be used without having to download anything.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C5n46v"&gt;Spike, an expanding email service, offers paid group videoconferencing to its subscribers, but it has also made a basic video meeting web app available to anyone who wants it. It’s quick and easy to use: just go to &lt;a href="https://video.spike.chat/"&gt;video.spike.chat&lt;/a&gt;, type in a name, and click on “Join Video Chat Meeting.” Spike generates a unique URL for the chat and even lets you share your screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zCfIFs"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="3KJGq9"&gt;Maximum participants: 200 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Jw8spn"&gt;One-on-one meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vZrJNH"&gt;Group meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xHQSKV"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NNElO2"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="WbxkWo"&gt;&lt;a href="https://telegram.org/"&gt;Telegram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Telegram has introduced group video chats." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/crODlHv9Ut59DJjE8hTXp3uc4xk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22686759/Screen_Shot_2021_06_28_at_9.27.02_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Telegram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Telegram has introduced group video chats.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AbKf3x"&gt;Telegram is a messaging chat app that, as of June 2021, is offering video group chats also. It’s well set up for that: the app already has a feature that lets you create groups with up to 20,000 members, and you can have either private or public groups. For now, video chats are limited to 30 people; the company says it plans to increase that in the future. While it was a little slow to add this feature compared to some other messaging apps (considering the demand for it during the pandemic), it is a welcome add-on for Telegram users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7ENYLr"&gt;Free version features&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="0s7zsb"&gt;Maximum participants: 30 &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VKbWLy"&gt;One-on-one meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="iHG3f9"&gt;Group meetings: No time limit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="591ur3"&gt;Screen sharing: Yes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lXEPnm"&gt;Record meetings: No&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cL6ktK"&gt;More alternatives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oQsh6Y"&gt;There is a wide range of other Zoom alternatives out there, including &lt;a href="https://www.remotehq.com/"&gt;RemoteHQ&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://talky.io/"&gt;Talky&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.8x8.com/"&gt;8x8&lt;/a&gt; (which acquired Jitsi in 2018). Some of these don’t have a free version or the number of participants who can use the free version is limited. For example, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bluejeans.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21286781%2Fbest-video-call-apps-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;BlueJeans&lt;/a&gt; starts at $9.99 per month for unlimited-time meetings with up to 100 participants, while the free version of &lt;a href="https://www.zoho.com/meeting/"&gt;Zoho Meeting&lt;/a&gt; only permits a maximum of three participants, and &lt;a href="https://www.intermedia.com/anymeeting-video-conferencing"&gt;Intermedia AnyMeeting&lt;/a&gt; allows four.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nhBhm"&gt;Other apps offer some video meeting as an added feature. &lt;a href="https://slack.com/"&gt;Slack&lt;/a&gt; is mainly set up for text chat, but it does give you the ability to make voice and video calls as well. If you’re on the free version of Slack, you can make a video call to an individual. But if you want to host a meeting between several people, as opposed to a one-on-one conversation, and want to do it for free, you’ll need to look for an alternative. The messaging app &lt;a href="https://signal.org/en/"&gt;Signal&lt;/a&gt; offers group video calls with a maximum of eight participants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqAFyA"&gt;There are also apps like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21229590/houseparty-how-to-video-chat-call-games-talk-friends-app-ios-android"&gt;Houseparty&lt;/a&gt;, which lets up to eight people use a virtual room to chat. In fact, anybody can drop into a friend’s online session without an invitation (although you can “lock” your room to prevent intruders). However, it does demand that all participants register in order to use it — and registration includes your name, email address, birthdate, and phone number. So we didn’t include it among our recommendations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d0ADE9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 4th, 2021, 2:40PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This article was originally published on June 11th, 2020. Since then, all entries have been updated; in addition, two apps have been dropped (Hangouts and Spike) and Glip Pro has been added.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3fBE0Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 5th, 2021, 9:15AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated to reflect the fact that Whereby’s breakout groups feature is out of beta and to add Signal to the list of alternatives.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hd3p07"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 6th, 2021, 4PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add Spike back to the main list.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngMfAf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 28th, 2021, 2:45PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add Telegram.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JpuW0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 19th, 2021, 3:40PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to change Meet’s time limit and to reflect the change of Glip Pro to RingCentral Video Pro.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat will let you pose your Bitmoji on your profile in 3D</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I4wEAoQ5YXxTgjmudueKz9cmbF8=/0x9:1322x890/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69602531/3D_Bitmoji_in_Profile_Poses_Menu.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some Bitmoji in 3D.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rhxyge"&gt;Snap is introducing the ability to pose your Bitmoji avatar on your Snapchat profile in 3D, the company announced on Monday. For your 3D Bitmoji, you’ll be able to pick from more than 1,200 combinations of body poses, facial expressions, gestures, and backgrounds, according to Snap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWUMwN"&gt;You can get a look at some of the options available in the image at the top of this post and in the one below. It looks like there will be a lot of fun ways to pose your Bitmoji to represent you.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ApGzuHPcD_Y9IbPUJKl2v1Nh-pg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22726809/3D_Bitmoji_in_Profile_Share_Flow.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jXjIUr"&gt;Snap says the feature is rolling out on Monday, but I haven’t been able to access it on Snapchat myself just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwuBIw"&gt;Bitmoji avatars are very popular — Snap says that more than 200 million people use them daily — and this isn’t actually the first time they have gone 3D: Snap offers Snapchat lenses that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/14/16303504/snapchat-bitmoji-world-lenses-animation-gabsee"&gt;project an animated and 3D version of your Bitmoji&lt;/a&gt; onto the world in augmented reality. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple releases iOS 14.7 just as MagSafe Battery Pack appears on shelves</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The MagSafe Battery Pack on the iPhone 12 Pro and Pro Max" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RDTHQVonO8JzipfkTdz-2126zMQ=/0x22:2000x1355/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69602462/MJWY3_AV4.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U2Ct9Z"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211808#147"&gt;has released iOS 14.7&lt;/a&gt;, an update which lets iPhone 12 owners fully utilize the MagSafe Battery Pack, HomePod users manage timers from their phone, and more (&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/07/19/ios-14-7-release-notes-features-changes/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgikvO"&gt;Arguably the update’s most exciting feature is one that adds support for new hardware: Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22576245/iphone-12-reverse-wireless-charging-magsafe-battery-pack"&gt;recently announced MagSafe battery pack&lt;/a&gt;, which should soon be arriving at stores and doorsteps. At least one of the charging devices has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22347900"&gt;already made its way to a customer’s hands&lt;/a&gt;, so Apple seems to be releasing the update in the nick of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePsyjW"&gt;The update also brings improvements to the HomePod timer experience, letting you manage timers from the Home app, rather than having to solely rely on your voice. Apple has also added a new Apple Card feature, which &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-introduces-apple-card-family-enabling-people-to-share-apple-card-and-build-credit-together%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F19%2F22583871%2Fapple-ios-14-7-magsafe-battery-pack-iphone-ipad-timers-apple-card" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it announced in April&lt;/a&gt;: two Apple Card Family users can now merge their accounts to combine their credit limits, while keeping the lowest interest rate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3rNsht"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can now manage HomePod timers from the Home app&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CgSfFc"&gt;Some of the features included in 14.7 don’t seem to be available to those &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22557308/ios-ipados-15-public-beta-apple-install"&gt;running the iOS 15 beta&lt;/a&gt;, and it doesn’t yet seem like there are enough MagSafe Battery Packs out in the wild to get a clear picture of how well they work with iOS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifzJcX"&gt;Apple has also released WatchOS 7.6, which brings the ECG app and irregular heart rhythm notifications to 30 more places, as well as tvOS 14.7. Currently, &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201222"&gt;Apple’s security updates page&lt;/a&gt; says that the latest version of iPadOS is still 14.6, so iPad users may have to wait a bit longer for the update to roll out to their devices.&lt;/p&gt;
