    <title>Netflix’s Witcher prequel gains Michelle Yeoh as... a sword-elf</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fDh1Nfl75SpreeE0VKGyDsyAE1M=/0x0:5117x3411/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69547220/crouching_netflix_yeoh.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b1echG"&gt;Michelle Yeoh is joining the cast of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21340050/netflix-the-witcher-blood-origin-live-action-prequel-announced"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher: Blood Origin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Netflix’s six-part spinoff of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;live-action television adaptation&lt;/a&gt; of the novels by Andrzej Sapkowski. The streaming service &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/witchernetflix/status/1412411286349045771?s=20"&gt;announced that the blockbuster film veteran will play “Scían,”&lt;/a&gt; bringing some star power and action skills to her role as the last remaining member of a tribe of “sword-elves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUmrgG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflixgeeked/status/1412436058608971783?s=21"&gt;According to Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, Scían is on a quest to retrieve a stolen sacred sword, which probably leads to her crossing paths with &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/the-witcher-blood-origin-casts-vikings-actor-laurence-ofuarain-lead-1234722496/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blood Origin&lt;/em&gt;’s other announced cast member&lt;/a&gt;, Laurence O’Fuarian as Fjall. &lt;em&gt;Blood&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Origin &lt;/em&gt;is focused on the creation of the first prototype Witcher (mutant monster hunters for those out of the loop) and the events that lead to the “Conjunction of the Spheres,” a cosmic occurrence that brought the world of elves colliding into a bunch of other realms — creating the magic- and monster-ridden continent of the original novels, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjnq6zD_s7xAhUWqJ4KHTJeApMQFnoECCUQAw&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2015%2F5%2F12%2F8586515%2Fwitcher-3-wild-hunt-review-ps4-xbox-one-game&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1mIaDtSkW4xgZjWiCCc64Y"&gt;CD Projekt Red video games&lt;/a&gt;, and Netflix series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fRV9Dn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Michelle Yeoh is joining the cast of THE WITCHER: BLOOD ORIGIN as the sword-elf Scian, whose deadly quest to retrieve a stolen sacred sword will lead her on a journey that will change the outcome of the Continent. &lt;a href="https://t.co/YzTo3yvTic"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YzTo3yvTic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1412436058608971783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K4razB"&gt;Yeoh’s most recent television project was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/25/16359132/star-trek-discovery-review-cbs-all-access-sonequa-martin-green-michelle-yeoh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and her long career in Hollywood has spanned everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/18/17690280/crazy-rich-asians-trope-rom-com-modern-statement"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crazy Rich Asians&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to James Bond. But she might best be known for her extensive filmography in Hong Kong where she notably did many of her own stunts&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The actress has battled plenty of bad guys, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrE4slKDtRo"&gt;large machinery&lt;/a&gt;, and even a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BNS0rOr-Bs"&gt;stop-motion skeleton&lt;/a&gt;. Her background in stellar on-screen fight scenes is what makes whatever blade-based business Scían gets up to most exciting. If you haven’t seen &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI0v72_wFqc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wing Chun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Reign of Assassins, &lt;/em&gt;it’s generally a good idea to give Michelle Yeoh a sword. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNSezk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher: Blood Origin &lt;/em&gt;is likely still a way off, but Netflix has more Witcher news to share this week: the streaming service is &lt;a href="https://www.witchercon.com/en#welcome"&gt;hosting a virtual WitcherCon &lt;/a&gt;alongside game developer CD Projekt Red on July 9th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>America used fewer fossil fuels in 2020 than it has in three decades</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Brent oil price dives below $20 per barrel" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m8pCMv7HRgAhxDcyY2A5JJd3PvQ=/0x1:4580x3054/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69547187/1210618127.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;NEW JERSEY, USA - APRIL 21: Phillips 66 oil refinery is seen in New Jersey, United States on April 21, 2020. Brent crude oil dived below the threshold of $20 per barrel as the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic ramped up oil oversupply amid low global consumption. | Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m1Przo"&gt;Americans gobbled up fewer fossil fuels in 2020 than they have in three decades, &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=48596#"&gt;according to the US Energy Information Administration&lt;/a&gt; (EIA). Consumption of petroleum, natural gas, and coal dropped by 9 percent last year compared to 2019, the biggest annual decrease since the EIA started keeping track in 1949.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2NG2WB"&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic was responsible for much of the fall as people stayed home to curb the spread of the virus and used less gas. In April 2020, oil prices &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/oil-prices-sink-to-20-year-low-as-un-sounds-alarm-on-to-covid-19-relief-fund"&gt;nosedived below zero&lt;/a&gt; because there was so little demand. The US transportation sector alone used up 15 percent less energy in 2020 compared to the year before. &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=47976"&gt;Higher temperatures last winter&lt;/a&gt; also helped to cut energy demand for heating, according to the EIA. As a result, greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575347/united-states-greenhouse-gas-emissions-historic-plummet"&gt;plummeted to a near 40-year low&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KTGFGW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That downward trend will have to continue&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I21q5X"&gt;That downward trend will have to continue in order to stave off the climate crisis. Upon rejoining the Paris climate agreement, President Joe Biden committed the US to slash its planet-heating pollution &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22394366/joe-biden-pledge-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2030"&gt;in half this decade&lt;/a&gt; from near-peak levels it reached in 2005. That’s part of a global effort to keep global warming from surpassing a point that life on Earth would struggle to adapt to, a global average temperature that’s roughly 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdG9cJ"&gt;To hit that goal, there should be no further investments in new fossil fuel projects, according to a recent landmark &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/pathway-to-critical-and-formidable-goal-of-net-zero-emissions-by-2050-is-narrow-but-brings-huge-benefits"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the International Energy Agency. The oil and gas industries are already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455387/big-oil-gas-shell-exxon-chevron-climate-change"&gt;feeling the crunch from lawsuits and activist investors&lt;/a&gt; forcing them to move faster toward more sustainable forms of energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nOKxhk"&gt;Renewable energy — particularly solar and wind — is on the upswing. Despite the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430465/renewable-energy-solar-wind-iea-2020-exceptional-growth"&gt;renewable sources of electricity grew at a faster pace last year&lt;/a&gt; than they have since 1999. After making up an impressive 90 percent of the global power sector’s growth, the International Energy Agency expects renewable energy to maintain the same “exceptionally high” growth through 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="lWMtFq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Renewable energy — particularly solar and wind — is on the upswing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mkX6JN"&gt;Despite the momentum moving in green energy’s favor, cutting pollution from fossil fuels at a fast enough pace to avoid climate catastrophe is still an uphill battle. As economies opened back up after their pandemic lull, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309374/global-china-carbon-dioxide-emissions-rising"&gt;CO2 emissions came roaring back&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRErF4"&gt;“The rebound in global carbon emissions toward the end of last year is a stark warning that not enough is being done to accelerate clean energy transitions worldwide,” Fatih Birol, IEA executive director, said in a March &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/after-steep-drop-in-early-2020-global-carbon-dioxide-emissions-have-rebounded-strongly"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFgnfb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeEKti"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pentagon cancels Microsoft JEDI contract, will ask for new cloud computing bids</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pentagon" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I2pqE3x7O-QjIulkGYVY79_zqcw=/59x0:4750x3127/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69546954/1223814797.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VVFuOX"&gt;The US Defense Department has canceled the $10 billion JEDI cloud computing project it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20700698/microsoft-pentagon-contract-jedi-cloud-amazon-details"&gt;awarded to Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, saying the controversial program’s design “no longer meets its needs.” The department will replace JEDI with another cloud infrastructure contract and plans to solicit bids from Microsoft as well as Amazon — which sued over losing the original contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hMOh9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/06/pentagon-cancels-10-billion-jedi-cloud-contract.html"&gt;CNBC reported&lt;/a&gt; the news earlier today. “Due to evolving requirements, increased cloud conversancy, and industry advances, the JEDI Cloud contract no longer meets its needs,” reads a Defense Department press release sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “JEDI was developed at a time when the department’s needs were different and both the CSPs technology and our cloud conversancy was less mature,” said acting Defense Department chief information officer John Sherman as part of the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eAsASV"&gt;The release also announced a multi-vendor contract called the Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability contract to provide many of the services offered by JEDI. CNBC says the Defense Department considers Amazon and Microsoft the only companies capable of providing the necessary infrastructure, although it says it will perform market research to see if other competitors could fit the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxB1yO"&gt;JEDI would have seen Microsoft provide cloud services for data storage as well as artificial intelligence tasks and other computing requirements, although some Microsoft employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17990534/microsoft-amazon-letters-medium-rekognition-jedi-military"&gt;protested the decision&lt;/a&gt; to submit a bid. Microsoft beat Amazon to secure the contract, and Amazon filed a lawsuit claiming former President Donald Trump’s animus against it had improperly influenced the decision. The suit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21136641/amazon-microsoft-pentagon-contract-jedi-10-billion-paused"&gt;placed JEDI on pause&lt;/a&gt;, and this spring, a judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409245/amazon-microsoft-jedi-contract-reject-motion-dismiss-trump-influence"&gt;allowed the case&lt;/a&gt; to proceed to trial. Amazon didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on how and if it plans to continue the suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rg69sy"&gt;In a statement to Congress in January, the Defense Department had &lt;a href="https://www.nextgov.com/media/gbc/docs/pdfs_edit/ng_infopaper_jedi_litigation_01282012.pdf"&gt;suggested that&lt;/a&gt; a protracted dispute with Amazon could &lt;a href="https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/"&gt;jeopardize JEDI’s future&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to an “urgent, unmet requirement” for cloud computing. “We remain fully committed to meeting these requirements, we hope through JEDI, but these requirements transcend any one procurement,” said Defense Department press secretary John Kirby in May. “And they’re going to have to be met one way or the other.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s OLED Switch: all of the news about the console upgrade</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V5lBfnqsNp5WYyxc-bE6VkjQxUo=/110x0:1330x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69546901/joy_con_01.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OLED Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It has a bigger OLED screen, but not much else has changed&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="OfKiQP"&gt;Nintendo has just revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;a new Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;, and it brings some nice upgrades to the four-year-old console. The most notable is a larger 7-inch 720p OLED screen, but it also has improved speakers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564942/nintendo-switch-oled-screen-new-kickstand"&gt;a Microsoft Surface-like kickstand&lt;/a&gt;, 64GB of internal storage, and a new dock with an included ethernet port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9U3WjN"&gt;The new Switch won’t support displaying 4K graphics when connected to a TV, despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22312559/new-nintendo-switch-oled-screen-holiday-release-report"&gt;rumors that had suggested otherwise&lt;/a&gt;, and there &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565118/nintendo-oled-switch-cpu-ram-bluetooth-audio-headphones-dock-no-4k"&gt;aren’t major changes to the CPU or RAM&lt;/a&gt;. But even though this OLED Switch is a lot like the old one, there’s still a lot to dig into about it. You can catch up on all of our coverage of the new console right here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo never needed to fix the Switch; it’s not broken</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u8JLbPQSvkpFY4vPh2h5Ck2Qft4=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69546873/NintendoSwitchOLEDmodel_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="88lBVH"&gt;Nintendo finally did it! There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;new Nintendo Switch coming in October&lt;/a&gt;! Over a year of rumors have amounted to the Nintendo Switch OLED model, featuring a slightly larger OLED display, “improved audio,” a built-in ethernet port, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22328983"&gt;a better kickstand&lt;/a&gt;. All of that hype has brought us a device that’s a mere step or two above the product launched back in March 2017. It sort of reminds me of that half-decade where Apple seemed to be stuck with the same generation of Intel CPUs in its laptops. The incremental improvements are nice, but we were all kind of hoping for more (like an end to Joy-Con drift?). Only Nintendo has never needed to give us more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bxz0wa"&gt;I’ve spent the last year and a half using a Nintendo Switch Lite and rereading rumors about the “Switch Pro” that seemed to promise a fix for every single issue I and others had with the original product. I thought a lot about how cool it would be to play games on my TV in 4K or marvel at improved frame rates or just pair my Bluetooth headphones without using some kind of dongle. With the 4K HDR-capable PS5 and Xbox Series X tucked into my entertainment center, I’ve gotten used to familiar games being tweaked for the TVs actually made in 2021 and would like to experience &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; the same way I’m currently experiencing &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AGXPBE"&gt;That’s not going to happen. The latest Switch will not incorporate HDR. It won’t do 4K or 120 frames per second, either. Instead, it will cap out at 1080p when attached to a TV, and its 7-inch OLED display will do just 720p. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;A $200 smartphone&lt;/a&gt; has better pixel density than the incoming Switch. I could get a cheap Android phone, a controller, and a subscription to Stadia and have a higher-resolution experience on my TV than I could with the Nintendo Switch OLED model. But I won’t be doing that. I will be patiently waiting for preorders on the OLED Switch instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e6lGqS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nintendo is a toy company first, a tech company a distant second&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K1fnr5"&gt;Because as much as many of us wanted something that could compete with Sony and Microsoft and give us &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; in 4K, Nintendo doesn’t actually need to cater to us. Its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422451/nintendo-annual-earnings-switch-84-59-million"&gt;console sales were up&lt;/a&gt; 44 percent year over year in the first three months of 2021. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20951926/nintendo-doug-bowser-interview-switch-lite-sales-3ds-support-consoles"&gt;It wants new owners&lt;/a&gt; — not necessarily to convert old ones. It can put out something with as minor upgrades as the Nintendo Switch OLED model, and we will buy it! Heck, it can have the audacity to actually officially call &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1412407485298790409"&gt;the thing the Nintendo Switch (OLED model)&lt;/a&gt;, and we will buy it! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1a2N8M"&gt;Nintendo makes really good games, and it produces truly innovative hardware. It’s a toy company first, a tech company a distant second. It’s never had to compete with Sony or Microsoft on specs, and historically, when it tried, it lost badly. Why get dragged into an arms race and take &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/3/22264242/playstation-5-sales-loss-manufacturing-costs-msrp-sony"&gt;massive losses on console sales&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/79180/xboxes-arent-profitable-but-the-nintendo-switch-certainly-is/index.html"&gt;it’s already selling the Switch at a profit&lt;/a&gt; and will likely be able to sell the OLED Switch at an even higher profit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0hA0E"&gt;While frame rate-counting nerds like myself have groaned about the Switch’s technological limitations versus the much more expensive (and harder-to-find and buy) PS5 and Xbox Series X, the vast majority of people don’t notice the occasional frame rate hiccup or care that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/nintendo-to-use-new-nvidia-graphics-chip-in-2021-switch-upgrade"&gt;a new custom Tegra chip inside a Switch Pro could theoretically use Nvidia’s DLSS technology&lt;/a&gt; to improve graphics via machine learning. Losing out on these things won’t matter to them as much as having a better display or drift-free Joy-Con. (Nintendo has neither confirmed nor denied that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MP5xr5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Doing a mid-cycle processor refresh leads to a lot of confusion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lJYZEm"&gt;Honestly, losing out on these things doesn’t bother me as much as I thought it would, either. After the initial disappointment over the lack of 4K and a better CPU, I was excited! This new model really was addressing my biggest complaints and coming in at a price I could stomach. I primarily play the Switch in handheld mode, and my main issue with both it and the Switch Lite has been the extremely ugly 720p LCD. OLEDs typically have better color accuracy and contrast than an LCD. So an OLED, even one with as dinky a resolution as 720p, is going to likely be a major improvement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0lrDU"&gt;And as we saw with the last generation of Sony and Microsoft hardware, doing a mid-cycle processor refresh &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335984/microsoft-xbox-series-x-exclusive-next-gen-promise"&gt;leads to a lot of confusion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-xbox-one-x-is-the-perfect-console-for-lazy-pc-gamer-1820083982"&gt;blurs the line between console and PC gaming&lt;/a&gt;. The appeal of console gaming is you buy the console and the game, and things just work. You shouldn’t have to worry about patches to introduce all of the features on the box. Sony and Microsoft have tried, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/10/15600272/sony-microsoft-playstation-4-pro-project-scorpio-nielsen-study"&gt;often bungled&lt;/a&gt;, to communicate the difference between all of their offerings. Nintendo has only been a little better. Remember the DS and DSi? &lt;a href="https://retrogamebuyer.com/nintendo-ds-vs-ds-lite-vs-dsi/"&gt;Nintendo had to make an entire chart&lt;/a&gt; to explain all of the differences. Or what about the 3DS and the New 3DS? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/6/8353503/xenoblade-chronicles-3d-new-nintendo-3ds-review"&gt;Some games&lt;/a&gt; didn’t even work on the original 3DS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RundS7"&gt;But there’s no need for charts or careful PR pushes to explain the difference this time. You can get a Switch for $299, a mobile-only Switch Lite for $199, or you can wait for a little while and get the illustratively named Switch (OLED model) for $349. The games should work. The display should be improved. The ethernet should be built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EeJ1f6"&gt;Nintendo could have given us a mid-cycle refresh to compete with all of those powerful PC consoles by Sony and Microsoft. But instead, it went &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21562549/nintendo-game-and-watch-super-mario-bros-next-gen-consoles"&gt;the Nintendo route&lt;/a&gt;. No confusion, no 4K, and my basic butt waiting to preorder anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roblox signs music partnership with Sony</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lil Nas X performing ‘Old Town Road’ inside Roblox" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dP5OOv-wlELlS6XSG1NX-d3Hlgo=/59x0:1679x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69546546/LNX_Concert_Old_Town_Road.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roblox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HwDFEp"&gt;Virtual world-building platform Roblox has signed a deal with Sony Music Entertainment. The deal extends an existing collaboration that included a 2020 Lil Nas X concert inside Roblox as well as a 2021 virtual dance party with Swedish artist Zara Larsson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOjcgB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://corp.roblox.com/2021/07/roblox-partners-sony-music-entertainment-bring-artists-metaverse/"&gt;A press release says&lt;/a&gt; the agreement will include “innovative music experiences for the Roblox community that offer a range of new commercial opportunities for Sony Music artists to reach new audiences and generate new revenue streams around virtual entertainment,” although a Roblox spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company was not announcing any specific events or experiences at this time. A spokesperson says Roblox is in talks with other record labels as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8igaGH"&gt;Roblox has grown dramatically in recent years, particularly with young users. The platform — a system for creating games and other virtual experiences for either profit or personal entertainment — &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/roblox-stock-price-sinks-after-monthly-active-user-decline-2021-6"&gt;reported 43 million&lt;/a&gt; daily active visitors in May. Lots of these experiences incorporate music, including through an official Roblox “boombox” item. Roblox and other “metaverse”-style worlds like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; have also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453061/ava-max-roblox-album-launch-party"&gt;played host&lt;/a&gt; to live virtual concerts and launch parties, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1o2giw"&gt;Roblox’s popularity has earned it positive &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;negative attention from the music industry. The National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527713/roblox-nmpa-lawsuit-copyright-infringement-deadmau5-ariana-grande-imagine-dragons"&gt;sued the company&lt;/a&gt; last month for allegedly enabling piracy, accusing Roblox of profiting when users upload copyrighted songs and share them within Roblox experiences. Roblox &lt;a href="https://corp.roblox.com/2021/06/roblox-partners-bmg-develop-new-opportunities-artists-songwriters/"&gt;settled claims&lt;/a&gt; with one plaintiff in mid-June, signing a “strategic agreement” with music label BMG. At that time, &lt;a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2021/06/21/bmg-roblox-music-licensing-partnership/"&gt;NMPA CEO David Israelite said that&lt;/a&gt; “having some deals with some labels and publishers to host music events is in no way legally adequate” for the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UtKdS"&gt;In today’s announcement, Roblox emphasizes that “Roblox respects the rights of all creators and uses advanced technology to screen all uploaded music. Roblox has no tolerance for repeat offenders and quickly responds to all submitted DMCA requests.” The company declined to specify on the record whether Roblox’s deal will include a license that covers users playing Sony music in experiences — something that major social media platforms like YouTube have enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo confirms no new CPU or increased RAM in the OLED Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8CPWzCrqAQYz-oOICnF6T9jMpr0=/110x0:1330x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69546301/joy_con_03.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BSfTv8"&gt;Nintendo just announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;new model of the Switch that has an OLED screen&lt;/a&gt;, but it won’t bring major changes to the CPU or RAM currently used in other iterations of the console, Nintendo confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0fesx"&gt;“Nintendo Switch (OLED model) does not have a new CPU, or more RAM, from previous Nintendo Switch models,” Nintendo said to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zM3b3"&gt;The company didn’t mention anything about improvements to those in its &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/4mHq6Y7JSmg"&gt;announcement video&lt;/a&gt;, on its &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/oled-model/"&gt;marketing page dedicated to the new console&lt;/a&gt;, or in its page listing &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/tech-specs/#oled-section"&gt;the technical specs for the device&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s not surprising that this is the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4j3Ip3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4mHq6Y7JSmg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R413Nr"&gt;Nintendo also confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that all Switch docks are interchangeable, meaning the non-OLED Switch can sit in the dock included with the OLED Switch and that the OLED Switch can slot into the older Switch dock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBjq5k"&gt;As for Bluetooth headphone support, something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22315790/nintendo-switch-pro-4k-oled-upgraded-what-we-want"&gt;we really wanted from an upgraded Switch&lt;/a&gt;, it sounds like that’s not in the cards, either. “We have nothing to announce on this topic, but like the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch Lite consoles, Nintendo Switch (OLED model) supports Bluetooth tech for the Joy-Con controllers,” Nintendo tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. And even though you’ll hear “enhanced audio” from the onboard speakers, Nintendo says there are no changes to the audio experience when you listen through headphones or your TV’s speakers when using the OLED Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fD2GkX"&gt;The new OLED Switch will be released on October 8th for $350. In addition to the bigger screen and enhanced audio, it also looks to have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564942/nintendo-switch-oled-screen-new-kickstand"&gt;a much-improved kickstand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo finally improved the Switch’s kickstand with new OLED model</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Nintendo Switch with OLED screen" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lVPvE0bawN5D8CHSDtJ65brXKJs=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69545867/newswitch_kickstand.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2TPIRf"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;Nintendo’s new Switch with an OLED screen&lt;/a&gt; seems promising for people who’ve wanted a bigger, more vibrant display to play games. That’s worth getting excited about (despite the apparent lack of spec improvements inside), but I’m just as pleased that Nintendo revised &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/11/5/16602556/nintendo-switch-kickstand-problems-bad"&gt;the truly horrible kickstand present in the original Switch&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of the flimsy, fragile stand that’s prone to wobbling (or breaking if you’re unlucky), the new one takes a page from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21526702/microsoft-surface-pro-x-2020-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Pro tablets&lt;/a&gt; — and seems a lot better for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1tOL8"&gt;Looking at the new Switch console’s backside, the kickstand is much wider, extending across the entire bottom part of the tablet to better support its weight. Nintendo’s announcement video shows the improved kickstand supporting custom adjustments, which should give you more ways to comfortably use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GrZbcJ"&gt;There are several multiplayer and single-player games releasing this year on the Switch that’ll benefit from this improved kickstand. At E3 2021, Nintendo announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535183/mario-party-superstars-warioware-nintendo-direct-e3"&gt;new &lt;em&gt;Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;WarioWare &lt;/em&gt;games&lt;/a&gt; as well as a remaster of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535127/advance-wars-1-and-2-re-boot-camp-nintendo-direct-e3-2021"&gt;first two &lt;em&gt;Advance Wars&lt;/em&gt; games&lt;/a&gt;. The company is also releasing &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread &lt;/em&gt;on October 8th&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— the same day that the Switch with OLED is launching&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ca3b9J"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why it took Nintendo 15 years to make Metroid Dread","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22536783/metroid-dread-yoshio-sakamoto-nintendo-switch-e3-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nRdziV-_0kw9qRKu9e5XnBRiMzM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701294/newswitchstand.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ee8Osc"&gt;Despite being almost five years old, the original Switch hardware has endured because it’s clever and well-built and because it relies upon standards like USB-C and microSD. The fiddly kickstand was a glaring misstep, and it’s great to see that Nintendo has reworked it in the new OLED version. I’m not suggesting that it’s worth upgrading to this new $349.99 console just because of the kickstand, but it’ll certainly sweeten the deal if you usually use the Switch in portable model or could see yourself doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7orVx6"&gt;It’d be ideal if Nintendo’s learnings trickled down to the less expensive model, mostly because an improved kickstand would be a really strange feature to reserve for its most premium console. Perhaps we’ll hear more about it as we get closer to its October 8th release date.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="7mXjnd"&gt;Nintendo finally announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;Switch with an OLED screen&lt;/a&gt; that comes out in October, but right now, GameStop is hosting a big one-day discount on two must-have Switch games: &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fsuper-mario-odyssey%2F10141908.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Ffire-emblem-three-houses%2F10173345.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Each game is going for $35 (usually $60) for the physical or digital versions, and if you have the means, I suggest getting both. &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; is the latest (delightful) installment in the long-running &lt;em&gt;Mario &lt;/em&gt;3D platforming franchise, while &lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem: Three Houses&lt;/em&gt; has strategic, turn-based battles interspersed with team- and friend-building elements you’d usually find in a &lt;em&gt;Persona &lt;/em&gt;game.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zbJnEU"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Duo keeps falling in price. Woot is hosting the best deal — by far — right now on the AT&amp;amp;T-locked version of the two-screened device in new condition. &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13112648?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fmicrosoft-surface-duo-dual-screen-lte-tablets-2" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The base model with 128GB of storage costs just $410&lt;/a&gt;, while doubling the storage space bumps the price up to $510. It still might be a little ridiculous to invest in this phone since Microsoft hasn’t delivered any major updates recently, but at least you won’t have to pay as much as early adopters did to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="v8HQPY"&gt;Last week’s excellent deal on the &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-14367655?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeals.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fmpp%2Fproductdetail%2F9dch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell G15 Ryzen Edition for $1,078&lt;/a&gt; (usually $1,458) is still happening. You can head over to Dell to get this deal on a capable but affordable gaming laptop that has a 15.6-inch 1080p display with a 165Hz refresh rate, with AMD’s Ryzen 7 5800H processor, and Nvidia’s RTX 3060 graphics chip. It has 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage (both of which can be upgraded after purchase). One caveat, though, is that shipping is currently scheduled for early August.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Sn3m6"&gt;The OnePlus 9 has received its first big price cut. Usually $729, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08Y73NTXY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s $649 now&lt;/a&gt;. As my colleague Allison Johnson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22564077/oneplus-9-pro-sale-price-screen-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;wrote yesterday&lt;/a&gt;, you won’t be missing much by not opting for the more expensive 9 Pro. The 9 and 9 Pro share the same processor, a 120Hz refresh rate display, and a great 50-megapixel ultrawide camera, though, the 9 has slower wireless charging, and a plastic build instead of aluminum. The OnePlus 9 can work via 4G and 5G on Verizon and T-Mobile, but just 4G with AT&amp;amp;T’s network.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo Switch OLED model will go on sale October 8th for $350</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MeoTDMA1-sx_eejL59ML_lIwfXo=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69545212/switcholedmodel.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4BoEkW"&gt;Nintendo is &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/oled-model/"&gt;announcing a new Switch model today&lt;/a&gt; with a larger 7-inch 720p OLED display. While rumors had suggested this new Switch would ship with a new Nvidia chip inside, this new OLED model is mostly a screen upgrade. Nintendo lists this Switch OLED model as only supporting 1080p via TV mode, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22312559/new-nintendo-switch-oled-screen-holiday-release-report"&gt;rumors had suggested 4K support&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to a rumored Nvidia chip upgrade. The Switch OLED model will go on sale for $350 starting on October 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u6Q7bQ"&gt;Other than the new screen, this revised model includes an adjustable stand for tabletop play, 64GB of built-in storage (up from 32GB), a new dock with a wired ethernet port built in, and improved audio for handheld or tabletop play. Nintendo only mentions “up to 1080p via HDMI in TV mode” for the TV dock, so the rumored 4K mode isn’t part of this OLED Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fgzmW"&gt;Nintendo has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that there are no major internal changes to the CPU or memory. “Nintendo Switch (OLED model) does not have a new CPU, or more RAM, from previous Nintendo Switch models,” says a Nintendo spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eb9NnZ6sbwlMvSD0LSpf1ibfDus=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701105/NintendoSwitchOLEDmodel_02.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nintendo’s new OLED Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SEdJ4P"&gt;Elsewhere, there’s little else changed over the original device. Nintendo says battery life on this new OLED Switch will be up to nine hours, the same amount as the current Switch. This OLED Switch is slightly longer than the original and also slightly heavier at 0.71 pounds (0.32kg) versus the 0.66-pound (0.29kg) weight of the original Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wwYJXz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Must-play Nintendo Switch games are almost half off","url":"https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/7/6/22564848/nintendo-switch-games-sale-mario-smash-animal-crossing-microsoft-surface-duo-deal"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="YZzjAc"&gt;Original Joy-Cons will all work with this new Switch, and all existing games will run on this new OLED model. Nintendo is also offering both black and white units when the Switch OLED model ships later this year. The new dock will also work with both the Nintendo Switch and this new OLED model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qMLNHf"&gt;This updated Switch has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346041/oled-nintendo-switch-dlss-nvidia-chip-report"&gt;rumored heavily&lt;/a&gt; in recent months, and Nintendo has chosen to reveal it well after the company’s E3 show that focused exclusively on new Switch games. Reports had suggested this new Switch would appear before E3 began last month.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oTkDCPlOwWyTyW3JtKMWOAqJfgs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701153/switcholeddock.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Switch dock.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fjgez4"&gt;The new Switch arrives nearly two years after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date%5D"&gt;Nintendo’s Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt;, a smaller and cheaper version of the Switch that you can’t hook up to a TV. The Switch Lite debuted at $199 in September 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aROu5i"&gt;Nintendo’s Switch has sold incredibly well, with the console &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21562530/nintendo-switch-lite-sales-october-2020"&gt;dominating US sales charts&lt;/a&gt; for nearly two years straight. Switch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422451/nintendo-annual-earnings-switch-84-59-million"&gt;lifetime sales are at 84.59 million&lt;/a&gt; units shipped since its launch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/12/14237060/nintendo-switch-console-launch-date-price-announced"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, a figure that is getting closer to the Wii console’s 101.63 million lifetime sales mark. This updated Switch model is bound to only help push sales even closer to the Wii.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0oLup"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, June 6th 11:20AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with Nintendo comments.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
