    <title>Dish is confident in its plan to offer 5G in its first major cities by end of Q3 2021</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QclUa4"&gt;Dish Network co-founder and chairman Charlie Ergen underscored the company’s commitment to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/8931827/dish-carrier-plans-5g-network-tmobile-sprint-us-confirms"&gt;building a 5G wireless network&lt;/a&gt; on today’s Q4 2020 earnings call. He restated the intention to bring 5G online in its first major cities by the end of Q3 2021 — that’s the period running from July through September — and was bullish on Dish’s ability to boost the US’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"&gt;somewhat dismal global position&lt;/a&gt; in terms of wireless network offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="px7YNP"&gt;Ergen spent several minutes on &lt;a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/yi3fxcbb"&gt;today’s call&lt;/a&gt; recapping what the company has done so far in its network-building effort. With its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21309968/dish-boost-sprint-tmobile-acquisition-spinoff-closes-prepaid"&gt;acquisition of Boost Mobile&lt;/a&gt; last year, it’s currently offering prepaid service as an MVNO on T-Mobile’s network, but it has also been accumulating its own spectrum to make the move to a full-fledged carrier. That’s a good sign for wireless competition in the US; with Sprint no longer available as a choice, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20708411/dish-tmobile-sprint-carrer-merger-assets-spectrum-boost"&gt;Dish is positioned to step up&lt;/a&gt; as a fourth major carrier option. And it kind of has to in order to satisfy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134278/sprint-tmobile-merger-court-ruling-opinion-decision-explainer-carriers-antitrust"&gt;the conditions of the T-Mobile-Sprint merger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PchgGb"&gt;To that end, Dish made low-, mid-, and high-band spectrum purchases last year, and it’s &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/regulatory/c-band-assignment-phase-kicks-off-february-8"&gt;estimated to have spent $2 billion&lt;/a&gt; in the recent C-band auction. With access to these different kinds of spectrum, Dish has the pieces of the so-called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21284203/5g-need-to-know-health-safety-radiowave-spectrum-verizon-att-tmobile-cellular-data"&gt;5G “layer cake”&lt;/a&gt; that will help it establish fast service with wide coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PnayvP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"5G in the US is disappointing right now, but it’s going to get better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292074/5g-nationwide-verizon-att-tmobile-c-band"},{"title":"The iPhone 12 series is already driving 5G adoption in the US","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287683/iphone-12-pro-max-5g-sales-adoption"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="lKc9dQ"&gt;“This isn’t our first rodeo,” Ergen said, stressing his confidence in the company’s ability to execute, despite the considerable risks. He didn’t stop there either; Ergen believes Dish can “help the United States actually start leading again in wireless.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CUHguA"&gt;Maybe he’s right. There’s a big challenge ahead of Dish, but the company doesn’t face one of the challenges plaguing the major carriers right now: keeping 4G data flowing while adding 5G. This has led Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T, in particular, to turn to a technology called Dynamic Spectrum Sharing, or DSS, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196060/verizon-5g-slower-than-lte-speed-test"&gt;poor results&lt;/a&gt;. Sadly, the bar is quite low at the moment for US networks, which might help Dish get a running start.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where and when you can buy the Xbox Series S and Series X consoles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/F-XyU5rsEElrPRnqeZ6FTPpJqdU=/0x0:1220x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67448810/twarren_200909_4177_0030.0.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mlkkez"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update February 22nd, 2021 4:55PM ET: The Xbox Series S is currently available at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733050721171570442" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Best Buy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; for $299.99. You can find more information &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22296076/xbox-series-s-restock-best-buy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;here&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZoKH5"&gt;The Xbox Series S and Series X consoles are officially out, and if you missed out on preordering either (or both — look, I’m not going to judge), you might be able to snag one online soon. Due to the pandemic, combined with the high demand for these consoles, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551484/best-buy-playstation-5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-store-sales-holiday-2020"&gt;retailers like Best Buy and Target are only selling online&lt;/a&gt;. That means you won’t be able to walk into a store to pick one up — unless you’ve purchased it already online. Only then will you be able to arrange an in-store pickup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5s3rFB"&gt;Until we hear updates on stock replenishing from retailers, I recommend keeping it locked to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08H75RTZ8/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=sl2&amp;amp;tag=verge-evergreen-20&amp;amp;linkId=e8ef14f64e0e9e1dacba6db0add8b578&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fc%2Fxbox-series-x-video-games%2F-%2FN-fd2hh&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fconsoles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Fpromotions%2Fgaming%2F20-1310%2Findex.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg&lt;/a&gt;, and (if you have memberships) &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/xbox-brand-showcase.html"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.samsclub.com%2Fp%2Fxbox-series-x%2Fprod24980179&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21437954%2Fxbox-series-x-s-preorder-us-retailers-microsoft-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sam’s Club&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723309405282483811" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy encourages shoppers to visit its site&lt;/a&gt; to order instead of showing up at its stores. It doesn’t have set time slots for when it expects stock to be available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lVxesu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="hLH7PZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444130"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ejjLHa"&gt;If you’re trying to decide between the Xbox Series S or Series X, my colleague Tom Warren recently reviewed both consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cqFv0O"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series X review: a next-gen PC","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"},{"title":"Xbox Series S review: small console, big potential","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h1 id="hCC7LP"&gt;Buy with the Xbox All Access plan&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="tnxiJL"&gt;As an alternative to paying full price upfront for each console, you can pay a monthly installment for either of them through the Xbox All Access plan. It’s a financing option that lets you get the console upfront at no cost. You’ll be billed one monthly payment for the console and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate together ($24.99 per month for the Series S, $34.99 per month for the Series X) for 24 months.

    <title>Xbox Series S is in stock at Best Buy</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D2Y_UmJIALkpuXAhDAF4zaVxpMQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68857913/vpavic_4275_20201030_0038.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6AgAag"&gt;Last November, Microsoft debuted two next-gen consoles — the Xbox Series X and the more affordable Xbox Series S. If you are looking for the more affordable next-gen Xbox, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733050721171570442" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; has the console in stock right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qyA4VQ"&gt;The Xbox Series S variant costs $299, is smaller, and is less powerful than the $500 Series X. One other important thing to note is the Xbox Series S is a digital-only console, meaning it lacks a disc drive to play physical games. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RsBijG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9444105"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QU1oLf"&gt;If you plan to buy this console, you may want to consider picking up a few accessories that will help you get the most out of your new gadget, most notably &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF26MXW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an additional controller&lt;/a&gt; if you are playing a game with a local co-op with a friend or family member. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tp76dt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562380"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dv0OUa"&gt;As far as storage goes, both consoles have rather limited storage. If you plan to download some older games that do not take full advantage of the next-gen hardware and don’t want to deplete your limited SSD storage, you can grab an external hard drive. You can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Game-Drive-Xbox-Special/dp/B072LX7WLP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;4TB external hard drive from Seagate for $100&lt;/a&gt;, and it includes two months of Xbox Game Pass, a Netflix-like digital video game subscription service for Xbox consoles. Or you can buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;three months of Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t have any games you’re interested in buying yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0on2NA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546609"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WaqSo8"&gt;Of course, you can also upgrade your SSD as well, but there are a few things to keep in mind. Seagate is the only one with an SSD expansion card compatible with both consoles. Additionally, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SSD expansion card only comes in 1TB&lt;/a&gt;, and it is very expensive, costing $220. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="B0wXAe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562459"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="ffPtu8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Xbox Series S review: small console, big potential","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>SpaceX announces second crew member of its all-civilian space mission</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A white woman with long, light brown hair smiling and standing with her arms crossed in front of a wall painted with planet earth and a star." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XNtxvTpv0HtoNYnyARwKu09fNGg=/1x0:1200x799/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68857769/Hayley_Arceneaux.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Hayley Arceneaux | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.stjude.org/inspire/series/st-jude-cancer-survivor-hayley-arceneaux-hope-inspiration4-worlds-first-all-civilian-space-flight.html" target="_blank"&gt;St. Jude&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7tgA4N"&gt;Hayley Arceneaux, a physician assistant at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, will join the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261038/spacex-announces-first-all-civilian-mission-to-space"&gt;first all-civilian trip to space&lt;/a&gt;, SpaceX announced today. She will orbit Earth for up to five days in the Crew Dragon capsule as part of the Inspiration4 mission. Crew members are being selected based on “mission pillars of leadership, hope, generosity and prosperity,” according to the &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210201005905/en/World%E2%80%99s-First-All-Civilian-Mission-to-Space-Will-Usher-in-New-Era-of-Commercial-Space-Exploration"&gt;press release for the mission&lt;/a&gt;. Arceneaux, SpaceX said, will represent hope. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HZeny"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/22/science/spacex-hayley-arceneaux.html"&gt;Diagnosed with bone cancer at 10&lt;/a&gt;, she had some of the bones in her left leg replaced with titanium as part of her treatment. She was treated at St. Jude, where she now works with children who are being treated for lymphoma and leukemia. With the upcoming mission, Arceneaux will become the first person with a prosthetic body part to go to space.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WPVAN1"&gt;The mission is slated for late 2021 and if all goes as scheduled, Arceneaux, at 29 years old, could also be the youngest American to go to space. The title of youngest person in space would still go to &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/05/gherman-titov-bad-boy-cosmonaut-turned-elder-statesman-of-space/"&gt;Gherman Titov&lt;/a&gt;, a cosmonaut who was 25 when he orbited Earth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lc85sQ"&gt;The selection process for crew members also involves a fundraising effort for St. Jude, with a sweepstakes where people can donate to St. Jude for chances to be the third member. The fourth crew member will be the winner of a contest sponsored by the billionaire Jared Isaacman, who is funding and commanding the mission. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New York City will reopen its movie theaters for the first time in nearly a year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x6s4kHcYHIVzyWRfJPYD4MYLwck=/290x0:1310x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68857549/cc34ecb078c29957ad70d987b6b38121.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Marvel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pvATSs"&gt;New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo will allow movie theaters in New York City to open with a limited audience capacity for the first time in nearly a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mc8UOv"&gt;As part of the restrictions, theaters will only allow a maximum of 50 people to sit in any one screening (restricting capacity to 25 percent). Attendees must wear masks and sit in their assigned seats. The theaters will also have to implement advanced air filtration systems, according to Cuomo. While theaters outside of New York City have been allowed to reopen over the last few months, high case numbers in the city have prevented people from going. Theaters originally shut down because of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21182499/regal-cinemas-close-all-us-theaters-march-17th-coronavirus"&gt;pandemic in mid-March 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNRxLB"&gt;Allowing New York City theaters to open is a big deal, especially for studios like Disney and Universal, whose executives are likely worried about timing for upcoming big releases like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21437889/black-widow-delayed-release-date-marvel-cinematic-universe-disney-streaming-mulan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;(May 7th)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21176895/fast-and-furious-f9-delay-universal-coronavirus-vin-diesel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F9 &lt;/em&gt;(May 28th)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Ticket prices are much higher in key markets like New York City and Los Angeles (where theaters are still unable to open). Plus, New York and California make up 21.5 percent of &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/07/blockbusters-return-until-new-york-and-california-reopen.html"&gt;all US filmgoing audiences&lt;/a&gt;. Not having those theaters open, even in a limited capacity and with higher ticket revenue, is catastrophic for movies that could potentially make $1 billion in pre-pandemic days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8Zue8"&gt;While industry insiders speculated that Disney could move &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;to Disney Plus as a Premier Access title and then release the film internationally where theater attendance is better, it was also increasingly apparent Marvel Studios didn’t want to go that route. &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;is a $200 million-plus budget movie; moving it to Disney Plus, even as a $30 Premier Access title, would never generate the same initial revenue it could earn at a theater pre-pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YMZWKy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The alternative is a situation US audiences saw with ‘Wonder Woman 1984’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tfnRmo"&gt;Without New York City or Los Angeles, Disney likely would have delayed the film again. But with New York City theaters reopening, even at just quarter capacity, it likely gives studio executives hope that Los Angeles could follow in the coming weeks, and there may be a better shot at a decent release for &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;(well, by pandemic standards). Add in a rebounding movie theater business in key markets like China, one of Marvel Studios’ most important demographics, and &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;could break even — potentially even earning a slight profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3nQvz"&gt;The alternative is a situation US audiences saw with &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;. With a production budget of $200 million and additional tens of millions in marketing budget, the film needed to generate at least a couple hundred million dollars to break even. That wasn’t going to happen in December 2020 with New York City and Los Angeles theaters closed, as well as restricted capacity at theaters in other states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LIufW4"&gt;Warner Bros. decided to move the film to a simultaneous release, premiering it in theaters and on HBO Max in the United States on the same day. By the end of January, AT&amp;amp;T (Warner Bros.’ parent company) executives told analysts that &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984 &lt;/em&gt;pushed a swath of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22215274/wonder-woman-1984-hamilton-hbo-max-disney-plus-numbers-streaming-success"&gt;new subscribers to HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, boosting numbers to 17.2 million accumulated activations, more than double the number of activations in AT&amp;amp;T’s previous quarter (8.6 million). The film  &lt;a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3624109569/weekend/"&gt;ended up making $159.9 million&lt;/a&gt;, with roughly 73 percent of that total coming from outside the US. To compare, the first &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman &lt;/em&gt;film &lt;a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl578455041/"&gt;earned $821 million worldwide&lt;/a&gt; with roughly 50 percent coming from the US alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5BZAwR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Studio executives and theater owners can’t predict if people will actually show up to theaters right now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q1BtrV"&gt;It’s also a big win for theater owners, whose executives have asked Cuomo and California Gov. Gavin Newsom to open theaters in New York City and Los Angeles over the last couple of months. AMC CEO Adam Aron thanked Cuomo when theaters in New York state were allowed to open back in October 2020, noting at the time that the company continued “to work closely with state and local authorities about the reopening of New York City, which we now hope with increasing confidence is not far away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixR2Jk"&gt;Still, studio executives and theater owners can’t predict if people will actually show up to theaters right now. As more vaccinations roll out across the country, people may feel safer about being in a theater with strangers while maintaining proper social distance. For others, however, it may be some time before they’re ready to watch a stranger six feet away toss popcorn in their mouth or sneeze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dd0lmR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic Games will settle Fortnite loot box lawsuits in V-Bucks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xGE4HOIRS-xi3PTYGjwmPQaE0v8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68857482/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sprt44"&gt;Epic Games will give &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;players 1,000 V-Bucks if they ever purchased an in-game loot box, presented within the game as “loot llamas” containing randomized items, as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-save-the-world-loot-llama-purchasers-to-receive-1000-v-bucks"&gt;proposed class action lawsuit settlement&lt;/a&gt; to be approved later this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Xjs3p"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s massively popular battle royale mode has never contained randomized loot boxes, the game’s cooperative survival mode, “Save the World,” did — at least until 2019 when Epic &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/26/18198543/fortnite-save-the-world-upgrade-llamas-loot-boxes-x-ray"&gt;changed its loot box system&lt;/a&gt; to allow players to see the item inside prior to purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91UwyG"&gt;Now, anyone who purchased a randomized loot box prior to their discontinuation will have the 1,000 V-Bucks (roughly $8) deposited automatically into their accounts over the next two to three days. The decision is part of a broader move from Epic to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/28/18245574/fortnite-epic-games-sued-lawsuit-predatory-llama-loot-boxes"&gt;settle blind draw loot box lawsuits it’s faced over the last few years&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xjuWmJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We believe players should know upfront what they are paying for when they make in-game purchases. This is why today we only offer X-Ray Llamas that show you the contents before you purchase them in Save the World.&lt;/p&gt;— Fortnite (@FortniteGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1363954445919354884?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wN1taJ"&gt;In this case, the developer on Monday received confirmation from a judge of preliminary approval for its class action settlement in the Superior Court of North Carolina, which is why Epic says it will begin distributing the rewards today. The move is unusual, as class action lawsuit settlements typically require claimants to file claims to receive benefits. But Epic says it’s giving out benefits early because it feels its current position on loot boxes is the right one, and that its players are owed something for having bought randomized ones in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZWyNb1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic will deposit V-Bucks and Rocket League credits automatically &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vALV1T"&gt;“For one, it’s the right thing to do and we feel strongly about random item loot boxes. And two, we feel good about the settlement,” said Jeffrey Jacobson, a partner at the law firm Faegre Drinker representing Epic, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an interview. “We hope our players agree with us.” A final approval hearing is scheduled for May, and lawyers representing both Epic and the plaintiffs expect the settlement to be approved as is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W0mFSv"&gt;Epic says that while the settlement affects only US players, it’s deciding to award the 1,000 V-Bucks to all players of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; globally, so long as they purchased at least one of its randomized loot llamas. The proposed settlement also includes &lt;em&gt;Rocket League &lt;/em&gt;players who purchased in-game items like event crates or keys to open loot boxes in the game, and affected players will be given 1,000 credits to be distributed automatically this week in similar fashion. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525842/epic-games-psyonix-acquisition-rocket-league-fortnite-unreal-deal"&gt;Epic acquired &lt;em&gt;Rocket League &lt;/em&gt;developer&lt;/a&gt; Psyonix in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPA2oO"&gt;Epic says with regard to the scope of the US settlement, the V-Bucks benefit will go to 6.5 million players who bought a random item loot llama in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;and 2.9 million &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; players who purchased an event crate or a key that was used to open a crate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGmRbz"&gt;“We stopped offering random item loot boxes like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Loot Llamas and &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; Crates because we realized that some players were repeatedly disappointed by not receiving the random items they hoped for,” said Epic CEO Tim Sweeney in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Monday. “Players should know upfront what they are paying for when they make in-game purchases.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2s9zBQ"&gt;The proposed settlement also provides up to $26.4 million in additional cash and other benefits for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Rocket League &lt;/em&gt;players “to resolve claims arising from players’ loot box purchases,” in other words refunds on prior purchases that go beyond the standard settlement terms. This pool includes both sides’ attorney fees, according to Epic. But the preliminary settlement also includes a provision that would allow for players who think they were subject to legal harm as part of randomized loot box purchases to argue for money back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dnf3pE"&gt;This benefit pool is available to minors in California who used their own money, and not the money of a parent or guardian, to purchase Epic loot boxes, which qualifies them for benefits under the state’s &lt;a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=df3d235d-b953-4dcb-8610-bcf7125042cb"&gt;contract disaffirmation law&lt;/a&gt;. It also includes any US &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Rocket League &lt;/em&gt;player who thinks they were subject to legal harm, such as fraud, by purchasing randomized loot boxes from Epic. In each case, a player can submit a claim to be investigated by a neutral administrator, with a potential refund award of up to $50 in refunds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFGP21"&gt;For non-minors filing claims regarding legal harm, Epic will award either up to $50 or 13,500 V-Bucks (or 13,000 &lt;em&gt;Rocket League &lt;/em&gt;credits) depending on which benefit the claimant prefers, if the claim is approved. US residents who believe they’re entitled to these extra benefits can file claims at &lt;a href="http://www.epiclootboxsettlement.com/"&gt;www.epiclootboxsettlement.com&lt;/a&gt;, which Epic put live Monday afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8viZ4M"&gt;Epic stopped selling randomized loot boxes in 2019, replacing what were once “V-Buck Llamas’’ with “X-Ray Llamas” in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; “Save the World”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;game mode. At the time, these blind draw llamas ran users 50 V-Bucks (at the time around 50 cents) and contained a random assortment of skins, weapons, or other loot. Later that year, &lt;em&gt;Rocket League &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20757479/rocket-league-loot-boxes-fortnite-psyonix-epic"&gt;removed loot boxes as well&lt;/a&gt;, months after Epic acquired its creator Psyonix. According to Jacobson, Epic’s lawyer, the class action settlement is “an exclamation point on a position we first announced two years ago.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="vmedP3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Players should know upfront what they are paying for when they make in-game purchases.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YsgGjy"&gt;Loot boxes have come under &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18226852/loot-boxes-gaming-regulation-gambling-free-to-play"&gt;fire from lawmakers and regulators&lt;/a&gt; around the world who claim selling random chances at rare or coveted in-game items is akin to gambling. Especially concerning to critics of the practice is that many of the players engaging with loot box systems are children, sometimes using their own money but often with access to a parent or guardian’s credit card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dizpd2"&gt;Many of the biggest games of the last decade, including entries in Electronic Arts’ &lt;em&gt;FIFA &lt;/em&gt;franchise and Blizzard’s &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, sell blind draw loot boxes for real money, and the business practice has proved lucrative for game developers. In some cases, game companies make more money on in-game microtransactions, like loot boxes, than they do on selling games outright. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c50LAM"&gt;In 2018, Belgium ruled that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17280440/belgium-video-game-loot-boxes-illegal-gambling"&gt;randomized loot boxes constituted illegal gambling&lt;/a&gt; and were subject to the country’s gaming law, forcing many prominent developers to either discontinue the practice in the country or alter how they allow players to buy and spend in-game currency at the risk of steep fines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sacFtC"&gt;Though the US has laws around online gambling, it does not consider loot boxes as such, meaning many games continue to offer them in the US. Bills have been introduced in Congress, such as Sen. Josh Hawley’s (R-MO) proposed Protecting Children from Abusive Games Act, but none have passed. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s recent Galaxy devices will now get at least four years of Android security updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uYaknM4NkaaMJ9eCzqUh6Jsu1og=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68857474/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IzZW6D"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-galaxy-security-extending-updates-knox/#_ftnref1"&gt;Samsung has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll be extending the amount of time that its Galaxy smartphones and tablets will be getting security updates. Now, devices released from 2019 and onward will receove at least four years of &lt;a href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/workScope.smsb"&gt;security updates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GqBWTX"&gt;Previously, Samsung offered either monthly or quarterly security updates for at least the first two years of a device’s life span, the frequency of which is determined by the device itself. More premium phones like the Galaxy Note or Galaxy S lines get monthly updates, while budget-friendly models like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315936/samsung-galaxy-a71-5g-uw-release-date-specs-price-verizon"&gt;2020’s Galaxy A71 5G&lt;/a&gt; get quarterly updates. Samsung also drops some of its higher-end devices down to quarterly updates after a certain point in time, like the Galaxy S8 lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKFKTL"&gt;It’s important to note that Samsung is only promising four years of “regular security updates,” which is actually Samsung’s lowest tier of update frequency, reserved for devices that it still supports but without the promise of a monthly or quarterly cadence. Still, the new announcement does mean that Samsung is working to extend the usable life span of dozens of its devices, including some of its cheaper entry-level phones that might not ordinarily see that kind of long-term support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJojei"&gt;To put that commitment in perspective, Google itself only promises “at least three years” of security updates for &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-phones"&gt;its Pixel phones&lt;/a&gt;. And there are far fewer models of Pixel hardware to support than the 40-plus phones and tablets for which Samsung is promising security updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbUbFB"&gt;The other important caveat here is that Samsung is promising security updates for at least four years, not Android OS updates. Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355777/samsung-android-os-update-promise-galaxy-phones-3-generations"&gt;&lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; guarantee support&lt;/a&gt; for at least three “generations” of Android OS updates in 2020, but only for some of its phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NX9lt"&gt;Today’s news from Samsung is also not the same commitment that Google and Qualcomm &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22178833/google-qualcomm-snapdragon-888-faster-android-updates-four-years"&gt;made in December&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that phones with new Qualcomm chips will support both four Android OS updates and four years of security updates. While similar in overall goals, that announcement only applied to devices starting with this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;Snapdragon 888&lt;/a&gt; and on, whereas Samsung is retroactively making its commitment for devices as old as 2019. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is adding easier access to support for eating disorders</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x_w6D3siTxvbbbI3LesAdNkogig=/19x0:1381x908/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68857097/151612295_1895260083948087_6213885929941207150_n.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KbRXrn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/how-were-supporting-people-affected-by-eating-disorders-and-negative-body-image"&gt;Instagram is announcing&lt;/a&gt; that it’s adding resources for people affected by eating disorders to its social platform. If users search for hashtags or content that’s potentially related to disordered eating, the company will guide that user to resources or help lines provided by the National Eating Disorders Association (or NEDA) in the US, as well as others in the UK, Australia, and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="2QgtSa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10354938"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eOFQUX"&gt;Instagram says that currently, it &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/188848648282410"&gt;tries to blur out potentially triggering content&lt;/a&gt; in search results, and it does direct people to generalized crisis support, but it should now direct users to resources specifically designed around eating disorders. In its blog, Instagram also says that it plans to show the resources if someone is trying to share eating disorder-related content, or “if a friend is concerned about something they see posted and wants to offer support.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lH8Es5"&gt;This update is similar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292166/tiktok-eating-disorder-support-resources-hashtags"&gt;to what TikTok announced earlier today&lt;/a&gt;. However, unlike TikTok, it doesn’t appear as if Instagram pointed to eating disorder-specific resources before, though they were shown in the general list of help lines. Currently, searching for content related to eating disorders will bring you to that general help line list, which not only includes NEDA but the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Veterans Crisis Line, and Trevor Project as well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I5CDjDHA7KMBCb_LDdLkTbCG5sc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320938/IMG_0876.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Currently, the list doesn’t surface eating disorder help lines, even if that’s the type of content from which the user was directed to it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AOFLXa"&gt;However, Instagram’s screenshots imply that the support button will specifically point out the NEDA contacts to people, rather than just showing them the whole list of available help lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4WYZC"&gt;As part of its National Eating Disorders Awareness Week programing, the company also says it’s planning to work with community leaders to publish Reels that “encourage positive body image, push back against weight stigma and harmful stereotypes, and show that all bodies are worthy and deserve to be celebrated.” According to the post, this is the third time that Instagram has worked on content for NEDA week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4z3KWy"&gt;Instagram has &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47637377"&gt;had issues in the past&lt;/a&gt; trying to regulate eating disorder content, and the social network is often brought up in conversations about negative body image and perception, especially among young people. While the higher resource prioritization likely won’t do much to help with self-esteem issues after using the site, it should help people who are struggling and vulnerable get easier access to help from experts.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ntv99t"&gt;NASA on Monday released a trove of video footage showing its Perseverance rover landing on Mars after plunging through the planet’s atmosphere, unveiling the most in-depth views of a Mars landing ever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Your front-row seat to my Mars landing is here. Watch how we did it.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CountdownToMars?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CountdownToMars&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Avv13dSVmQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Avv13dSVmQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA's Perseverance Mars Rover (@NASAPersevere) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAPersevere/status/1363929492138254340?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O8o8pR"&gt;Mission teams at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California got back 30 gigabytes of data and over 23,000 images of the vehicle descending down to the surface. The videos were among 4,500 images NASA planned to release on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LttMvd"&gt;Perseverance &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;entered Mars’ atmosphere&lt;/a&gt; last week bundled with a protective shell and a descent stage called the “Skycrane,” which fired rocket thrusters to slow its descent near the surface. The bundle sported four cameras to capture the landing sequence: one fixed on its protective backshell facing upward, one on the descent stage, and two on each side of the rover. Together, they captured some incredible views of the spacecraft’s descent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HnAwP"&gt;“I can watch these videos for hours, and keep seeing new stuff every time,” Allen Chen, the mission’s entry, landing, and descent lead, said during a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FkltHO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I can watch these videos for hours, and keep seeing new stuff every time,” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1mltrl"&gt;Imaging company FLIR provided the four cameras, and NASA made little to no modifications to them. “You can purchase the same camera off the internet,” Dave Gruel, lead engineer for Mars 2020’s EDL Camera system, said at the press conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9uP2jg"&gt;A microphone on board Perseverance also captured sounds once the rover was on the surface. It recorded noise &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fnasa%2Ffirst-sounds-from-mars-includes-rover-self-noise&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F2%2F22%2F22295739%2Fnasa-perseverance-rover-landing-mars-video-footage" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;from the rover itself&lt;/a&gt; and the soft sound of wind on Mars in the background.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rwH2F1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Now that you’ve seen Mars, hear it. Grab some headphones and listen to the first sounds captured by one of my microphones.  &lt;a href="https://t.co/JswvAWC2IP"&gt;https://t.co/JswvAWC2IP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CountdownToMars?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CountdownToMars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA's Perseverance Mars Rover (@NASAPersevere) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAPersevere/status/1363937472971907072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PSHHfZ"&gt;The data started coming through NASA’s Deep Space Network last Thursday and Friday as the team pored over data on the spacecraft’s health. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Lubhk"&gt;The Perseverance team is looking forward to analyzing this data and much more as the rover settles at its landing site of Jezero Crater, a former lake some 3.5 billion years ago that could contain evidence of past life. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LIDAR maker Velodyne boots its founder after an investigation into ‘inappropriate’ behavior</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Yandex NV Trials Driverless Taxis" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CvHocOCjEYsr94M-JX58RoBjlsg=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856898/1164317768.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YyAi76"&gt;Velodyne, which makes LIDAR sensors crucial for the operation of autonomous vehicles, has removed its founder, David Hall, as chair of the company’s board following an investigation, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports. Hall’s wife, Marta Thoma Hall, has also stepped down as chief marketing officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSRIC3"&gt;The investigation, which started in December 2020, concluded that the Halls “each behaved inappropriately with regard to Board and Company processes, and failed to operate with respect, honesty, integrity, and candor in their dealings with Company officers and directors,” the company said in &lt;a href="https://velodynelidar.com/press-release/velodyne-lidar-announces-changes-to-board-of-directors/"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xeePbf"&gt;David Hall had previously stepped down as chairman of the board “voluntarily,” the board said, and transitioned to a new role as executive chairman. Marta Hall was terminated as an employee of the company but will remain a member of the board of directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02nxsY"&gt;“The Board also formally censured both Mr. Hall and Ms. Hall, and directed them both to receive appropriate remedial training,” the company said. It is unclear what behavior proceeded this decision. A spokesperson for the company declined to provide further comment.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="apSl5d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“formally censured”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kMyDtQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/18/16491052/velodyne-lidar-mapping-self-driving-car-david-hall-interview"&gt;David Hall has long been revered in the world of autonomous vehicle technology&lt;/a&gt; as a pioneer in the use of laser sensors to enable AVs to “see” the world around them. LIDAR, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, uses thousands of laser beams to sense objects and measure their distance. The cone- or cylindrical-shaped sensor perched on the roof of a vehicle has become synonymous with self-driving cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tdqbvl"&gt;Ford was an early backer of Velodyne, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/16/12499622/ford-baidu-velodyne-investment"&gt;investing $150 million&lt;/a&gt; in the company in 2017 along with Baidu, the Chinese search giant. Ford contributed $75 million of that total and held 13.1 million shares in the company. But the automaker abruptly dissolved its stake in the LIDAR company earlier this month and noted in a regulatory filing that it would no longer be a customer for Velodyne’s sensors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVJe7q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055011/lidar-sensor-self-driving-mainstream-mass-market-velodyne-ces-2020"&gt;Hall stepped down as CEO of Velodyne in January 2020&lt;/a&gt;, replaced by the company’s chief technology officer Anand Gopalan. But he remained chairman of the board, steering the company’s major financial decisions, until earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQkauc"&gt;Last summer, Velodyne became the latest mobility technology company to go public via a reverse merger, or SPAC. The company struck a deal to merge with special purpose acquisition company Graf Industrial Corp., with a market value of $1.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
