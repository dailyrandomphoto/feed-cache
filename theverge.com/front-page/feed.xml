    <title>Google reportedly asked employees to ‘strike a positive tone’ in research paper</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V0U8zm3hGiepcU9UwRYQtVXZE9g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68575059/acastro_180130_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fIulmC"&gt;Google has added a layer of scrutiny for research papers on sensitive topics including gender, race, and political ideology. A senior manager also instructed researchers to “strike a positive tone” in a paper this summer. The news was &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-alphabet-google-research-focus-idUSKBN28X1CB"&gt;first reported by Reuters&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QC8dai"&gt;“Advances in technology and the growing complexity of our external environment are increasingly leading to situations where seemingly inoffensive projects raise ethical, reputational, regulatory or legal issues,” the policy read. Three employees told Reuters the rule started in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSeGOx"&gt;The company has also asked employees to “refrain from casting its technology in a negative light” on multiple occasions, Reuters says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPSXt4"&gt;Employees working on a paper on recommendation AI, which is used to personalize content on platforms like YouTube, were told to “take great care to strike a positive tone,” according to Reuters. The authors then updated the paper to “remove all references to Google products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLN6LV"&gt;Another paper on using AI to understand foreign languages “softened a reference to how the Google Translate product was making mistakes,” Reuters wrote. The change came in response to a request from reviewers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TSLD8c"&gt;Google’s standard review process is meant to ensure researchers don’t inadvertently reveal trade secrets. But the “sensitive topics” review goes beyond that. Employees who want to evaluate Google’s own services for bias are asked to consult with the legal, PR, and policy teams first. Other sensitive topics reportedly include China, the oil industry, location data, religion, and Israel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djpVVC"&gt;The search giant’s publication process has been in the spotlight &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;since the firing of AI ethicist Timnit Gebru in early December&lt;/a&gt;. Gebru says she was terminated over an email she sent to the Google Brain Women and Allies listserv, an internal group for Google AI research employees. In it, she spoke about Google managers pushing her to retract a paper on the dangers of large scale language processing models. Jeff Dean, Google’s head of AI, said she’d submitted it too close to the deadline. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158501/timnit-gebru-team-google-public-statement-fired"&gt;Gebru’s own team pushed back on this assertion&lt;/a&gt;, saying the policy was applied “unevenly and discriminatorily.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfOZU9"&gt;Gebru reached out to Google’s PR and policy team in September regarding the paper, according to &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/23/google-timnit-gebru-ai-ethics/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. She knew the company might take issue with certain aspects of the research, since it uses large language processing models in its search engine. The deadline for making changes to the paper wasn’t until the end of January 2021, giving researchers ample time to respond to any concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PWvWMQ"&gt;A week before Thanksgiving, however, Megan Kacholia, a VP at Google Research, asked Gebru to retract the paper. The following month, Gebru was fired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6hXsy"&gt;Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i8s3xJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Andrew Yang is running for mayor of New York City</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zsqc-SVHizO4qTOcV-esNF165OI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68574897/akrales_190411_3346_0075.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="903D1k"&gt;Former presidential candidate Andrew Yang has filed paperwork to run for mayor of New York. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/politics/andrew-yang-files-paperwork-to-run-for-new-york-city-mayor/2797754/"&gt;NBC 4 New York&lt;/a&gt; first reported the news, citing confirmation from the city’s Campaign Finance Board. Yang will be running to replace current New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, who is term-limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1epQ6s"&gt;A longtime New York resident, Yang first drew attention &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/17/18408685/andrew-yang-2020-president-democrat-candidate-policies-universal-basic-income-reddit-twitter"&gt;as a candidate in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary&lt;/a&gt;, focusing his campaign on the promise of a universal basic income. Yang was also outspoken about the threats posed by automation, and how its economic consequences were driving forward the opioid epidemic and a broader social dislocation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MztTcm"&gt;While Yang’s campaign was successful in cultivating a dedicated following, he failed to attract broader support and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21134021/andrew-yang-drops-out-2020-presidential-race-democratic"&gt;withdrew from the race&lt;/a&gt; in February after a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYU4gy"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;em&gt;Politico &lt;/em&gt;reported that Yang was reaching out to city political brokers, but the mayoral run was still hypothetical. Wednesday’s filing shows that it is real, and kicks off what is likely to be a heated campaign. New York City’s Democratic primary is scheduled for June 22nd, 2021, and several early polls show Yang with a slight lead. On Tuesday, &lt;a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/531337-poll-finds-andrew-yang-favored-for-new-york-city-mayor"&gt;a poll conducted by Public Policy Polling&lt;/a&gt; showed 17 percent of respondents supporting Yang, the highest of any candidate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Daft Punk releases ‘complete edition’ of their stunning Tron: Legacy score</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Ow1_9aAc1v3WIbsTmMqL1yhR18=/117x0:1383x844/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68574797/tron_legacy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PAVAoO"&gt;Fans of Daft Punk’s incredible &lt;em&gt;Tron: Legacy &lt;/em&gt;score will receive a pretty good holiday gift this year: an extended version that’s now available on Spotify and Apple Music. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nO7Viw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tron: Legacy The Complete Edition &lt;/em&gt;adds nine tracks that weren’t available on the original score, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/23/22197334/daft-punk-new-extended-complete-edition-tron-legacy-soundtrack"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Here’s the catch: these aren’t new songs. Some are iTunes exclusives; others are tracks that were only available on vinyl. There’s also an Amazon MP3 bonus track and — get this — a Nokia Music Store bonus track. &lt;em&gt;The Complete Edition &lt;/em&gt;simply marks the first time it’s all been collected in one place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1vcSi"&gt;Even though the tracks aren’t new, I’m excited about having an extended, complete version of the score available on Spotify. I love &lt;em&gt;Tron: Legacy &lt;/em&gt;and adore the score. I play it almost every single day while I work. “The Game Has Changed,” “Derezzed,” “Disc Wars,” and “Arena” are perfect for productivity — not something Daft Punk may have planned for, but it worked out all the same. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIwHvD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tron: Legacy &lt;/em&gt;is a score I haven’t gotten tired of yet, even 10 years later. Having nine new tracks — even if they’re unlikely to compete with “Derezzed” or “The Game Has Changed” — is a perfect holiday treat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXLdZ0"&gt;Now, if only Disney would kindly give us an update on what’s happening with &lt;em&gt;Tron 3&lt;/em&gt;, which has existed in development hell for years. The film, if it happens, will star Jared Leto and is set to be directed by Garth Davis. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Today I learned that the iOS calculator has a scientific mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A screenshot of the iOS default calculator in landscape mode." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/icidNCMgqFS6XgLW-P9Fe2GxOdE=/622x0:2310x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68574753/IMG_0369.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xh9hfo"&gt;Today I learned that the iPhone’s built-in calculator app has a scientific mode — and all you have to do to access it is turn your phone on its side. If you’re the type of person who keeps your phone permanently in portrait lock (like me), this might come as a surprise to you, as it did to many of us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ehyfax"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;that glimpse of an alternate universe vibe when you turn your iPhone sideways and all of a sudden it’s a scientific calculator &lt;a href="https://t.co/PNxLVpXRAS"&gt;pic.twitter.com/PNxLVpXRAS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— J.R. Carpenter (@jr_carpenter) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jr_carpenter/status/1341786812381941761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 23, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S0ItSy"&gt;This unlocks all sorts of functionality, like adding numbers to memory, parentheses, exponents, and all those trig functions from back in high school. The feature isn’t exactly new, or hidden: It &lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/2008-06-09-iphone-calculator-gets-scientific-in-2-0.html"&gt;was introduced in iOS 2.0&lt;/a&gt; back in 2008, and there’s actually even a screenshot of it on the App Store page for the calculator app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the App Store page for Apple’s Calculator app" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-s6TgkXysrFCKxXjWex8Zszo8e8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22193835/IMG_0371.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It was hiding in plain sight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="O8rgx6"&gt;To be fair, most people probably never see that App Store page, as the app comes pre-installed on every phone. It’s not the first app that you’d probably look for if you wanted to install a new calculator, either — even with the hidden(ish) functionality, it’s still not great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDF2M3"&gt;For starters, there’s no ticker tape feature, which lets you see all the operations you’ve just done, which is useful when you need to see if you’ve already added a value or not. It also makes some essential functions like parentheses — which I use in almost every math equation I do — hard to access.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot of a calculator’s ticker tape function, which shows the previous numbers and functions. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZuCALofVyHQNd6KWC4FylPkAfYQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22193842/IMG_0368.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is PCalc’s ticker tape function, which is invaluable to me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="y2aGlH"&gt;Thankfully, there are other options: &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pcalc/id284666222"&gt;PCalc offers a more robust calculating experience&lt;/a&gt;, and offers a free &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pcalc-lite/id300311831"&gt;PCalc Lite&lt;/a&gt; version that’s also worth a download. Or for more serious math, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Texas-Instruments-MultiView-Scientific-Calculator/dp/B000PDFQ6K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;there’s the TI-30XS&lt;/a&gt;, which can make some things (like fractions) so easy it almost feels like cheating.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Venture back into the underworld to curl up in front of Hades’ excellent Yule log</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ct-m2tD7UKM-6Gcb46iKJsgqh7k=/161x0:2225x1376/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68574622/Screen_Shot_2020_12_23_at_2.49.05_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qX0siO"&gt;It’s nearly the holidays, which means that in the long-standing tradition of the internet, it’s also time for novelty, themed Yule log videos. And this year brings an excellent new entry: a roaring fireplace in the House of Hades, from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496904/hades-supergiant-games-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;Supergiant Games’ &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="saiXIz"&gt;The video is in crisp 4K, showing off the lovely art of the game (one of our favorites this year): the fireplace is decked out in gilded skulls and opulent marble, while creeping pomegranates add a dash of color to the proceedings. There are also the essential sounds of any good Yule log: the roar of a fireplace, with the crisp, crackling sound of the logs. (There’s a &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; spin, with murmurs and echoes from deeper within the House whispering just at the edge of hearing.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F8lBy9"&gt;The Yule log pairs perfectly with &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; itself, &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/hades-switch/"&gt;which is on sale for the holidays for $20&lt;/a&gt; on the Nintendo Switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="RNTOsV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why Hades is my game of the year ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22159911/hades-best-game-2020-nintendo-switch-supergiant-pc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MLcCZG"&gt;The new &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; video joins the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/15/10223468/5-hours-of-darth-vaders-burning-corpse-will-replace-your-yule-log"&gt;long-standing canon&lt;/a&gt; of excellent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/24/14075268/original-yule-log-1966-tv-broadcast-digitally-restored"&gt;virtual fireplaces&lt;/a&gt; to curl up in front of, like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q23_LCri1Kw"&gt;WarnerMedia’s Eye of Sauron Yule log&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVJzibVS2YM"&gt;Darth Vader’s slowly burning corpse&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS-ErOKpO4E&amp;amp;has_verified=1"&gt;Nick Offerman’s relaxing Lagavulin scotch session&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s own exploding gadgets of 2016 Yule log (commemorating Galaxy Note 7 and hoverboard fires that dominated headlines that year.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wafq0R"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Yule log fireplace fueled by 2016's exploding gadgets|99995" data-volume-uuid="2525738c3" data-volume-id="99995" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-42" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="youtube"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IkA2a1"&gt;The video is only 12 hours long, but you can always start it again (and again, and again, and again) until the holidays are done (or you’ve finally broken out of the underworld.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verge readers can get two years of PlayStation Plus for only $60</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NWohEz"&gt;If you own a PS4 or PS5 and need to renew your PlayStation Plus membership soon, Eneba has an incredible deal on its website right now: &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; readers can get two &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=verge&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one-year PlayStation Plus subscriptions for only $60&lt;/a&gt; by entering offer code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEPLUS&lt;/strong&gt; at checkout. This is a real bargain — normally, one year of PlayStation Plus retails for $60. So if you are looking to stock up on this subscription for a couple of years or want to keep one and gift the other, take advantage of this deal — it will likely sell out quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xF1WcC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9734577"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UEqOVA"&gt;PlayStation Plus is a paid online subscription service that comes with a ton of perks for members, including occasional discounts during PlayStation Store sales and free games that switch up usually on a monthly cadence, among other things. A PlayStation Plus subscription is compatible with both the PS4 and the PS5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERjldv"&gt;If you have a PS5, you get an additional perk: access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a digital collection of “generation-defining” first- and third-party titles that were originally released for the PS4, such as &lt;em&gt;Bloodborne&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; God of War&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Persona 5&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Trump vetoes $740 billion defense bill after Section 230 complaints </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="72PLxn"&gt;President Donald Trump has vetoed an annual defense bill authorizing billions of dollars in military spending after complaints that the bill did not include changes to Section 230, the provision that gives social media companies legal immunity over much of the content posted by their users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KM8dz7"&gt;Earlier this month, Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22037118/trump-section-230-repeal-ndaa-rider-facebook-twitter-moderation"&gt;threatened to veto&lt;/a&gt; the $740 billion spending bill, the National Defense Authorization Act, unless Congress included a provision that would repeal Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. Congress approved the measure by veto-proof margins in December. House lawmakers will return to Capitol Hill on Monday for a vote to override the president’s veto, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/connorobrienNH/status/1341839804485537792?s=20"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Politico’&lt;/em&gt;s Connor O’Brien&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="XIxTE6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:8777491"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H8mIiH"&gt;“Section 230 facilitates the spread of foreign disinformation online, which is a serious threat to our national security,” Trump &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viaCristiano/status/1341840565814644737?s=20"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday. “It must be repealed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2OxsO"&gt;Amending or repealing Section 230 has become a priority for the Trump administration over the last few months. In May, Trump signed an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273822/trump-signs-executive-order-facebook-twitter-section-230-social-media-companies"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; urging the Federal Communications Commission to reinterpret the law. The order came in response to Twitter fact-checking a tweet from Trump for the first time, over false claims made on voter fraud. That pressure has only grown in the wake of the election, as President Trump has continued to use social platforms to promote false evidence of fraudulent voting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTMwXi"&gt;Social media companies like Facebook and Twitter have been under immense pressure to moderate the president’s tweets when he posts falsehoods online. The companies’ increasing moderation efforts have led Trump and Republican lawmakers to make misleading claims that the platforms are biased against conservatives. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4U3Poe"&gt;In a statement, Trump said that Congress’ “failure to terminate the very dangerous national security risk of Section 230 will make our intelligence virtually impossible to conduct without everyone knowing what we are doing at every step.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VzDAif"&gt;Previously, lawmakers had been broadly skeptical of efforts to pass 230 reform as part of the defense bill — but some Senate Republicans now say they will not vote to override Trump’s veto. “I will not vote to override presidential veto unless effort is made to wind down Section 230,” Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LindseyGrahamSC/status/1341849256706138113?s=20"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday. In a counterpoint to Graham, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jim Inhofe (R-OK) said he supports changing Section 230 as policy, but will &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JimInhofe/status/1341846890804031493?s=20"&gt;vote in opposition&lt;/a&gt; to the president once the motion is brought to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I have not played Cyberpunk 2077 but it’s my favorite game of the year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Keanu Reeves as Johnny Silverhand in Cyberpunk 2077" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rBIrpFNVh9Nf_Re3AxahznSv_WQ=/600x0:3840x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68574437/Cyberpunk2077_No_Future_RGB.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PebY1p"&gt;Like many non-gamers, I have experienced &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; mostly through news articles and Twitter posts. And I’ve got to say — this is possibly the best way to experience it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aOCAie"&gt;I mean, look — I’ve heard about this game for years, because a lot of my coworkers and friends are gamers. Everyone got all hype! I had to delay the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020-roundup"&gt;end-of-year package&lt;/a&gt; I was project-managing in order to accommodate it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3mwfVr"&gt;But almost immediately after launch, there was &lt;em&gt;drama: &lt;/em&gt;Sony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22188007/sony-cyberpunk-2077-removed-playstation-store-full-refunds-policy"&gt;pulled the game from its store&lt;/a&gt; and started offering refunds! Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189059/microsoft-cyberpunk-2077-refunds-xbox-microsoft-store"&gt;also offering refunds&lt;/a&gt;! So are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189238/best-buy-cyberpunk-2077-returns-cd-projekt-red-refund-xbox-one-ps4"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195420/gamestop-cyberpunk-2077-returns-even-if-opened"&gt;Game Stop&lt;/a&gt;! Employees of the game’s maker, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-18/cyberpunk-game-maker-faces-hostile-staff-after-failed-launch?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;CD Projekt Red&lt;/a&gt;, are revolting! If your file gets too big, it’ll &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/20/22192375/cyberpunk-2077-save-file-corrupted-8-mb"&gt;be corrupted and useless&lt;/a&gt;! An &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163783/cyberpunk-2077-epileptic-seizure-warning-permanent-fix-cd-projekt-red"&gt;epilepsy warning&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168295/cyberpunk-2077-twitch-dmca-copyright-strike-music-turn-off-bug"&gt;DMCA strikes&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bqIaN"&gt;If there are two things I love, they are drama and chaos, and boy, does &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; offer both. There’s also this, which I thought was a joke, but then when I read the tweet’s replies, I realized &lt;em&gt;it was not at all a joke&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AKNWPQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Nobody told me there’s a part in Cyberpunk where Keanu Reeves jacks your body to finger some woman in a car thus causing a traffic accident&lt;/p&gt;— merritt k (@merrittk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/merrittk/status/1339346103347638272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I3H2kw"&gt;One of my friends bought it the day it came out and essentially went into a bunker to play it for a few days. He’s called it “a wonderful mess,” but also said that the weakest part is combat and “the AI is dumb as bricks.” Another can’t finish her Johnny side quest and is very angry about it. Like, not ironically angry: she desperately &lt;em&gt;wants&lt;/em&gt; to meet Nancy at the goth club, but the NPC she’s supposed to talk to isn’t there. (Also, as a condition of using her story, she asked that I mention that Judy is her wife.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3v1Hy4"&gt;Some of the drama around &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk &lt;/em&gt;is objectively &lt;em&gt;not funny at all&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/4/21575914/cyberpunk-2077-release-crunch-labor-delays-cd-projekt-red"&gt;overworked developers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.them.us/story/cyberpunk-2077-video-game-transphobic-stereotypes-boycott"&gt;stereotypes about trans people&lt;/a&gt;. Our sister site &lt;em&gt;Polygon &lt;/em&gt;has gone so far as to post a standard disclaimer on every post about the game just because there’s &lt;em&gt;so much&lt;/em&gt; going on here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="0Iu4eh"&gt;Ahead of the release of &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, CD Projekt Red faced &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/4/21575914/cyberpunk-2077-release-crunch-labor-delays-cd-projekt-red"&gt;scrutiny from reporters for its work practices&lt;/a&gt;, particularly with regard to “crunch,” a term referring to long overtime hours lasting weeks or months. Despite &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/4/21575914/cyberpunk-2077-release-crunch-labor-delays-cd-projekt-red"&gt;past promises to the contrary&lt;/a&gt;, the company imposed &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/18/21071895/cyberpunk-2077-delay-crunch-cd-projekt-red"&gt;obligatory crunch&lt;/a&gt; on some employees. &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; also faced criticism for its marketing — in particular, the usage of a &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/e3/2019/6/12/18662443/cyberpunk-2077-trans-advertisement-cd-projekt-red-e3-2019"&gt;sexualized trans model in a promotional poster&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/4/22058784/cyberpunk-2077-marketing-cd-projekt-red-transphobia"&gt;the flippant tone used in much of the game’s advertising and social media&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="hUnDe6"&gt;This thing is a fucking fiasco! My main takeaway is that the people who will enjoy this game the most are people who know and love a great many gamers, but are not gamers themselves. And for us, the best part of the game is the glitches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zawA9p"&gt;We have been collecting some of our favorite glitches in a group chat, and I am now going to share them with you. Fair warning: some of these are not safe for work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZcJ4zS"&gt;California EV startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;Canoo&lt;/a&gt; became a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ stock exchange on Tuesday under the ticker $GOEV, marking an incredible milestone for the three-year-old venture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2pRWfq"&gt;Last week, Chinese EV startup XPeng &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-16/xpeng-delivers-first-evs-to-norway-in-slow-going-europe-entry?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;began deliveries in Europe&lt;/a&gt;, just a few months after its own successful IPO in the US. Neither company is going to become the apocryphal “Tesla killer” anytime soon. But each has now succeeded at accomplishing major goals once shared by other EV startups that have failed or fallen by the wayside, like Byton and Faraday Future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fyzpvO"&gt;They’re not alone. Despite a major economic downturn brought on by the pandemic, billions of dollars poured into the electric vehicle space during 2020, lifting up companies like China’s Nio and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21348057/chinese-ev-startup-li-auto-public-stock-nasdaq-trading"&gt;Li Auto&lt;/a&gt;, and Lordstown Motors, Fisker Inc., and Nikola in the US. That faucet remains open, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KpGoWi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The rush of money into EVs could help some finally prove their worth&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kpsppu"&gt;Not all recipients of that money will survive. But this rush of interest in the space — accelerated by the meteoric rise in Tesla’s stock price this year — has surely provided &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; with enough cash to finally move beyond PowerPoint pitches and investor roadshows and start proving their worth on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZbALu"&gt;Alibaba-backed XPeng and Tencent-backed Nio are already doing this, having respectively delivered 4,224 and 5,291 vehicles in November. And when XPeng rolled its first exported electric vehicles &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-16/xpeng-delivers-first-evs-to-norway-in-slow-going-europe-entry?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;off a boat in Norway last week&lt;/a&gt;, it accomplished something many of its peers have sought: expansion into new markets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="t8d9jC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Byton suspending operations for six months due to financial trouble","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308389/byton-chinese-ev-startup-operations-suspended-furloughs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2O0MMf"&gt;Selling vehicles in Europe was an explicit goal of Byton, which was also founded in China but fancied itself as a “global automaker,” with offices in Germany and the US. But Byton has now all but shuttered its North American operations, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308389/byton-chinese-ev-startup-operations-suspended-furloughs"&gt;laying off hundreds across 2020&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.electrive.com/2020/10/22/byton-ceo-daniel-kirchert-quits/"&gt;losing its CEO&lt;/a&gt;, and facing a potential roll-up of its Chinese operations into primary backer First Auto Works — the original state-owned automaker in China. In fact, Byton’s North American operation is apparently so destitute that it hasn’t paid its lawyers in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308389/byton-chinese-ev-startup-operations-suspended-furloughs"&gt;a lawsuit against former CEO&lt;/a&gt; (and current Faraday Future CEO) Carsten Breitfeld, &lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.767301/gov.uscourts.cacd.767301.47.0.pdf"&gt;according to a previously unreported court filing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="24iP2k"&gt;Byton’s demise was striking, given that it had backing from such a powerful government-owned automaker. At one point not so long ago, that support made the startup seem far more legitimate than the rest. Byton was even the first of the many EV startups to complete its own factory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7AvHM3"&gt;That approach fell into stark relief with Nio’s, which in 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18252244/nio-ev-startup-factory-shanghai-cancelled-jac-motors"&gt;abandoned its own plans for a factory&lt;/a&gt; and instead decided to keep paying a contract manufacturer to make its electric cars. While this left Nio stuck paying a fee for every car it had its manufacturing partner build, it also meant the startup didn’t have to cover the massive cost of building out and running a factory — which was crucial when money got really tight in 2019 and 2020, according to Michael Dunne, head of ZoZo Go, a consulting group focused on the Chinese market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="Am3pwH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Byton’s factory, once an asset, became an albatross&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UTydQb"&gt;“Nio said, ‘We’re not going to go that direction anymore,’ and investors originally said, ‘You’re not serious — you’re not going to have your own plant?’ Byton, meanwhile, goes that route and investors say, ‘I can count on these guys,’” Dunne says. But when both companies ran into financial trouble and the pandemic hit, Dunne says Byton’s factory turned into “an albatross.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGyIrX"&gt;Now, Nio is arguably the second-most successful electric vehicle company behind Tesla (though still a very distant one) and just raised &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Finvesting%2F2020%2F12%2F17%2Fnio-just-raised-3-billion-heres-why%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F23%2F22194330%2Fev-startups-tesla-success-2020-electric-vehicles-spac-public#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;another $2.6 billion&lt;/a&gt;. XPeng is right there with Nio, and just &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-09/china-ev-startup-xpeng-raises-2-2-billion-in-upsized-share-sale"&gt;raised $2.2 billion&lt;/a&gt; itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfQSzZ"&gt;“Nio, a year ago, was in desperate straits and needed a bailout,” says Dunne, referring to a $1.4 billion deal the Chinese EV startup struck &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21274457/nio-q1-earnings-deliveries-chinese-government-investment-bailout"&gt;with the Anhui province earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. “They were right at the edge, and then here comes Tesla with its meteoric valuation and everyone looks around and says, ‘What next?’ Since then, I’ve gotten so many calls from people saying: ‘Should we bet on XPeng? Should we bet on Nio?’” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sijUQC"&gt;Most EV startups, like California’s Canoo, are still just trying to get a vehicle into production. But, founded by former BMW executives who split from Faraday Future in 2017, Canoo has now accomplished something its forebear long sought: going public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="97n8mv"&gt;Faraday Future teased an IPO as far back as its earliest days in 2015, though, to be sure, there wasn’t much the startup &lt;em&gt;didn’t&lt;/em&gt; talk about back then. Buoyed by its tycoon founder Jia Yueting’s fortune, Faraday Future aimed to release a super-luxury car crammed with technology and world-beating performance. The startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/5/10713718/faraday-future-vpa-iphone-comparison"&gt;said it would make an EV as disruptive as the iPhone&lt;/a&gt;. It passed over cheap, already-built manufacturing facilities — including one that would have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;cost the company just $1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/23/21035192/rivian-funding-1-3-billion-t-rowe-price-amazon-ford"&gt;now occupied by Rivian&lt;/a&gt; — and instead announced it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/5/9674314/faraday-future-electric-car-1-billion-factory"&gt;would build a $1 billion factory in the Nevada desert&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="EyYpfw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Public offerings, global expansions — these were all goals of startups that faltered&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SDLaWF"&gt;Jia became so known for his grand visions that he was derided in China as a “&lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/6efac122-3170-11e7-9555-23ef563ecf9a"&gt;PowerPoint CEO&lt;/a&gt;.” Those ambitions were ultimately too much for Faraday Future to bear, too, as it has spent the years since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/10/30/20879811/faraday-future-ceo-founder-jia-yueting-carsten-breitfeld-bankruptcy"&gt;struggling to make ends meet&lt;/a&gt;. Now, in the twilight of 2020, it’s Canoo that has become a publicly-traded company while Faraday Future languishes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhInX6"&gt;Canoo is one of the many companies to go public this year by merging with a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition company&lt;/a&gt;,” or SPAC. This method of going public allowed companies like Canoo (and Nikola, and Fisker, and many automotive suppliers) to essentially shortcut the typical IPO process by merging with a SPAC that is already traded on one of the stock exchanges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kpK5HB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Faraday Future’s still haunted by the past of its billionaire founder","url":"https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/10/30/20879811/faraday-future-ceo-founder-jia-yueting-carsten-breitfeld-bankruptcy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="G7Q2p1"&gt;The urgency to get onto the NASDAQ or the New York Stock Exchange was due in large part to a sort of gold rush kicked off by Tesla, which saw its own &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/teslas-market-cap-zooms-past-500-billion-11606239860"&gt;stock price skyrocket across 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Big announcements from the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175017/ford-mustang-mach-e-electric-suv-first-drive-specs-review?utm_campaign=theverge&amp;amp;utm_content=chorus&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;Ford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525290/hummer-ev-electric-truck-gmc-price-specs-range"&gt;GM&lt;/a&gt; surely helped, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKufmZ"&gt;Whatever the reason, Canoo now has a few hundred million more dollars to play with and, theoretically, easier access to raising more money as it tries to bring its electric delivery vehicle platform to market in the next few years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llg1BQ"&gt;Canoo is just one example. Lordstown Motors, which didn’t even exist two years ago, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352433/gm-lordstown-motors-electric-truck-startup-public-merger-spac"&gt;went public this year via a SPAC merger&lt;/a&gt; and is targeting a 2021 release of its electric pickup truck. Fisker is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21322573/fisker-vw-meb-modular-platform-architecture-ocean-suv-apollo"&gt;doing the same&lt;/a&gt;. So is &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/18/uk-electric-vehicle-maker-arrival-is-going-public-via-spac.html"&gt;electric bus company Arrival&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2020/12/08/chargepoint-ceo-on-why-its-going-public-via-spac.html"&gt;charging company ChargePoint&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/spac-merger-becomes-the-trendiest-ev-ipo-route-of-2020-2020-12-08"&gt;list goes on&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ylM58p"&gt;It’s worth noting that these accomplishments — going public, starting deliveries, entering new markets — have not come without a cost. In Canoo’s case, the startup is now in the hands of a businessman who pivoted away from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;focusing on an electric van for consumers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21277248/canoo-ev-startup-stefan-krause-leaving-evelozcity"&gt;One of its founders is gone&lt;/a&gt;, and while another remains CEO for now, Canoo’s new chairman recently told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; he’s making no guarantees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="6mGKsf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nio’s future depends more on the Chinese government than ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21274457/nio-q1-earnings-deliveries-chinese-government-investment-bailout"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Z3EiVg"&gt;Nio, which started as an ostensibly independent company (as far as such a thing can exist in China), ultimately &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21274457/nio-q1-earnings-deliveries-chinese-government-investment-bailout"&gt;had to turn to the Chinese government for help&lt;/a&gt;. That relationship only appears to be deepening as &lt;a href="https://investorplace.com/2020/12/nio-stock-11-things-to-know-as-nio-shares-stumble-today/"&gt;Nio’s joint ventures in China get cozier with the government&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, XPeng’s rise in prominence has increased the scrutiny on its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/24/18277168/xpeng-china-tesla-apple-trade-secret-theft-electric"&gt;alleged role in the theft of trade secrets from Tesla and Apple&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jxzeZ7"&gt;Nikola is perhaps the shining example of how quickly the recent rush of cash into the EV space can turn into a “The Monkey’s Paw”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;situation. Nikola was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21162886/nikola-public-nasdaq-merger-hydrogen-electric-trucks"&gt;one of the first EV startups to go through the process of merging with a SPAC&lt;/a&gt;, and that deal vaulted the company from relative obscurity to “hottest new stock” status. But the resulting scrutiny sparked questions about potential self-dealing, financial misdeeds, and fraud. Nikola has since had multiple deals with potential customers fall apart, seen its stock price crash from its summer highs, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/21/21448729/nikola-electric-hydrogen-truck-fraud-allegations-executive-chairman-founder-trevor-milton"&gt;its founder has distanced himself from the company&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3NL6of"&gt;Other EV startups on the cusp of production that raised money before 2020, or through the more traditional private investment route, have made tradeoffs as well. After Lucid Motors languished in search of the funding required to build its luxury sedan and a factory in Arizona, it ultimately turned to Saudi Arabia — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302524/lucid-motors-saudi-arabia-pif-investment-majority-shareholder#:~:text=California%20EV%20startup%20Lucid%20Motors,a%20lawsuit%20filed%20on%20Wednesday.&amp;amp;text=The%20company%20declined%20to%20comment."&gt;which is now the majority owner&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5X67D"&gt;(The outlier here is Rivian, the Michigan-based EV company that aims to bring an electric pickup truck and SUV to market next year. It has raised &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/10/21319899/rivian-2-5-billion-funding-round-amazon-soros-r1t-r1s-truck-suv-ford"&gt;some $6 billion and counting&lt;/a&gt; after playing things &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17380600/rivian-electric-truck-pickup-suv-interview-rj-scaringe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; close to the vest since its founding in 2009&lt;/a&gt;. Where startups like Canoo, or Faraday Future, or China’s Nio, loudly sought public offerings, Rivian raised its money in the private markets, finding big institutional partners like Amazon and Ford along the way.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qctiWV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Most EV startups will take some bad with the good, as long as the alternative is oblivion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SlN1Xd"&gt;Most EV startups will take some bad with the good, as long as the alternative is oblivion, though. The failure of their peers and predecessors to follow in Tesla’s wake is still fresh enough that they know sacrifices are necessary to survive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1W67dr"&gt;There are good reasons to be skeptical about how long this run can last, or whether it’s a “bubble.” How these startups withstand the scrutiny of being a public company, or one that’s finally delivering products to customers, or both in 2021 will help sort things out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7W8akP"&gt;But that wake Tesla has created is bigger than ever, and if it sustains, it could provide cover for startups to falter without imploding, and for others to shoot their own shots as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qgokVh"&gt;To wit, this week I spoke with Fraser Atkinson, the CEO of GreenPower. It’s a small Canadian electric shuttle and bus manufacturer that has toiled away since 2007, surviving in part by securing government grants in the US, and by performing mergers with two different mineral companies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTDrgr"&gt;GreenPower did a traditional IPO this year that yielded about $40 million. Atkinson said GreenPower &lt;em&gt;could &lt;/em&gt;have done a SPAC merger, which could have generated much more cash. But he said he was wary it would bring in &lt;em&gt;too much &lt;/em&gt;money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="EqdLU0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Turning down money, in this economy? &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xyl20H"&gt;“That was funding we couldn’t have possibly spent on any level of production that we have planned for the company over the next number of years,” Atkinson said. “It’s so tempting if you’ve [raised a lot of cash], the pressure is on to do something with that money, to do something transformative, whereas our approach is much more incremental in terms of building the blocks up to a company that can attain profitability.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9gSct4"&gt;It’s hard to imagine any one of these companies striking that kind of tone just a year or two ago. But it makes a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; more sense now, when money is flowing into the industry so freely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="vctfvq"&gt;Turning down money, in this economy? That might be the best sign yet that there’s finally real runway for the myriad startups trying to build a business around electric vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="82fqiT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKf0Qw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7brzx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 leak suggests better battery life is on the way</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cDs1lohe7zoLNw1jfRaZwNTjh5U=/338x0:2162x1216/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68573764/17a1cca82fdaa085e6a7da0895a7b6855c33cd7b5943c466b0f539c1b260d8b4.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.voice.com/post/@evan/samsung-galaxy-chromebook2-first-images-1608577621-196464122" target="_blank"&gt;Evan Blass / Voice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XlwoQb"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Chromebook 2 seems like it will improve on the battery life and price of its predecessor, according to leaked Samsung slides (via &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/23/galaxy-chromebook-2-specs-leak/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;previous Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; was an attractively designed 2-in-1 that nonetheless faltered due to its battery life and high $999 price tag. If these slides are to be believed, then next year might hold some Chromebooks to be hopeful about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CC4EoH"&gt;The most important change is that battery life. The slides shared by leaker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_?s=20"&gt;WalkingCat&lt;/a&gt; say Samsung is targeting 12-plus hours of battery life on this new model. That’s a lot more than the measly 4 hours and 20 minutes (and the 8 hours Samsung promised) we observed in our review of this year’s model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1oLI5V"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;p.s. how about 699? &lt;a href="https://t.co/DDSdmTiDu3"&gt;https://t.co/DDSdmTiDu3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WalkingCat (@_h0x0d_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1341780886954512387?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 23, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yINy07"&gt;Samsung’s slides also note the Galaxy Chromebook 2 will be the first Chromebook with a QLED, or quantum dot LED, screen. The company’s previous Chromebook used a 4K AMOLED, a choice which seemed to hurt the battery life of the device. Switching to QLED would match the change Samsung made in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/29/20938145/samsung-galaxy-book-flex-ion-laptops-design-wireless-charging-qled-hands-on"&gt;its non-Chrome OS laptops in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqWkFS"&gt;The old Galaxy Chromebook relied on an Intel 10th-gen Core i5 that was more than capable of handling the tasks Samsung imagined customers would use the device for, but this new Galaxy Chromebook 2 is supposedly switching to a 10th-gen Core i3. It isn’t necessarily a step down for browser-based work in Chrome OS, but it is interesting considering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505926/intel-11th-gen-rocket-lake-desktop-processors-q1-2021-amd"&gt;the availability of 11th-gen Intel processors in 2021&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wctmX"&gt;All these changes may have played a role in the $699 (likely entry-level) price, the final notable tidbit from WalkingCat’s leak. The original Galaxy Chromebook was pitched as something “premium” for “professionals,” and at least &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22194081/samsung-leaked-galaxy-chromebook-2-orange-color-ces-2021"&gt;from the renders we’ve seen&lt;/a&gt;, the Galaxy Chromebook 2 is maintaining that sleek design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="II3XNX"&gt;The Galaxy Chromebook 2’s cheaper price puts it closer to actual high-end Chromebooks than to proper laptops from Apple and others. Swapping to a different processor, and relying on a display it already sources for its other laptops, could help improve sales, especially when combined with a lower price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXddwG"&gt;We’ll have to wait till that promised February 2021 launch date from the slide to know for sure. But CES 2021 is right around the corner, and with it comes the possibility of some clarity on Samsung’s Chromebook roadmap for next year and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
