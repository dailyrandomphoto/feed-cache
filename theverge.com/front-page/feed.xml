    <title>Unlimited smartphone plans, explained</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlimited plans from Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile all have one thing in common: limitations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;span class="ql-cursor"&gt;﻿&lt;/span&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A guide to your phone plan’s fine print&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ejBS9S"&gt;Phone plans are notorious for including the worst kinds of jargon — things that seem to tell you what you’re signing up for but actually conceal a long list of conditions and exceptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfKPDU"&gt;This is the industry that brought us the term “anytime minutes.” Seriously, have you ever really thought about that phrase? &lt;em&gt;Anytime minutes.&lt;/em&gt; Even the 10-year-old &lt;em&gt;Portlandia&lt;/em&gt; sketch where Kumail Nanjiani sells Fred and Carrie a phone plan is still painfully accurate. (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MrccTMwoLv8"&gt;Go watch it&lt;/a&gt; for such gems as “After you pay for it, it is free” and “It’s just a one-time fee that you pay annually.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPW9SB"&gt;So it should come as no surprise that when wireless carriers call a service “Unlimited,” there are, in fact, limitations on it. T-Mobile recently brought attention to one of those practices known as “deprioritization” by introducing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295466/t-mobile-magenta-max-unlimited-data-5g-4k-video-announced"&gt;an unlimited plan without it&lt;/a&gt;. But that’s just one of a handful of fine print provisos that all three of the major US carriers impose on their customers. Here’s a jargon-free guide to the most common limitations on your favorite carrier’s so-called unlimited plans, postpaid and prepaid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qHiyY4"&gt;Premium data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="HnEpNO"&gt;You will likely see the phrase “premium data” or “premium network access” on your plan details; that’s a nice way of describing “deprioritization,” or “throttling” as it’s also called. This is when carriers temporarily slow down data speeds for their heaviest users when network traffic is high. The carriers say this practice is necessary to ensure networks aren’t overwhelmed. In many cases, deprioritization doesn’t kick in until users hit a certain monthly threshold of data usage — often 50GB — but some carriers’ lowest-tier plan subscribers are always subject to slowdowns, regardless of how much data they’ve used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="R5GdxD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some carriers’ lowest-tier plan subscribers are always subject to slowdowns&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UzMdrt"&gt;That’s the case for users on Verizon’s Start Unlimited plan and AT&amp;amp;T’s Unlimited Starter, while those on the carriers’ more expensive unlimited plans aren’t subject to slowdowns until they’ve used 50GB in a month. T-Mobile’s basic Essentials plan includes a 50GB threshold. Its most expensive plan, Magenta Max, is the only one of the major carriers’ plans that doesn’t include a limit on its fastest mobile data speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBMPZK"&gt;Prepaid unlimited plans from all of the major carriers across the board are subject to slowdowns, regardless of how much data has been used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="N9MpjO"&gt;Video streaming limits&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="EherbJ"&gt;With your smartphone connected to home Wi-Fi, you can stream video at whatever resolution you please. Streaming video over mobile data is another story. Just about every phone plan out there limits streaming video to 480p quality, but there are a few exceptions. But even the plans that do support higher-quality streaming usually require you to enable it in your account. If you do have this option and choose to enable it, just keep in mind that streaming video might eat into your monthly “premium data” allotment faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yz9TMC"&gt;For example, Verizon’s more expensive unlimited plans include 720p streaming, but you need to log in to your account online and enable it. For an extra $10 per month, you can raise that to 1080p. And if you’re connected to the company’s fast Ultra Wideband 5G — which is only included on those more expensive unlimited plans — you’ll get streaming up to 4K.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="eoqSn2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even the plans that do support higher-quality streaming usually require you to enable it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8IM7fz"&gt;The other two carriers work in a similar way. AT&amp;amp;T’s basic unlimited plans get 480p, and while the “Elite” plan includes 1080p, you’ll need to turn off a feature called “Stream Saver” in your account settings to enable it. T-Mobile’s most expensive plan, Magenta Max, includes 4K streaming, which customers need to activate. All others are limited to 1.5Mbps, which essentially translates to 480p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r0ysgF"&gt;With a couple of exceptions, customers on prepaid unlimited plans are restricted to 480p streaming, too. AT&amp;amp;T’s most expensive prepaid unlimited plan allows users to disable Stream Saver and get 1080p streaming if they like. Verizon prepaid customers on the unlimited plan with Ultra Wideband 5G service will also get 4K if they’re connected to that network. Some data-capped prepaid plans from T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T allow customers to opt for HD, but not so for basic unlimited plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UnH9SV"&gt;Tethering&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ObhxDk"&gt;Another one for the category of “your unlimited data is not truly unlimited” is mobile tethering. Even though your phone might support tethering (using your mobile device’s data connection as a Wi-Fi hotspot or via a USB cable to your computer), your phone plan has limitations on if and how much you can use this feature. Basic unlimited plans tend to offer slow or no tethering at all, while even the most expensive plans include some limit to how much data you can use this way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="C0Hpfa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Basic unlimited plans tend to offer slow or no tethering at all&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HLcpEf"&gt;There’s no mobile tethering offered on Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T’s most basic unlimited plan. More expensive plans from both carriers offer progressively more generous 15GB and 30GB caps the more you pay. T-Mobile offers 3G tethering (600 Kbps) on its basic plan, which is adequate for web browsing but not ideal for streaming SD or HD video. Up to 5GB of much faster 4G / 5G data is included on its middle tier and a cap of 40GB on Magenta Max — these speeds will feel much closer to what you get with home internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrsCFv"&gt;Mobile tethering tends to not be included on basic prepaid unlimited plans; AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon offer it as an add-on for an additional monthly fee, while T-Mobile includes it at 3G speeds. The step-up prepaid unlimited plans include high-speed tethering across the board, albeit with a lower 10GB cap in all cases. Verizon does include unlimited Ultra Wideband 5G tethering for its top prepaid plan (again, if you can manage to find an Ultra Wideband signal).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qhruad"&gt;Mexico and Canada&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="vpbF5d"&gt;If there’s one way that your unlimited plan might actually be getting you more than you realized, it’s that your plan likely includes some international data for trips to Canada and Mexico. Most plans include, as a bare minimum, very slow 2G speeds in those countries, but a few include a certain amount of 4G data on either a monthly or daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="FNWFev"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Most plans include, as a bare minimum, very slow 2G speeds&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RGkzUd"&gt;Verizon makes it simple: it includes up to 0.5GB per day for all of its postpaid and prepaid unlimited plans. Once that daily cap is reached, you’ll get 2G speeds after that. AT&amp;amp;T only says that all unlimited plans — postpaid and prepaid — include data in Mexico and Canada but that “2G off-net data speeds may apply.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZeQe49"&gt;T-Mobile’s basic postpaid Essentials plan gets 2G only; the top-tier plans include 5GB of 4G monthly and then 2G after that. The company’s prepaid unlimited plans don’t include even 2G data, and “additional charges apply for international use.” Instead, users can add 5GB of 4G data for use in Canada and Mexico for an additional $5 per month. T-Mobile and Verizon also specify that the majority of a subscriber’s usage must come from within the US; otherwise, the companies are entitled to cut off international service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QDXOKP"&gt;Miscellaneous&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="n9VNnO"&gt;Those are the major items, but what else will you find if you go peering down the dark alleyways of your phone contract? Some are obvious, like clauses to keep you from turning your phone into your home Wi-Fi hub. Plans with generous tethering data allowances are more likely to include these details, stating, for example, that the majority of use must come from a smartphone or tablet. And of course, your contract prohibits you from certain types of bad behavior and illegal activity. But you knew that already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzGw8Q"&gt;You might also be pleasantly surprised to find discounted or subsidized streaming video services are included in your plan, too, but you’ll definitely want to read the conditions closely. Often, it’s a promotion for a set time period, like Verizon’s “Disney Plus for six months on us,” after which you’ll be charged on your monthly phone bill unless you cancel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yyTPmo"&gt;Others — usually on the more expensive plans — are included standard, like HBO Max included on AT&amp;amp;T’s Elite plan, and Netflix subscriptions on T-Mobile’s Magenta and Magenta Max. Even in those cases, you’ll want to read the conditions; a certain number of lines are required on T-Mobile to qualify for the Netflix deal, and the subscription offered may be for a more limited version, like SD quality only on one screen per account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="985AFE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s one more agreement in your contract to be aware of: the privacy policy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5TWlaB"&gt;But there’s one more agreement in your contract to be aware of: the privacy policy. Specifically, all three major carriers sell anonymized data about their customers to third-party advertisers in the name of serving more relevant ads. It’s an unwelcome but extremely common practice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="3ruipH"&gt;The good news is that you can opt out of these programs. Verizon customers can do so by logging in to My Verizon and following the steps on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fabout%2Fprivacy%2Ffull-privacy-policy%23acc-item-34&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360228%2Funlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;company’s privacy page&lt;/a&gt;. Likewise, T-Mobile customers can find instructions for opting out on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fprivacy-center%2Ftake-control-of-your-data&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360228%2Funlimited-plan-verizon-att-t-mobile-premium-data-tethering-limits" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;carrier’s privacy center page&lt;/a&gt;, and AT&amp;amp;T customers can opt out by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=http://www.att.com/cmpchoice&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321733/t-mobile-privacy-policy-third-party-advertisers&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22085774__t_w__r_google.com__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;logging in to their account’s privacy controls&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not going to stop the dozens upon dozens of other websites and services that you use from selling your information, but it’s at least one less source to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook bans Trump again after he borrows daughter-in-law’s page</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7LwPQqvb9yAucVNQSsUzAwDPM3s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69055386/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hSiPiG"&gt;Donald Trump has been kicked off of Facebook a second time after &lt;a href="https://www.mediamatters.org/facebook/former-president-donald-trump-set-return-facebook-his-daughter-laws-page"&gt;Media Matters for America&lt;/a&gt; raised questions about his appearances on daughter-in-law Lara’s page. Facebook has removed an interview with the former president that was posted by Lara Trump, who is married to Eric Trump. Lara &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/LaraLTrump/photos/a.529608677244941/1547529432119522/?__cft__%5B0%5D=AZVZ1gTclckEBnQ-G3wcL1hvj9f2RKtJCfZVcFs3cABAx-ZV9zMhHpwseGzDh4up8uRGX4dKmpThn_FGt2i20qIZmy5XpFjbMQAmRMPSt1vDUrZqVyWh2r6eBBhTGr75d0Bs6ImOO_bI-nXmRqA_lI_O&amp;amp;__tn__=%2CO*F"&gt;posted screenshots&lt;/a&gt; of emails that appear to be from Facebook (complete with an obligatory &lt;em&gt;1984&lt;/em&gt; reference), saying that a video of the interview was removed because it featured “the voice of Donald Trump,” along with a warning that posting further content would result in account limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U0QxdF"&gt;The full text of the purported email from Facebook is below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Rw356Q"&gt;Hi folks,&lt;br&gt;We are reaching out to let you know that we removed content from Lara Trump’s Facebook Page that featured President Trump speaking. In line with the block we placed on Donald Trump’s Facebook and Instagram accounts, further content posted in the voice of Donald Trump will be removed and result in additional limitations on the accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wc6Qum"&gt;Donald Trump has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;banned from Facebook since the January 6th attack on the capitol&lt;/a&gt;. The company’s oversight board is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256821/facebook-trump-ban-oversight-board-public-feedback"&gt;currently deliberating&lt;/a&gt; on whether the platform should have banned the then-president, and its ruling is expected soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgJmaN"&gt;Following the capitol attacks most platforms banned Trump, and this isn’t the first time we’ve seen him try to get around the bans and get his voice out onto social media: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221683/trump-tried-to-evade-his-ban-with-potus-but-those-tweets-were-instantly-deleted"&gt;Twitter banned multiple Trump-affiliated accounts&lt;/a&gt; that posted his statements. It’s generally noted in platform’s terms of service that trying to evade a ban will result in further banning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mpMcR"&gt;Facebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple won’t give Siri a female-sounding voice by default anymore</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eSmEyQdJXZ_lq0c_brhksTk9O9g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69055372/akrales_190522_3444_0028.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sZUrJR"&gt;Apple will remove the female voice as the default for its Siri assistant, according to &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/03/31/apple-adds-two-siri-voices/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The change is effective as of today’s release of the sixth iOS 14.5 beta. Once this latest update is publicly released to all customers, iPhone and iPad users will be prompted to choose their preferred Siri voice during device setup. Previously, Siri defaulted to a female voice, and users would pick another option in settings after the fact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y8oNgg"&gt;Alongside this change, Apple is also introducing two completely new voices for Siri that, according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;, “use source talent recordings that are then run through Apple’s Neural text to speech engine, making the voices flow more organically through phrases that are actually being generated on the fly.” Those new voices are available to English speakers globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRO49l"&gt;The news is the latest example of big tech companies trying to remove any gender associations from their digital voice assistants. Studies have found that when assistants use a female-sounding voice by default, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/21/18634322/amazon-alexa-apple-siri-female-voice-assistants-harmful-gender-stereotypes-new-study"&gt;it can reinforce bias and negative stereotypes&lt;/a&gt;. Some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/19/15998668/samsung-adds-removes-sexist-bixby-descriptor-tags"&gt;embarrassing mistakes&lt;/a&gt; have been made along the way as these technologies develop, but Apple’s latest step is one of the most significant yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NvXw3H"&gt;“We’re excited to introduce two new Siri voices for English speakers and the option for Siri users to select the voice they want when they set up their device,” Apple told &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; in a statement. “This is a continuation of Apple’s long-standing commitment to diversity and inclusion, and products and services that are designed to better reflect the diversity of the world we live in.” Siri takes on over 25 billion requests monthly across 500 million devices, according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A comedian says he created ‘Darla,’ the anti-union Amazon worker, as a joke</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U_8uTW07U037YOqK8n0_vtmKgHU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69054896/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0001.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TkzeF0"&gt;While some Alabama Amazon workers were submitting their votes to unionize the company’s first US warehouse last week, something strange was happening on Twitter. Accounts seemingly belonging to warehouse workers were tweeting at users supporting the union or making unsavory comments about Amazon in general. Amazon’s anti-union Twitter army has been a subject of criticism and mockery for the last few years, inspiring a slew of accounts parodying actual Amazon ambassadors, but the Bessemer fight brought it all back into the spotlight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzYxt5"&gt;Over the weekend, one parody account, in particular, caught the attention of reporters and Amazon detractors across Twitter: @AmazonFCDarla. Darla’s profile picture looked fake, but the language used in her tweets was eerily similar to that used by real Amazon employees. Publications like &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/theres-something-fishy-about-amazons-anti-union-twitter-1846572212"&gt;quickly debunked Darla’s&lt;/a&gt; account. Her profile picture appeared to have been created by an artificial intelligence program like &lt;a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/"&gt;This Person Does Not Exist&lt;/a&gt;. Her account was created in March with no tweets dating back to the beginning of Amazon’s ambassador program. And Darla’s tweets were half-baked “in the way that a troll might tweet,” &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo &lt;/em&gt;said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nq3BQ0"&gt;An Amazon spokesperson confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that many of the accounts weren’t created by company employees.&lt;em&gt; “&lt;/em&gt;Many of these are not Amazon FC Ambassadors – it appears they are fake accounts that violate Twitter’s terms,” a spokesperson said. “We’ve asked Twitter to investigate and take appropriate action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcfdB4"&gt;It didn’t take long for Twitter to suspend the Darla account and other fake ones on the grounds of “impersonation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hoJpV9"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It's official, Darla is dead for good. RIP, and best wishes to her boys, Tyler and Cameron &lt;a href="https://t.co/522kxhQBzI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/522kxhQBzI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— hi i'm robby (@robbleton) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/robbleton/status/1377115245265580037?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 31, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p id="HRsLM1"&gt;Robby Appleton, a comedian from Chicago, came forward on Tuesday saying he had created the Darla account to parody real Amazon Twitter ambassadors. “On Friday, I created a satirical Twitter account making fun of Amazon’s anti-union propaganda,” Appleton said in a tweet &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/robbleton/status/1376603576731111429?s=20"&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;. “I can’t wrap my head around how far this dumb Twitter account got,” he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/robbleton/status/1376683571763687429?s=20"&gt;said in another&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QxhuKQ"&gt;Appleton provided a variety of evidence to back up the claim, including two email responses from Twitter regarding an account suspension he claims to be Darla’s. The first email shows Twitter’s response to his appeal for the account to be reinstated. Appleton also forwarded an email from Twitter confirming that an account belonging to his email was “permanently” suspended for violating the platform’s rules on “impersonation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHUSfN"&gt;Twitter declined to confirm or deny that Appleton was the user behind the @AmazonFCDarla account on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FHoReU"&gt;I spoke with Appleton on Tuesday night about why he started the account and what he would tell Amazon if the company is still paying attention to the gag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nxuoiW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Sj4Z8g"&gt;
&lt;p id="0DOZTV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why did you decide to make the account in the first place?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kODMj3"&gt;It was Friday afternoon when I first made the account, and I’d been watching all the news with the Amazon plant in Alabama trying to unionize. I was watching all of the really weird responses from the Amazon News account to Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and I was like, “That’s a really insane PR strategy they seem to have.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="deXQWa"&gt;Then I started spotting these Amazon FC accounts, and I knew there were a lot of parodies, but a couple of them seemed legitimate. They had very little engagement, like three or four followers. They would reply to something and mostly just get hate. It was so bizarre to me that Amazon was making their employees sit on the clock and be sycophants for the people hiring them. Also, their strategy was so chaotic that this wasn’t even effective. And I thought, because it was so chaotic, I might be able to make an account and maybe fool a dozen people into thinking it was real and have a little fun with that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdJwC0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much time did you dedicate to the account? And what was your strategy for drafting the tweets?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3VgAf2"&gt;It was actually pretty minimal. I know a lot of Twitter detectives kept going after the profile picture. It was AI-generated from This Person Does Not Exist. And the reason for that was just like, I was just lazy. If I thought this was going to fool a lot of people, I probably would have gotten a friend or a family member to pose for a picture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRRNaH"&gt;I spent the whole weekend at my girlfriend’s parents’ house for Passover. I didn’t have a lot of free time because we were cooking, eating, and we were going shopping because I got some new cats. Most of this happened in little moments I could steal away on my phone. But the strategy was just that I wanted to see how far I could push one of these accounts without making it so absurd no one would believe me. I learned to keep it just realistic enough that I thought I could fool most people while keeping it strongly satirical. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTGmSs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How long were you planning to keep pushing this schtick?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZZ1e2"&gt;Honestly, I had no real strategy. Once the account had been suspended, it was clear that I wasn’t going to have any more fun with this. Yesterday, I knew the end was near, and so I decided that today, I was going to post a fake PowerPoint presentation for Amazon that started as an anti-union speech and turned into this really strongly pro-union “seize the means of production” rant. But Twitter suspended me a bit before I could do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emxtQ1"&gt;I was maybe going to put the Soviet national anthem under it at the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VvyDDD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It was reported that Amazon asked Twitter to investigate the account. If Amazon is still paying attention, what would you tell the company now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PEg1pw"&gt;If their working conditions are as good as they claimed, they should welcome a union because it would be the pride of every union. If they’re so good that they don’t need a union, the union would come in and absolutely praise for the good work they’re doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5I1IaY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Belkin’s iPhone 12 stand will follow you with face tracking (but not during video calls)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C_MyDRTOtdl9YM1IeiLdi0MLnHE=/240x0:1440x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69054852/belkin_MMA001btBK_movement_tracking_tripod_stand_playing_guitar_on_live_stream_carousel_1_v01_r01_1680x800_us.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Belkin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bgwcJV"&gt;Belkin has a new iPhone stand that’s useful enough to be interesting but annoyingly limited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aSHDJV"&gt;The company’s “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2FP-MMA001%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360203%2Fbelkin-iphone-12-magsafe-face-tracking-stand-no-video-calls" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Magnetic Phone Mount with Face Tracking&lt;/a&gt;” works with the iPhone 12’s MagSafe feature, clipping your phone into place using the device’s built-in magnets. It then uses face tracking to follow you around the room, rotating so it’s always facing you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwSRbw"&gt;The catch is that this feature doesn’t work with video calls on Zoom, FaceTime, or any other similar service — surely one of the biggest potential use cases in a pandemic. In fact, judging by the product description, the tracking feature &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; works when recording video through Belkin’s own iOS app. That would mean you can’t even use the stand to make sure your phone is always facing you as you follow along with an exercise video or recipe. We’ve reached out to Belkin to double check this and will update this article when we know more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9itFST-kcwCd0tftdHB2JqBUJ9E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410698/belkin_MMA001btBK_movement_tracking_tripod_stand_hosting_streaming_workout_session_carousel_2_v01_r01_1680x800_us.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Belkin&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can track yourself recording video but not watching it. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1ij6qo"&gt;Being able to record video that tracks you will definitely be useful to some people, and Belkin says its iOS app can connect directly to social media accounts (including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and others) to make posting easy. But it still means the mount is more of a specialist tool than a device that could help more consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zRDLhq"&gt;Other relevant specs: the mount works in landscape and portrait orientations, can be tilted vertically from -15 to 30 degrees, rotates horizontally through 360 degrees, and is powered by three AA batteries. And of course, because it uses MagSafe to attach to your phone, it only works with the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro, and iPhone 12 Pro Max. The mount will sell for $65, but it’s only listed as “coming soon” &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.belkin.com%2Fus%2Fp%2FP-MMA001%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F31%2F22360203%2Fbelkin-iphone-12-magsafe-face-tracking-stand-no-video-calls" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on Belkin’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PUBG Lite is shutting down at the end of April</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pdtYxl2kIH9ZyPs5nyt0pqq3aV4=/113x0:1859x1164/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69054775/pubg_mobile.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8Ah5rA"&gt;There are a few different versions of &lt;em&gt;PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds&lt;/em&gt; — the game that popularized the battle royale genre and inspired a legion of competitors — which you can play on everything from your underpowered phone to your high-end gaming rig. At the end of April, however, the list will be one entry shorter: &lt;em&gt;PUBG Lite&lt;/em&gt;, the free-to-play version of the ultimate life and death fight specced for lower-end machines, is &lt;a href="https://lite.pubg.com/2021/03/30/notice-april-29-service-termination-notice/"&gt;going dark on April 29th&lt;/a&gt;. New downloads were shut down on March 30th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuMgnp"&gt;In its note to fans, Krafton, the game’s publisher, didn’t give a reason for the impending closure. Here’s what it &lt;a href="https://lite.pubg.com/2021/03/30/notice-april-29-service-termination-notice/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; in full: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="MAywm1"&gt;We are deeply grateful for the passion and support from the astounding number of PUBG LITE fans that have been with us. During the strenuous times of the COVID-19 pandemic, we hope that PUBG LITE was able to provide our fans a fun way to stay safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhcG9n"&gt;Unfortunately, we have made the difficult decision to close service after much deliberation and the time has come for our journey to end. We regretfully inform you that service of PUBG LITE is scheduled to end on April 29th, 2021 (UTC).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="NDAiii"&gt;News of the shutdown came after the publisher’s announcement last November that &lt;em&gt;PUBG Lite&lt;/em&gt; was going fully free-to-play, after &lt;a href="https://lite.pubg.com/2020/11/13/2020-november-dev-letter-l-coin-system-termination/"&gt;ditching its in-game currency system&lt;/a&gt;. The game was launched in beta in January 2019 in Thailand, and it moved to Europe in October of that same year. Goodnight, sweet prince. Goodnight, sweet ultimate life and death fight. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2 review: Ring’s best doorbell yet</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The new top-of-the-line Ring doorbell is expensive but works well&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="ZaO1pl"&gt;Ring’s new $249.99 Video Doorbell Pro 2 is the best video doorbell yet from a company that has nearly become a household name for video doorbells. It has an excellent field of view and video quality; plenty of customizable features for notifications and recording zones; and speedy performance, whether that’s sending alerts to your phone or smart speaker when someone rings the bell or pulling up the live feed from the Ring app on a phone. If you can tolerate the price tag, are able to install a wired doorbell at your door, and aren’t put off by Ring’s Neighbors app or police partnerships (both of which you can opt out of), the Video Doorbell Pro 2 is one of the best video doorbells you can get right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FDRHOb"&gt;The new Video Doorbell Pro 2 is Ring’s top-of-the-line model, replacing the original Video Doorbell Pro from 2017. Unlike Ring’s other doorbells, the Pro 2 does not have a battery option; you have to have wiring running to it for power. But because it doesn’t have to house a battery, the Pro 2 is much smaller than Ring’s battery-powered options and has faster response times when you want to pull up the feed on your phone or an Echo Show smart display. It also can work with an existing doorbell chime in your home if you have one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x5wxhI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10421741"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K9mDFz"&gt;Despite its higher-than-average price tag, the Pro 2 doesn’t really look all that much more premium than other Ring models. The housing is made entirely of plastic, and there’s a big Ring logo stamped on the bottom. If sleek design is what you’re after, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/3/17312166/nest-hello-yale-lock-smart-home-review"&gt;Google’s Nest Hello&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22318478/logitech-circle-view-doorbell-homekit-review-test-price"&gt;Logitech Circle View Doorbell&lt;/a&gt; are better choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PzGXbN"&gt;Ring has added a number of new features this time around, but the most significant change is how the Video Doorbell Pro 2 captures video clips. Unlike the prior model and every other Ring doorbell before it, the Pro 2 shoots 1536 x 1536-pixel square video, which lets you see visitors from top to bottom. It also makes it much easier to see if packages have been left at your doorstep because you can see the ground right in front of the doorbell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lM8q9t"&gt;On my doorway, the Pro 2’s wide and tall field of view was able to let me see the entirety of my small porch much better than the older 16:9 format Ring doorbells or others that have a tall but not as wide aspect ratio, like Logitech’s Circle View Doorbell. The Pro 2 captures a sharp and detailed image, complete with HDR for balancing bright skies and visitors’ faces. It also has a dedicated infrared night mode that will come on automatically if the light levels are low enough. The porch light I have at my doorway was sufficient enough to keep the Pro 2 in normal video mode, so I was able to have full-color video captures at night without blinding visitors with a light on the doorbell itself like what happens with the Circle View Doorbell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fn6WnL93QgNcXYX-fc16XIPTPHQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22406592/dseifert_20210323_4486_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2 has a new camera that captures a wide and tall square video clip.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3nMAQwL1KZ7saW93S9volPrtUtY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22406590/dseifert_20210323_4486_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despite its higher-than-average price tag, the Video Doorbell Pro 2 is still very plasticky and looks cheap compared to other options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LYDc41"&gt;Thanks to support for both 2.4GHz and 5GHz Wi-Fi, pulling up the Pro 2’s video feed through the Ring app on my phone is a painless process that just takes a couple of seconds. Likewise, asking an Echo Show to display the feed is quick and easy. The Echo Show and Fire TV devices will even automatically display the feed from the camera whenever the doorbell is rung. Older video doorbells used to take an agonizing amount of time to show their video feeds. I’m glad to see this newest crop is much faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aoa4c9"&gt;The Pro 2 also has a new “3D Motion Detection” feature that lets you see the movements of someone on your property even if they are out of frame of the camera. The name oversells what this is doing a bit: the app will show a top-down view of movements represented as colored dots on the map of your home overlaid over the recorded video clip. It’s designed to let you see where someone has been on your property before they show up on the primary camera. But the range for this feature is limited to only 30 feet — that’s about enough to reach a third of the way down my driveway — and while it’s a neat demo of technology, I didn’t find much utility in it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dOS2ftO1vLT3Ui_-xQefBSfAFpY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410391/daytime_2up.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Video Doorbell Pro 2 shows more of my front porch than other doorbells. The new 3D Motion Detection feature provides the bird’s-eye view of movement on my property, seen in the right image.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oJTuda"&gt;The other thing I didn’t find much use for is the Alexa Greetings feature, which lets you have Alexa answer the door through the Ring doorbell if you don’t get to it within a set amount of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2z4Yz"&gt;There are two reasons I didn’t really like this feature. One is since we’re still spending the majority of our time home due to the pandemic, I don’t really need someone else to answer the door for me — I’m always there. The other is the idea of having Amazon’s Alexa robot speak to a visitor in my place. Alexa can ask couriers to leave a package in a particular place you specify or record a message from other visitors that will be sent to your phone. In my tests, it works like a typical Alexa interaction, with a slight delay between each prompt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zmk1Ok"&gt;But in general, it feels a bit off-putting and rude to force visitors to interact with an unexpected robot. I feel the same way about using the two-way audio to talk to someone at the door through my phone. While there may certainly be great accessibility use cases for these features, they weren’t helpful for me, and I left them turned off. I think basic package detection and notifications, which other doorbells offer, would be more useful, but Ring doesn’t have any features like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nW7aox"&gt;The Alexa responses feature requires a subscription to Ring’s Protect plan, which starts at $3 per month and enables other features such as a six-second pre-roll recording for motion alerts, the option to only get alerted when a person is detected, video history for up to 60 days, and the ability to save and share clips. You can use the Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2 without paying for this subscription, but you’ll be limited to motion alerts, live view, two-way talking, and six preset responses if you’re not home. Neither one of Ring’s plans, paid or free, offers continuous 24/7 recording. If that’s something you want, Google’s Nest Hello is a better choice.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3fDqBQCrK7_eH9qhwaRMvy2hbRI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22410429/nightime_2up.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Video Doorbell Pro 2 has a traditional grayscale infrared night mode (right), but if you have enough light, it will fall back to its color feed at night (left).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYdSOu"&gt;Since Ring is an Amazon company, the Pro 2 works best and offers the most utility if you have Amazon Echo speakers or smart displays. In addition to the ability to automatically show the feed when the bell is pressed, you can have Echo speakers announce when someone’s at the door so you never miss a visitor. This feature isn’t available with Google Nest smart speakers or displays; again, the Nest Hello would be a better choice if you’re running a Google smart home. (Likewise, if you’re running an Apple HomeKit smart home, the Logitech Circle View Doorbell is a better choice.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmO74r"&gt;Lastly, I can’t cover a Ring product without mentioning its controversial Neighbors app and police partnerships. The Neighbors app is a separate app that collates crime and safety reports from other Ring owners in your neighborhood. By default, the Neighbors feed is integrated into the Ring app, allowing you to see other posts and share video clips from your camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57RkP5"&gt;Similarly, the Public Safety feature allows police and other public service agencies to request video clips from your camera to aid in solving crimes. You then have the option to approve or deny the request.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="xwGmh2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10421784"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0FaiaA"&gt;Ring has made it easier to manage these features. Both of them are controlled in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21050426/ring-control-center-privacy-dashboard-app-police-security-two-factor-ces-2020"&gt;app’s Control Center section&lt;/a&gt;, where you can disable the Neighbors feed and block public agencies from requesting clips from your video camera. You can also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22225716/ring-end-to-end-encryption-video-launch"&gt;enable end-to-end encryption&lt;/a&gt;, which will disable these features and limit the ability to share video clips with others. But I wish Ring would go even further and disable both of them by default, letting owners decide if they want to opt in or not during setup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JlbTl2"&gt;Ring’s portfolio of video doorbells has grown significantly over the past couple of years, and it can be confusing to figure out which one is right for your needs. The Pro 2’s pitch is simple: this is the best video doorbell camera Ring sells, provided you have the ability to hook it up to existing doorbell wiring or run new wiring to it. If you want the best performance and are in Amazon’s Echo ecosystem, the Pro 2 is the doorbell to get.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Specialized Como SL e-bike review: mellow yellow</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;A fun lightweight commuter from the maker of the Turbo Vado&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cCW5rF"&gt;Specialized just released one of its most interesting electric bikes to date, the Como SL. The SL stands for “Super Light,” and Specialized is marketing it as an everyday commuter, perfect for zipping over to a friend’s house, picking up some groceries, or, if you really need to, carrying up a few flights of stairs. There’s even a hand grip built into the frame to help lift the bike when needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f1JzBX"&gt;The Como SL is a slimmed-down version of Specialized’s Turbo Como, which is the company’s entry-level electric bike for commuters. The company is doubling down on a lot of the elements that made the Turbo Como so inviting to riders, while also adding a whole host of additional features — including aluminum fenders, a rear rack, and a front-mounted basket — without adding unnecessary pounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VlDKFz"&gt;For the last week and a half, I’ve had the pleasure of riding the Como SL all over my neighborhood to see how it measures up — not only to Specialized’s other highly capable, extremely powerful (and at times very pricy) e-bikes, but also to the other lightweight commuter e-bikes that have been flooding the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AS5sna"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10421956"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gFmo6e"&gt;I tackled steep hills, busy county roads without bike lanes, and even a languid ride through the park. While the Como SL is not the most powerful e-bike I’ve ever ridden, it is among the smoothest and easiest to handle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YLhUwx"&gt;Maybe it was the warming spring weather or the way the Como SL’s yellow paint job reflected the daffodils just now emerging from the ground, but I found this bike to be an absolute delight to ride. I did have some issues with the UX of the digital display, and the gearing left a little bit to be desired. But overall, the skill and craftsmanship Specialized put into the Como SL really shone through, and I think this will be a worthy addition to the company’s growing lineup of e-bikes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m8ClsxKpsNx6e9i_24smEUOZd3U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408145/ahawkins_20210329_4495_0014.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Como SL has a surprising amount of cargo capacity for errands or other outings. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="86gBfy"&gt;Specialized may be based in California, but its design team is headquartered in a nondescript brick building in Cham, Switzerland. That’s where the company designs its Turbo-branded e-bikes like the Levo, Creo, Vado, and Como, as well as their Super Light variants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlBMpq"&gt;To make the Como SL worthy of that suffix, the company started out by fully integrating the battery into the frame of the bike. Many direct-to-consumer e-bike brands have unsightly batteries perched on the downtube, while other companies have tried to have it both ways by integrating it into the frame while also having it be removable. Specialized decided to make its battery both fully integrated and non-removable, placing the Como SL in the same category as companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;VanMoof&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/18/18484541/ampler-stout-e-bike-review-its-not-easy-being-green"&gt;Ampler&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21344679/gogoro-eeyo-1s-e-bike-review-score-price-date"&gt;Gogoro&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1Dlni"&gt;“By integrating [the battery] we were able to make a really lightweight aluminum frame,” Dominik Geyer, head of business for Specialized’s Turbo brand, who is based in the company’s Swiss office, told me. “We have a system that is super efficient, that needs less battery cells [which] makes it lighter weight.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LfkYvQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have a system that is super efficient, that needs less battery cells [which] makes it lighter weight.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OTrKNq"&gt;Specialized says the Como SL’s 320Wh battery should be good for 62 miles (100 kilometers) of range, depending on the terrain and power setting. I found that while riding in the middle “Sport” setting, I burned through nearly 100 percent of the battery in less than 35 miles. That’s pretty standard for an e-bike battery, but Specialized does offer an optional Range Extender for $449.99, which the company says adds about 31 miles (55 km) of range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uq44Qz"&gt;Specialized says the battery can recharge from 3 percent to 100 percent in approximately 2 hours and 35 minutes. There’s a port at the base of the downtube where you can plug in the 48V charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDCmWQ"&gt;Another driving factor was simplicity, Geyer said. Specialized wanted a bike that was easy to ride and even easier to maintain. The Gates carbon belt drive and internal geared hub motor speak to this desire, as well as the simplicity of the cockpit controls. “The bike simply needs to be a trusted partner in your daily life to get around,” Geyer added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YueJOM"&gt;Still, the Como SL isn’t exactly a featherweight. It essentially weighs the same as the Turbo Como — between 47 and 48.5 pounds, depending on the frame size — despite all those new accessories. That means Specialized has found other, unique ways to shave off some of that bulk without compromising on what makes it so much fun to ride. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvAMUy"&gt;One of those is the SL motor, which tips the scale at 4.3 pounds (1.95 kg). Compare that to the Turbo Como’s motor, which weighs about 7.5 pounds (3.4 kg), and you can see how much work Specialized put into shrinking down the componentry in this bike. The motor is developed jointly by Specialized and Brose, a German company that also makes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22179185/harley-davidson-serial-1-ebike-test-hands-on-specs-price"&gt;e-bike motors for Harley-Davidson&lt;/a&gt; and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="sgW3Cl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’d think that by reducing the size of its motor that you’d be dealing with a less powerful bike — and you’d be right&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="61fDnG"&gt;You’d think that by reducing the size of its motor that you’d be dealing with a less powerful bike — and you’d be right, to some extent. Specialized says the Como SL’s rear-hub motor has 240W of peak and continuous power as well as 35Nm of torque. That’s slightly less than the Turbo Como, which has a mid-drive motor rated for 250W of nominal power and 415W of peak and 50Nm of torque. Specialized says the Turbo Como offers riders four times their natural power input while pedaling, while the Como SL only delivers twice as much power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qjfrec"&gt;That becomes readily apparent when powering up a steep hill. I found myself having to exert a lot more force than I usually do when riding an e-bike, which is not necessarily a bad thing. I appreciate an e-bike that makes you work a little bit harder to get you to where you’re going, though I realize I might be in the minority with that opinion, especially if your goal is to arrive at your office job sweat-free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoLXOB"&gt;Overall, the look of the bike is very clean and polished, with all the wires integrated into the bike’s frame. That’s a stark contrast to most DTC e-bikes, which typically come with a rat’s nest of wires tangled around the handlebars. After all, there are clear advantages to going with an e-bike from a legacy bike company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OJG9WixZVCDcpJs6bZaqUMC4o2Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408079/ahawkins_20210329_4495_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The on/off button on the downtube also displays battery levels. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ih_oVku91IpcqPqxlvBAxGnrWcs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408147/ahawkins_20210329_4495_0016.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Gates carbon belt drive is cleaner and easier to maintain than a traditional chainring. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p8mGQjJ0QS_Dqv237E8YmTDpAVI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408146/ahawkins_20210329_4495_0015.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Front and back lights are connected to the bike’s battery.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UYjVfaMFfE1q1kDvYGHoIIcik88=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408078/ahawkins_20210329_4495_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The display has left and right buttons to toggle between different screens. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oI4JYT"&gt;Let’s talk about the digital display because this was my least favorite part about the Como SL. The LCD display is small by e-bike standards, 2.5 x 2 inches, or about the size of a pack of gum. There are only two buttons, left and right, which can be used to scroll through a half-dozen different screens showing speed, odometer, calories burned, distance traveled, and a timer. It’s a clean design, but I found it to be over-simplified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sAxwoZ"&gt;The real controls are routed through Specialized’s smartphone app, Mission Control, which is paired with the bike via Bluetooth. I’ll be completely honest: I am not a fan of app-based controls for e-bikes. It was one of my few beefs with Gogoro’s Eeyo 1S, and the same goes for the Como SL. I understand that by offloading certain controls to an app, manufacturers can offer nicer graphics and more functionality while saving on the costs associated with the on-bike display. And you don’t need the app to actually turn the bike on; the button for that is placed on a nice rubber pad in the downtube, along with a series of blue light bars that indicate battery strength. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NVIZTw"&gt;But when I’m riding an e-bike, I want to be able to toggle between power settings without fumbling in my pocket for my phone. The Como SL doesn’t come with a standard phone mount. Although one could certainly be purchased separately, I’d struggle to find a place to mount it. The sloping handlebars would likely direct the phone’s display off to the side. And the LCD screen is mounted in the center, which would be another obvious place for a mount. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZQ5xed"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I want to be able to toggle between power settings without fumbling in my pocket for my phone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fYAsBj"&gt;The good part about the app is the level of fine-tuning it allows. You can customize the power settings to fit your riding style. The “Smart Control” feature automatically tailors the electronic assist in real time based on the information you input, such as how far you plan on riding. That worked well when I took the Como SL on a 10-mile ride with a lot of steep hills. The gearing on this bike is also among the most seamless I’ve ever experienced. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kUABm"&gt;My last issue with the Como SL is the price. Specialized’s build quality is among the best in the industry, so you won’t be surprised to learn that this bike is a little expensive. There are two versions of the Como SL: the 4.0, which retails for $3,299.99, and the 5.0, which sells for $3,699.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SnAmZy"&gt;The difference between the two is the number of gears in the Shimano drivetrain. The Como SL 4.0 features the 5-speed Nexus system, while the 5.0 comes with the 8-speed Alfine. There are also different paint jobs that come with both. The 4.0 comes in three colors: “cast umber,” “dove grey,” and “raspberry.” The 5.0, which is the one I tested, comes in “brassy yellow,” “brushed silver,” and “smoke.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dc8joiTT970ppQwPQeZdNRTJI6g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22408082/ahawkins_20210329_4495_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Como SL is very approachable, with a low-step frame that makes mounting and dismounting a breeze. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kg2YLB"&gt;Specialized claims both bikes can reach a top speed of 28mph — which technically puts them in the speed pedelec category. However, on a flat surface and in the highest “Turbo” power setting, I was only able to get up to 24–25 mph. Not a huge deal, but it still left me wondering what I was missing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wQdjvP"&gt;Overall, the Como SL is a super fun, super lightweight, very approachable electric bike. The shape and contours of the frame are inviting, the front basket and rear rack allow for a decent amount of storage, and the drivetrain is extremely simple to use. Although I would have preferred less reliance on the app for basic functionality, I’m also not a Luddite, and I realize this is a direction some e-bikes appear to be heading. Fortunately, it’s not ubiquitous, so there’s still time to figure this out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BC1VRV"&gt;The price may deter those looking for something inexpensive. But for fans of Specialized — or for anyone who’s interested in an e-bike from a trusted company with decades of experience in the building, selling, and maintenance of bikes, both traditional and electric, — the Como SL should be the perfect fit. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="DC2jOd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242218/resident-evil-8-village-release-date-trailer-ps5-ps4-xbox-pc"&gt;coming on May 7th&lt;/a&gt;, but if you have been keeping up with the news surrounding the game, you may have heard about Lady Dimitrescu, a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; tall woman who has become &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/1/15/22233028/resident-evil-village-capcom-preview-fans-love-big-vampire-lady"&gt;&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; popular on the internet&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="b1mdc3"&gt;Lisina, a &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2019/11/28/worlds-tallest-model-no-one-cares-about-my-basketball-career/"&gt;former Olympian-turned-model&lt;/a&gt;, recently shared some content on Instagram of her cosplaying Lady Dimitrescu, even going so far as to re-create a parody of one of the trailers for the game. But don’t take my word for it, just check out the video she shared on her Instagram page:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0CoPYi"&gt;Lisina stands at 6 feet, 9 inches tall — which, fun fact, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261405/resident-evil-village-tall-lady-dimitrescu-height"&gt;is the inverse height of the actual character&lt;/a&gt;, according to the game’s art director. This isn’t the only content we’ve seen from Lisina cosplaying as the character: she also posted a TikTok a few days ago of her in the outfit. Outside of cosplaying as the latest &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil &lt;/em&gt;antagonist, Lisina also &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLJHO3kBxRQ/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"&gt;cosplayed as Princess Peach&lt;/a&gt; from the &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt; series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CfQSj"&gt;And now, I shall patiently wait to see if someone on the &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; development team notices Lisina’s cosplay because I really want to know what their reaction is. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Original Xbox and Xbox 360 games arrive on Microsoft’s xCloud streaming service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x2oAFdjKAjR5sKdZsXeTKr1B3xM=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69054377/xcloudxbox360games.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TfmC2P"&gt;Microsoft is bringing 16 original Xbox and Xbox 360 games to the company’s Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) service today. Titles like &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind&lt;/em&gt;, the original &lt;em&gt;Banjo-Kazooie&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Fallout: New Vegas&lt;/em&gt; are all now available to stream to Android devices. Microsoft is also enabling touch controls for &lt;em&gt;Jetpac Refuelled&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Viva Pinata&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Viva Pinata TIP&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTNyKM"&gt;The 16 games will be available to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members and streamable to Android phones and tablets. “We’ve listened to the feedback, going all the way back to our earliest cloud gaming preview, and making games from previous generations available on mobile devices has been one of the most requested features by the community,” &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/03/31/backward-compatibility-reaches-the-clouds-for-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-members/"&gt;says Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r9g0FY"&gt;Microsoft is also still planning to extend xCloud game streaming to iOS this spring. The software maker hasn’t revealed exactly when its iOS preview will go live, but Microsoft has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165280/microsoft-xcloud-ios-pc-launch-spring-2021-announced"&gt;previously promised&lt;/a&gt; both iOS and web browser streaming for xCloud in spring 2021. Game streaming will be available in the Xbox app for Windows 10 PCs, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ly0zwB"&gt;We got an early look at how xCloud will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/27/22304762/microsoft-xcloud-app-windows-xbox-touch-controls-gyro-support"&gt;work on Windows 10&lt;/a&gt; last month, alongside an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/15/22283739/microsoft-xcloud-web-screenshots-cloud-gaming-streaming-browser-features"&gt;exclusive first look at the web version of the service&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft is also testing 1080p streams for xCloud, and this will likely debut with the Windows version of the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o50xjZ"&gt;For now, here are the original Xbox and Xbox 360 games making their way to Xbox Cloud Gaming today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YJmXGS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Banjo-Kazooie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pJ1XcD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Banjo-Tooie&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uEZV1t"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Double Dragon Neon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pGYcfK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fable II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yig9FW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fallout: New Vegas&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="50YGsT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gears of War 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="OmnC4c"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gears of War 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="MZpXQZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gears of War: Judgment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="G0lEwQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jetpac Refuelled (touch controls enabled)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bKx9XS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kameo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nmwDhR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perfect Dark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qiOcTW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Perfect Dark Zero&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="11iKnO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8VmEvm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LRMHvL"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Viva Piñata&lt;/em&gt; (touch controls enabled)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="AH7JwK"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Viva Piñata: TIP&lt;/em&gt; (touch controls enabled)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
