    <title>TikTok removed more than 300,000 videos for election misinformation</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WgLmpN"&gt;TikTok removed over 340,000 videos in the US for breaking the platform’s rules on election misinformation, manipulation, or disinformation, according to a Wednesday &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/safety/resources/transparency-report-2020-2&amp;amp;lang=en"&gt;transparency report&lt;/a&gt; covering content from the second half of last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sl5NX3"&gt;A few months before the 2020 presidential election, TikTok announced that it would pair with fact-checking organizations as part of a broader effort to combat election and COVID-19 misinformation. At the time of the announcement, TikTok was under immense pressure by the Trump administration and lawmakers for its alleged ties to the Chinese government. Microsoft and Oracle were among some of the companies bidding for ownership over TikTok from ByteDance, a Chinese firm. A final deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276090/tiktok-oracle-deal-biden-trump-ban-china-bytedance-white-house"&gt;between Oracle and TikTok&lt;/a&gt; is still on hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TfZtVA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A final deal between Oracle and TikTok is still on hold&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5ytt3Z"&gt;“TikTok is a diverse, global community fueled by creative expression. We work to maintain an environment where everyone feels safe to create, find community, and be entertained,” Michael Beckerman, TikTok’s vice president and head of US public policy, said &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktoks-h-2-2020-transparency-report"&gt;in a statement Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. “We are committed to being transparent about how we keep our platform safe, because it helps build trust and understanding with our community.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUAiKr"&gt;Outside of the videos deleted for breaking election rules, TikTok announced Wednesday that over 441,000 videos were removed from the platform’s recommendation algorithm, or the For You Page, for spreading misinformation. Shortly before the 2020 election, TikTok rolled out an election guide &lt;a href="https://www.ballotready.org/"&gt;powered by BallotReady&lt;/a&gt;, a voting information tool. That guide was available on the Discover page, and election-related videos, hashtags, and political accounts. It was visited 18,000,000 times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BsD7If"&gt;TikTok also removed 1,750,000 accounts used “for automation” throughout the course of the 2020 US election. “While it’s not known if any of the accounts were used specifically to amplify election related content, it was important to remove this set of accounts to protect the platform at this critical time,” the transparency report reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g8I5O5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon Luna cloud gaming now available on Fire TVs without an invite </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qGNxbgc89dwL7_HXs-izRokX3qc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68866494/1600885423_downloadable_luna_heroamazon_luna.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4UI1Ak"&gt;Amazon’s cloud-gaming service, Luna, is now available to try for free in the US on select Fire TV devices without an invitation, &lt;a href="https://amazonluna.blog/play-amazon-luna-on-fire-tv-e00e1e44810b"&gt;the company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Luna launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525435/amazon-luna-early-access-cloud-gaming"&gt;in early access last year&lt;/a&gt;, as an invitation-only service. Originally, customers also needed an invite to buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P989QTJ?ref_=ods_surl_bn&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Luna Controller&lt;/a&gt;, but Amazon now says it’s available to everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KiG038"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/luna/landing-page?tag=theverge02-20#faq:~:text=How%20do%20I%20get%20early%20access,business%20accounts%20are%20not%20currently%20supported." rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s FAQ &lt;/a&gt;says that users can get access to Luna on Fire TV by simply downloading the app. A list of Fire TV devices that are compatible with Luna is available on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GUFHUSX8X324T4XE&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this Amazon support page&lt;/a&gt;. These include the Fire TV Stick Lite, Fire TV Stick (2nd &amp;amp; 3rd generation), Fire TV Stick 4K, Fire TV (3rd generation), Fire TV Cube, Toshiba Fire TV Edition, and Insignia Fire TV Edition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3K2JmS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If you don’t have a Fire TV you can still request an invitation to access Luna”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jEwejk"&gt;Signing up for Luna gets you a 7-day free trial of the Luna Plus channel, which costs $5.99 a month thereafter during early access and includes games like &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Grid. &lt;/em&gt;There’s also a Ubisoft Plus channel subscription for $14.99 a month which includes titles like &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlFQzt"&gt;As well as Fire TV devices, Luna’s early access is also available on Windows, Mac, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22177222/amazon-luna-android-cloud-gaming-google-pixel-samsung-oneplus"&gt;select Android devices&lt;/a&gt;, and web browsers on iPhone, iPad, Windows, and Mac, but only after receiving an invitation. “If you don’t have a Fire TV you can still request an invitation to access Luna at &lt;a href="http://amazon.com/Luna.?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;amazon.com/Luna&lt;/a&gt;,” Amazon’s post reads. The service is currently limited the US mainland, excluding Alaska, Hawaii, and US territories.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new browser extension blocks any websites that use Google, Facebook, Microsoft, or Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s8AbssNUMSvnvSjb5865lOzEVaM=/68x0:2318x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68866419/Screen_Shot_2021_02_23_at_10.46.03_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3mfa8r"&gt;The Economic Security Project is trying to make a point about big tech monopolies by releasing a browser plugin that will block any sites that reach out to IP addresses owned by Google, Facebook, Microsoft, or Amazon. The extension is called &lt;a href="https://bigtechdetective.net/"&gt;Big Tech Detective&lt;/a&gt;, and after using the internet with it for a day (or, more accurately, trying and failing to use), I’d say it drives home the point that it’s almost impossible to avoid these companies on the modern web, even if you try. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJEevq"&gt;Currently, the app has to be side-loaded onto Chrome, and the Economic Security Project expects that will remain the case. It’s also &lt;a href="https://bigtechdetective.net/firefox"&gt;available to side-load onto Firefox&lt;/a&gt;. By default, it just keeps track of how many requests are sent, and to which companies. If you configure the extension to actually block websites, you’ll see a big red popup if the website you’re visiting sends a request to any of the four. That popup will also include a list of all the requests so you can get an idea of what’s being asked for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrjU9i"&gt;It’s worth keeping in mind that just because a site reaches out to one or more of the big four tech companies, it doesn’t mean that it’s necessarily snooping or doing something nefarious. Many websites use fonts from Google Fonts, or host their sites using Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure. That said, there are pages that connect to those IP addresses because they use trackers provided by one of the big four companies. The examples I’m about to list were selected because they’re common sites, not necessarily because they should be shamed.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WTlDZnAE3w9XUQsZr9oaLrSD_0A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324233/Screen_Shot_2021_02_23_at_10.46.57_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even when I’m not using Google, I still see the pop up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U1mo0h"&gt;I saw the popup a lot. DuckDuckGo and Fastmail, popular non-Google alternatives for search and email, were both blocked because they loaded resources from Google, and DuckDuckGo also loaded things from Microsoft (not that this was surprising, given that &lt;a href="https://help.duckduckgo.com/company/advertising-and-affiliates/?redir=1"&gt;the search engine’s ads come from it&lt;/a&gt;). In fact, almost every search engine I could think of was blocked: Microsoft’s Bing, obviously, but also Yahoo, Startpage, Ecosia, and even Ask.com. &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;was also blocked, as it loads resources from Amazon, Google, and Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nh4Cnu"&gt;If I were trying to use the web without being able to connect to IP addresses owned by the big four, it would certainly make my job more difficult: not only could I not easily search for information, basically every news site I could think to try also came up blocked — even the one for my local paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GhOprT"&gt;If I can’t work, how about some entertainment? That could be tricky too. Google obviously owns YouTube, but Netflix, Hulu, Floatplane, Mangadex, and even Vimeo also all showed the big red lock screen courtesy of the Big Tech Detective extension. It was the same story with online shopping, as Etsy loads resources from all four companies. And if this extension made me want to just ditch the internet and go to the woods? The Hiking Project and AllTrails were also lost to the block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bJObhv"&gt;To try to drive the point home that the takeaway from this extension should be more along the lines of “the entire internet relies on basically four companies” and not “every website is tracking me,” I tried to go to a website that I helped build and that I know isn’t doing anything creepy or even showing ads. It was blocked because it’s hosted on AWS and uses fonts from Google.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4k8ePvWU_4gh4PdTYHJ2y4FZ7k0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324228/Screen_Shot_2021_02_23_at_11.06.44_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look at what I apparently did to my boy, without even realizing it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lcENCh"&gt;Of course, if a browser extension can tell that trackers are present, it’s also possible to block them. There are &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/the-best-chrome-extensions-to-prevent-creepy-web-tracking/"&gt;quite a few extensions available that do so&lt;/a&gt;, and I’ve used one called NoScript in the past. However, it is a balancing act between blocking things you don’t want, and also not breaking the site you’re trying to visit — having to deal with broken sites because of super-strict settings was the reason I backed off trying that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xj6wpa"&gt;Big Tech Detective isn’t meant to keep your data private from these companies — it even says when it locks one of the pages that it isn’t actually preventing the resources from loading, or collecting your data if that’s their purpose. It’s really meant as a visualization tool to show you that if you want to use the internet without relying on these companies, you’re not going to have a good time. It does, however, let you somewhat recreate &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/c/goodbye-big-five"&gt;the experiment &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; ran&lt;/a&gt; where one of its reporters tried to cut out the same four tech companies &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; Apple — and some technology from that work helps power this extension.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aG0DpA"&gt;Oh, and if you’re wondering if I found any sites that didn’t get blocked, the answer is yes: somehow, the iCloud site seemed to work fine. However, Apple’s website proper did not — it made requests to Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GhaTPk"&gt;It’s possible that the web’s reliance on Google, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon might change. &lt;a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/"&gt;This hilariously explicit website is always my go-to&lt;/a&gt; when I want to remind myself that the modern web is very different from what it used to be.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden to sign executive order calling for semiconductor supply chain review</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Remarks On Lives Lost To Covid-19" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kD3njk4f_gprF1Jqgc5oS5sdmH0=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68866371/1231330766.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ekuCQk"&gt;President Biden is set to sign an executive order Wednesday to address growing concern over a global semiconductor shortage hampering the production of goods like automobiles and smartphones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RnZ0SG"&gt;The White House’s executive order will direct the federal government&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;to conduct 100-day reviews of supply chains in four sets of products, including computer chips and large capacity batteries, like those used in electric vehicles, according to administration officials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNlhx7"&gt;The chip shortage was a result of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278431/biden-administration-global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-executive-order"&gt;a number of factors&lt;/a&gt; created by the coronavirus pandemic. As more of daily life moved online, consumer electronics manufacturers saw an increase in demand for products like laptops. Production of chips also slowed down in part because of the pandemic, and former President Trump’s trade war with China made it more difficult for US companies to work with Chinese chip producers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrttfz"&gt;This resulted in companies like Apple, AMD, Sony, and Qualcomm raising concern over shortages over the last few weeks, including parts for iPhones and consoles like the PlayStation 5. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bQ2zyv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Semiconductors play a critical role in enabling the products and services that fuel our economy”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sdj2Fi"&gt;Earlier this month, lobbying groups for the auto, telecommunications, and technology industries &lt;a href="https://www.semiconductors.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/CHIPS-multi-assn-letter-feb-18-2021_1.pdf"&gt;called on the White House&lt;/a&gt; to work with Congress to provide additional funding for domestic chip research and production. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xbu682"&gt;“Semiconductors play a critical role in enabling the products and services that fuel our economy, contribute to American innovation, and enhance our national security,” the groups said in a letter to Biden last week. “Given the central role of semiconductors, strengthening the US position in semiconductor research, design, and manufacturing is a national priority.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZhAwap"&gt;In a press conference Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said that Congress &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-china-democrats/top-u-s-senate-democrat-directs-lawmakers-to-craft-bill-to-counter-china-idUSKBN2AN2HJ"&gt;would be working to draft a legislative package&lt;/a&gt; to “outcompete China and create new American jobs” as well as making new investments in the US semiconductor industry. Schumer said he’s looking to bring these items up for a floor vote in the Senate this spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfRknH"&gt;“Right now, semiconductor manufacturing is a dangerous weak spot in our economy and in our national security, that has to change,” Schumer said on Wednesday. “We cannot let China get ahead of us in chip production.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOfHY2"&gt;Outside of the semiconductor supply chain, Biden’s order also calls for similar reviews into the defense, public health, biological preparedness, information communications technology, transportation, and energy and food production sectors, the administration officials said.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dkfMCn"&gt;Biden is expected to sign the order Thursday afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0dfab"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fry’s Electronics is shutting its doors for good</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LN3T54U3JzNKk2yJ3JNzyuZ8cfU=/0x0:2200x1467/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68866122/20190209_Sean_Hollister_Verge_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="c2c6gs"&gt;Fry’s Electronics, one of the last big brick-and-mortar electronics store chains in the United States — and a Silicon Valley institution in particular — is permanently closing nationwide, &lt;a href="https://www.kron4.com/news/national/frys-electronics-permanently-closes-nationwide/"&gt;local broadcaster KRON4 has confirmed&lt;/a&gt;, following a report &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bill0004/status/1364407906192424964"&gt;from Bill Reynolds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MatthewKeysLive/status/1364424681302810630"&gt;another from Matthew Keys&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f3EFUE"&gt;The company’s Facebook page is also gone and its Twitter feed has been set to private — it was public earlier this evening, though it hadn’t tweeted in quite some time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ye3JiM"&gt;If you’ve ever visited a Fry’s anytime in the past two to three years, none of this will come as a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xmKxWG"&gt;Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fry%27s_Electronics"&gt;the family-owned business&lt;/a&gt; had been pushed to the brink of extinction by online retailers like Amazon, Newegg and more. Initially, the company started a campaign to price-match any item you could find online. It added a children’s toy aisle, huge racks of As Seen on TV gadgets, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/harrymccracken/status/637759447381639168"&gt;even perfume&lt;/a&gt;. But things got worse. By 2019, what used to be a paradise of gadgets, computers, components, video games, audio equipment and appliances had turned into ghost warehouses &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/harrymccracken/status/1229277395695235072"&gt;filled with empty shelves&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iTPbAD"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Horn of Plenty is barren. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ycE0EBLHpD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ycE0EBLHpD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Harry McCracken (@harrymccracken) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/harrymccracken/status/1229277395695235072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GVPN1s"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Is-Fry-s-Electronics-in-trouble-Company-denies-14945559.php"&gt;It turned out&lt;/a&gt; the company had been forced to switch to a consignment model, only able to attract suppliers willing to get paid for their goods &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; Fry’s managed to sell them. Many suppliers weren’t. A former employee tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Samsung stopped doing business  due to unpaid bills, and that Fry’s had eliminated most full-time roles even before the pandemic hit, in order to save money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwkzN4"&gt;YouTuber star Bitwit famously &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wq2rUsUTL_0"&gt;conducted a video investigation&lt;/a&gt; that showed the depths the once-great stores had sunk to — and how the company shipped extra inventory to its Las Vegas store just in case journalists stopped by during CES 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rS4qvz"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wq2rUsUTL_0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lVxNNd"&gt;Soon, the company began closing its stores — and not just any stores, but major ones in the heart of Silicon Valley, like &lt;a href="https://laughingsquid.com/frys-palo-alto-the-western-theme/"&gt;its cowboy-themed store in Palo Alto&lt;/a&gt; mere steps away from where my dad used to work on the Danger Hiptop (known better as the T-Mobile Sidekick) and many big tech startups still do business. That Palo Alto store closed &lt;a href="https://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2019/12/27/the-era-of-frys-electronics-comes-to-an-end-in-palo-alto"&gt;in December 2019&lt;/a&gt;. I used to ride my bike to the company’s Egyptian-themed, pyramid shaped store in Campbell, &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Fry-s-Electronics-closes-Campbell-store-15719689.php"&gt;which abruptly closed last November&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P2GcvC"&gt;Egyptians? Cowboys? Yes, setting foot into a Fry’s Electronics was an experience with a capital “E” — when I moved to the Bay Area in 1990, one of the very first stores was laid out like the insides of a (now-vintage) computer — you’d walk down the aisles of the motherboard, bumping into giant human-sized capacitors and resistors as you’d go. The Egyptian store had fake columns, mummies and sarcophagi; laptops were laid out on huge stone slabs held up by statues of black panthers. That Palo Alto store which closed? Fake horses and hot air balloons hanging from the ceiling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EWyAJM"&gt;Here are a few of the other locations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7Zapoe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Fry's Electronics @ Burbank, CA (opened 1995) &lt;a href="https://t.co/Kj5yqorQ7K"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Kj5yqorQ7K&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Froyo Tam   #BlackLivesMatter (@FroyoTam) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FroyoTam/status/1364432478807617538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Df4ZI"&gt;“Going to a Fry’s store is entertainment in itself; for a geek, it could be recuperative,” wrote former Apple exec Jean-Louis Gassée &lt;a href="https://mondaynote.com/the-frys-era-8709a7e602eb"&gt;in a 2019 blog post&lt;/a&gt;. I wholeheartedly agree — I’d even occasionally grab some food, either a packet of discount astronaut ice cream or one of the many, many selections from their tremendous candy shelves attached to the checkout line. They’d even do cheap hot dogs and soda in the parking lot, some summers when I was growing up. The company’s Black Friday doorbusters were a Silicon Valley event, too, with lines around the block for $200 laptops and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/8317301136818176"&gt;$60 routers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G0F1y9"&gt;You could just &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; a lot of demo devices, too. I tried my first VR headset at a Fry’s, long before Oculus came around. It was my first taste of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII &lt;/em&gt;on a demo PlayStation as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q8rbsj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The most magical place in the universe:&lt;br&gt;The Fry’s store in Campbell. &lt;a href="https://t.co/gUGHYGN5Do"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gUGHYGN5Do&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— SwiftOnSecurity (@SwiftOnSecurity) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/931956226379960320?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 18, 2017&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="17THmh"&gt;There was the little matter of Fry’s famously bad customer service, though. Rare was the day I’d find an employee who knew anything about their products, checkout lines were long, returns were incredibly slow, and the company was well-known for taking product returns, slapping on a discount label, and sticking them right back on the shelf. They’d also try to check every item against your receipt as you left, something that (unlike Costco, where you sign a member’s agreement) you didn’t need to let them do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="knfkVB"&gt;(I can’t figure out where to fit it, but there was also the amusing incident where a Ferrari-driving VP &lt;a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/frys-electronics-executive-accused-of-embezzling-65-million/"&gt;was found to have embezzled $65 million&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGKza1"&gt;The writing has been on the wall for Fry’s since last April, I would say, when reports surfaced &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/04/15/huge-tech-campus-eyed-in-north-san-jose-at-frys-electronics-site/"&gt;that its San Jose store might be replaced with an office campus&lt;/a&gt; — reports that often neglected to mention that Fry’s &lt;em&gt;corporate headquarters&lt;/em&gt; also occupied the same address. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DzWOWW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 75%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9uw0--6qFYo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="prTiB4"&gt;For a lot of readers, I bet this news is more of a nostalgia trigger than a real loss. But for me, it feels like we’re at the end of the era of gadget stores, now that the one I grew up with is gone. Over the years, we’ve lost Radio Shack, Toys R Us, The Sharper Image and Brookstone, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21067715/bose-shutting-down-retail-stores-layoffs-north-america-europe-japan-australia"&gt;the Bose stores&lt;/a&gt;, Circuit City, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21297400/microsoft-retail-stores-closing-cities-open"&gt;the Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt; and more. In the Silicon Valley we also lost CompUSA and Micro Center, and stores like Halted (known for actual circuits, not computers) and WeirdStuff Warehouse (a wild experience itself, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StarFire2258/status/983033269837967363"&gt;read my thread&lt;/a&gt;) have long since closed their doors as well. Some of the bigger ones have become &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/11/19/21578231/radioshack-rev-relaunch-online-store-zombie-brand"&gt;zombie brands&lt;/a&gt;, but they’re effectively gone. (Micro Center still has stores outside the Bay Area.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NtWh4d"&gt;I’m trying to think of any Silicon Valley electronics stores left, save Central Computer and of course Apple and Best Buy. If you think of any, let me know in the comments below? I might like to visit while that’s still an option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ck4o76"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Oculus Quest feature lets you mark your actual couch in VR</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dgc1PWO0MlqOoiAhSBm9xp-qGaM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68866064/akrales_200904_4160_0208.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bg5she"&gt;A new Oculus Quest feature expands the headset’s Guardian mode by letting you mark your real couch as an object that’ll show up in VR. The Guardian is an Oculus safety feature that lets you draw lines around your environment that act as a virtual boundary and appear in VR when you get too close to the edges; this couch mode is the first time that the Guardian has worked as more than just a simple measure of floor space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="170JVg"&gt;&lt;a href="https://uploadvr.com/oculus-quest-couch-guardian/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that you can mark out your couch or chair by touching one side and dragging out a virtual blue rectangle across it to define the correct size. Once you’ve done that it’ll appear as a 3D-modeled couch in the Oculus Home menu environment, or as the same blue rectangle when using the Guardian feature in an app or a game, and its position will be saved as part of the Guardian system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="cdotPd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Oculus Quest 2 review: better, cheaper VR","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"},{"title":"The 12 best new and updated games for the Oculus Quest 2","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21535909/oculus-quest-2-best-games"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8C5lai"&gt;What makes this cool is that the couch can now act as an extension of your Guardian system rather than as an obstacle that limits your space. Previously you’d have had to draw Guardian boundaries in front of your couch as if the space above it was a solid wall, so as not to accidentally walk into it. But now if you move to the edges of the Guardian and see the couch outside it, &lt;em&gt;UploadVR&lt;/em&gt; reports, you can simply sit down on it and get prompted to switch to “Couch mode,” so the game or app will know you’re sitting down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2EQIQ"&gt;The feature is still early, though — it’s listed as “experimental” in the Quest settings menu as part of software version 26 and hasn’t yet rolled out to everyone, including us. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG will license its webOS software to other TV brands</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oyc_CowuZJ91vN3WNAds3RY4YkQ=/239x0:3239x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68865091/Powered_by_webOS_TV.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5s8mw3"&gt;LG tonight announced that the company’s webOS smart TV platform will soon be found on TVs from other brands. RCA, Ayonz, and Konka are some of the companies that have already signed on. “This has the potential to reshape the TV business for both technology and content providers while significantly growing LG’s presence and prominence in the global home entertainment market,” LG said in a press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="16BZXX"&gt;The news comes after LG revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223767/lg-webos-6-tv-software-oled-qned-lcd-redesign"&gt;a significantly overhauled version of webOS&lt;/a&gt; at CES in January. On LG’s 2021 TVs, the slide-up “blades” interface has been ditched entirely in favor of a more traditional scrolling home screen. I’ve seen a wide range in opinions from LG’s existing TV customers; some like the new look since it resembles a streaming device and seems easier to use. Others who’ve come to appreciate the more colorful and “fun” webOS hope LG will keep webOS 6 off their TVs from 2020 and earlier. I’ll need some more time with the software before I can weigh in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDoP0N"&gt;But that redesign isn’t something that buyers of licensed webOS TVs will have to think about — at least not yet. LG tells me that the “powered by webOS TV” platform is based on webOS 5.0. So it’ll look just the same as LG TVs from the last several years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SIgZip"&gt;In licensing its platform to other TV brands, LG is following in the footsteps of Roku and Amazon, each of which has joined with third parties to release Roku TVs and Fire TV Edition TVs, respectively. Here’s what LG says its partners will get out of the deal:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="P6RMyS"&gt;Licensees of webOS TV receive the familiar and highly acclaimed UX design along with a rich pool of features such as voice search and control, integrated AI algorithms, and easy connectivity that have earned webOS positive industry and consumer accolades. With LG webOS TV, partners also get a diversity of content options including access to global streaming service apps such as Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime Video and sports streaming service DAZN as well as LG Channels, the company’s free premium content streaming service. Compatible TV models also include the dedicated Magic Motion remote controller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7NRW1dr7yHEVrobWLiM08L8XHpo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22324250/webOS_TV_Partners.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LG has already lined up a number of partners for “powered by webOS” TVs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lhsvT2"&gt;What’s in it for LG? The company will have control over the TV software experience across more devices — and also take in more advertising revenue. Expanding webOS to more TVs will get the ad-sponsored LG Channels in front of new eyes. This approach also gives LG more user data to make improvements to webOS, which will in turn benefit the company’s own TV lineup. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California can finally enforce its landmark net neutrality law, judge rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QPWnjZRUBCIuw4Ywj5gtgMnv3Po=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68864908/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VtbpaX"&gt;Net neutrality &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16776154/fcc-net-neutrality-vote-results-rules-repealed"&gt;died a horrible death&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, but things have just turned around: California’s landmark net neutrality law — erected in 2018 but immediately blocked by lawsuits from Trump’s Department of Justice and the telecom industry — can finally be enforced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dH8xmV"&gt;That’s the verdict from Judge John Mendez today, who declined to grant the telecom industry the preliminary injunction it had requested. The case might not be over, but the law can go into effect — and the judge doesn’t think the telecom industry is likely to win.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cS8w0Y"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Swiftstories/status/1364363591822962691?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1364363591822962691%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MLEx &lt;/em&gt;journalist Mike Swift&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eriqgardner/status/1364363126934802433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1364363126934802433%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;’s Eriq Gardner&lt;/a&gt;, each of whom had been following the decision live, Judge Mendez believes it should be up to Congress to say whether net neutrality should exist: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2CUceS"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Mendez says it should be up to Congress, not federal courts, to regulate &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NetNeutrality?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NetNeutrality&lt;/a&gt; "When you have to deal with legislation drafted in 1934 in 2021, I don’t think anyone is well served ...That is Congress' job. They have to keep up with what is going on in the real world." &lt;a href="https://t.co/4yceR9bbT4"&gt;https://t.co/4yceR9bbT4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Swift (@Swiftstories) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Swiftstories/status/1364363591822962691?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="UJatyR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Judge addresses what he says is "elephant" in case: "There are political overtones... This decision today is a legal decision and shouldn’t be viewed in political lens. I'm not expressing anything on soundness of policy. That's better left to Congress."&lt;/p&gt;— Eriq Gardner (@eriqgardner) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eriqgardner/status/1364363126934802433?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mqeooc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22273185/justice-department-drops-california-net-neutrality-lawsuit-ajit-pai"&gt;The DOJ dropped its own lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; challenging the California law earlier this month, so the telecom industry’s possible preliminary injunction was the last thing standing in the way — for now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qilicz"&gt;Here’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22240827/biden-acting-fcc-chair-rosenworcel-net-neutrality-acting"&gt;acting chairwoman of the FCC&lt;/a&gt;’s thoughts on the matter: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pznARd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;When the FCC, over my objection, rolled back its &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/netneutrality?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#netneutrality&lt;/a&gt; policies, states like California sought to fill the void with their own laws. Tonight a court in California decided that the state law can go into effect. This is big news for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/openinternet?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#openinternet&lt;/a&gt; policy.&lt;/p&gt;— Jessica Rosenworcel (@JRosenworcel) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcel/status/1364369582325121028?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0vfF0s"&gt;California State Senator Scott Weiner, who authored the bill, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Scott_Wiener/status/1364364856200073219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1364364856200073219%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=about%3Asrcdoc"&gt;is celebrating&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2p1SwA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;SB 822 is the strongest net neutrality law in the nation. We worked incredibly hard to pass this law, overcoming massive corporate opposition. California can now fully protect an open internet.&lt;/p&gt;— Senator Scott Wiener (@Scott_Wiener) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Scott_Wiener/status/1364364856200073219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nWwfFI"&gt;And so am I, as a California resident who knows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;it’s past time to fix the internet&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvGSJB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB822"&gt;Here’s the full text&lt;/a&gt; of the California Internet Consumer Protection and Net Neutrality Act of 2018, also known as SB-822. It contains a list of things that ISPs are not going to be able to do, including paid prioritization, “zero-rating” favorable content so it doesn’t count against your data cap (think of those bundled streaming services!), and failing to tell you fast service actually is and how their network management practices and speeds actually work.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="hDe169"&gt;GameStop CFO Jim Bell &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/02/23/2180940/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Resignation-of-CFO-and-Succession-Plan-to-Support-Transformation.html"&gt;has resigned&lt;/a&gt;, and will be leaving the video game retailer for good on March 26th. That’s just over a month from now. GameStop also announced a “succession plan,” just in case it can’t immediately find anyone suitable to accelerate a mall-based video game retailer’s transformation into the post-pandemic future. We can only speculate on the reasons for his departure, but &lt;em&gt;let’s just come out and say what everyone is thinking: &lt;/em&gt;STONKS!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="JvC0jw"&gt;What I want to know: did &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9oI_8YG6Vs"&gt;the Tendieman&lt;/a&gt; come for Bell? If not, perhaps he can still get a producer credit on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22268952/gamestop-stock-stonks-reddit-wallstreetbets-movies-tv-shows-hbo-netflix"&gt;the umpteen GameStock films&lt;/a&gt;, or a nice book deal.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stardew Valley is now a cooperative board game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nQuTEoQc3_oukXHOEp5XRYaIn-E=/45x0:1395x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68864499/Screen_Shot_2021_02_23_at_2.30.52_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: ConcernedApe&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QfEfbY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; has been adapted into board game form and is available to purchase now for $55, according to the game’s developer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1364322680804057090"&gt;Eric Barone (ConcernedApe)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; got its start as a popular, indie-take on farm sim classic &lt;em&gt;Harvest Moon&lt;/em&gt;, but now the video game will finally exist in physical form (without the need to go out and actually learn how to farm).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXMB4V"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley: The Board Game&lt;/em&gt; was developed over two years by Barone and board game designer Cole Meideros. The game aims to adapt the gameplay from the video game like farming, foraging, mining, and romance, into a customizable, but less open-ended form that you can actually finish in one sitting. The game is also designed for one to four players, meaning that just like the original game, you can play alone if you so choose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LLHint"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/31Sz4vMWYes?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pQiJIV"&gt;Finishing the game requires completing “Grandpa’s Goals” and the Community Center bundles that you might already be familiar with from the video game version. Players complete tasks and collect resources by taking turns positioning their pawns around the board and engaging in an activity of their choice. Mining at the mines, fishing at the beach foraging in the wilderness, and of course, farming at the farm. The seasons advance one week at a time each round, meaning time and available resources change as the seasons do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rstE3A"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-the-board-game-available-now/"&gt;In a blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing the board game, Barone stresses that it was designed to feature some amount of depth and complexity. “It’s easy to play once you learn the rules, but it’s not a short, casual game.” he says. He also provided &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/n3x4p8nw2yr1a3j/Stardew%20Rules%20for%20Download.pdf?dl=0"&gt;the rulebook&lt;/a&gt; so you can get a better sense of how difficult it is to set up and how many other mechanics there are to contend with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Yp3px"&gt;While the board game doesn’t initially seem as approachable as the video game it’s based on, the amount of detail that went into recreating &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; in physical form seems really impressive. You can purchase &lt;a href="https://shop.stardewvalley.net/products/stardew-valley-the-board-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley: The Board Game&lt;/em&gt; now for $55&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
