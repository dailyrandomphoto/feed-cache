    <title>Twitter is trying out ads in the perfect new place: right in the replies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ElP5KBM9fJ0hQkj9zDlvzThvhgA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69991326/acastro_170726_1777_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QuvCPN"&gt;I don’t know about you, but I sometimes feel like Twitter is overloaded with ads in my feed. Unfortunately, those ads don’t seem to be enough for the company, though, because it’s testing a new place to show them: right in the middle of conversations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yRNIhC"&gt;The new ad format is in testing on iOS and Android, and you’ll see ads after the first, third, or eighth reply to a tweet if you’re in the test, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boo/status/1448319014921404417?s=21"&gt;according to Bruce Falck&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter’s revenue product lead. He shared a GIF of what the new in-conversation ads look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aDjUzj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Starting today, we’re trying something different and testing a new ad format in Tweet conversations. If you’re a part of this test (which is global; on iOS &amp;amp; Android only), you’ll see ads after the first, third or eighth reply under a Tweet.  ️ &lt;a href="https://t.co/kvIGeYt2vp"&gt;pic.twitter.com/kvIGeYt2vp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— bruce.falck()   (@boo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boo/status/1448319014921404417?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1YvOyb"&gt;The in-conversation ad looks exactly as you’d expect, but I can’t say I’m a fan. Twitter can already be a pretty overstimulating place, especially if I take a risk by tapping into potentially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713211/twitter-pre-tweet-prompt-fight-intense-conversation"&gt;heated replies&lt;/a&gt;; I don’t know if I want to have to cognitively process ads amongst other junk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440425/elon-musk-impersonator-cryptocurrency-bitcoin-twitter-scam-report-ftc"&gt;like Elon Musk impersonators&lt;/a&gt;. Fortunately, I don’t seem to have been selected for the test just yet, so at least for now, any conversations I read are ad-free.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use the iOS app tracking blocker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12 mini feels very comfortable to hold." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v8CApHo89l_6-U02FA26oLjLlBo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187117/vpavic_4279_20201108_0321.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5AV4O6"&gt;Privacy is on everyone’s mind these days. Last spring, iOS 14.5 introduced a new privacy feature called App Tracking Transparency that may have made its users happier but did not endear Apple to some other companies — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;specifically Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. The feature is still available in iOS 15, along with &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F06%2Fapple-advances-its-privacy-leadership-with-ios-15-ipados-15-macos-monterey-and-watchos-8%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22403523%2Fios-14-5-tracking-consent-app-transparency-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some new privacy features&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gLqII1"&gt;Many apps don’t just track your movements inside the app, but they track your movements outside of the app — in other words, where you go after you’ve left the app. This is why you see ads in Facebook and other apps for products you were just looking at on Amazon or other sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJui93"&gt;Before 14.5, you could turn tracking off for all of your apps by going to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking and turning off “Allow Apps to Request to Track.” The version that first appeared in iOS 14.5 allows you to be more specific. To begin, when you install a new app, you don’t have to do anything; you are automatically asked whether you want the new app to track you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_sNA9207Ij6MSzf2Kv2v5aQKVoc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470537/Image_from_iOS.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New apps must ask permission to track you in order to personalize their ads.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you or not." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SFVoiRqzCT28pCAurjfCEcl0yRk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470540/Image_from_iOS__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s up to you now whether to allow each app to track you.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P6sRHd"&gt;If you want to see which apps have asked for permission to track and possibly change their tracking settings, you can just go to that same Tracking page. There, you will be able to give or revoke that permission. So:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="amnEHD"&gt;Go to your iPhone’s settings and select Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FMi304"&gt;Beneath “Allow Apps to Request to Track,” you’ll now see a list of specific apps that have asked for that permission. You can permit or revoke that permission for each specific app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to Settings &amp;amp;gt; Privacy &amp;amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w6w_zBXKYJsJ68-QaTDaA_HPCgU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470579/Image_from_iOS__3_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Privacy &amp;gt; Tracking to change the settings for specific or all apps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sqNFgl"&gt;And you can still use “Allow Apps to Request to Track” to turn off permission for &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of your current (and future) apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ne1PGZ"&gt;(Note: At first, the App Tracking Transparency feature seemed to be misbehaving for some people; it either didn’t respond, or &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/04/26/ios-14-5-app-tracking-transparency-toggle-mysteriously-toggle-grayed-out-for-some-users/"&gt;the toggle in Tracking was grayed out&lt;/a&gt;. On May 3rd, Apple issued update 14.5.1, which was supposed to fix the problem. &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/05/03/ios-14-5-1-release-changes/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the fix hasn’t worked for some people; however, at least one staffer at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported that his toggle was no longer grayed out. There have been no such problems reported recently.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qdw2bJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 27th, 9:20AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to add a note about problems with the new feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4nwEG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 10th, 2:50PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;The note about issues with the new feature has been updated.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzW1Zi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 13th, 5:20PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article has been updated to acknowledge that iOS 15 has shipped.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fox is trying to build a Masked Singer NFT community</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DahUCkOEXc4-PcJv08L-SYsryOE=/305x0:2339x1356/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69991140/Screen_Shot_2021_10_13_at_1.30.35_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="v1ocu3"&gt;Some TV studio was going to be the first to tie a big NFT project to a major show, and it turns out to be Fox — the company is launching the MaskVerse, an NFT collection / game / thing that ties into &lt;em&gt;The Masked Singer&lt;/em&gt;. Fox has shown interest in doing NFT tie-ins before, but this one leans on a community aspect that we’ve seen other NFT projects use (sometimes to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664469/bored-ape-yacht-club-sothebys-auction-amount"&gt;great success&lt;/a&gt;, other times &lt;a href="https://www.thegamer.com/nft-evolved-apes-scam/"&gt;to disaster&lt;/a&gt;). Fox also seems like it wants this project to become more of A Thing than &lt;a href="https://curionft.com/collections/american-gods-motel-america"&gt;the collectibles released by other TV shows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jpgHoZ"&gt;The company says that the first NFT for the show, which will be free and grant “special access” to the MaskVerse’s Discord, will launch on Wednesday (along with, of course, an episode of &lt;em&gt;The Masked Singer&lt;/em&gt;). After that, people can buy packs of NFTs to build collections, and come November, Fox will be adding a game where players can vote on what will happen to contestants of the game show. The prize for guessing right will be the opportunity to buy even rarer NFT packs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mzOwEr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y4gpUY"&gt;Fox says that people will be able to trade or sell their NFTs halfway through &lt;em&gt;The Masked Singer’s &lt;/em&gt;season so that they can build complete collections. Getting a full collection of “Common Masks” will let you get access to even more exclusive digital items, &lt;a href="https://www.fox.com/article/maskverse-faqs-61660a4e44c9630020a29ac3/"&gt;according to the MaskVerse FAQ,&lt;/a&gt; as well as the possibility of real-life prizes (and, presumably, some extra clout in the Discord). The NFTs will at first only be purchasable using credit cards or PayPal, but Fox says support for cryptocurrencies is coming “soon.” If you’re interested in the nitty-gritty of the blockchain tech the company is using to do all this, &lt;a href="https://www.fox.com/article/maskverse-faqs-61660a4e44c9630020a29ac3/"&gt;the FAQ&lt;/a&gt; goes pretty in-depth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2wZ0Q"&gt;Fox has shown a lot of interest in doing show-based NFTs before, even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441078/fox-blockchain-animated-series-dan-harmon-nft"&gt;announcing that it’s created a company&lt;/a&gt; called Blockchain Creative Labs to make that happen. It already announced &lt;em&gt;Krapopolis&lt;/em&gt;, a show created by &lt;em&gt;Rick and Morty&lt;/em&gt; co-creator Dan Harmon that will be “curated entirely on the Blockchain.” Instead of focusing on releasing content and related merch on the blockchain, it seems like the MaskVerse is Fox trying to tap into a show with a pre-existing fanbase to get people excited about NFT trading, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;NBA Top Shot-style&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TAAR4y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The MaskVerse is a bit more than collectibles for a show&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bbMRQB"&gt;That’s not a surprising move with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;recent hype around NFT communities&lt;/a&gt; like the Bored Ape Yacht Club or Pudgy Penguins, but it will be interesting to see whether it’s successful — will the potential perks be interesting enough to get &lt;em&gt;The Masked Singer’s&lt;/em&gt; mainstream audience invested in an NFT game? Will the promise of NFTs get crypto people into the show? It’s hard to tell if either is likely, but given that Fox’s FAQ says the blockchain has an open event log, it should be relatively easy to tell how many people are interested.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook attempts to stop leaks by making some message boards private</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LHW2A8o3GV9c6KgJZvSlzcetWek=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69991120/acasto_180123_1777_0001_v3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DjkVDj"&gt;For weeks, Facebook has been dealing with numerous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686364/facebook-oversight-board-xcheck-moderation-exemption"&gt;bombshell&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;revelations&lt;/a&gt; resulting from a huge cache of &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;leaked internal documents&lt;/a&gt;. Now, Facebook is making some groups on its internal Workplace message boards about platform safety and protecting elections private, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/13/technology/facebook-workplace-transparency-leaks.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The move is seemingly in an effort to prevent further leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0zRwp"&gt;It’s unclear exactly how many groups will be taken private, so we don’t know how broadly Facebook is locking things down. “Leaks make it harder for our teams to work together, can put employees working on sensitive subjects at risk externally and lead to complex topics being misrepresented and misunderstood,” a Facebook spokesman said to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. The company didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GMiW8v"&gt;Facebook’s decision follows last week’s Congressional testimony by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen&lt;/a&gt;, a former staffer in the Civic Integrity group who was the source of the leaked documents. On Monday, Haugen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/11/22721229/facebook-whistleblower-frances-haugen-instagram-oversight-board"&gt;accepted an invitation&lt;/a&gt; to speak to Facebook’s independent Oversight Board, and later this month, she is scheduled to testify &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-58870495"&gt;before the UK Parliament&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Luna Display can now turn your iPad into a second screen for Windows devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/beif1eQuMH4VMcv6Jati_-qdTfw=/195x0:1503x872/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69991001/Screenshot_2021_10_13_12.58.42_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Astropad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b9Ybrs"&gt;Astropad’s Luna Display is a handy way to turn an iPad or another Mac into a wireless external monitor for Apple’s computers. Now the company has updated its wireless dongles &lt;a href="https://astropad.com/luna-5-0-windows/"&gt;to include support for Windows PCs&lt;/a&gt;, a solid step forward for the company after Apple’s Sidecar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18651017/apple-ipad-pro-pencil-sidecar-wwdc-2019"&gt;made its functionality a built-in part&lt;/a&gt; of iPadOS and MacOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cQL3ob"&gt;Windows support is included in Luna Display 5.0 and requires “Windows 10 64-bit, Build 1809 or later” and at least iPadOS 12.1, according to Astropad. That means modern Windows devices and iPads can work together in a variety of configurations, including using the Apple Pencil along with an iPad as a very expensive drawing tablet for your Windows machine. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6zHLEKudq02qN_7p4fS1SjB3FMs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924633/lunadisplaywindows.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Gif: Astropad&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPad’s touch controls, gestures, and Pencil support all translate over to Windows.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EIEzg5"&gt;The company is making Luna Display for Windows available in two types of connectors for plugging into your Windows devices, either USB-C and HDMI. Owners of the older USB-C Luna Display are also able to update to add support for Windows starting today. For what it’s worth, Astropad says the restructuring it did for its 5.0 release also means setting up Luna Display on M1 Macs should be faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VfXNZZ"&gt;Astropad &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/8/23/16184080/astro-hq-luna-turns-ipad-into-wireless-display"&gt;first launched Luna Display in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, about two years before Apple “sherlocked” it with the Sidecar feature added in macOS Catalina. Not long after, the company updated Luna Display &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/18/20920510/luna-display-mac-to-mac-mode-sidecar-sherlocked-apple"&gt;to work wirelessly between Macs&lt;/a&gt; as a response to Apple’s move. “Apple zigs, we zag,” Astropad CEO Matt Ronge &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mronge/status/1184881856598237184?s=20"&gt;tweeted at the time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NRMXdf"&gt;Astropad &lt;a href="https://astropad.com/sherlocked-by-apple/"&gt;has been fairly open&lt;/a&gt; about its experience of being copied, including suggesting it was &lt;a href="https://astropad.com/blessing-in-disguise/"&gt;a blessing in disguise&lt;/a&gt; when it announced it was testing Windows support in beta (other companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21124116/apple-developers-sherlocked-blix-bluemail-anonymous-email-feature"&gt;preferred taking legal action&lt;/a&gt;). The Kickstarter for its new Luna Display for Windows dongles &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/767721702/luna-display-for-windows/posts"&gt;launched on September 30th, 2020&lt;/a&gt; and was successfully funded just an hour later. People clearly want this functionality for Windows, and now Astropad is finally offering it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a9FIlU"&gt;Luna Display is $129 for Mac or PC, with port options for USB-C, HDMI, and Mini DisplayPort.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook execs tease VR prototype hardware with new photos</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v7-l0N8nmrT1PU6wpZZFsnAuqqc=/0x178:843x740/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69990835/245329931_10113982963136581_574941966054337503_n.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M9WeKB"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook virtual reality lead and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688510/facebook-cto-andrew-boz-bosworth-chief-technology-officer"&gt;soon-to-be CTO&lt;/a&gt; Andrew Bosworth (or “Boz”) are playing around with prototype VR (or AR) tech and want to show it off. Both executives have &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10113982963161531&amp;amp;set=a.529237706231"&gt;posted pictures of themselves&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1448336606360838145?s=21"&gt;wearing prototype headsets&lt;/a&gt; and linking the concepts to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;Facebook’s work&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;the metaverse&lt;/a&gt;. While the headsets the two are wearing are in no way guaranteed to become actual retail products, it’s an interesting look at what’s going on in Facebook’s virtual reality lab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QybSMc"&gt;The headset Zuckerberg is wearing looks similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;the company’s Oculus headsets&lt;/a&gt;. However, he identifies it as “retina resolution,” borrowing Apple’s phrase for screens with such high pixel density that you can’t discern individual points at a normal operating distance. The headset Boz is wearing has a more intriguing design — it looks, to be frank, almost exactly like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;drawings and descriptions of Apple’s rumored VR headset&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond Zuckerberg’s vague “retina” comment, there are basically no details on what kind of headsets they are, what they’re capable of, or even if they’re just nonfunctional design mock-ups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bxxMxp"&gt;
&lt;div class="iframely-embed" style="max-width: 640px;"&gt;&lt;div class="iframely-responsive" style="padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=10113982963161531&amp;amp;set=a.529237706231" data-iframely-url="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fphoto%2F%3Ffbid%3D10113982963161531%26set%3Da.529237706231&amp;amp;key=9ef4a209439e42bc59783ba959d50197"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="cEJ2cx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Proud of the research Michael Abrash's team is working on at FRL-R Redmond—excited to get an early look at some of the technologies that will underpin the metaverse (we work on several prototype headsets to prove out concepts, this is one of them. Kind of. It's a long story.) &lt;a href="https://t.co/Yi9xjy5HmG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Yi9xjy5HmG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Boz (@boztank) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1448336606360838145?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ihcOXc"&gt;That’s perhaps to be expected, given that this isn’t a product announcement from Facebook. While the company has released a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22662809/facebook-ray-ban-stories-camera-smart-glasses-hands-on"&gt;smart (and screen-less) Ray Bans&lt;/a&gt;, which it called a step in the path “towards full augmented reality glasses,” Facebook’s virtual reality lab also teases many prototypes that probably won’t make it to market. That includes things like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609564/facebook-reality-lab-reverse-passthrough-vr-prototype-research-siggraph"&gt;horrifying eye-projection headset&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22641894/facebook-project-aria-augmented-reality-ar-research-glasses-user-manual"&gt;research-focused Aria AR glasses&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308813/facebook-vr-sunglasses-research-proof-of-concept"&gt;proof-of-concept set of VR glasses&lt;/a&gt; (which show you a virtual world instead of augmenting the real one). Rather than hawking headsets, Boz and Zuckerberg seem to be selling their metaverse concept, which the company says is a virtual world that could be the next version of the internet. If you want to do a deep-dive into what that means exactly, check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22701104/metaverse-explained-fortnite-roblox-facebook-horizon"&gt;my colleagues’ great explainer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Hilariously, one of HTC’s Vive executives replied to Boz, asking if he’d be willing to trade the prototype headset for one hot off the factory line. Boz declined the offer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CNIGbx"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="es" dir="ltr"&gt;no deal&lt;/p&gt;— Boz (@boztank) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1448366889126686720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 13, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>How Axie Infinity is turning gaming on its head</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vhf2WiFv1FzxusvxYQ-LzKSfJBE=/168x0:1289x747/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69990831/https___bucketeer_e05bbc84_baa3_437e_9518_adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_418f3acf_2d81_4f05_ad62_2c875ec2c33f_4463x2289.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="w8QDP7"&gt;Last month I wrote about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22655077/loot-social-network-open-source-nft"&gt;Loot, a viral social project like nothing I had seen before&lt;/a&gt;. What made it possible was the unique digital objects known as non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, which inspired the Loot community to go build an entire fictional universe around them from the bottom up. Today I want to talk about another big social experiment that NFTs have enabled, and the potentially profound consequences of the platform that is emerging as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ohDUDq"&gt;I realize that, for lots of you, talk of blockchain projects immediately triggers eye-rolling and tab closing. But as with Loot, today’s edition is about one of those unconventional startups that feels too interesting to ignore. Especially because, on the surface, it can look like little more than a cheap &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; clone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8MndSx"&gt;The name of this thing is&lt;a href="https://axieinfinity.com/"&gt; Axie Infinity&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s made by a Vietnam-based company named Sky Mavis. Last week it was in the news because, just five months after raising&lt;a href="https://axie.substack.com/p/seriesa"&gt; a $7.5 million round&lt;/a&gt; of Series A funding, &lt;a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/119521/axie-infinity-nft-series-b-funding-a16z"&gt;Sky Mavis added an additional $152 million Series B led by Andreessen Horowitz&lt;/a&gt;. The company, which was founded in 2018, is now valued at $3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aK9D5w"&gt;The fundraising isn’t the interesting part: in 2021, almost any crypto-branded project showing decent growth will find itself showered in venture capital. &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; is interesting because it’s using cryptocurrency to stand up a new kind of video game, one in which you can earn meaningful income just by playing. The game is surrounded by a community that holds a financial stake in &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; via the game’s two currencies, which they can use to influence its development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VCv8UI"&gt;In short, it’s a social network where all the participants are buying and selling goods with real money. We have a word for that, one that we would almost never apply to a web-based social network: &lt;em&gt;an economy&lt;/em&gt;. And if &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; continues to grow at its current rate, that’s poised to have some fascinating implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="onNKEO"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; is just the beginning,” said Arianna Simpson, a partner at Andreessen Horowitz who led the firm’s &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; investment. “&lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; sort of created this model, but I think it’s going to be extremely widely applied ... If I can play a game, and have an equivalent amount of fun, and also make money — well obviously I’d rather do that, right? And so I think &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; is really just defining a new category, and this mechanism, in my mind, is going to be baked into the coming generations of games.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OuvTv3"&gt;But let’s back up for a minute: what kind of game is &lt;em&gt;Axie Infinity, &lt;/em&gt;exactly? In short, it’s &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; on the blockchain. (It’s not available in app stores; you either download &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; onto your desktop or sideload it onto your Android phone.) The game offers turn-based combat between teams of three cartoon monsters, known as Axies; each Axie has powers originating from their type (bug, bird, plant, etc.) and their various body parts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0IbWsQf_ZfLh83eDxZOZghDUW3s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924743/0_mKVkWxi7ubrmq96K.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YG4PQ1"&gt;Where it differs from &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; is that Axies are unique digital objects stored on &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt;’s own blockchain; to create new ones, existing owners must “breed” them by spending currency earned within the game or purchased from an exchange. By winning battles in the game, or selling Axies to other players, owners can earn the game’s currencies. Those earnings can then be sold on the open market for real money, generating income for the players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1hPpg"&gt;Dedicated players are now earning thousands of dollars a month playing &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt;, and the platform has grown quickly, to 1.8 million users logged in to the platform in August. As &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; reported in August, &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/axie-infinity/"&gt;this has proven particularly true in the Philippines&lt;/a&gt;, where 40 percent of today’s &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; players are based. The combination of existing low wages in the country and pandemic-related lockdowns has been a boon to &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt;, as players have flocked to the game in search of economic opportunity. (The outlet interviewed one man who doubled his income selling feed by playing &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt;, to $2,000 a month; a follow-up story explored &lt;a href="https://restofworld.org/2021/axie-players-are-facing-taxes/"&gt;how the country’s Bureau of Internal Revenue is now hounding players to pay their taxes&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Pkj6Sx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;in some places in the Philippines, people are paying their rent with the game’s SLP token&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s5ooNO"&gt;One stat that struck me: Sky Mavis says 25 percent of its players have never had a bank before, meaning their &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; wallets are the first financial services they’ve been able to access. Simpson told me that in some places in the Philippines, people are paying their rent with the game’s SLP token. That helps explain how &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt;’s total trading volume now exceeds $2.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="edkurQ"&gt;I asked Aleksander Larsen, co-founder and chief operating officer of Sky Mavis, why he thought &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; had grown so much faster than other crypto projects. In short, he said, &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; nailed the financial incentives: they gave players a good monetary reason to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFtbiW"&gt;“The way crypto works is that you have something to gain by it, right?” he said. “I think that’s really where it started. And then over the past couple of years, more and more people have have started to believe in our vision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQiFez"&gt;The company also made smart technical decisions: for example, moving the game’s transactions to a dedicated “&lt;a href="https://whitepaper.axieinfinity.com/technology/ronin-ethereum-sidechain"&gt;side chain&lt;/a&gt;” that enables the game to use the basic structure of Ethereum without processing transactions there, which can be slow and expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="i0PAZl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"NFTs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"},{"title":"Blockchain, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22654785/blockchain-explained-cryptocurrency-what-is-stake-nft"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="xUGO4F"&gt;The question is how much bigger &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; can get from here. While the economic incentives can be powerful, particularly in developing countries, there’s no getting around the fact that playing &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; today is onerous. The&lt;a href="https://axie.substack.com/p/axie-community-alpha-getting-started"&gt; eight-step process&lt;/a&gt; described in the company’s online guide involves downloading not one but two crypto wallets; buying and depositing Ethereum onto the company’s own blockchain; and purchasing at least three Axies, among other tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZoTeOf"&gt;There are a lot of upfront costs: &lt;em&gt;Rest of World&lt;/em&gt; estimates that it currently costs around $1,500 to buy into the game. (I haven’t yet made the leap myself.) In the Philippines, companies are now loaning out Axies to other players in exchange for 30 percent of their earnings.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jkx5Fq1vRU3rdP7clpmQg5YQhRE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924749/https___bucketeer_e05bbc84_baa3_437e_9518_adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com_public_images_117b0612_3517_489b_bc52_b8839f55d020_1600x862.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PoPtbs"&gt;Larsen is the first to admit that the current setup is complicated. He likened it to “swimming out to an island” just to play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="70kmIB"&gt;“&lt;em&gt;Axie &lt;/em&gt;is totally isolated out there — you have to do all this hard stuff to get there,” he said. “And yet people are willing to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W01Sd9"&gt;But a change is coming, he told me. The company is currently at work on a free-to-play version of &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; that, at least theoretically, could pass muster in the Google Play Store or Apple’s App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfdAq8"&gt;It should be available within three or four months, Larsen said. He said he was hopeful that the growing popularity of the app would give Sky Mavis leverage with Apple as it navigates app store policies. To date, so far as I can tell, there’s no iOS app for buying and selling NFTs. (Some,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22684372/opensea-app-nft-ios-android-apple-google"&gt; like OpenSea’s&lt;/a&gt;, simply least showcase the ones you own.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HijvOP"&gt;The dream is to eliminate everything that’s hard about playing &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; and welcome in the rest of the world. Larsen hopes that in a future version of the game, you’ll be able to acquire your blockchain assets with a single click and start playing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IKzXzA"&gt;“That’s the dream, obviously,” he said. “That’s what I’m working for. And when that moment in time hits, I think we can get to 2 billion people.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VNSl1i"&gt;In the meantime, &lt;em&gt;Axie&lt;/em&gt; is developing a way for people to buy virtual plots of lands in its fictional setting, the aptly named Lunacia, and eventually hopes to become a platform for games and experiences akin to Roblox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9N5TZl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What will it mean to live in a world where average people can make a little money — or even a lot of money — playing games?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UsT3B0"&gt;But let’s fast-forward a few years to a point when Apple and the crypto companies have worked something out. What will it mean to live in a world where average people can make a little money — or even a lot of money — playing games? How will it affect what kinds of games get built? Will it gradually siphon the attention of people who might have otherwise spent their time thumbing through feeds, mindlessly enriching the platform?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xFJhT0"&gt;It’s too soon to say, of course, but sometime this summer, these questions stopped feeling like sci-fi to me. I don’t know whether &lt;em&gt;Axie Infinity&lt;/em&gt; is the next &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. But I do believe that the phenomenon playing out in the Philippines today will be coming to other countries — possibly even more developed countries — in the not too distant future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RZxTYY"&gt;And when it arrives, the idea of playing to earn might bring a lot of people into crypto along with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="LCYdgo"&gt;
&lt;p id="WLaZXX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="d22oPe"&gt;The Apple Watch’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/4/8543033/apple-watch-hidden-port-charging-battery-strap"&gt;diagnostic port&lt;/a&gt; has been a mysterious part of the wearable lineup since its first model, but the new Series 7 officially ditches the six-pin port entirely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2RqFb0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/10/13/apple-watch-series-7-lacks-diagnostic-port/"&gt;First noted by &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the lack of a port can be seen when you remove the bottom strap from an Apple Watch Series 7 — the company has removed the hidden plate and the port behind it. Intended for internal use for diagnostics, the port wasn’t officially acknowledged on Apple’s website or documentation. But the diagnostic port briefly hinted at the possibility of expanding the Apple Watch with hardware accessories. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="suxWRo"&gt;The most famous of these &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/5/28/8676901/apple-watch-secret-port-charges-faster"&gt;was the Reserve Strap&lt;/a&gt;, which attempted to use the port for extending the battery life of the Apple Watch by incorporating extra batteries into a specially made band that would slot directly into the diagnostic port. The port actually offered &lt;em&gt;faster&lt;/em&gt; charging than Apple’s own magnetic cable, too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DmIBnjNnV8fTl2XKhGyRler4aJs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924623/Screen_Shot_2021_10_13_at_3.58.46_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Reserve Strap&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1xk1iH"&gt;Unfortunately, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/19/11460712/apple-watch-wristband-reserve-strap-accessory-loophole"&gt;Apple quickly blocked that capability&lt;/a&gt; and Reserve Strap (along with virtually every other attempt at harnessing the port for useful purposes). For the subsequent life span of the Apple Watch, it remained useful for its intended purpose: diagnostics for internal Apple use and repairs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xP1EOD"&gt;Of course, Apple still needs a way to do diagnostics on the Apple Watch, and appears to be replacing the mysterious port with an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690061/apple-watch-series-7-wireless-dock-data-transfer-port-free"&gt;even &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; mysterious 60.5GHz wireless module&lt;/a&gt; that pairs with a magnetic dock capable of local data transfer for internal use. That’s led to some speculation that Apple is using the Series 7 as a test bed for a future portless iPhone that could use similar technology to replace cables for connecting to a computer. But if years of the useless diagnostic port have taught us anything, it’s that sometimes there’s no greater meaning or utility to be found in proprietary diagnostic tools. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDvDWv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 13th, 5:17pm: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added MacRumors sourcing. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to use Safari extensions on your iPhone and iPad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZxdtPME6LdsDlwMyFZFoxseD6U0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69990647/akrales_210917_4760_0330.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OnAPJ1"&gt;One of the handiest types of software in anyone’s quiver is the browser extension: those cool little applets that let your browser do what you want it to do. And one of the nicest things about iOS 15 and iPadOS 15 is that you can now add extensions to the Safari browser. Even though this is a new feature that launched with the latest iOS version, there are already a number of useful extensions available for you to add.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YasHh9"&gt;What follows is a rundown on how to add extensions to your Safari app — while we’ve illustrated the process using an iPhone, you can follow the same basic directions with an iPad. We’ve also included a sampling of some extensions you can try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5WSYPV"&gt;How to add extensions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="PeMPW1"&gt;Tap on the Settings app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Asir3B"&gt;Scroll down to and select Safari &amp;gt; Extensions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TITo5t"&gt;Any extensions that you’ve already installed will be listed here. Tap on “More Extensions” if you’d like to see what’s available in the App Store. (You can also simply go to the App Store and search on “Safari Extensions.”)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In your settings, go to Safari &amp;amp;gt; Extensions to see your current extensions and get new ones." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3AD67CZ0fV_CpSxi9R5SxShgnpI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924238/makephotogallery.net_1634147611611.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;In your settings, go to Safari &amp;gt; Extensions to see your current extensions and get new ones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="8nqVoA"&gt;Once you’ve installed your first extension, you’ll see a little “puzzle piece” icon on the left side of Safari’s address bar. Tap that, and the menu that pops up will include your current extensions plus a “Manage Extensions” selection, which lets you toggle your extensions on and off.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s simple to install a new extension from the App Store." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FtOUJLXJMIdbD7qzlHOPGsr-JmQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924199/IMG_62BD37855789_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s simple to install a new extension from the App Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once installed, you can manage your extensions from the Safari address bar." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fQeRleRBeQ_EwGaNC_62lTg0tr4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22924201/IMG_04F0290642C7_1.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once installed, you can manage your extensions from the Safari address bar.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="s7Bn4f"&gt;Some extensions to try&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AGDDk3"&gt;This is a small sampling of some of the extensions that you can now access via the App Store. While there are not many extensions yet available (compared to the number of extensions for, say, Chrome), it’s a pretty safe bet that there will be lots more to come over the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EcWNOu"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/amplosion-redirect-amp-links/id1585734696"&gt;Amplosion&lt;/a&gt; ($2.99)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2ac8e"&gt;AMP, which is short for “Accelerated Mobile Pages,” is a web format created by Google to optimize search results for mobile browsers. However, if you’d rather not have Google tweaking the webpages you upload, you can use Amplosion to redirect the AMP links that show up in search results into normal mobile links. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gdDvT0"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/noir-dark-mode-for-safari/id1581140954"&gt;Noir&lt;/a&gt; ($2.99)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="QbnD0m"&gt;When you’re browsing at night and you’ve set your iPhone or iPad to dark mode, you will often hit a website that is bright enough to make your eyes water. Noir allows you to set a dark mode for all the websites you visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2kHdjr"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/1password-password-manager/id568903335"&gt;1Password&lt;/a&gt; (subscription needed)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LWSUOV"&gt;1Password is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722617/1password-sharing-link-google-docs-secure"&gt;well-known and respected password manager&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a 1Password user, there’s no question that you’re going to want to add this one to your mobile Safari app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mL3I9c"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/super-agent-for-safari/id1568262835#?platform=iphone"&gt;Super Agent for Safari&lt;/a&gt; (free)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6RVAs2"&gt;This handy extension automatically fills out a website’s cookie consent forms based on your preferences, which can save you a lot of time and irritation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="avc3ZM"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/web-inspector/id1584825745"&gt;Web Inspector&lt;/a&gt; (free)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iJnWA2"&gt;Something for developers: an app that lets you inspect the HTML coding of a website, modify it, debug it, and perform other essential tasks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fossil fuels are forecast to dry up, but not soon enough</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Climate Activists Continue Protests Outside White House" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T7re8xFu5pQwq8hEKR4zNqzPYqw=/0x18:6076x4069/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69990451/1346211976.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6MCYJn"&gt;This decade could see the beginning of the end of fossil fuels’ dominance as a source of energy, according to a new report from an agency that was formed to safeguard the world’s oil supply. It’s the latest signal that the global energy economy is on the verge of a dramatic transformation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWBf08"&gt;The International Energy Agency (IEA) came together in the midst of the 1970s oil crisis to monitor global supply and demand and foster cooperation on energy policy. For the first time, its annual &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/world-energy-outlook-2021"&gt;World Energy Outlook&lt;/a&gt; predicts that oil demand will reach a peak and begin to decline in all the future scenarios the agency examined — and it sees that as a good thing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="y8Q0KN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The cusp of a new era.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oOoaLb"&gt;In the most optimistic scenario, with countries standing by their leaders’ &lt;em&gt;pledges&lt;/em&gt; on climate change, fossil fuel use overall — which also includes coal and gas — will peak around 2025 and begin to fall soon after. In the most pessimistic scenario, which only takes into consideration existing &lt;em&gt;policies&lt;/em&gt; on climate change, fossil fuel use would likely stagnate over the next couple decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iSO9rh"&gt;“We stand on the cusp of a new era,” Mark Campanale, founder and executive chair of London-based nonprofit think tank Carbon Tracker Initiative, said in a &lt;a href="https://carbontracker.org/carbon-tracker-statement-on-ieas-weo/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; responding to the IEA’s new outlook. In its own &lt;a href="https://carbontracker.org/reports/2020-vision-why-you-should-see-the-fossil-fuel-peak-coming/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt;, Carbon Tracker predicted that demand for all fossil fuels would peak this decade as renewable energy gets cheaper and economies try to tackle climate change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IGomNH"&gt;The speed of the energy transition, however, is still too slow to keep the climate crisis at a level humans would be better able to cope with. Greenhouse gas emissions globally need to be essentially eliminated by around 2050, according to &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;leading climate scientists&lt;/a&gt;, in order to keep global warming from surpassing 1.5 degrees Celsius. The world has already reached &lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/media/press-release/2020-was-one-of-three-warmest-years-record"&gt;1.2 degrees&lt;/a&gt; Celsius of warming, and we’re seeing more catastrophic storms, floods, heatwaves, fires, and drought as a result. Breaching 1.5 degrees will trigger significantly worse conditions, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22617371/extreme-weather-science-attribution-un-report-climate-change"&gt;scientists expect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tXc4zr"&gt;More than fifty &lt;a href="https://www.climatewatchdata.org/net-zero-tracker"&gt;countries&lt;/a&gt; around the world have pledged to reach net zero greenhouse gas emissions by the middle of the century. Even with their commitments, global carbon dioxide emissions will only fall by about 40 percent by 2050, the IEA found, far short of what’s needed to keep warming limited to 1.5 degrees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3dhCw"&gt;A fault that more progressive environmental activists have found with net zero goals is that they might not aim to reach &lt;em&gt;absolute&lt;/em&gt; zero emissions. Instead, net zero pledges allow polluters to continue burning fossil fuels as long as they try to cancel out some of their emissions by turning to unreliable carbon offsets and still unproven technologies that capture CO2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CHR7MG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The stubborn incumbency of fossil fuels”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1QYmG0"&gt;“The world’s hugely encouraging clean energy momentum is running up against the stubborn incumbency of fossil fuels in our energy systems,” IEA executive director Fatih Birol said in a &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/world-energy-outlook-2021-shows-a-new-energy-economy-is-emerging-but-not-yet-quickly-enough-to-reach-net-zero-by-2050"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pkCODi"&gt;What’s more, the most optimistic scenario charted out by the IEA assumes that world leaders will be able to make good on mere climate promises. The problem is that the world’s biggest polluters, China and the US, &lt;a href="https://www.climatewatchdata.org/net-zero-tracker"&gt;don’t have actual laws yet&lt;/a&gt; in place to mandate fossil fuel pollution cuts reaching net zero. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09Px6L"&gt;The IEA called the Energy Outlook it published today a “handbook” for global climate negotiations scheduled to start at the end of the month. The United Nations climate summit, called COP26, marks a deadline for countries to raise their carbon-cutting commitments, five years after the adoption of the landmark Paris Agreement. There ought to be no new investments in any new fossil fuel projects if the world is to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement and stave off global heating beyond 1.5 degrees Celsius, the IEA determined in another groundbreaking &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-by-2050"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BhpPPE"&gt;“Governments, businesses, industry groups, and investors rely on analysis by the IEA to guide their energy decisions. They have the power to influence key stakeholders, and we are counting on them to do so,” May Boeve, executive director of the international environmental organization &lt;a href="http://350.org"&gt;350.org&lt;/a&gt;, said in a statement today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4bsBFE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Net-zero is not enough”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zsd0ZU"&gt;Hundreds of demonstrators, led by Indigenous activists, are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FightFossils/status/1447564005791473667"&gt;rallying&lt;/a&gt; in Washington, DC this week to demand not only a stop to new fossil fuel projects, or an emphasis on “net zero” pledges, but a stop to fossil fuel drilling in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QQPdxp"&gt;“[The IEA] report is an important milestone that hopefully sends a message ahead of these important climate negotiations, but net-zero is not enough,” Boeve said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJihnI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALp3dV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
