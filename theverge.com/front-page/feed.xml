    <title>Scuf’s Reflex for PS5 is a pricier, customizable take on the DualSense</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Scuf Reflex controller for PS5" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cSRzioh7lkTZslpM5SIUNbGwHTA=/0x0:7429x4953/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70240424/reflexhero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I adore the face buttons that don’t show the signature shape indicators.&lt;/em&gt; | Scuf&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7pKWAh"&gt;Scuf has introduced the Reflex lineup of customizable wireless controllers made for the PS5 and PC, consisting of three pricey controllers. Pricing starts at $199.99 for the Reflex, $229.99 for the Reflex Pro, going all the way up to $259.99 for the Reflex FPS, and each model has its own unique features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKFp64"&gt;Across the range, the Reflex is built upon Sony’s first-party DualSense controller board. That means it’ll receive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22600654/sony-ps5-beta-software-2-0-update-controller-ps-app-parents"&gt;updates through your console&lt;/a&gt; and that its feature set is almost identical to what you’d get from Sony’s controller (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22627413/scuf-instinct-pro-microsoft-xbox-controller-wireless-series-x-s-one-pc-features-price"&gt;Scuf’s Instinct Pro for Xbox&lt;/a&gt; was built this way, too, mirroring Microsoft’s first-party controller). The Scuf Reflex is rechargeable and supports USB-C charging, and it has a mute button and features a touchpad — all features it shares in common with the DualSense. The Scuf Reflex and Reflex Pro (but not the Reflex FPS) feature haptics and Sony’s signature adaptive rear triggers, which can adjust the amount of tension you feel contextually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhgkGN"&gt;So, what does the $120 (or higher) premium for Scuf’s Reflex over the DualSense get you? It depends on which of the controllers you buy. All of them come bearing several differences that alter the DualSense’s aesthetic and functionality, for starters. The faceplate can be removed and swapped with a different one (more colors will come in “the weeks and months” following launch, but black is the only color available for now). You’ll also be able to purchase different colors of anti-friction rings that can be installed around the analog sticks that cushion their movement. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The different colors of the Scuf Reflex" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/unId5StdjZj7Zs_FQlK-eLBP3fE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060633/reflexcolors.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Scuf&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Someday, all of these face plates will be available for purchase, though black is the only one coming at launch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5DKBSo"&gt;All three models of the Scuf Reflex feature four rear paddles that can be customized. The controllers can store up to three profiles, letting you cycle between up to 12 unique paddle bindings, which is handy if you swap between game genres. In the box with each controller, you’ll get a few thumbsticks that can be replaced with the stock sticks: long, short, domed, and concave. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASlDZj"&gt;Both the Reflex Pro and Reflex FPS have a “high-performance” grip around their back to make them easier to hold. The Reflex FPS is the only one of the bunch that features instant triggers, which are Scuf’s feature that, upon toggling some switches on the rear of the controller, significantly shortens the pull action. This feature (also present on the Xbox-specific Instinct Pro) makes triggers feel more like bouncy mouse clicks, and that shorter pull could lead to faster actuation to let you get the jump on your opponents. As mentioned before, the Reflex FPS lacks haptics and adaptive triggers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yPRwLr"&gt;I’ve yet to actually get my hands on any of the Reflex controllers, but I’m excited that there’s finally a third-party wireless alternative to Sony’s DualSense coming to market. Though, it’s tough to call it an alternative when it costs so much more. But if you’re in the crowd of people who wish Sony would bring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21571413/sony-dualshock-4-back-button-attachment-ps4-ps5-controller-playstation"&gt;its affordable Back Button Attachment from the PS4 days&lt;/a&gt; to the PS5, well, this might be your only solution for now.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel is taking its self-driving company Mobileye public in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/O2Q6tu2a_cvJkqitbNb99cENDiI=/129x0:1520x927/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70240232/mobileye_av_nyc_intel_24.jpg.rendition.intel.web.1648.927.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SDS4Ms"&gt;Intel announced that it will take public its self-driving technology company Mobileye, the Israeli company it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/13/14906304/intel-mobileye-acquisition-self-driving-cars"&gt;acquired for $15.3 billion&lt;/a&gt; in 2017. The chipmaker said that by listing Mobileye’s shares on the stock market, it hopes to unlock more value for Intel’s shareholders. Intel will remain the majority shareholder in Mobileye. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ualCdf"&gt;In a statement, Intel heralded its acquisition of the company as a noteworthy success, noting that Mobileye’s revenue in 2021 was 40 percent higher than the previous year. An IPO “provides the best opportunity to build on Mobileye’s track record for innovation and unlock value for shareholders,” Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="urJIrV"&gt;The news comes as a number of electric and autonomous vehicle companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763180/aurora-av-spac-merger-nasdaq-publicly-traded-urmson"&gt;have gone public in recent months&lt;/a&gt;, with varying levels of success. Despite this wave of interest in the public markets, the AV industry has struggled with overinflated expectations, missed deadlines, shuttered businesses, and a host of technological challenges. Still, many companies have said they are on the cusp of launching commercial businesses after years of testing and research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pxejIR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Founded in Jerusalem in 1999 by Amnon Shashua and Ziv Aviram&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W3LXln"&gt;Founded in Jerusalem in 1999 by Amnon Shashua and Ziv Aviram, the company develops systems and chips to help vehicles navigate autonomously and provide warnings for collisions. Tesla originally used Mobileye chips for its Autopilot system but &lt;a href="http://www.recode.net/2016/7/26/12285930/tesla-mobileye-self-driving-cars"&gt;severed ties with the company after a fatal accident&lt;/a&gt; where Tesla claims Mobileye’s technology was unable to distinguish between a laterally crossing truck and the sky behind it. Its EyeQ4 chip is currently used in the NIO ES6 and ES8, Nissan’s ProPilot 2.0, VW’s Travel Assistant in the Passat and Golf, the Ford Mustang Mach-E, as well as the F-150 truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4cBph"&gt;Mobileye is currently working on four different products that offer varying levels of automation, including an advanced driver assist system (ADAS) that it currently supplies to 25 companies and a “premium” ADAS that will launch with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346358/geely-electric-vehicle-brand-zeekr-china"&gt;Zeekr&lt;/a&gt;, an electric vehicle brand owned by China’s Geely. Neither ADAS system will include lidar, the sensor that uses lasers to determine the real-time location of objects on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hrqrSi"&gt;Mobileye’s other two products will use lidar and are more advanced in their automation technology. Mobileye Drive is a self-driving system that utilizes the companies’ EyeQ system-on-a-chip, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/1/13791848/delphi-mobileye-self-driving-car-pittsburgh-intel-maps"&gt;data crowdsourcing program called the Road Experience Management&lt;/a&gt;, or REM, which uses real-time data from Mobileye-equipped vehicles to build out a global 3D map. This product will be used by customers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22375759/intel-mobileye-udelv-autonomous-vehicle-delivery-2023"&gt;Udelv&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.transdev.com/en/press-release/mobileye-transdev-ats-lohr-autonomous-shuttles/"&gt;Transdev, Lohr&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/schaeffler-and-mobileye-to-industrialize-self-driving-shuttles/"&gt;Schaeffler&lt;/a&gt; for applications like autonomous delivery vehicles and self-driving shuttles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eCPwGB"&gt;Mobileye also aspires to operate its own robotaxis, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22659366/intel-mobileye-robotaxi-germany-sixt-moovit"&gt;recently announcing&lt;/a&gt; plans to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service in Germany in 2022. It also said it will&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585338/intel-mobileye-autonomous-vehicle-av-testing-nyc"&gt; test its vehicles in New York City&lt;/a&gt;, a notoriously dense and difficult place to test AVs, but is still negotiating with local regulators for permission. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jessica Rosenworcel confirmed by Senate to lead the FCC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senate Commerce Committee Hearing On FCC Oversight" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IVfAq_9vu0lwp_erEB_n8PydtTk=/0x0:4574x3049/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70240230/1222449901.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lee0ZP"&gt;On Tuesday, the Senate voted 68 to 31 to confirm Jessica Rosenworcel’s re-appointment to the Federal Communications Commission, putting her in place to be the first permanent chair of the agency under President Biden. Rosenworcel will also be the first female chair &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/commissioners-1934-present"&gt;in the 86-year history of the FCC&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UkpSLy"&gt;The vote officially confirmed Rosenworcel’s reappointment as FCC commissioner, but with Senate approval in place, it makes her formal ascension to chair all but certain. In a speech announcing the floor vote, Majority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-NY) called Rosenworcel “a remarkable, highly experienced and historic nominee.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lIvPY3"&gt;“It’s the honor of my lifetime to lead the @FCC and serve as the first permanent female Chair,” said Rosenworcel &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JRosenworcelFCC/status/1468271741315207177"&gt;in a tweet after the vote&lt;/a&gt;. “There’s work to do to make sure modern communications reach everyone, everywhere. Now let’s get to it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CFhiPk"&gt;As chair, Rosenworcel is expected to place a particular emphasis on broadband access, working to expand high-speed internet coverage in underserved areas. In a Vergecast interview in 2020, she placed particular emphasis on the “homework gap” caused as schools move online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="78oUEf"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.megaphone.fm/VMP8019458570" style="border: 0; width: 100%; height: 200px;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xiRdjs"&gt;“We need a nationwide plan for addressing the digital divide,” Rosenworcel said at the time. “As a nation, we need a policy that addresses how we’re going to connect all of us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1YXrR"&gt;Rosenworcel will be taking the reins amid an extended deadlock at the commission, which has been without a fifth commissioner — and as a result, without a Democratic majority — since President Biden took office. As a result, the FCC has been unable to take action on net neutrality, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321995/net-neutrality-ed-markey-save-the-internet-open-ajit-pai-rosenworcel"&gt;widely anticipated in the wake of the election&lt;/a&gt;. In October, Biden nominated longtime net neutrality advocate Gigi Sohn for the fifth seat, but she has generated significant opposition from Republicans and may not receive a full Senate vote until after the new year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8uJCJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12:39PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Included Rosenworcel statement.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An Amazon server outage is causing problems for Alexa, Ring, Disney Plus, and others</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration an Amazon Web Services logo seen..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EVu4i0c_YWVLUdA-WvFOOWrbvps=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70240006/1230840274.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HsxliB"&gt;Problems with some Amazon Web Services cloud servers are causing slow loading or failures for significant chunks of the internet. Amazon’s widespread network of data centers powers many of the things you interact with online, including this website, so as we’ve seen in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/25/21719396/amazon-web-services-aws-outage-down-internet"&gt;previous&lt;/a&gt; AWS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/28/14765042/amazon-s3-outage-causing-trouble"&gt;outage incidents&lt;/a&gt;, any problem has massive rippling effects. People started noticing problems at around 10:45AM ET. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yicS6U"&gt;There are reports of outages for Disney Plus streaming and games like &lt;em&gt;PUBG, League of Legends,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Valorant.&lt;/em&gt; We’ve also noticed some problems accessing &lt;a href="http://Amazon.com"&gt;Amazon.com&lt;/a&gt; and other Amazon products like the Alexa AI assistant, Kindle ebooks, Amazon Music, Chime, or Ring security cameras. The &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/"&gt;DownDetector&lt;/a&gt; list of services with spikes in their outage reports runs off nearly any recognizable name: Tinder, Roku, Coinbase, both Cash App and Venmo, and the list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hERNiN"&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29473630"&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/rb226w/aws_outage/"&gt;network admins&lt;/a&gt; everywhere about errors connecting to Amazon’s instances and the AWS Management Console that controls their access to the servers. Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://status.aws.amazon.com/"&gt;official status page&lt;/a&gt; has been updated with messages confirming the outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1dmcwH"&gt;8:49 AM PST We are experiencing elevated error rates for EC2 APIs in the US-EAST-1 region. We have identified root cause and we are actively working towards recovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K2wNqI"&gt;We are experiencing API and console issues in the US-EAST-1 Region. We have identified root cause and we are actively working towards recovery. This issue is affecting the global console landing page, which is also hosted in US-EAST-1. Customers may be able to access region-specific consoles going to https://console.aws.amazon.com/. So, to access the US-WEST-2 console, try https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xyKq2j"&gt;It appears that the problems are focused on the US-EAST-1 AWS region hosted in Virginia, so users elsewhere may not see as many issues, and even if you’re affected, it could manifest as slightly slower loading while the network reroutes your requests somewhere else. Contacted for comment, Amazon pointed to the updates on its status page, which indicate the company is “actively working towards recovery.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fqa8R3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 7th, 12PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added additional information about outage and Amazon’s current status.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer made a $60 RGB cooling fan with MagSafe for your iPhone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ksPr8klWvsl6hkeKkUprWCzacuI=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70240061/https___hybrismediaprod.blob.core.windows.net_sys_master_phoenix_images_container_h7e_h83_9276684894238_211207_Phone_Cooler_Chroma_MagSafe_Compatible_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2r578u"&gt;Razer has announced its latest smartphone accessory: &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmobile-accessories%2Frazer-phone-cooler-chroma&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Razer Phone Cooler Chroma&lt;/a&gt;, an RGB-light infused cooling fan for your iPhone or Android device that’s designed to help cool down your phone during intense gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CeTtcV"&gt;The Cooler Chroma fan &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fmobile-accessories%2Frazer-phone-cooler-chroma%2FRC21-01790100-R3M1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;comes in two versions&lt;/a&gt;, both of which cost $59.99: a magnetic model that’s compatible with Apple’s MagSafe accessory system that snaps right onto the back of your iPhone, and a model with a “universal clamp” for Android devices or iPhones without MagSafe. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TFBbEOQ51D-ev0AiVj0ct1kVGOo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070214/Screen_Shot_2021_12_07_at_11.38.54_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IB7Fiq"&gt;Despite its mobile-focused design, the Cooler Chroma fan doesn’t seem to have a built-in battery, meaning that you’ll need to plug it into a USB-C power source when you want to use it (which will likely limit how useful it’ll actually be for gaming on the go). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZ6I4D"&gt;As for the actual cooling properties of the Cooler Chroma, Razer notes that it features a seven-blade fan that spins at up to 6400 RPM, a thermoelectric cooler, and an aluminum heat sink to siphon off excess heat from your phone. There are also 12 customizable RGB lights, of course, because it’s a gaming accessory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEJHya"&gt;The Razer Phone Cooler Chroma is available now from Razer’s website. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap’s first AR Spectacles are an ambitious, impractical start</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aQtRUhKra793wcYWABL9kXZcCG0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70239915/alopez_211129_4909_0014.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Mainstream AR glasses are still years away&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="YcwMIw"&gt;It doesn’t take long to realize why Snap’s first true AR glasses aren’t for sale. The overall design is the highest quality of any standalone AR eyewear I’ve tried, and they make it easy to quickly jump into a variety of augmented-reality experiences, from a multiplayer game to a virtual art installation. But the first pair I was handed during a recent demo overheated after about 10 minutes, and the displays are so small that I wouldn’t want to look through them for a long period of time, even if the battery allowed for it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wiTww"&gt;Snap is aware of the limitations. Instead of releasing these glasses publicly, it’s treating this generation of Spectacles like a private beta. The company has given out pairs to hundreds of its AR creators since the glasses were announced in May and has recently made a few notable software updates based on user feedback. “It was really just about getting the technology out there in the hands of actual people and doing it in a way that would allow us to maximize our learning from their experiences of using it,” Bobby Murphy, Snap’s co-founder and chief technology officer, says of the rollout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqVNla"&gt;After months of asking for a demo, Snap invited me and a handful of other journalists to try them in conjunction with &lt;a href="https://lensfest.live"&gt;Lens Fest&lt;/a&gt;, Snap’s annual AR creator conference being held virtually this week. Guided by Snap employees in a Los Angeles backyard, I tried a wide range of AR experiences in the glasses, including a zombie chase, a pong game, Solar System projection, and an interactive art piece that utilized basic hand tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="01TWQx"&gt;The demoes showed me that Snap has an ambitious, long-term vision for where AR is headed. The hardware also highlighted the technical limitations keeping mainstream AR glasses at bay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/83FHfR29GHhitbtjuiuE4hllPYQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060788/alopez_211129_4909_0017.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WxihI6"&gt;Like past versions, these AR Spectacles boast a bold design. The narrow, sharp-edged frame has a similar aesthetic to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20976539/tesla-cybertruck-test-drive-electric-truck-pickup-video-features-price-elon-musk"&gt;Tesla’s Cybertruck&lt;/a&gt;, something that is not lost on Snap’s product designers, and they come with a sturdy, magnetized case that can be turned into a charging stand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Six0Pe"&gt;The glasses are light to wear, with flexible sides that can bend out from the head enough to accommodate prescription glasses underneath. (Prescription lenses are available to AR creators &lt;a href="https://www.spectacles.com/creatorform"&gt;who apply&lt;/a&gt; and receive a pair.) They include stereo speakers, onboard Wi-Fi, a USB-C port for charging, and two front-facing cameras for capturing video and detecting surfaces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQqYEW"&gt;The biggest limitation I noticed was the battery, which lasts for only 30 minutes of use. Snap did not try to hide this fact and had multiple pairs ready on standby to swap out for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bFw1vpoveC3rzomUOvIuSdRum7k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060786/alopez_211129_4909_0015.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XHQVuc"&gt;The AR effects, which Snap calls Lenses, are projected by a pair of dual waveguide displays that sync with Snapchat on a paired mobile phone. Besides the battery, the main drawback to these Spectacles is the small size of the displays, which covers roughly half of the physical lenses. Due to the small field of view, the AR effects I tried looked better after the fact in their full size on a phone screen, rather than in the actual glasses. Even still, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447150/snap-waveoptics-acquisition-500m-spectacles-waveguides"&gt;WaveOptics waveguides&lt;/a&gt; were surprisingly rich in color and clarity. The displays’ 2,000 nits of brightness means they are clearly visible in sunlight, a tradeoff that severely impacts battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7H9p16"&gt;Since Snap announced these Spectacles &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445481/snap-spectacles-ar-augmented-reality-announced"&gt;earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, it has added some new software improvements. To maximize battery life, an endurance mode automatically turns off the displays when an AR Lens, such as a scavenger hunt game, is running but not actively being used. Lenses can be tailored to specific locations based on a GPS radius. A feature coming soon called Custom Landmarkers will let people overlay Lenses onto local landmarks persistently for others wearing Spectacles to see. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8j1L82"&gt;Another new software update brings Connected Lenses to Spectacles, letting multiple pairs interact with the same Lens when sharing a Wi-Fi network. I tried a couple of basic multiplayer games with a Snap AR creator named Aidan Wolf, including one he made that lets you shoot orbs of energy at your opponent with the capture button on the side of the frame. The pairing system still needs work since syncing our glasses to play the game took a couple of tries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mEnf5reRxNrtBc5ODWV-bLrCTFI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060793/alopez_211129_4909_0022.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NcGVAv"&gt;None of the Lenses I tried blew me away. But a few showed me the promise of how compelling AR glasses will be once the hardware is more advanced. Rudimentary hand tracking was limited to one Lens I tried that let me cue different parts of a moving art piece with specific gestures. Assuming hand tracking gets better over time, I can see it being a key way to control the glasses. In one of the other more impressive experiences, I placed persistent location markers around the backyard and then raced through them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7YzMbm"&gt;Most of the Lenses I tried felt like the basic proofs of concept I’ve seen in other AR headsets over the years and not experiences that would compel me to buy these glasses if they were available for purchase. But for glasses that have been in the wild for less than a year, it’s clear that creators will dream up interesting Lenses as the software and future hardware gets better. I’ve seen a few early concepts online that are compelling, including &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dmvrg/status/1450297362551824384"&gt;exercise games&lt;/a&gt;, utility use cases like &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/V_Kurbatov/status/1465311637771071490"&gt;seeing the city you’re in while traveling&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gP8fTgs8-08"&gt;AR food menus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpERRE"&gt;Here are a few Lenses I captured during my demo:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="gpfaMJ"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="AR_Spectacles_Demo_Zombie|105119" data-volume-uuid="a59b9653f" data-volume-id="105119" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-267" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="EDi1aF"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="AR_Spectacles_Demo_fetch|105118" data-volume-uuid="0f380dec5" data-volume-id="105118" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-428" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="MRRJRN"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="AR_Spectacles_Demo_Solar|105120" data-volume-uuid="43b7d991f" data-volume-id="105120" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-32" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qd4Grl"&gt;The glasses’ main visual interface is called the Lens Carousel. A touchpad on the side of the frame uses flick gestures to navigate in and out of Lenses, view recorded footage, and send it to Snapchat friends without removing the glasses. You can also use your voice to cue a Lens. Ways of controlling future Spectacles will likely include eye-tracking and more robust hand tracking — technologies Snap is already exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ODS4kw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We fully understand that this is still a number of years away”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nvbesa"&gt;A dedicated button on the side of the Spectacles frame is for Scan, Snap’s visual search feature that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22642017/snapchat-scan-feature-ar-camera-visual-search"&gt;recently introduced in the main Snapchat app&lt;/a&gt;. I used it to scan a plant on a table and my glasses recommended a few plant-related Lenses to try. Like Scan in Snapchat, its functionality and ability to recognize objects is fairly limited for now. But if it continues to get better, I could see Scan being a staple feature for Spectacles in the years to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eVLN7G"&gt;Meanwhile, the tech powering Lenses is continuing to get more advanced. At Lens Fest this week, Snap is announcing a slew of new tools for making Lenses smarter, including a library of music from the top music labels and the ability to pull in real-time information from outside partners like the crypto trading platform FTX, Accuweather, and iTranslate. A new real-world physics engine and software Snap calls World Mesh makes Lenses interact more naturally with the world by moving with the laws of gravity, reacting to real surfaces, and understanding the depth of a scene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XOgjLV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10906155"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AotPEx"&gt;Like Meta, Snap sees AR glasses as the future of computing. “We’ve been very interested in and invested in AR for a number of years now because we view AR as the capacity to perceive the world and render digital experiences in much the same way that we naturally observe and engage with our surroundings as people,” Bobby Murphy tells me. “And I think this is really in stark contrast to the way that we use a lot of technology today.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="G1l3Ph"&gt;&lt;q&gt;An “insane distribution system of augmented reality”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qOGtFs"&gt;Murphy won’t say when AR Spectacles will be ready to sell publicly, but Meta and other tech companies have signaled that consumer-ready AR eyewear isn’t coming any time soon. “We fully understand that this is still a number of years away,” Murphy says, citing battery and display technology as the two key limitations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUaMWU"&gt;While the tech to make quality AR glasses a reality is still being developed, Snap is already betting its future on AR in the mobile phone era. According to Murphy, Snap’s “main priority now as a company is to really support and empower our partners and our community to be as successful as they can be through AR.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CjKGv4k-xECwSoT4ztDhlL2Wubg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23060789/alopez_211129_4909_0018.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E5h7XG"&gt;Snap claims to have over 250,000 Lens Creators who have collectively made 2.5 million Lenses that have been viewed a staggering 3.5 &lt;em&gt;trillion&lt;/em&gt; times. 300 creators have a made a Lens that's been viewed over one billion times. “We’re building this really insane distribution system of augmented reality that doesn’t exist anywhere else,” says Sophia Dominguez, Snap’s head of AR platform partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYrJcI"&gt;Now the company is starting to focus on ways to help Lens Creators make money, including a new marketplace that lets app developers using Snap’s camera technology pay creators directly to use their Lenses. Viewers of a Lens can send its creator an in-app gift, which they can then redeem for real money. And for the first time, a Lens can include a link to a website, allowing a creator to link to something like an online store directly from AR.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVsnbW"&gt;What about letting users pay for Lenses directly? “It’s something we’ve certainly given thought to,” says Murphy. He calls NFTs a “very, very fascinating space” and “a good example of digital assets [and] digital art having a kind of a real, tangible value.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="LTglDu"&gt;Snap doesn’t like to talk about its future product roadmap but Murphy is clear that “new updates to our hardware roadmap” will keep coming “fairly often.” In the meantime, it’s making an effort to court AR creators long before its glasses are ready for primetime. While there’s no guarantee that Snap will be a major player when the tech is finally ready, for now it has a head start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xp4Z2n"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bungie celebrates its 30th Anniversary in Destiny 2 with off-brand Halo gear</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QwG-w7IB3RcrvNu27kCUwUNQtks=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70239813/2021_30th_Press_Kit_Large_Gear_08.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="obF5tQ"&gt;A lot is happening in the world of &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; today. Bungie is celebrating its 30th Anniversary inside &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;, with a big content drop that includes &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-like guns. A trailer for &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;’s new Bungie 30th Anniversary pack shows off a Magnum-like sidearm in &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;, alongside a Battle Rifle-like pulse rifle in the looter shooter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mg6sym"&gt;Both guns appear to look and feel like the original &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; weapons, but there’s no mention of an official crossover with Microsoft anywhere. It doesn’t appear that Bungie secured the official rights from Microsoft to put the actual &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; guns it originally created in &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; and has instead done a good job at producing replicas that nod to the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FgiAih"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Bungie just revealed a Halo-like Battle Rifle and Magnum are coming to Destiny 2 today, to celebrate 30 years of Bungie   &lt;a href="https://t.co/xkSUwpTtPZ"&gt;https://t.co/xkSUwpTtPZ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/4fdaR7yrMr"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4fdaR7yrMr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1468236173646737422?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vBg9Hi"&gt;“Reunite with an Exotic Sidearm that you may recognize from adventures long ago,” reads a &lt;a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/Direct/Anniversary?ciid=50638"&gt;description on Bungie’s website&lt;/a&gt; for the Magnum-like gun. “It led you to glory then and it will do so again.” The exotic sidearm is called Forerunner, and the Battle Rifle-like weapon is named BxR-55 Battler. There’s even armor for the Titan that includes a Needler-style shoulder pad, and armor for the warlock that features the &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; ring. The &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt;-like loot doesn’t even require Destiny 2 players to own the 30th Anniversary pack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tw7o5K"&gt;The 30th Anniversary pack also includes a new six-person activity (which is separately free to all players) with armor and weapons, the grasp of avarice dungeon, and the return of the infamous Gjallarhorn rocket launcher. Bungie is also bringing back classic weapons like the Matador 64, Eyasluna, and 1000-Yard Stare, which can be earned with the 30th Anniversary pack, alongside some heavy changes to the player-vs-player sandbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ft7wsW"&gt;If that’s not enough nostalgia for Bungie’s classic games, there’s even a Myth Claymore (&lt;em&gt;Myth&lt;/em&gt;) and Marathon (&lt;em&gt;Marathon&lt;/em&gt;) armor ornament set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KzSPQS4eRkj5kih3ZSHBeGyJwcg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070058/2021_30th_Press_Kit_Large_Gear_16.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bungie&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2’s new exotic sidearm looks like Halo’s Magnum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QXo07d4JaHVAPuQQ5GjJkDMJO2U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23070108/2021_30th_Press_Kit_Large_NPC_01.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new space horse.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TcUpoZ"&gt;There’s even a space horse, an NPC that will be housed inside the giant loot cave where players will earn some of today’s new weapons and armor. The mystical space horse was first spotted in &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2 &lt;/em&gt;during Season of the Drifter, and it has some links to the Nine, a mysterious faction inside &lt;em&gt;Destiny’s &lt;/em&gt;universe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iw5DAq"&gt;Combined with some great-looking armor, cosmetics, and ornaments, it feels like &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2 &lt;/em&gt;is getting a big injection of content midway through a season that leads to the next big expansion: &lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt;. The game’s biggest expansion in years, &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2: The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639582/destiny-2-the-witch-queen-expansion-release-date-gjallarhorn"&gt;will launch on February 22nd&lt;/a&gt;. It will see players finally face Savathûn, and continue the story of the sci-fi space series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Bk9co"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt; expansion will also feature a new location, Savathûn’s Throne World, alongside important changes to existing subclasses, campaign content, weapons, armor, and a new raid. The 30th Anniversary pack should hopefully hold players over until February, in what’s an unusually long season for &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discord’s new Premium Memberships let creators monetize servers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D3sfgjAj-V2HnOoo2-Si6oKhZow=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70239712/acastro_200318_1777_discord_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2m7f91"&gt;Discord is starting to test a new Premium Memberships feature that will allow creators to monetize their servers. An initial pilot is going live today with around 10 creators who will pave the way for Discord’s 150 million monthly active users to pay to access a range of channels or servers and support creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FLqIkq"&gt;Premium Memberships offer what a number of creators have already been experimenting with: a way to offer more content or access to community members. Discord communities will be able to create tiered perks, view analytics on member engagement, and lock channels or even entire servers to paying subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/27PZsyf0pFGkRdTb2zrC7pXgdmU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069823/Home.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Discord&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discord’s new Premium Memberships include tiers for community servers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="stRGLM"&gt;“We see Discord becoming a home for more creators and communities through products like Premium Memberships,” explains Sumeet Vaidya, director of engineering at Discord, in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “By providing tools that let community creators earn money, more of them will run healthy engaged communities for longer periods of time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cqg2M"&gt;While Discord already has a number of integrations with Patreon, YouTube, Twitch, and other services that let subscribers on other platforms get special perks or privileges in Discord servers, Premium Memberships will be fully native to Discord. That means Discord also sets the terms of payments directly, and it has picked a 90 / 10 split with creators, allowing Discord communities to keep 90 percent of all revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qetlgv"&gt;“We want to make sure that creators are able to make as much money as possible, while also making sure that if creators are successful Discord is also making some money which makes sure Discord is successful too,” says Vaidya. “This was the most favorable split we could think of, to make sure both parties are invested in the long run.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FbZJxF"&gt;It’s not clear how this revenue split will work if people subscribe on mobile, though. Apple and Google take a cut of subscriptions and in-app purchases like this, and right now Discord is only enabling this through its desktop and browser clients.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qlmFaJhF2-ClS6HxO2he2vl8cns=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23069825/Basic_Info.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Discord&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Creators will be able to set different membership levels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A welcome message for Discord Premium Memberships.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6eunEW"&gt;So what do you get if you opt for a Premium Membership to a Discord server? That’s really up to creators, and it’s something Discord is looking to its communities to help shape these memberships during this trial phase. There are already journalists, professional map makers, and other communities monetizing their Discord servers, with many using the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22356682/discord-stage-channels-clubhouse-like-feature-voice"&gt;Clubhouse-like Stage Channels audio features&lt;/a&gt; to provide a small and more intimate community or exclusive perks for subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="chpQLn"&gt;It’s clear Discord saw this emerging trend and wanted to make it a lot more streamlined, native to its platform, and easier for everyone involved. While you might associate Discord subscriber-only channels with Twitch streamers or Patreon subscriptions, Discord is working with a diverse set of communities to test Premium Memberships and make them accessible for both creators and Discord users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBoAw1"&gt;Premium Membership channels will have a small blue star next to them, and if you try to access them, you’ll be offered the tiers of access that creators have set. In the coming weeks you might see Discord community servers testing this new feature, and it’s something that will expand to more communities next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05dzTW"&gt;“This is one of our most-requested features from creators,” reveals Vaidya. “While it’s something that many creators already do through third parties, this is the first time they’ll be able to do it natively on Discord.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HOJzJq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, December 7th 11:15AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with details about Discord testing this only on desktop and browser for now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s favorite guilty pleasures</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hVQyZyHsNgrL9DbfoLZwZceztd4=/0x200:1200x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70239637/ember_cup_with_phone.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: Ember Technologies&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aeNrDm"&gt;We all have stuff that we’ve bought ourselves — or asked others to buy for us — that makes us happy, even if we suspect our friends may not understand why it’s so great. It could be a $100-plus coffee cup that keeps your liquid at the exact right temperature. Or a video game that you’ve been playing for years. Or a hair styler that is way expensive but would make you look fabulous.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0tqkN"&gt;We asked the staff of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; what some of their guilty pleasures are, and the braver among us volunteered some answers. Here they are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zIwJem"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.geappliances.com/appliance/GE-Profile-Opal-2-0-Nugget-Ice-Maker-with-Side-Tank-XPIO13SCSS"&gt;GE Opal 2.0 ice machine&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Maut8q"&gt;I’m hesitant to call it a “guilty” pleasure because I have used this $550 (or more) GE Opal 2.0 ice machine every day for nearly a full year and not once have I felt guilt about spending such an obscene amount of cash on a kitchen gadget that does exactly one thing. But the GE Opal gives me the “good” ice, alternatively known as “nugget” or “Sonic” ice. Besides being crucial for authentic Tiki drinks, this ice just feels like it classes up every drink it touches. I stopped buying iced coffee elsewhere because mine always just came out fancier — and seemingly tastier. Juice feels luxurious poured over these chewy little ice nugs. Sodas sparkle when faced with so much surface area. Even a glass of water feels like it’s more expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSLWHb"&gt;The GE Opal costs $550 if you’re lucky (it goes on sale often) but usually retails for $579 to $679. It comes with Bluetooth and an atrocious app I closed immediately after opening. It’s noisy — the churn of ice being made is providing a background rhythm even as I type this. But every day I use this machine I feel a little trill of joy — so it might not be a guilty pleasure for me, but depending on your love of beverages, mileage will vary. &lt;em&gt;—Alex Cranz, managing editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6qQY6d"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10905059"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="1dbMgX"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JmsFpY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://drinkspindrift.com/drinks/orange-mango-sparkling-water/"&gt;Spindrift sparkling water&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="AkhYmk"&gt;I’m obsessed with the orange mango flavor of Spindrift sparkling water. It tastes kind of like orange soda but without all of the sugar, and I find it extremely refreshing. If I think about it too much, sparkling water feels like a waste of money. But every week when I go to the grocery store, a case of the delicious Spindrift just happens to end up in my cart. &lt;em&gt;—Jay Peters, news writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nWf1yB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10905143"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Rsp0Kv"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dTPZVH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://nerf.hasbro.com/en-us/product/nerf-halo-bulldog-sg-dart-blaster-pump-action-rotating-10-dart-drum-tactical-rails-10-nerf-darts-skin-unlock-code:1025C4C0-4F78-41BD-AAC4-4AA5B3ED58BC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;Nerf Bulldog SG Dart Blaster&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gY3lTR"&gt;Don’t let the gray hairs, mortgage, spouse, and two cats fool you — I am a child. A recent example is my impulsive purchase of two &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NERF-Pump-Action-Rotating-Tactical-Official/dp/B08SMQLYJW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo &lt;/em&gt;Nerf Bulldog SG Dart Blasters&lt;/a&gt; from a lightning deal during the Black Friday / Cyber Monday weekend. I usually refrain from buying into the hype cycle of new game releases, but I have been getting back into &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; in a big way since the multiplayer beta launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4JlfjR"&gt;As for the Nerf, the pump-action loading and included in-game weapon skin hooked me. I got one for myself and one for my brother-in-law, ensuring I have a partner in crime. We immediately tested them on each other — they do sting a bit — before turning our aim to my wife’s Christmas decorations (that poor snowman). Then we hopped into some multiplayer matches, giggling as we hunted down shotguns just to see our cool digital Nerf guns. Now I want the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/NERF-NER-Halo-MA40/dp/B08486XL7R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MA40 assault rifle&lt;/a&gt; to go with it, so I can start every match in &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; with another silly, guilty pleasure purchase straight from IRL. &lt;em&gt;—Antonio G. Di Benedetto, commerce writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yrbY7a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10905435"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="nQSjD9"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="29evVB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dyson.com%2Fhair-care%2Fhair-stylers%2Fairwrap%2Fcomplete-nickel-fuchsia&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22820219%2Fguilty-pleasures-ice-halo-dyson-sims" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dyson Airwrap Complete styler&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ApCJtT"&gt;I’ve attended a few weddings in the “Before Times” where I had to style my hair with a curling iron like a grown-up, and not default to my usual ponytail. I watched countless YouTube videos and practiced a bunch, but each attempt was anxiety-inducing. After all, there is no Control-Alt-Z or edit button to undo the wrong curl, especially when you’re working with a hot piece of equipment and under time pressures. In those anxious moments, the $550 Dyson Airwrap styler doesn’t seem like &lt;em&gt;such &lt;/em&gt;a ridiculous splurge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMjQ6H"&gt;The Airwrap styler uses Dyson’s vacuum technology to create a vortex that automatically wraps your hair around the styling barrel or brush. This eliminates the confusion over which direction to twist the barrel (which is half the battle) and makes it easier to style the hair at the back of your head. My guilty pleasure just involves checking in on this product’s price (no change or even more expensive) and availability (mostly sold out) every now and then. While I can’t guarantee I will use this tool regularly enough to justify its cost, at least I would have no excuse for turning up in a ponytail again.  &lt;em&gt;—Gloria Sin, reviewer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uFyMWh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10905921"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="NAHPbJ"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FafVHk"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22277238/dji-mini-2-drone-review-price-specs-features"&gt;DJI Mini 2 drone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="u2giDX"&gt;I am a drone pilot. That’s what I tell myself every time I purchase a new drone. And maybe six times a year, it’s vaguely true. I love flying and I love drones, but I definitely did not need to purchase the $449 DJI Mini 2. When I sold my DJI Mavic Pro, just a couple years after buying that one to upgrade a Phantom 3 Pro I never used, I told myself I would wait. Of course I didn’t listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3xltw"&gt;Like I told my friend Vjeran Pavic, who is an &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; photographer and videographer and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/vjeran-pavic"&gt;reviews drones like a pro&lt;/a&gt;, I feel kind of naked without one now. Who knows when there might be something amazing happening in my neighborhood and I can just toss a drone up in the air for a look? (Never mind that I’ll undoubtedly have to spend half an hour recharging batteries and possibly updating firmware and databases first.) I &lt;em&gt;totally&lt;/em&gt; clocked those kids launching illegal fireworks in my neighborhood this summer, and it reminded me of fond memories reading &lt;em&gt;Harriet the Spy&lt;/em&gt; growing up. I’m not sure if it was that, or flying through the fireworks that really made me smile. Either way, the drone is now back in the drawer where it’s been sitting for months. While it’s hard to explain why, I’m &lt;em&gt;so&lt;/em&gt; glad it’s there. —&lt;em&gt;Sean Hollister, senior reports editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NIVH2S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10215854"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="3xhz0A"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HWKyDC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/buy"&gt;Sims 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6VR9Y"&gt;Look, there’s an evergreen joke about people who like &lt;em&gt;The Sims&lt;/em&gt; but only pick it up every few months to aggressively play it for about a week before forgetting it exists again. I am not one of those people. I am a very avid &lt;em&gt;Sims 4&lt;/em&gt; player and I refuse to hide that any longer. I create intricate storylines for all of my characters and I challenge myself to become a better virtual interior decorator with each new house I build. It helps that new features have recently been added like Scenarios, predetermined sticky situations your Sims can find themselves in, and Kits, which add small batches of new items without needing to buy a full expansion pack (although, I do already own plenty of the expansion packs). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrhWou"&gt;I discovered the first version of the game in the early 2000s at my babysitter’s house as a child, and I’ve been a lost cause ever since. I’ve followed the series through most of the iterations on multiple consoles. This means I can confidently say that The Sims 2 on the PC is still the best version of the game. I also follow TikTok creators who create Sims content to share in the gallery, like &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thatsimschick?"&gt;ThatSimsChick&lt;/a&gt;, who builds beautiful homes and styles them with the eye of a professional. Perhaps one day I’ll be good enough to share my own creations (and abominations) in the gallery, too. Until then, I’m gonna keep logging an embarrassing amount of hours of gameplay a week. — &lt;em&gt;Kaitlin Hatton, senior e-commerce social media manager&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h3W9XF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10905993"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="pTSl8O"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="R7vYdY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://ember.com/products/ember-mug-2?variant=30843977859157"&gt;Ember Mug 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6fZQn"&gt;As a number of my colleagues likely remember, just a few weeks ago in our team Slack channel, I vociferously criticized buying a $100-plus coffee mug that did nothing other than keep your coffee (or tea, or hot cocoa, or whatever liquid you like to drink hot) at the exact temperature you set it to. Perhaps this was a case of a schoolyard bully negging the kid they have a crush on to hide their true feelings, because I’ve been coveting one of those fancy Ember mugs for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kcT2XC"&gt;And when Best Buy put its &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf9N7v1IqHE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;exclusive blue color of the Ember Mug V2&lt;/a&gt; on sale for Black Friday, I finally bit. Reader, this mug is fantastic. It keeps my coffee hot no matter how long I take to consume it, I never have to bother with microwaving a room temperature mug, and I can even tweak its settings depending on what I’m drinking out of it (coffee in the morning, tea in the afternoon, usually). I even get the joy of occasionally updating the firmware on my coffee mug, a sentence that would have made no sense to anyone just a few years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rce7yH"&gt;To be clear, this is a completely frivolous product that nobody actually needs. It makes a mildly annoying thing slightly less annoying and its drawbacks (cost, can’t put it in the dishwasher, did I mention the cost?) probably outweigh those benefits for most people. It’s a little embarrassing how much I like it, which is why it’s a perfect guilty pleasure. I enjoy it, I feel a little awkward about it, and I’d like to never speak of it again. — &lt;em&gt;Dan Seifert, deputy editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UkmZKD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10906039"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="taTD7V"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BF9Na6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://monteverdepens.com/engage/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Monteverde Engage Ink Ball pen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="l5TEw3"&gt;I have a close friend who for years tried to convert me to pen collecting. But while I loved the fountain pens she bought me for birthdays, I was constantly inking up my fingers and smearing the pages, and I just couldn’t get the hang of writing with them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3z6DRb"&gt;Then she bought me the Monteverde One Touch Engage pen, which uses fountain pen ink in a roller-ball format — in other words, it uses ink like a fountain pen but writes like a ballpoint. At first, I was doubtful: it was larger than most pens I used and felt a little awkward in my hand. But it definitely grew on me; when I use it, the ink flows so smoothly and beautifully that I feel like another Jane Austen, sitting at a desk and penning some clever 19th-century prose. You can fill the pen with ink from a bottle or use disposable cartridges. (I use the latter; refilling pens was something I also never got the hang of.) The model my friend gave me has rose-gold accents and a stylus on the top so I can also use it with a touch device. The current model lacks the stylus but is, I’m sure, still a cool pen.&lt;em&gt; — Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter acquires messaging platform Quill to make DMs suck less</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HaCJK38A8qTLOn0UrLJ_FmqI0Dw=/420x62:1188x574/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70239635/quill_and_twitter.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter is acquiring Quill | Quill&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I1I4Tu"&gt;Twitter has acquired Slack-like messaging app Quill with an eye toward improving messaging services, including direct messages, the company announced Tuesday. In a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nickcald/status/1468221428268863489?s=20"&gt;tweet thread announcing the deal&lt;/a&gt;, Nick Caldwell, general manager for core tech at Twitter, described Quill as a “fresher, more deliberate way to communicate. We’re bringing their experience and creativity to Twitter as we work to make messaging tools like DMs a more useful &amp;amp; expressive way people can have conversations on the service.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CKeEIJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ludwig?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ludwig&lt;/a&gt; and his talented team built Quill as a fresher, more deliberate way to communicate. We’re bringing their experience and creativity to Twitter as we work to make messaging tools like DMs a more useful &amp;amp; expressive way people can have conversations on the service.&lt;/p&gt;— Nick Caldwell   (@nickcald) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nickcald/status/1468221428268863489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8cwZJr"&gt;Quill will shut down, but its team will join Twitter’s Experience org. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. A &lt;a href="https://quill.chat/updates/2021-12-07-quill-twitter/"&gt;farewell blog post&lt;/a&gt; on Quill’s updates site provided instructions for users who want to export their team message histories, which will be available until 1PM PT on December 11th. At that point, Quill will be turning off its servers and deleting all data. Active customers will be issued full refunds, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="arBTmL"&gt;“Together with Twitter, we will continue to pursue our original goal — to make online communication more thoughtful, and more effective, for everyone,” the blog post reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v7aLrs"&gt;Quill made its &lt;a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/quill-7"&gt;official launch&lt;/a&gt; in February, &lt;a href="https://quill.chat/"&gt;billing itself&lt;/a&gt; as “messaging for people that focus.” It was founded by Ludwig Pettersson, former creative director of payments processing platform Stripe. Pettersson will be joining Twitter’s Conversations team under Oji Udezue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Wbq20"&gt;The platform was built for work conversations but with controls over some of the features that make Slack a distracting time suck. Its structured channels allowed for more focused conversations than the traditional reverse chron chat thread, and message threads could be split and moved into separate conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXPIfa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlZ5oK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ma3k5h"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
