    <title>Netflix scoops up Oxenfree developer Night School</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Oxenfree" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CyK6kc7RcE31HHwg8XSrXQt0YVE=/106x0:1186x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69922839/Sreens_CYMK_House.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oxenfree.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WX5kXR"&gt;Netflix is continuing its push into video games with the acquisition of Night School Studio, the team best-known for 2016’s &lt;em&gt;Oxenfree &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20932270/afterparty-review-xbox-ps4-pc"&gt;2019’s &lt;em&gt;Afterparty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;Oxenfree&lt;/em&gt;, it should be noted, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/27/12297852/oxenfree-game-stranger-things-pc-ps4-xbox-one"&gt;had strong &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; vibes&lt;/a&gt; — and Night School also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18510849/stranger-things-secret-games-telltale-studio-closed"&gt;previously worked on a canceled &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things&lt;/em&gt; title&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HiRsCW"&gt;“Night School wants to stretch our narrative and design aspirations across distinctive, original games with heart,” &lt;a href="https://nightschoolstudio.com/joining-netflix/"&gt;Night School’s Sean Krankel said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Netflix gives film, TV, and now game makers an unprecedented canvas to create and deliver excellent entertainment to millions of people. Our explorations in narrative gameplay and Netflix’s track record of supporting diverse storytellers was such a natural pairing. It felt like both teams came to this conclusion instinctively.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YC64xK"&gt;The studio says it will continue to work on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382536/nintendo-indie-world-showcase-fez-oxenfree-2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oxenfree II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;as well as “cooking up new game worlds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nq5PUb"&gt;The acquisition is just the latest part of Netflix’s ongoing push into games. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577868/netflix-video-games-confirmed-mike-verdu-ea-oculus-facebook"&gt;the company hired Mike Verdu&lt;/a&gt;, formerly of EA and Oculus, to head up its gaming efforts, and it’s currently testing having games in its mobile app — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22689922/netflix-games-italy-spain-android-beta-mobile"&gt;just today, that test expanded to include Spain and Italy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SifBpe"&gt;“We’ll continue working with developers around the world and hiring the best talent in the industry to deliver a great collection of exclusive games designed for every kind of gamer and any level of play,” Verdu said as part of today’s announcement. “Like our shows and films, these games will all be included as part of your Netflix membership — all with no ads and no in-app purchases. Stay tuned for more.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk, live at the Code Conference</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9PXv2JIbYypjTkMELOSVwwSUqNM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69922752/acastro_191211_elon_decade_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Thus Sprach Technoking&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="BuwXrr"&gt;We’re at the &lt;a href="https://voxmediaevents.com/code2021"&gt;2021 Code Conference&lt;/a&gt; here in Beverly Hills, California — and very soon, Elon Musk will take the stage in an interview with Kara Swisher. As always with Musk, there will be more than enough to talk about. There’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688377/tesla-steering-wheel-yoke-model-s-x-redesign"&gt;latest from Tesla&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22693610/tesla-opens-full-self-driving-beta-software-more-customers"&gt;self-driving&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615539/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed-2022-elon-musk"&gt;where Cybertruck development is&lt;/a&gt;. Just today, we learned that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22698388/tesla-texas-lawsuit-cops-autopilot-crash-injury"&gt;Tesla is being sued by Texas cops&lt;/a&gt; after a Model X on autopilot slammed into five officers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0F5ly"&gt;Then we’ve got &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675793/spacex-inspiration4-launch-first-all-civilian-private-crew"&gt;SpaceX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680152/spacex-inspiration4-first-private-crew-update-in-orbit"&gt;space tourism&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/18/22681185/spacex-ceo-elon-musk-starlink-internet-service-leaving-beta-october"&gt;satellite internet&lt;/a&gt;. Plus, we could talk about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/9/22427006/dogecoin-crashing-elon-musk-snl-host"&gt;Dogecoin&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/25/21338456/tesla-elon-musk-twitter-memes-spacex"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and whether Musk is thinking much about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463920/elon-musk-stock-price-tweets-sec"&gt;the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt; these days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UBrIP1"&gt;Oh, and of course, we could revisit the topic of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/2/11837874/elon-musk-says-odds-living-in-simulation"&gt;whether we are still living in a simulation&lt;/a&gt; or if we can escape. (Hey, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22640826/matrix-4-trailer-resurrections-release-date"&gt;fourth &lt;em&gt;Matrix&lt;/em&gt; movie is coming&lt;/a&gt;, so why not?) So yeah, there’s a lot that could happen. We’ll be live-blogging his interview with Swisher right here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IjKutR"&gt;&lt;div class="live-center-embed" data-src="https://livecenter.norkon.net/frame/voxmedia/17058/vox"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;(function(n){function c(t,i){n[e](h,function(n){var r,u;if(n&amp;&amp;(r=n[n.message?"message":"data"]+"",r&amp;&amp;r.substr&amp;&amp;r.substr(0,3)==="nc:")&amp;&amp;(u=r.split(":"),u[1]===i))switch(u[2]){case"h":t.style.height=u[3]+"px";return;case"scrolltotop":t.scrollIntoView();return}},!1)}for(var t,u,f,i,s,e=n.addEventListener?"addEventListener":"attachEvent",h=e==="attachEvent"?"onmessage":"message",o=n.document.querySelectorAll(".live-center-embed"),r=0;r&lt;o.length;r++)(t=o[r],t.getAttribute("data-rendered"))||(u=t.getAttribute("data-src"),u&amp;&amp;(t.setAttribute("data-rendered","true"),f=n.ncVizCounter||1e3,n.ncVizCounter=f+1,i=f+"",s="nc-frame-c-"+i,t.innerHTML='&lt;div style="position: relative; height: 300px; border: none;" id="'+s+'"&gt;&lt;iframe src="'+u+"?"+i+'" style="position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" mozallowfullscreen="true" allow="autoplay; fullscreen"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;',c(t.firstChild,i)))})(window);&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Apple says the iPad Mini’s jelly scrolling isn’t a problem that needs to be fixed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1WEGUNYfPxzjse8L3u8t9hvwNPw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69922596/vpavic_210924_4766_0047.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NhqQno"&gt;&lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/2021-ipad-mini-suffers-from-uneven-jelly-scrolling-in-portrait-mode/"&gt;Apple tells &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it thinks the “jelly scroll” effect some users have noticed on the new iPad Mini is normal LCD behavior that the company won’t have to fix. The effect, also known as skewing, can make it seem like one half of the display is slightly behind the other while you're scrolling, and it’s most apparent while using the iPad Mini in portrait mode. &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; executive editor Dieter Bohn noted the issue in a tweet and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;in his review&lt;/a&gt; of the device published this morning. Despite our requests before and after publishing the review, the company did not respond or comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8cFw9a"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars&lt;/em&gt; explains that the issue happens because the iPad starts drawing the lines on one side of the screen, and it takes time to go from one side to the other. A tiny amount of time, yes, but it can be noticeable depending on the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3bKrD"&gt;You can see what it looks like below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="91zdci"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here is is slow-mo video of scrolling on the iPad Min i slowed down EVEN MORE in a frame-by-frame step through. Notice how the right moves up faster than the left.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In normal usage you barely see it, but every now and then it become noticeable. In landscape it goes away entirely &lt;a href="https://t.co/iq9LGJzsDI"&gt;pic.twitter.com/iq9LGJzsDI&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1440678843589689346?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lmPztH"&gt;If you want to see how LCD screens refresh in shocking detail, The Slow Mo Guys on YouTube &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/3BJU2drrtCM?t=250"&gt;have done a video&lt;/a&gt; showing how it works with TVs and iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CW2ggO"&gt;Apple is correct in stating this effect is common in LCD displays. It’s very possible that the screen you’re reading this on right now would display the same effect if you &lt;a href="https://www.testufo.com/scanskew"&gt;loaded up a webpage that tests for it&lt;/a&gt; — my laptop shows it quite strongly. The reason it sticks out on the iPad Mini, though, is that it’s frequently used in alignments where the problem is most apparent — it’s not likely to be an issue on a landscape display where you’re scrolling vertically. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZCjgTe"&gt;This effect also happens with many video cameras, for largely the same reasons: if you pan fast enough, straight items like poles and trees will slant to one side, as the data is read from the top of the camera’s sensor to the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lRD3l"&gt;While the effect is common (and subtle on the iPad Mini, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22696652/ipad-mini-2021-6th-gen-review"&gt;we don’t think it’s a deal-breaker&lt;/a&gt; given how good the screen is otherwise and the inclusion of USB-C), it seems noticeably worse on this particular model than other recent iPads. It also feels unusual that Apple isn’t concerned about it while managing to avoid jelly scrolling on both higher-end iPad models and even my previous-generation iPad Mini (which retailed for significantly less than the new model). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="v2My9M"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="IxCvHn"&gt;Related:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="dqbxaY"&gt;

    <title>Fortnite’s upcoming global music series will have an interactive experience for each artist</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FzSoLc2LxCzV5y-bwG0ahTzZ_jA=/0x0:1106x737/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69922515/SoundwaveHamaki_notext.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mohamed Hamaki will be featured in &lt;/em&gt;Fortnite&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4SbxOL"&gt;Epic Games has announced the next set of musical performances coming to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, called &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-presents-the-soundwave-series-musical-shows-kicking-off-with-mohamed-hamaki?sessionInvalidated=true"&gt;the Soundwave Series&lt;/a&gt;. The new series will feature artists from around the world, and players will be able to experience music from each artist in an interactive experience in-game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YjOCTq"&gt;Epic is well known for bringing musical performances to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;including spectacular shows for huge artists like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;Travis Scott&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling"&gt;Ariana Grande&lt;/a&gt; and concerts hosted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21423004/fortnite-party-royale-concert-series-dominic-fike"&gt;on the non-violent party royale island&lt;/a&gt;. But Epic is increasingly working with its community to create signature experiences for the game in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s Creative mode, such as with this summer’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550240/fortnite-easy-life-concert-o2-arena"&gt;Easy Life virtual concert&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/20/22679754/fortnite-balenciaga-collaboration-epic-games-unreal-engine"&gt;Balenciaga-themed “Strange Times” hub&lt;/a&gt;. The first show in the Soundwave Series, featuring Egyptian artist Mohamed Hamaki, will continue that trend, as will the future shows in the Soundwave Series, Epic tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vVPFGm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hamaki’s show kicks off on October 1st&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s1Toti"&gt;Hamaki’s show kicks off on October 1st at 2PM ET and will be available until October 3rd at 2PM ET. Interestingly, there will be multiple ways to see the event: you can attend by jumping into a dedicated playlist or watch it during a typical battle royale match via a picture-in-picture mode, which has been used in the past &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20706969/fortnite-world-cup-picture-in-picture-pip-live-event-viewing-in-game"&gt;to show competitive &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;in game&lt;/a&gt;. (This picture-in-picture feature will only be available for certain times during the 48-hour Hamaki event.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6IXt8"&gt;The new series seemingly marks Epic’s next initiative to make &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; something more than just a game. The concerts not only offer something else for players to do, but the picture-in-picture feature could keep players locked into &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s universe for music instead of turning to something like Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q0xyyi"&gt;In the coming months, the Soundwave Series will also feature Australian singer-songwriter Tones And I, Brazilian rapper Emicida, Japanese pop artist and music producer Gen Hoshino, and French-Malian singer Aya Nakamura, Epic says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sable is an adventure made from the most chill parts of Breath of the Wild</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZZzEoWSWL2TjxYTWxs2bvU72Qvo=/300x0:1920x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69922326/2021_09_20__12_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Shedworks&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Zoom through sandy dunes vibing to the sounds of Japanese Breakfast&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="gG22Am"&gt;When I think of &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt;, trying to conjure for it an elevator pitch that I might use to convince my friends to play, my mind settles on describing it as: what if the pod-racing sequence from &lt;em&gt;The Phantom Menace&lt;/em&gt; made a baby with &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild &lt;/em&gt;in a world where no one suffers, and everyone’s needs are met? It’s an unwieldy description, but it gets at the heart of what I love about the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="shJNSx"&gt;Developed by Shedworks, a small team based in London, &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt; generated a lot of interest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/14/17462494/sable-xbox-preview-moebius-zelda-e3-2018"&gt;at its E3 2018 preview&lt;/a&gt; with its &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=moebius&amp;amp;rlz=1C5CHFA_enCA717CA718&amp;amp;sxsrf=AOaemvICNzk50BwPfnqvgdtRD1RkPoUIvg:1632857515176&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;sqi=2&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwj5mqShtKLzAhV-Q_EDHWeCC4MQ_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;amp;biw=1274&amp;amp;bih=798&amp;amp;dpr=1"&gt;Moebius-inspired art style&lt;/a&gt; and similarities to &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;. Comparisons between &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;BotW&lt;/em&gt; are inevitable but welcome, according to its developers, who said they took heavy inspiration from 2017’s nigh universally acclaimed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/13/16771360/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-game-of-the-year-2017"&gt;game of the year&lt;/a&gt;. In &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt;, as in &lt;em&gt;BotW&lt;/em&gt;, the seemingly endless world lies open to you, demanding no more from you than your attention and appreciation. Almost anything can be scaled, there are hundreds of bugs, clothing items, and cosmetics to collect, and, predictably, there’s a paragliding feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="55quoi"&gt;But that’s where the similarities end. Rather than being driven to defeat an ancient enemy, you are the engine in &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt;. There is no combat, no evil to outwit, nor any grand mystery the game demands you solve. Instead, &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt; gifts you with a pod-racer and some encouraging words of self-determination and discovery, then lets you go. I didn’t think I’d enjoy such a game. I’m a creature of structure, preferring an objective be clearly spelled out for me. Without that kind of guidance, I grow bored of aimless wanderings or become so paralyzed with choice that I simply decide to do nothing and turn off the game. But &lt;em&gt;Sable’&lt;/em&gt;s desert world, hiding discoveries buried within and above the dunes, enticed me into a state of pleasant and quiet contentment instead of mindless wanderings. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m1jUpUiyRj9bBSvbwy3JO9b2FzY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22885447/Sable_4.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Shedworkds&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bnmoLZ"&gt;You play as the titular Sable, a person on the cusp of adulthood who embarks on their coming of age journey called “The Gliding.” In Sable’s culture, young people are sent out alone to experience the world and learn their place in it. To figure that out, they must earn masks that denote a particular profession, and at the end of their Gliding, they must choose a mask to lock in the vocation they will be bound to for the rest of their life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5tV5mB"&gt;To earn masks, Sable is given tasks by the people they encounter on their gliding, the reward for which is usually a badge. The tasks are simple, usually involving you collecting some kind of item, which requires a bit of creative platforming, and that’s it. Collect three of the same type of badge and exchange them for a mask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQW5NJ"&gt;Do not approach &lt;em&gt;Sable &lt;/em&gt;expecting it to be a bunch of side-quests strung together to form a full game. Though there are the characters who give you badge quests, the majority of what you experience in the game is because of your own exploration, and therein lies its charm. There were often times when I was heading between objectives that I noticed something interesting-looking on the horizon. The landscape unfurled like a kicked piece of carpet, revealing a visually distinct piece of land or a structure that begged to be explored. You’re rewarded for your inquisitiveness with money, clothing, or a bike cosmetic. There are also little Korok-like creatures called Chums that, if you turn them into their mother, will reward you with an increased stamina bar. There are no quests that point to these areas, so you’d never know they existed without wandering into them. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hScgLG7JOPlWR--IUz9sUj8iZ7A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22885450/2021_09_24__3_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Shedworks&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Sable meeting the chum queen.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lauRak"&gt;You may run into some problems playing &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt;. The game suffers from frustrating bugs that occur just often enough to distract from an otherwise lovely experience. Quest objectives sometimes don’t spawn or trigger. Saving and quitting usually fixes the issue, but it doesn’t always happen on the first try. Also,&lt;em&gt; Sable&lt;/em&gt; can clip through surfaces you want to climb, which can undo some healthy progress if you’re in the middle of some creative platforming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lx9U5d"&gt;I also appreciate that the point of &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt; is for you to cruise on your hoverbike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22688375/sable-soundtrack-music-composer-japanese-breakfast-interview"&gt;vibing to music&lt;/a&gt; that wouldn’t sound out of place on a “lofi beats to chill to” playlist, but sometimes, I wish there was just a little bit more in the world for you to see. The landscape is the attraction, and it is breathtaking, but there were times that after cresting a dune, I had hoped to see a hidden town or a temple to explore instead of just more sand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQhv0N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt; is a soft, slow game that only asks of you to be present in your surroundings. I learned that lesson acutely and by accident. At one point, I noticed that I didn’t know what I could do with the menagerie of bugs I collected. To find out, I fast-traveled to the nearest vendor to see if I could sell them or trade them for a badge. While speaking to the vendor, I noticed smoke billowing in the distance — indicative of some kind of settlement. &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt; refuses to give you explicit direction but will hint at where you can visit on your map. When I saw the smoke, I checked my map to see if there was a village I somehow missed in my travels, but I couldn’t see any of the usual visual cues the map uses to denote a place of interest. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="71c1y6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Sable&lt;/em&gt; is a soft, slow game that only asks of you to be present in your surroundings.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V3Rg8R"&gt;The village was far away and situated atop a plateau too tall for my stamina bar. Since most of my enjoyment of&lt;em&gt; Sable&lt;/em&gt; came from figuring out, “How do I get up there?” — I decided to try. It took a fair bit of planning and stamina management, but I made it to the settlement to find a lone NPC. I opened my map again since, once you visit a place in Sable, it gets named on your map and becomes a fast-travel destination. It was then I noticed that this place was indeed marked on my map, but I was too far zoomed out and covered in quest waypoints to see it. It felt like a bell going off in my head, in which the premise of &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt; revealed itself to me: f you focus too much on the forest, you miss the trees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S1Ker7"&gt;At the beginning of the game, your mother figure says that your Gliding can be as long or as short as you want it. Functionally, this means there is no set number of masks you must collect before you can “end” the game. After earning only one, you can simply return home, select a mask, and complete your Gliding. I didn’t focus too much on acquiring masks, knowing I could return home at any time, figuring there would be some point at which all the wandering would finally get to me enough to “end” the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SwxWHh"&gt;While exploring, I found the wreckage of a spaceship. Inside, it was like the shrines in &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;, requiring you to complete a simple puzzle to gain access to the ship’s control room. There, you meet an AI who shares with you a piece of a recording from the long dead crew. The AI suggests you find other ships to piece together the whole recording but can’t tell you where they are. As I went about earning badges and climbing the highest peaks, I slowly found each of the spaceships, and through them, I learned the story of this world and how its people got there. Once I learned the secret of the world, I was satisfied that I had reached a natural ending point. That knowledge was what my Gliding was supposed to show me, and more than that, I had gotten all that I needed out of the game. So I returned home, chose my mask, and ended the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYM9of"&gt;Most video games are about “beating” them, giving you an objective to satisfy or a quest to complete. &lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t need you to complete it. That might be why the game’s best moments don’t happen along some questline but are experienced only through dogged exploration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phgDSx"&gt;Sable is available now on Steam, Xbox, and Xbox Game Pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gc0uqr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Most people aren’t accessing their medical records on their phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="FRANCE-HEALTH-VIRUS-VACCINE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a7xeQar1qDGtxKY8c-h0T0hD8BA=/0x0:5260x3507/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69922276/1230393274.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by SAMEER AL-DOUMY/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5A0wRE"&gt;Even as more and more people in the United States start to have access to their medical records online, most are still far more likely to use their computers to log in to patient portals than a smartphone app, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2021-09/HINTS_2020_Consumer_Data_Brief.pdf"&gt;new report&lt;/a&gt; from the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Pt07z"&gt;Almost 40 percent of US adults said that they accessed their health records through a patient portal in 2020, according to the report, which analyzed data from the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) run by the National Cancer Institute. That’s up from 25 percent in 2014. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5aHy5"&gt;The survey only collected data from January through April 2020. That captures the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic when doctors started to transition to telehealth — which often requires patients to log in through a portal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EAcPee"&gt;Of the people who did use a portal during the study period, around 40 percent said that they only or sometimes used a smartphone app to access it. That lines up with a trend that started even before the pandemic. People have been slow to start using apps for their health records, even though tech companies have been trying to generate interest for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LPX7kj"&gt;Apple, for example, has a health records section in its Health app, and it is available to patients at around 700 hospitals. It’s hard to tell how many patients are actually using it: most hospitals aren’t tracking that data, &lt;a href="https://medcitynews.com/2021/09/546989/"&gt;a &lt;em&gt;MedCity News&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; found, and Apple declined to tell &lt;em&gt;MedCity News&lt;/em&gt; how many people use the feature. But one hospital that did have the information available, UC San Diego Health Sciences, said that only a small fraction of its patients used Apple’s health records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xOYWuZ"&gt;Google is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379846/google-health-record-data-app-android"&gt;working on a medical records tool&lt;/a&gt;. It would be Google’s second attempt in this space — it launched Google Health in 2008 before shutting the program down in 2012, citing low adoption. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7YLOEE"&gt;The report was not able to differentiate third-party apps, like the Apple feature, from apps directly distributed by a healthcare organization or electronic medical record company. The Office of the National Coordinator told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it is testing additional questions that it hopes capture that nuance on the 2022 survey. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKw1SZ"&gt;The HINTS data also showed that more and more people are messaging their doctors through their portals. Just under 60 percent of people in the study said they used the systems to send messages in 2020, up from 48 percent in 2017. Again, though, this data only captures the very start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Other analysis of data from electronic health records in 2020 shows that use of the messaging feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679239/patient-messages-health-record-epic-doctor-burnout"&gt;spiked around April 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and that it stayed high through the rest of the year. Doctors say they’re overwhelmed by the volume. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="azukBd"&gt;The reasons people &lt;em&gt;don’t &lt;/em&gt;use their online medical records have stayed consistent: people said that they’d rather speak to a doctor directly, and that they don’t see a need to access their medical records online. Around a quarter of people said they found it difficult to log in, and 20 percent said they were uncomfortable with computers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PeBEe5"&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic, though, accelerated efforts to make digital health and telemedicine more accessible. Doctors spent the past year helping patients set up online access so that they could get the care they needed without leaving home. This report outlines a baseline comfort level with online records before that work took place. Additional analysis on the rest of 2020 could help show how successful those efforts may have been. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla asks owners to share fewer clips of ‘Full Self-Driving’ beta mistakes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dIdykzp1Qsx46BgGxa7QSRSTPVM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69922179/tesla.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xuJIR4"&gt;Tesla is making owners who opt in to the controversial beta version of its “Full Self-Driving” software sign non-disclosure agreements and is also discouraging them from sharing video clips that show the driver assistance system making mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwf56r"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/m7ezxq/how-teslas-self-driving-beta-testers-protect-the-company-from-critics"&gt;a copy of the NDA obtained by &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Tesla tells those who sign the document that “there are a lot of people that want Tesla to fail; Don’t let them mischaracterize your feedback and media posts.” The company also says owners in the beta should “share on social media responsibly and selectively” and “consider sharing fewer videos, and only the ones that you think are interesting or worthy of being shared.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmTZoS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice’s&lt;/em&gt; report comes as Tesla is now working on expanding access to the “Full Self-Driving” software, all while the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22673497/tesla-nhtsa-autopilot-investigation-data-ford-gm-vw-toyota"&gt;National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigates&lt;/a&gt; the company’s less-advanced Autopilot driver assistance system currently available on its cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HuF5P3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“there are a lot of people that want Tesla to fail”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="STU5Pi"&gt;Tesla has allowed a small group of die-hard owners to test the beta version of the “Full Self-Driving” software for about a year now. Some of them take their roles as “beta testers” quite seriously and try to find flaws in the system in an effort to help Tesla make the software better. Many also film themselves traveling around with the software running. Some compress their longer drives into supercuts, speeding up the footage to emphasize just how far the software can take them without human intervention. Others post the raw footage, warts and all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phvdHD"&gt;(As always, to be clear: this software does not make Tesla’s cars fully autonomous. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has himself even said that he believes the “feature complete” version of the software his company calls “Full Self-Driving” will, at best, only be “&lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2020/01/13/tesla-full-self-driving-feature-complete-soon-elon-musk/#:~:text=When%20Musk%20talks%20about%20a,features%20with%20city%20driving%20capability.&amp;amp;text=So%20feature-complete%20means%20it's,it%20would%20still%20be%20supervised."&gt;likely&lt;/a&gt;” to drive someone from their home to work without human intervention and will still require supervision. That does not describe a fully autonomous car.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="urkwCl"&gt;This whole process — the years of unfulfilled claims of being able to make fully autonomous cars, the idea of beta testing in-development drivers assistance software on public streets with untrained owners behind the wheel — has drawn Musk and Tesla a lot of scrutiny. Recently, though, a clip from a video originally shot by Tesla owner and investor Galileo Russell went viral and charged the conversation even more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="TdLSlV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A few people in the “Full Self-Driving” beta show the software with no edits, warts and all&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A5ZAlF"&gt;In it, Russell’s car should be merging left, but it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DavidZipper/status/1439681683880546306"&gt;suddenly takes a dive to the right&lt;/a&gt;, eventually pointing straight at pedestrians in a crosswalk. A hedge fund owner shared this clip on Twitter, where many people (rightfully) were aghast at how close the car came to running over pedestrians. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hfP9N9"&gt;In a follow-up video, Russell made a passing mention about how Tesla “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/gvgsoRPiWA8?t=118"&gt;doesn’t want&lt;/a&gt;” people in the beta sharing clips that look bad while making a larger point explaining why he posted the video to begin with. But it wasn’t until &lt;em&gt;Vice &lt;/em&gt;reported on the NDA this week that it was clear what he meant.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3djub"&gt;Tesla is using this language to try and control the public perception of its “Full Self-Driving” software as the company starts to open up access to a much wider group — despite the software still being in development. Tesla added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22693610/tesla-opens-full-self-driving-beta-software-more-customers"&gt;a button to the user interface of its cars&lt;/a&gt; this past weekend that lets owners request to be a part of the beta. It also launched a “safety score” system, which monitors drivers who apply and evaluates them on a number of metrics, like braking habits or aggressive acceleration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZtQfgS"&gt;At the moment, Musk says drivers with a perfect safety score of 100 will be accepted into the beta, though he tweeted that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1442707528924684293"&gt;Tesla will lower that bar&lt;/a&gt;. He also said Tesla will soon start adding up to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1442706542839701510"&gt;1,000 new owners per day&lt;/a&gt; to the beta, a dramatic expansion of who will be able to test the driver assistance software out on public roads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vertcf"&gt;Expanding access is sure to bring even more attention to Tesla and Musk’s patchwork approach to rolling out the “Full Self-Driving” software. In fact, it already has. Last week, National Transportation Safety Board chair Jennifer Homendy told the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; that she wished the company would address “basic safety issues” before allowing new owners into the program. Homendy was one of the more outspoken board members during a 2020 hearing that found Autopilot to be partially at fault for the 2018 death of a driver in Mountain View, California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U6AHce"&gt;Tesla doesn’t appear to be changing course, though. Over the weekend, in response to a blog post about her comments, Musk tweeted a link to Homendy’s Wikipedia page — which eventually &lt;a href="https://wccftech.com/tesla-tsla-trolls-attack-the-wikipedia-page-of-the-ntsb-director-after-her-stance-on-the-fsd-labeling-was-validated-by-an-mit-study/?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;amp;utm_medium=twitter"&gt;had to be locked&lt;/a&gt; after a sudden rush of edits.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Echoes of the Eye injects a mystifying and scary microcosm into Outer Wilds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Outer Wilds Echoes of the Eye" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ErMdEYy8Qks83xNhcrk1LWP20FM=/0x0:3176x2117/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69922162/outerwildseote.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Mobius Digital / Annapurna Interactive&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fTSrrk"&gt;Entering a state of desperation is essentially a requirement to solve many of &lt;em&gt;Outer Wilds&lt;/em&gt;’ puzzles. The game’s new $15 expansion, &lt;em&gt;Echoes of the Eye&lt;/em&gt;, features one such puzzle that had me feeling like I’d exhausted every option. I had the right tool in hand, I was in the right room. I had followed the vague tips in the slide reels I had seen so far, left behind by an intelligent species. So I did what I usually do when I lose hope in the game: reset the loop. Maybe I needed to start again with a fresh perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GU8SD"&gt;Then I woke up in a different world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JqZ6yf"&gt;I hadn’t solved the puzzle completely, but I inadvertently progressed through the story by taking a chance on a hunch. Taking chances is core to progressing in &lt;em&gt;Outer Wilds&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s also the theme of the new storyline in &lt;em&gt;Echoes of the Eye&lt;/em&gt;, which itself feels different (and long) enough to be a standalone game. You won’t get anywhere without being bold, and sometimes they’ll pay off. But you might also end up somewhere you don’t want to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Rq3CbR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Echoes of the Eye’&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;feels different (and long) enough to be a standalone title&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I14E84"&gt;In case you haven’t played &lt;em&gt;Outer Wilds&lt;/em&gt;, it’s an open-world (more like open-universe) space exploration game where you visit planets and make archaeological discoveries, sometimes accidentally. Each planet plays a role in the greater story, which lures you into figuring out why the sun explodes every 22 minutes, and putting a stop to it. Each time loop resets everything, except your ship’s log, which collects points of interest to make it easier to go back and to piece things together as you go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="88vgJf"&gt;The aforementioned species in this new expansion, which look like wise bipedal owls with antlers, abandoned their home planet in the hopes of a better life after picking up a promising transmission from an entity in another universe, the same one your protagonist inhabits. After a few trips around The Stranger, the new “planet”-like structure added to the roster in &lt;em&gt;Outer Wilds&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll start to piece things together about what life was like, why things didn’t go according to plan, and why no one lives there despite it seeming perfectly capable of harboring life.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hoeNJL6RqJXdo3g604iPLEedAGA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22885380/OW_DLC_GIF_3.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Mobius Digital / Annapurna Interactive&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YM9lSg"&gt;The base game of &lt;em&gt;Outer Wilds&lt;/em&gt; lets you choose which planet to go to first, and you always start the loop at your Earth-like home planet. In terms of easing the player in, &lt;em&gt;Echoes of the Eye&lt;/em&gt; is far from the easiest destination to get to or navigate within. As you might have seen from the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pt9M6WumjtE"&gt;expansion’s teaser&lt;/a&gt;, The Stranger is invisible. Though, you don’t need to have completed &lt;em&gt;Outer Wilds&lt;/em&gt; to access it; just head to the observatory on the starting planet to get your first hint as to where you’ll find it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vU7ziY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s nice to play games without objective arrows sometimes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iDPPeN"&gt;The Stranger offers a landscape layout that’s new to &lt;em&gt;Outer Wilds&lt;/em&gt;, and I often found myself marveling at the artistic and technical achievement on display. Like the rest of the planets, developer Mobius Digital’s knack for effortlessly guiding the player through complex environments without obvious signposting is on display here. It reminded me that it’s nice to play games without objective arrows sometimes. Few games really trust the player to figure everything out with limited information. It feels great when you can solve the puzzles with your own brain, but there were a few moments later in the expansion where I wouldn’t have turned down a little help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ly1kDS"&gt;In case you were curious, The Stranger is impacted by the sun exploding every 22 minutes, as every other planet in the game is. Its terrain changes during that time span, covering up some areas and exposing others that were previously hidden, similar to some other planets in the game. But through some crucial story beats, you’ll figure out why the rules of the universe you might know from the base game don’t necessarily apply here, for better or worse.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Outer Wilds Echoes of the Eye" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AimJCnsaAJXOsEfAUTG4MT-NfwM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22885369/outerwildseote.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Mobius Digital / Annapurna Interactive&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iz563S"&gt;You’ll utilize the same few game mechanics from the base game, including using your jetpack and flashlight, to enter places to which you otherwise wouldn’t have access. Compared to many other games where you have countless skills at your disposal, I’ve always enjoyed the deliberately small loadout in &lt;em&gt;Outer Wilds&lt;/em&gt; because it makes every new addition — of which there are a few in &lt;em&gt;Echoes of the Eye&lt;/em&gt; — feel important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWt1rZ"&gt;After about 10 hours with &lt;em&gt;Echoes of the Eye&lt;/em&gt;, it felt different from the main game, but initially it didn’t deliver on the mystique I was expecting — though that changes as you approach the end. I won’t go into details, but the latter sections of the story put you in tense situations that made me feel like I was playing a survival horror game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6nx68"&gt;Like the rest of the adventures in &lt;em&gt;Outer Wilds&lt;/em&gt;, once your objectives become clear, the gameplay morphs. The landscapes become obstacle courses, especially as you try to accomplish more with limited time in each loop. And it sheds its chill space exploration facade to reveal that it’s basically a speed-running game where you’re racing against the clock to find the answers to life’s biggest questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7k51p6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Once your objectives become clear, the gameplay morphs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TZBQIm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Echoes of the Eye&lt;/em&gt; diverges from the base game in some welcome ways, but it still feels like it’s a part of the same universe. It was a risk for Mobius Digital to squeeze another planet into &lt;em&gt;Outer Wilds&lt;/em&gt;, which already felt like a complete package with more than enough mystery to unspool. But this spooky, mystifying expansion is an integral part of the experience, as well as a fantastic send-off for a special game.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfG3LR"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Echoes of the Eye&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;Outer Wilds&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; are available on PC via Epic Games Store and Steam, along with PS4 and Xbox One (and playable on newer consoles). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s Astro home robot&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Amazon’s long-awaited home robot is here&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="uWyMCR"&gt;In the fall of 1962, TV-watching audiences were invited to meet the Jetsons, a space-dwelling, flying-car-driving family from the future and their dog, Astro. Today, Amazon wants you to meet a different Astro, one that’s not quite as fantastical or futuristic as the Jetsons, but actually available in our present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kguNTY"&gt;Amazon’s Astro is not a dog; instead, it’s the company’s long-rumored home assistant robot. Though Amazon denies taking inspiration for the name from &lt;em&gt;The Jetsons&lt;/em&gt;, it was hard to ignore the resemblance to a faithful pet when I got to see the Astro in action last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PkMmz"&gt;The Astro, which will initially cost $999.99 and available as a Day 1 Edition product that you can request an invite for the privilege of buying, is Amazon’s most ambitious in-home product yet. Amazon sees it as bringing together many different parts of the company — robotics, AI, home monitoring, cloud services — all into one device. Best described as the love child between a Roomba and an Echo Show smart display, the Astro is meant to be the next step in what Amazons believes to be the seemingly inevitable home robot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="H4TG3L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Astro is an attempt to combine a number of Amazon’s strengths&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="duHyjP"&gt;Amazon claims the Astro can do a wide variety of things you might want from a home robot. It can map out your floor plan and obey commands to go to a specific room. It can recognize faces and deliver items to a specific person. It can play music and show you the weather and answer questions like any Echo smart display. It can be used for video calls, always keeping you in frame by literally following your movements. It can roam around your house when you aren’t home, making sure everything is okay. It can raise its periscope camera to show you whether you’ve turned the stove off. It can use third-party accessories to record data like blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCZCzw"&gt;But as ambitious as the Astro is, it still is very much a first cut at what a home assistant robot could be. It doesn’t have any arms or appendages; it can’t clean your floors; it can’t climb stairs; it can’t go outside of your home; and it probably can’t do a zillion other things I’m not thinking of at the moment. That’s part of the reason why Amazon is limiting its availability at launch — even after years of development, it still has a lot to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YwFIZVGehrzFZPaiLR_o10astWk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882955/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Astro has a 10-inch touchscreen for a “face” and a wide array of sensors for eyes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="Nu5NSx"&gt;The Astro stands roughly two feet high and weighs about 20 pounds. Its main drive wheels are about 12 inches in diameter, large enough to clear door thresholds and move through carpet, while a single caster in the back helps it keep balanced. The Astro can zip along at a top speed of one meter per second and it has the ability to move in 360 degrees, forward, back, or any direction it pleases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U5QMQk"&gt;Inside the plastic-clad shell are five different motors: one for each drive wheel, one to raise and lower its periscope camera, and two to twist and tilt its “face.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LpzbH5"&gt;That face is effectively the screen lifted off an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22297810/amazon-echo-show-10-2021-review"&gt;Echo Show 10&lt;/a&gt;. It’s got an array of sensors in its bezel, plus a standard 5-megapixel video calling camera. Most of the time, the screen displays two circles that behave as “eyes,” allowing you to understand what the Astro is doing or where it’s planning to go. It can also show some limited personality through these circles, contorting them into different shapes and angles, similar to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/3/4/18250104/jibo-social-robot-server-shutdown-offline-dead"&gt;ill-fated Jibo’s expressions&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/29/18523124/anki-drive-robot-toy-company-out-of-business-shutting-down"&gt;also-ill-fated Cozmo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0V5uSs"&gt;But those circles aren’t what the Astro uses to see you or its environment. It’s actual “eyes” are the variety of sensors and cameras packed into the base of the unit, things like ultrasonic sensors, time-of-flight cameras, and other imaging tools that let the robot know what’s around it and where it’s going. The Astro’s navigational tools are all inside of itself — there’s no need for special boundary markers or other external guidelines like some robot vacuums rely on — and it can tell when it’s about to head down a set of stairs or hit an object.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wuELuL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon’s race to create the disappearing computer","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22696187/amazon-alexa-ambient-disappearing-computer-limp-interview"},{"title":"Amazon’s new Echo Show 15 is meant to hang on your wall","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22693503/amazon-echo-show-15-smart-display-wall-price-specs-features"},{"title":"Amazon marries Ring and Eero in a neat, white package","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692073/ring-alarm-pro-amazon-event-release-date-specs-price-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vVEEzJ"&gt;In another similarity to a robot vacuum, the Astro will use these sensors to map out your home. You can label each room and adjust the boundaries in the Astro smartphone app. You can also set up specific “viewpoints” in your home that the robot will remember. From there, you can tell the Astro to go to a specific location either with a voice command or remotely through the app. Since the Astro can’t go up or down stairs, Amazon expects most people to place it on the main floor of their home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="icgHLn"&gt;Amazon says all of the processing and storage for these maps happens locally on the device. Then a “portion of that data is sent securely to the cloud” so that you can tell the Astro where to go using the smartphone app. The Astro can only be paired to a single phone at a time — a security measure to help prevent unauthorized access or use. Similarly, its facial recognition data is also stored locally on the Astro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3NRb7I"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Amazon Astro demo clip|104104" data-volume-uuid="f75493661" data-volume-id="104104" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-98" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="chorus"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Inside the Astro are five different motors that allow it to move freely. | &lt;/em&gt;Animation: Amazon&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UhwiLi"&gt;Between the sensors on the front of the robot are a couple of two-inch speakers. There’s also a passive resonator on the bottom to improve bass output. These can get quite loud when playing music, and since the Astro can literally follow you around and always move itself to the optimal position, you’re almost always going to be able to hear it well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zbqL3W"&gt;To make up for its diminutive size, the Astro has a 12-megapixel periscope camera that can raise up to 42 inches high, enough to see over a typical counter or table. This camera can be used for video calls or viewed through the accompanying phone app to see what’s happening inside your home when you’re not there. Surrounding the telescoping pole are the far-field mics that are used to pick up voice commands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tdq4gU"&gt;Around back is a small payload area, capable of carrying 4.4lbs (2kg) of cargo. By default, this area has an insert with two cupholders, but that can easily be swapped for a basic bin. Amazon envisions this area to be something third parties will take advantage of and for which they’ll design accessories. There’s a 15-watt USB-C port in the payload area that you can use to charge your phone, but the real utility of that is for accessories to plug into. Amazon’s executives spoke of a blood pressure cuff that will utilize it, though I wasn’t able to see that in person.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Znw2OvCFTyJD9q8kPp8RLHcLEEQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882953/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A 42-inch tall periscope camera allows the Astro to see over counters or other tall obstacles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QclzNK"&gt;Like a robot vacuum (again), the Astro has a charging dock to which it can automatically attach itself. Charging the battery from zero to 100 takes about 45 minutes and it can go for about two hours of motion between charges. The Astro is designed to manage its battery life on its own — if it needs to recharge, it will just go to its dock by itself — but you can also tell it to do so by voice commands, through the touchscreen or in the app. The internal battery is located under the payload area and can be replaced when it no longer holds a charge, but it’s not designed to be changed frequently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OwZ4mV"&gt;The brains of the Astro are Qualcomm chips, not the Amazon-designed AZ2 processor that’s in the new Echo Show 15. The company says it used Qualcomm silicon here because of the Astro’s long development time. Like its maps, all of the Astro’s processing and movements happen locally — for privacy reasons but also for practicality. A cloud-based system wouldn’t be able to respond as quickly when the Astro needs to navigate around an unfamiliar obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g87IU5"&gt;For those interested, the Astro’s functionality is built on top of Fire OS and Linux. Amazon isn’t announcing an official Astro SDK today, but it says, “it’s easy to imagine a world where customers and developers can build unique capabilities that allow Astro to keep getting better over time, and we look forward to sharing more details in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVtSkP"&gt;The Astro’s design isn’t particularly beautiful or elegant — its utilitarian looks seem to be driven more by functionality than emotion. Amazon executives told me many different form factors and designs were tested and this shape is what they’ve landed on for now. But the design is not offensive or intimidating either, something that is important to get right if people are going to accept a largely autonomous robot in their homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9hmlMkk8vl0V-2p_lK38S4L8Ikc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882947/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_16.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Astro’s large wheels allow it to roll over most obstacles it might encounter in a home, like thresholds or power cables.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="W8c2b3"&gt;Trying to wrap your head around how all of those features and capabilities together might be useful in your home can be a challenge. Amazon envisions a handful of use cases — home security monitoring, remote elder care, and convenience — but it also readily admits that there could be more that just haven’t been found yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttfkh9"&gt;That first use case is perhaps the most obvious one. The Astro can integrate with Ring’s security alarm system and function much like a Ring camera. It can capture video clips of events and send them to Ring’s cloud, and it can also automatically go to the site of a disturbance, if say a Ring motion or door sensor goes off when you’re not home. You can also program it to make autonomous patrols on a schedule, or direct it manually to go check something out through the Astro app. It’s not unlike the pitch for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22456089"&gt;Ring Always Home Cam drone&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tBCMoH"&gt;Remote monitoring of your home is perhaps where the Astro’s periscope camera is most useful. You can tell it to raise the camera to see over a counter or obstacle and switch between the periscope camera and the camera mounted above the screen easily. Amazon’s execs were eager to tell me how useful it is to check if the oven was left on when you aren’t home. The Astro also has Alexa Guard integration, allowing it to alert you to sounds of a broken window or smoke alarm, just like an Echo speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FifZt_-Js2CtWZdeIan-SQmSyVk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882946/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_17.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Astro has sensors and cameras all around it help it navigate your home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LVq3eu6oBujSB0PNQRVuMC2ORPQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882948/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_14.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Astro’s rear payload area is customizable — Amazon anticipates third-party companies will make accessories for it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fCB9zC"&gt;Amazon also envisions the Astro as being useful for remote monitoring of elderly relatives. Thanks to its ability to recognize faces, it can look for an elderly person and provide status notifications to their caregivers. Routines can be programmed where it will remind the person to take medication or check their blood pressure when they need to; the Astro’s ability to find them means that it can deliver this reminder even if they aren’t in the same room as it. The Astro will also be integrated into the new Alexa Together service, which provides access to an emergency helpline and support for fall detection devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OoF34h"&gt;Lastly, Amazon sees the Astro as the next level of how Alexa can integrate into your home. Though the Astro’s wake word for voice commands is “Astro” (by default, it can be changed to Alexa, Echo, or Computer, but sadly not Artoo), the intelligence underpinning it all is Alexa. The Astro is effectively an Echo Show on wheels — you can ask it to follow you around as you do things; have it play music or podcasts while you’re doing chores; ask it to set reminders, timers, or take a photo; use it for video calling through Alexa’s calling service; and do all the other things an Echo Show can do. The software on the screen itself is effectively lifted right off the Echo Show, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZ6OPw"&gt;The Astro’s ability to recognize faces means it knows who it’s looking at and can play a greeting or turn on your favorite music when it sees you. It’s designed to learn your habits, so if you end up using it most of the time in the kitchen, it will park itself there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3Xxgf"&gt;Amazon has also built more personality into the Astro than we’re used to from Alexa. It will move its body, change the shape of its eyes, and adjust its screen to express attention or emotions. You can ask it to do silly things like dance, and it moves around in a way that’s meant to make it easy to tell where it’s going, when it’s going to turn, and so on. Amazon says that beta testers claimed the Astro’s personality made it feel more like a part of their home than a smart speaker or other gadget; it will surely draw comparisons to the Jibo robot that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18682780/jibo-death-server-update-social-robot-mourning"&gt;engendered similar attachments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TbYJoDPvp1xr3btFgORYCKOfEoQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882961/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Astro will turn its “head” to look at you or indicate where it’s going.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="NArSd4"&gt;For all of the things that the Astro can do, however, there’s a laundry list of things it can’t. In a demo of the device ahead of its official announcement, I was able to see Astro perform a variety of tasks, such as go to a specific room, find a particular person, take a photo, and so on. I was able to ask it to follow me around as I walked from one room to another; it had no trouble navigating around random obstacles that ended up in its path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZpU1u"&gt;But as mentioned, it can’t go outside; it can’t go up or down stairs; it has no arms or appendages to open doors or cabinets; and it can’t help you move or get up if you’ve fallen down. Sure, it can deliver an ice cold beer to a specific person, but someone still has to get the beer out of the fridge and put it in the back of the Astro before telling it where to go. It can show you that the oven was left on, but it has no ability to press the buttons itself to turn it off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9eGTFh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Astro’s competition will be software assistants as much as other robots&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2RYUTG"&gt;It also doesn’t do a lot of assistant-type things that software is already starting to handle. There’s no ability for it to answer your phone and deal with telemarketers (something Google Pixel phones are already doing) or have it work with your doctor’s office to schedule your next appointment. The Astro can tell you when someone’s rung the doorbell, but it can’t go ahead and sign for that package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEoOzQ"&gt;Amazon, for its part, is clear-eyed about the Astro’s limitations. That’s part of the reason why it’s releasing it with a limited, invite-only system before launching it to the public. The company told me that things like robot arms and other appendages could certainly unlock many more capabilities, but right now the cost is too great to make them practical or accessible. There’s also the problem of what people will be comfortable with in their home at this stage — the Astro’s current design isn’t a huge leap from a robot vacuum, but add a bunch of R2-D2-like grabber arms and the ability to open doors and people might start getting uncomfortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c2_KpgEqiXwOQtAqeWeOykAbjUU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22882959/amazon_astro_home_robot_4773_5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Astro uses the circles on its screen to express different emotions.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="OsQNTN"&gt;That’s why, as it functions right now, the Astro feels more like an artificial pet than a true robotic assistant. It can do some tricks, provide some entertainment, and help out a little bit here and there, but it’s far from the kind of robots that science fiction has conditioned us to expect. Even the Astro’s insistence on putting itself in the best position for you to see and hear it (a couple feet in front of you, screen tilted up toward you) is undeniably similar to a dog begging for some scratches behind the ears or a piece of jerky. It’s hard not to find the thing just a little bit endearing as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKp1pR"&gt;Amazon is convinced that everyone will have a robot of some sort in their home in the next five to ten years. The Astro is the company’s attempt to get out ahead of the field, before it’s too crowded with competitors. (It used this exact same approach to great success with the Echo.) It’s also only the first of its attempts at putting a robot in your home, and given the company’s nearly endless resources, it doesn’t need the Astro to be a huge sales success to keep developing on this idea. The introductory price of $999.99 includes a six-month trial of Ring Protect Pro, though Amazon says its price will go up to $1449.99 once it reaches broader release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wMcoFF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Many questions about the Astro remain unanswered for now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pdQ09j"&gt;The question for all of us then, is how much do we want to be testing Amazon’s ideas and experiments in our most intimate of spaces? The company has done a lot to mitigate privacy concerns with the Astro’s local processing, but it can’t possibly know every way someone will feel their personal space violated by a robot in their home until it’s already there. That’s why it needs to do larger-scale testing than it’s able to do in secret.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2F70vj"&gt;I’m also curious to see how it reacts and behaves in a real-world environment, outside of Amazon’s beta testers. How’s it going to function when a toddler decides it’d be fun to sit on the back and ride it? How will a real-life dog deal with this robotic interloper in its domain? Can it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22660467/irobot-roomba-ai-dog-poop-avoidance-j7-specs-price"&gt;avoid dog poop&lt;/a&gt;? How useful will it actually be when it’s limited to just one floor of a multistory home? How much convenience can it really add beyond the smart speakers that are already in my home?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="XYo9jo"&gt;Those answers will have to wait until we’re able to spend more time with the Astro and push its capabilities first hand. Until then, we’ll have to be content with dreams of robotic dogs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="PgwXCO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, 2:40PM ET, Tuesday, September 28th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version said the maps of a home that the Astro creates are never sent to the cloud. That is incorrect — Amazon says a “portion” of the mapping data is stored in the cloud for remote access via the phone app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FPfKgh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Package alerts come to Ring’s wired doorbells</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5va60agsnJ_vGfFz97cVGR84Co0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69920872/dseifert_20210323_4486_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="K03c9F"&gt;Ring is bringing package alerts to its Ring video doorbells, and it’s about time, too. This is a much-requested feature that’s already found on most of its competitors’ camera doorbell offerings. When the main selling point for a product is that it will deter porch pirates, it’s kind of important to be able to keep a virtual eye on those packages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3UjgaN"&gt;The pings that will tell you when a package is on your porch will start rolling out to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22359973/ring-video-doorbell-pro-2-review"&gt;Ring Pro 2&lt;/a&gt; and Ring Video Doorbell (2020) in the US and internationally today and should arrive on other buzzers next year. But this still doesn’t address a big issue with most of Ring’s doorbells; the cameras’ wide viewing angles often don’t pick up the spot where the package is left. Only the Pro 2 has a head-to-toe view for seeing the whole porch.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S_knnMUMfe3Pm_OPE5jz4MY5cN0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884281/Package_Alerts.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ring Pro 2 is the only Ring doorbell that can show you a head-to-toe view, which is useful for seeing packages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="trcpZF"&gt;Along with playing catch-up in the industry it invented, Ring has a new trick up its sleeve: Custom Event Alerts. This feature lets you create your own alert based on the information you want to know. For example, is the garage door open? Is the car in the driveway? Is the front door shut? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q59NRh"&gt;Custom Event Alerts will only be available on the Spotlight Cam Battery and are scheduled to arrive later this year. Both Package Alerts and Custom Event Alerts require a subscription to a Ring Protect plan (starting at $3 a month or $30 a year).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q6jvQh"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Ring custom alerts demo video|104114" data-volume-uuid="48c385801" data-volume-id="104114" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-182" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="chorus"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BapcvU"&gt;Ring says the custom alerts work by having you train your camera on the two states you want it to recognize, such as when a garage door is left open or closed or when a car is in the driveway or not. The computer vision algorithm processes images of the scene in the cloud or locally on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22455992"&gt;Ring Alarm Pro (Ring’s new smart security hub)&lt;/a&gt; and sends an alert when it sees a change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcIUPc"&gt;“You can literally build your own detector — there’s so many neat things to do with it,” said Ring founder Jamie Siminoff in an interview. He taught a camera to tell him when his HVAC compressor was on or off. “I was having problems with the outdoor compressor and was able to train it to tell me if the fan was spinning or if it wasn’t.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OYXn7G4dSx_TbWjhPm6cLT7e3fc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22884280/Custom_Event_Alerts.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ring&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new feature on the Ring Spotlight Cam lets you create custom event alerts to tell you when the state of something changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SnRKzK"&gt;The camera uses computer vision and machine learning to figure out the difference between the two states and should then recognize when that state changes and alert you to it. This type of AI-powered motion detection is the next arms race in the smart home. Companies are competing to find the best way to send their users fewer annoying alerts in favor of more relevant, useful ones from their smart home cameras. And what’s more relevant than an alert you create yourself and custom design for your home? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kv2cGw"&gt;To date, Ring has been behind here, partly hampered by a reliance on battery-powered tech, which energy-intensive smart alerts can swamp. Category leaders such as Arlo and Google Nest already offer package, people, animal, and vehicle alerts, but Ring could well be the first to let you create your own. This is a bold claim, however, and we won’t know if it holds up until we’ve been able to test it ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;
