    <title>Microsoft Teams tries out Together Mode for smaller groups</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/83s0WDydSX57VabwOWK8PsN7D4Y=/173x0:1748x1050/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69547452/2021_07_06_09_41_12_TechSmith_Camtasia_2021.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EbIBmA"&gt;Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amandassterner/status/1410591387184242691"&gt;adding support for smaller gatherings&lt;/a&gt; to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317526/microsoft-teams-together-mode-dynamic-view-new-features"&gt;Together Mode feature of Teams&lt;/a&gt;, which uses AI to place all of the participants in a meeting into virtual environments (&lt;a href="https://www.onmsft.com/news/microsoft-teams-makes-together-mode-available-for-all-meeting-sizes"&gt;via OnMSFT&lt;/a&gt;). Sports fans may recognize the feature from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21337326/nba-microsoft-teams-together-mode-basketball-virtual-experience-fans"&gt;the NBA’s use of it during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; to provide a crowd-like experience for basketball games. The change to allow smaller crowds is somewhat the opposite of that and is currently in beta. Given Microsoft’s focus on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549191/skype-windows-11-microsoft-teams"&gt;Teams as a personal communications app&lt;/a&gt; as well as a corporate one, it’s not necessarily surprising that Together Mode will be able to work for family gatherings as well as company-wide all-hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEBp0Y"&gt;At the moment, the feature’s availability seems to be limited to people using the Teams Developer Preview. In theory, &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro"&gt;joining is easy&lt;/a&gt;: you just go to Teams, click on the ellipsis next to your profile picture in the top-right corner, go to About, then check Developer Preview. If you’re using a work account, though, you may not have the option; &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro"&gt;Microsoft says&lt;/a&gt; the ability to turn previews on or off is controlled by your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0weOC"&gt;It being in preview also puts an asterisk on the “together” part. When I was testing with one client running on the preview, and one not, the Together interface only showed up on the computer running the preview. On the computer that wasn’t, it just looked like a normal Teams call.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hGAPAHrxZaKY5kd8-lcJBcifCTY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701739/2021_07_06_09_40_00_TechSmith_Camtasia_2021.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alone at the coffee shop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4DJQUk"&gt;It also appeared to work for one person, for those who’d like to sit alone at the cafe from the comfort of their own home. As with any features in preview, how it works is subject to change by the time it gets released to the general public. It’s good to see that Microsoft is at least planning on allowing smaller groups to use this feature, as it can be fun for gatherings big and small.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>macOS 101: how to force quit a Mac app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nm-CwgHR_wOY-d-ceXSgL4epemc=/0x34:1058x739/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69547450/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_2.08.39_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oTrMbb"&gt;Apps on macOS are usually well-behaved, but there are times when they can stop working or freeze and slow down your entire Mac. If that happens to you (and it might happen often if you’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22558991/macos-monterey-how-to-install-public-beta"&gt;playing with the latest Monterey betas&lt;/a&gt;), it’s time to quit the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yu7SMu"&gt;The first thing to do, of course, is try to quit the app normally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="224zXf"&gt;Right-click on the app’s icon in the menu bar and select “Quit,” or...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="33lfCZ"&gt;Press the Command-Q keys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="DdcZYn"&gt;However, if the app is frozen or just won’t go away, then you need to force a quit. Again, there are a couple of ways to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LYQa97"&gt;Click on the Apple icon in the top-left corner and look for a choice that says “Force Quit” or...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lpmgTD"&gt;Press Command-Option-Esc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You may be able to find “Force Quit” in the Apple drop-down menu." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vGxWEJCREgbEqgl5I-HhcupWLPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701867/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_10.51.06_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You may be able to find “Force Quit” in the Apple drop-down menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="byeFag"&gt;Either way, this will bring up the “Force Quit Applications” box, which will have a list of currently active apps. Highlight the troublesome app, and click on the “Force Quit” button. A pop-up will ask if you’re sure; click on “Force Quit” to finally quit the app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Use the “Force Quite Applications” menu to shut down an erring app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yedHKjJbMVDbcF4Rv0fbv4N4JeQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701870/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_10.51.30_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use the “Force Quite Applications” menu to shut down an erring app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XHmqw7"&gt;If for any reason you can’t access the “Force Quit” menu, there is another way to quit the app using the Activity Monitor, which lists all of the active processes on your Mac. To get to the Activity Monitor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rF7rhW"&gt;Use Spotlight Search to find “Activity Monitor,” or...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4X1teS"&gt;In your Finder, click on Applications in the left-hand menu. In the resulting list of apps, double-click on Utilities to open the folder, and then double-click on Activity Monitor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll find Activity Monitor in the Applications Utility folder." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KvDa75zQOI0DwTY5DW0vxkRhhz4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701873/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_11.56.14_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll find Activity Monitor in the Applications’ Utility folder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="FZwqc2"&gt;You’ll see a list of active processes, which should include your misbehaving app. It’s going to be a long list, so you can click on the “Process Name” heading to alphabetize the list for an easier find. If you suspect that the app is stressing your CPU, you might try clicking on the “% CPU” heading, which may put the app at the top of the list.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once you’ve found the app, click the “x” icon at the top of the list." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_CMmuCURZUgQZz6vrf9_GYtYx94=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701874/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_11.57.47_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once you’ve found the app, click the “x” icon at the top of the list.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Nt5G6I"&gt;Highlight the app you want to quit, and click on the “x” icon at the top of the window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QzaPws"&gt;Click on “Force Quit.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Now you can either quit or force quit the app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QbRG3yXrKPupi5QFry73TVRQz_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701875/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_12.03.03_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now you can either quit or force quit the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kBldLk"&gt;And if you’re still having difficulties, you can always shut down your system. You may lose some of what you’re currently working on, but it will close the app that’s driving you nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="368Xap"&gt;Hold down your power button (or the Touch ID button if your Mac has a Touch Bar) until you see the Apple logo on your display.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vFZxsK"&gt;Let go, and allow the system to restart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="uA3HUE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avlTqC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Welcome to Simulation City, the virtual world where Waymo tests its autonomous vehicles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XiwJExqeWfobcoDWwCtfrjCxzss=/348x0:1571x815/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69547270/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_1.58.04_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The Alphabet company is doubling up on simulation as it gets closer to commercialization&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Q8ClOp"&gt;A light gray cube with a thin blue top glides down a darkened highway, beset on all sides by dozens of green cubes. The green cubes bounce between lanes in an attempt to pass the gray cube, but the gray cube maintains a steady speed as the blackened landscape slips past into the artificial night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gK1zK"&gt;This is Simulation City, the virtual world where Waymo, an offshoot of Google, tests its autonomous vehicles in preparation for real-world experiences. The gray cube with the blue top represents one of the company’s autonomous semi-trailer trucks, while the green cubes are all the other vehicles on the artificial highway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFcwDT"&gt;Waymo is unique among autonomous vehicle operators in that it has not one but two simulation programs it uses to train its vehicles. The first is &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/08/inside-waymos-secret-testing-and-simulation-facilities/537648/"&gt;CarCraft&lt;/a&gt;, which has been in use since at least 2017, and in which Waymo says it has driven over 5 billion miles. Simulation City is the latest virtual world in which the company trains, tests, and validates its “Waymo driver” software in order to ensure its vehicles are better prepared to meet all of the challenges of the open road. Waymo is sharing details about Simulation City for the first time exclusively with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NX3wOP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Waymo is unique among autonomous vehicle operators in that it has not one, but two simulation programs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n1RYi5"&gt;The company decided it needed a second simulation program after discovering “gaps” in its virtual testing capabilities, said Ben Frankel, senior product manager at the company. Those gaps included using simulation to validate new vehicle platforms, such as the Jaguar I-Pace electric SUV that Waymo has recently begun testing in California, and the company’s semi-trailer trucks outfitted with sensing hardware and the Waymo driver software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uDFb06"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Waymo's Simulaiton City|102867" data-volume-uuid="6702603bc" data-volume-id="102867" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-101" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OrMn97"&gt;The company has also been using Simulation City to run tests in new operating domains to better prepare its vehicles to launch in new cities. Right now, Waymo has vehicles operating autonomously in the suburbs outside of Phoenix, Arizona, and in San Francisco and Mountain View, California. The company also has manually driven vehicles gathering mapping data in Los Angeles. To date, Waymo said it has tested its vehicles in over two dozen cities, most of which are in California. But expansion has been &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/05/why-hasnt-waymo-expanded-its-driverless-service-heres-my-theory/"&gt;going slowly&lt;/a&gt;, and Waymo is hoping that Simulation City can provide help as it seeks to expand to new locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kC8zl"&gt;“The way that I would hope that this platform evolves is such that you could get a sense of the rates of different incidents and events inside a city that we haven’t driven in before, before we have to put boots on the ground in that city,” Frankel said, “and get a read on whether the Waymo driver is good or not already for a particular city — and being able to do that for lots of lots of cities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="AeOA1d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You could get a sense of the rates of different incidents and events inside a city that we haven’t driven in before”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w5QTnV"&gt;Simulation City is well-suited to gaming out “end-to-end” robotaxi trips, such as a 20-minute “rider only” trip across San Francisco. “Rider only” is Waymo parlance for autonomous vehicles without a human driver behind the wheel. The company has approximately 600 vehicles as part of its fleet. More than 300 vehicles operate in Arizona in an approximately 100-square-mile service area that includes the towns of Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, and Tempe — though its fully driverless cars are restricted to an area that is only half that size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kerxMc"&gt;“There’s a set of things that we needed to have better tooling to support,” Frankel said, “and Simulation City filled in that grid of capabilities that we needed, and makes it possible to do what was challenging before with the existing simulation tools.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fht3fc"&gt;Simulation is a critical piece of the puzzle for autonomous vehicles. These programs allow Waymo’s engineers to test — at scale — common driving scenarios and safety-critical edge cases, the learnings from which it then feeds into its real-world fleet. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iWbnIRAohLEicX_RX2Am1hXgK4s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701958/SensorSim.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Waymo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Simulation is a critical piece of the puzzle for autonomous vehicles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wTGuBq"&gt;The key word is “scale” because these simulators allow Waymo to far exceed the distances its vehicles travel on public roads. As of 2020, Waymo said it’s simulated 15 billion miles of driving, compared to just 20 million miles of actual driving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJo3zK"&gt;In Simulation City, those real-world miles are now informing the miles driven in simulation, meaning the company has more confidence in the validity and reliability of the virtual situations it constructs for its vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="712LkU"&gt;“Once that relationship is established in an increasingly strong way, we need fewer additional miles driven in the real world to basically say what we learned in simulation is correct,” Frankel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HRAlE8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Simulation City is also computationally more advanced than Waymo’s previous virtual world testing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EEEmC4"&gt;Simulation City is also computationally more advanced than Waymo’s previous virtual world testing in the level of detail it can create. For example, Waymo’s engineers can simulate something as small as raindrops or as complex as late afternoon solar glare. In the past, these situations have been known to confuse an autonomous vehicle’s perception hardware, which can make it difficult to read critical signage like traffic lights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UILOK5"&gt;In addition to its own real-world testing, Waymo is using a variety of data sources to help build out the driving scenarios for the simulator, including the &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/data/crash-data-systems"&gt;National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s crash data systems&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.trb.org/StrategicHighwayResearchProgram2SHRP2/Public/Blank2.aspx"&gt;Transportation Research Board’s naturalistic driving study data&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kdOaE"&gt;The company is also using artificial intelligence and sensor data collected by its self-driving vehicles to generate realistic camera images for simulation. They call this technique SurfelGAN (surfel is an abbreviated term for “surface element,” while GAN stands for generative adversarial network, a machine learning term). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/im7q3nhoPjS1jDO68sc9rkwbIq8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13601824/vpavic_181127_3122_0042.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MMLnru"&gt;SurfelGAN was created out of a realization that current sensor simulators often use gaming engines, such as Unreal or Unity, which require manual creation of environments and other objects like cars and pedestrians. Waymo’s engineers discovered that these gaming engines were hard to scale and often failed to produce realistic approximations of camera, lidar, and radar data without a ton of extra work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DWfy01"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Inside Waymo’s strategy to grow the best brains for self-driving cars","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/9/17307156/google-waymo-driverless-cars-deep-learning-neural-net-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Z7pAKI"&gt;So they developed SurfelGAN, which uses texture-mapped surface elements to reconstruct scenes and camera viewpoints for positions and orientations. The use of artificial intelligence helps scale the product, making it easier and more efficient to develop. The technique was outlined in &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03844"&gt;a recent paper&lt;/a&gt; co-authored by Waymo researchers, including principal scientist Dragomir Anguelov.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUMZLn"&gt;There is a risk in using these new simulation techniques, said Huei Peng, professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan and the director of Mcity, the proving ground for autonomous vehicles. The main one is that flawed input data will produce entirely useless results — known in computational science circles as “garbage in, garbage out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z86Ujs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There is a risk in using these new simulation techniques&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rwWvFk"&gt;“You have to do some kind of correlation to say, ‘My simulation is not junk, there is a very close correlation between what my simulation tells me and what the real testing tells me, even if they are not quantitatively 100 percent,’” Peng said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUMxhd"&gt;But Frankel says that Waymo has already improved upon what Anguelov and his co-authors outlined in their paper last year. “The maturity of the sensor simulation has grown quite a lot since the time that we published that,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AgZKX2"&gt;Waymo is ramping up its simulation work at a rather &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22423489/autonomous-vehicle-consolidation-acquisition-lyft-uber"&gt;precarious time for the company&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier this year, John Krafcik &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364317/waymo-ceo-john-krafcik-stepping-down-self-driving-cars-google-alphabet"&gt;announced that he was stepping down as CEO of Waymo&lt;/a&gt; after helping lead the company since 2015. Experts say that Waymo still has a commanding lead in the pursuit of autonomous vehicles, but diminished expectations about the future of self-driving cars are affecting its valuation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="al8qnW"&gt;Of course, these are business problems, not technical ones. And earlier this year, Waymo showed how simulation can be used to make a better case to the public for its autonomous vehicles. In a bid to prove that its robot drivers are safer than humans, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22315361/waymo-autonomous-vehicle-simulation-car-crash-deaths"&gt;Waymo simulated dozens of real-world fatal crashes&lt;/a&gt; that took place in Arizona over nearly a decade. The company discovered that replacing either vehicle in a two-car crash with its robot-guided minivans would nearly eliminate all deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yuklto"&gt;Waymo has been conservative in the rollout of its robotaxis, refusing to expand the service area in Arizona and holding back on launching a similar service in the Bay Area until it’s sure that its software is up for the task of a much denser and more complex urban environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcotMY"&gt;But Frankel said that Simulation City has helped contribute to the growing “maturity” of its autonomous vehicles that will better prepare them for wider-scale use in the near future. “It’s a level of maturity that I think it’s worth picking our heads up and saying, ‘Hey, world, we’re doing this cool new thing,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s Witcher prequel gains Michelle Yeoh as... a sword-elf</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fDh1Nfl75SpreeE0VKGyDsyAE1M=/0x0:5117x3411/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69547220/crouching_netflix_yeoh.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b1echG"&gt;Michelle Yeoh is joining the cast of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21340050/netflix-the-witcher-blood-origin-live-action-prequel-announced"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher: Blood Origin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Netflix’s six-part spinoff of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;live-action television adaptation&lt;/a&gt; of the novels by Andrzej Sapkowski. The streaming service &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/witchernetflix/status/1412411286349045771?s=20"&gt;announced that the blockbuster film veteran will play “Scían,”&lt;/a&gt; bringing some star power and action skills to her role as the last remaining member of a tribe of “sword-elves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUmrgG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflixgeeked/status/1412436058608971783?s=21"&gt;According to Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, Scían is on a quest to retrieve a stolen sacred sword, which probably leads to her crossing paths with &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/the-witcher-blood-origin-casts-vikings-actor-laurence-ofuarain-lead-1234722496/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blood Origin&lt;/em&gt;’s other announced cast member&lt;/a&gt;, Laurence O’Fuarian as Fjall. &lt;em&gt;Blood&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Origin &lt;/em&gt;is focused on the creation of the first prototype Witcher (mutant monster hunters for those out of the loop) and the events that lead to the “Conjunction of the Spheres,” a cosmic occurrence that brought the world of elves colliding into a bunch of other realms — creating the magic- and monster-ridden continent of the original novels, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjnq6zD_s7xAhUWqJ4KHTJeApMQFnoECCUQAw&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2015%2F5%2F12%2F8586515%2Fwitcher-3-wild-hunt-review-ps4-xbox-one-game&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1mIaDtSkW4xgZjWiCCc64Y"&gt;CD Projekt Red video games&lt;/a&gt;, and Netflix series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fRV9Dn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Michelle Yeoh is joining the cast of THE WITCHER: BLOOD ORIGIN as the sword-elf Scian, whose deadly quest to retrieve a stolen sacred sword will lead her on a journey that will change the outcome of the Continent. &lt;a href="https://t.co/YzTo3yvTic"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YzTo3yvTic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1412436058608971783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K4razB"&gt;Yeoh’s most recent television project was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/25/16359132/star-trek-discovery-review-cbs-all-access-sonequa-martin-green-michelle-yeoh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and her long career in Hollywood has spanned everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/18/17690280/crazy-rich-asians-trope-rom-com-modern-statement"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crazy Rich Asians&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to James Bond. But she might best be known for her extensive filmography in Hong Kong where she notably did many of her own stunts&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The actress has battled plenty of bad guys, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrE4slKDtRo"&gt;large machinery&lt;/a&gt;, and even a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BNS0rOr-Bs"&gt;stop-motion skeleton&lt;/a&gt;. Her background in stellar on-screen fight scenes is what makes whatever blade-based business Scían gets up to most exciting. If you haven’t seen &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI0v72_wFqc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wing Chun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Reign of Assassins, &lt;/em&gt;it’s generally a good idea to give Michelle Yeoh a sword. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNSezk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher: Blood Origin &lt;/em&gt;is likely still a way off, but Netflix has more Witcher news to share this week: the streaming service is &lt;a href="https://www.witchercon.com/en#welcome"&gt;hosting a virtual WitcherCon &lt;/a&gt;alongside game developer CD Projekt Red on July 9th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>America used fewer fossil fuels in 2020 than it has in three decades</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Brent oil price dives below $20 per barrel" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m8pCMv7HRgAhxDcyY2A5JJd3PvQ=/0x1:4580x3054/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69547187/1210618127.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;NEW JERSEY, USA - APRIL 21: Phillips 66 oil refinery is seen in New Jersey, United States on April 21, 2020. Brent crude oil dived below the threshold of $20 per barrel as the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic ramped up oil oversupply amid low global consumption. | Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m1Przo"&gt;Americans gobbled up fewer fossil fuels in 2020 than they have in three decades, &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=48596#"&gt;according to the US Energy Information Administration&lt;/a&gt; (EIA). Consumption of petroleum, natural gas, and coal dropped by 9 percent last year compared to 2019, the biggest annual decrease since the EIA started keeping track in 1949.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2NG2WB"&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic was responsible for much of the fall as people stayed home to curb the spread of the virus and used less gas. In April 2020, oil prices &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/oil-prices-sink-to-20-year-low-as-un-sounds-alarm-on-to-covid-19-relief-fund"&gt;nosedived below zero&lt;/a&gt; because there was so little demand. The US transportation sector alone used up 15 percent less energy in 2020 compared to the year before. &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=47976"&gt;Higher temperatures last winter&lt;/a&gt; also helped to cut energy demand for heating, according to the EIA. As a result, greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575347/united-states-greenhouse-gas-emissions-historic-plummet"&gt;plummeted to a near 40-year low&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KTGFGW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That downward trend will have to continue&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I21q5X"&gt;That downward trend will have to continue in order to stave off the climate crisis. Upon rejoining the Paris climate agreement, President Joe Biden committed the US to slash its planet-heating pollution &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22394366/joe-biden-pledge-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2030"&gt;in half this decade&lt;/a&gt; from near-peak levels it reached in 2005. That’s part of a global effort to keep global warming from surpassing a point that life on Earth would struggle to adapt to, a global average temperature that’s roughly 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdG9cJ"&gt;To hit that goal, there should be no further investments in new fossil fuel projects, according to a recent landmark &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/pathway-to-critical-and-formidable-goal-of-net-zero-emissions-by-2050-is-narrow-but-brings-huge-benefits"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the International Energy Agency. The oil and gas industries are already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455387/big-oil-gas-shell-exxon-chevron-climate-change"&gt;feeling the crunch from lawsuits and activist investors&lt;/a&gt; forcing them to move faster toward more sustainable forms of energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nOKxhk"&gt;Renewable energy — particularly solar and wind — is on the upswing. Despite the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430465/renewable-energy-solar-wind-iea-2020-exceptional-growth"&gt;renewable sources of electricity grew at a faster pace last year&lt;/a&gt; than they have since 1999. After making up an impressive 90 percent of the global power sector’s growth, the International Energy Agency expects renewable energy to maintain the same “exceptionally high” growth through 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="lWMtFq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Renewable energy — particularly solar and wind — is on the upswing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mkX6JN"&gt;Despite the momentum moving in green energy’s favor, cutting pollution from fossil fuels at a fast enough pace to avoid climate catastrophe is still an uphill battle. As economies opened back up after their pandemic lull, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309374/global-china-carbon-dioxide-emissions-rising"&gt;CO2 emissions came roaring back&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRErF4"&gt;“The rebound in global carbon emissions toward the end of last year is a stark warning that not enough is being done to accelerate clean energy transitions worldwide,” Fatih Birol, IEA executive director, said in a March &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/after-steep-drop-in-early-2020-global-carbon-dioxide-emissions-have-rebounded-strongly"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFgnfb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeEKti"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pentagon cancels Microsoft JEDI contract, will ask for new cloud computing bids</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pentagon" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I2pqE3x7O-QjIulkGYVY79_zqcw=/59x0:4750x3127/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69546954/1223814797.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VVFuOX"&gt;The US Defense Department has canceled the $10 billion JEDI cloud computing project it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20700698/microsoft-pentagon-contract-jedi-cloud-amazon-details"&gt;awarded to Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, saying the controversial program’s design “no longer meets its needs.” The department will replace JEDI with another cloud infrastructure contract and plans to solicit bids from Microsoft as well as Amazon — which sued over losing the original contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hMOh9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/06/pentagon-cancels-10-billion-jedi-cloud-contract.html"&gt;CNBC reported&lt;/a&gt; the news earlier today. “Due to evolving requirements, increased cloud conversancy, and industry advances, the JEDI Cloud contract no longer meets its needs,” reads a Defense Department press release sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “JEDI was developed at a time when the department’s needs were different and both the CSPs technology and our cloud conversancy was less mature,” said acting Defense Department chief information officer John Sherman as part of the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eAsASV"&gt;The release also announced a multi-vendor contract called the Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability contract to provide many of the services offered by JEDI. CNBC says the Defense Department considers Amazon and Microsoft the only companies capable of providing the necessary infrastructure, although it says it will perform market research to see if other competitors could fit the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxB1yO"&gt;JEDI would have seen Microsoft provide cloud services for data storage as well as artificial intelligence tasks and other computing requirements, although some Microsoft employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17990534/microsoft-amazon-letters-medium-rekognition-jedi-military"&gt;protested the decision&lt;/a&gt; to submit a bid. Microsoft beat Amazon to secure the contract, and Amazon filed a lawsuit claiming former President Donald Trump’s animus against it had improperly influenced the decision. The suit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21136641/amazon-microsoft-pentagon-contract-jedi-10-billion-paused"&gt;placed JEDI on pause&lt;/a&gt;, and this spring, a judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409245/amazon-microsoft-jedi-contract-reject-motion-dismiss-trump-influence"&gt;allowed the case&lt;/a&gt; to proceed to trial. Amazon didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on how and if it plans to continue the suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rg69sy"&gt;In a statement to Congress in January, the Defense Department had &lt;a href="https://www.nextgov.com/media/gbc/docs/pdfs_edit/ng_infopaper_jedi_litigation_01282012.pdf"&gt;suggested that&lt;/a&gt; a protracted dispute with Amazon could &lt;a href="https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/"&gt;jeopardize JEDI’s future&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to an “urgent, unmet requirement” for cloud computing. “We remain fully committed to meeting these requirements, we hope through JEDI, but these requirements transcend any one procurement,” said Defense Department press secretary John Kirby in May. “And they’re going to have to be met one way or the other.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s OLED Switch: all of the news about the console upgrade</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V5lBfnqsNp5WYyxc-bE6VkjQxUo=/110x0:1330x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69546901/joy_con_01.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OLED Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It has a bigger OLED screen, but not much else has changed&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="OfKiQP"&gt;Nintendo has just revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;a new Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;, and it brings some nice upgrades to the four-year-old console. The most notable is a larger 7-inch 720p OLED screen, but it also has improved speakers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564942/nintendo-switch-oled-screen-new-kickstand"&gt;a Microsoft Surface-like kickstand&lt;/a&gt;, 64GB of internal storage, and a new dock with an included ethernet port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9U3WjN"&gt;The new Switch won’t support displaying 4K graphics when connected to a TV, despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22312559/new-nintendo-switch-oled-screen-holiday-release-report"&gt;rumors that had suggested otherwise&lt;/a&gt;, and there &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565118/nintendo-oled-switch-cpu-ram-bluetooth-audio-headphones-dock-no-4k"&gt;aren’t major changes to the CPU or RAM&lt;/a&gt;. But even though this OLED Switch is a lot like the old one, there’s still a lot to dig into about it. You can catch up on all of our coverage of the new console right here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo never needed to fix the Switch; it’s not broken</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u8JLbPQSvkpFY4vPh2h5Ck2Qft4=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69546873/NintendoSwitchOLEDmodel_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="88lBVH"&gt;Nintendo finally did it! There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;new Nintendo Switch coming in October&lt;/a&gt;! Over a year of rumors have amounted to the Nintendo Switch OLED model, featuring a slightly larger OLED display, “improved audio,” a built-in ethernet port, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22328983"&gt;a better kickstand&lt;/a&gt;. All of that hype has brought us a device that’s a mere step or two above the product launched back in March 2017. It sort of reminds me of that half-decade where Apple seemed to be stuck with the same generation of Intel CPUs in its laptops. The incremental improvements are nice, but we were all kind of hoping for more (like an end to Joy-Con drift?). Only Nintendo has never needed to give us more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bxz0wa"&gt;I’ve spent the last year and a half using a Nintendo Switch Lite and rereading rumors about the “Switch Pro” that seemed to promise a fix for every single issue I and others had with the original product. I thought a lot about how cool it would be to play games on my TV in 4K or marvel at improved frame rates or just pair my Bluetooth headphones without using some kind of dongle. With the 4K HDR-capable PS5 and Xbox Series X tucked into my entertainment center, I’ve gotten used to familiar games being tweaked for the TVs actually made in 2021 and would like to experience &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; the same way I’m currently experiencing &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AGXPBE"&gt;That’s not going to happen. The latest Switch will not incorporate HDR. It won’t do 4K or 120 frames per second, either. Instead, it will cap out at 1080p when attached to a TV, and its 7-inch OLED display will do just 720p. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;A $200 smartphone&lt;/a&gt; has better pixel density than the incoming Switch. I could get a cheap Android phone, a controller, and a subscription to Stadia and have a higher-resolution experience on my TV than I could with the Nintendo Switch OLED model. But I won’t be doing that. I will be patiently waiting for preorders on the OLED Switch instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e6lGqS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nintendo is a toy company first, a tech company a distant second&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K1fnr5"&gt;Because as much as many of us wanted something that could compete with Sony and Microsoft and give us &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; in 4K, Nintendo doesn’t actually need to cater to us. Its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422451/nintendo-annual-earnings-switch-84-59-million"&gt;console sales were up&lt;/a&gt; 44 percent year over year in the first three months of 2021. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20951926/nintendo-doug-bowser-interview-switch-lite-sales-3ds-support-consoles"&gt;It wants new owners&lt;/a&gt; — not necessarily to convert old ones. It can put out something with as minor upgrades as the Nintendo Switch OLED model, and we will buy it! Heck, it can have the audacity to actually officially call &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1412407485298790409"&gt;the thing the Nintendo Switch (OLED model)&lt;/a&gt;, and we will buy it! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1a2N8M"&gt;Nintendo makes really good games, and it produces truly innovative hardware. It’s a toy company first, a tech company a distant second. It’s never had to compete with Sony or Microsoft on specs, and historically, when it tried, it lost badly. Why get dragged into an arms race and take &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/3/22264242/playstation-5-sales-loss-manufacturing-costs-msrp-sony"&gt;massive losses on console sales&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/79180/xboxes-arent-profitable-but-the-nintendo-switch-certainly-is/index.html"&gt;it’s already selling the Switch at a profit&lt;/a&gt; and will likely be able to sell the OLED Switch at an even higher profit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0hA0E"&gt;While frame rate-counting nerds like myself have groaned about the Switch’s technological limitations versus the much more expensive (and harder-to-find and buy) PS5 and Xbox Series X, the vast majority of people don’t notice the occasional frame rate hiccup or care that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/nintendo-to-use-new-nvidia-graphics-chip-in-2021-switch-upgrade"&gt;a new custom Tegra chip inside a Switch Pro could theoretically use Nvidia’s DLSS technology&lt;/a&gt; to improve graphics via machine learning. Losing out on these things won’t matter to them as much as having a better display or drift-free Joy-Con. (Nintendo has neither confirmed nor denied that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MP5xr5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Doing a mid-cycle processor refresh leads to a lot of confusion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lJYZEm"&gt;Honestly, losing out on these things doesn’t bother me as much as I thought it would, either. After the initial disappointment over the lack of 4K and a better CPU, I was excited! This new model really was addressing my biggest complaints and coming in at a price I could stomach. I primarily play the Switch in handheld mode, and my main issue with both it and the Switch Lite has been the extremely ugly 720p LCD. OLEDs typically have better color accuracy and contrast than an LCD. So an OLED, even one with as dinky a resolution as 720p, is going to likely be a major improvement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0lrDU"&gt;And as we saw with the last generation of Sony and Microsoft hardware, doing a mid-cycle processor refresh &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335984/microsoft-xbox-series-x-exclusive-next-gen-promise"&gt;leads to a lot of confusion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-xbox-one-x-is-the-perfect-console-for-lazy-pc-gamer-1820083982"&gt;blurs the line between console and PC gaming&lt;/a&gt;. The appeal of console gaming is you buy the console and the game, and things just work. You shouldn’t have to worry about patches to introduce all of the features on the box. Sony and Microsoft have tried, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/10/15600272/sony-microsoft-playstation-4-pro-project-scorpio-nielsen-study"&gt;often bungled&lt;/a&gt;, to communicate the difference between all of their offerings. Nintendo has only been a little better. Remember the DS and DSi? &lt;a href="https://retrogamebuyer.com/nintendo-ds-vs-ds-lite-vs-dsi/"&gt;Nintendo had to make an entire chart&lt;/a&gt; to explain all of the differences. Or what about the 3DS and the New 3DS? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/6/8353503/xenoblade-chronicles-3d-new-nintendo-3ds-review"&gt;Some games&lt;/a&gt; didn’t even work on the original 3DS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RundS7"&gt;But there’s no need for charts or careful PR pushes to explain the difference this time. You can get a Switch for $299, a mobile-only Switch Lite for $199, or you can wait for a little while and get the illustratively named Switch (OLED model) for $349. The games should work. The display should be improved. The ethernet should be built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EeJ1f6"&gt;Nintendo could have given us a mid-cycle refresh to compete with all of those powerful PC consoles by Sony and Microsoft. But instead, it went &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21562549/nintendo-game-and-watch-super-mario-bros-next-gen-consoles"&gt;the Nintendo route&lt;/a&gt;. No confusion, no 4K, and my basic butt waiting to preorder anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roblox signs music partnership with Sony</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lil Nas X performing ‘Old Town Road’ inside Roblox" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dP5OOv-wlELlS6XSG1NX-d3Hlgo=/59x0:1679x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69546546/LNX_Concert_Old_Town_Road.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Roblox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HwDFEp"&gt;Virtual world-building platform Roblox has signed a deal with Sony Music Entertainment. The deal extends an existing collaboration that included a 2020 Lil Nas X concert inside Roblox as well as a 2021 virtual dance party with Swedish artist Zara Larsson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOjcgB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://corp.roblox.com/2021/07/roblox-partners-sony-music-entertainment-bring-artists-metaverse/"&gt;A press release says&lt;/a&gt; the agreement will include “innovative music experiences for the Roblox community that offer a range of new commercial opportunities for Sony Music artists to reach new audiences and generate new revenue streams around virtual entertainment,” although a Roblox spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company was not announcing any specific events or experiences at this time. A spokesperson says Roblox is in talks with other record labels as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8igaGH"&gt;Roblox has grown dramatically in recent years, particularly with young users. The platform — a system for creating games and other virtual experiences for either profit or personal entertainment — &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/roblox-stock-price-sinks-after-monthly-active-user-decline-2021-6"&gt;reported 43 million&lt;/a&gt; daily active visitors in May. Lots of these experiences incorporate music, including through an official Roblox “boombox” item. Roblox and other “metaverse”-style worlds like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; have also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21453061/ava-max-roblox-album-launch-party"&gt;played host&lt;/a&gt; to live virtual concerts and launch parties, particularly during the coronavirus pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1o2giw"&gt;Roblox’s popularity has earned it positive &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;negative attention from the music industry. The National Music Publishers’ Association (NMPA) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527713/roblox-nmpa-lawsuit-copyright-infringement-deadmau5-ariana-grande-imagine-dragons"&gt;sued the company&lt;/a&gt; last month for allegedly enabling piracy, accusing Roblox of profiting when users upload copyrighted songs and share them within Roblox experiences. Roblox &lt;a href="https://corp.roblox.com/2021/06/roblox-partners-bmg-develop-new-opportunities-artists-songwriters/"&gt;settled claims&lt;/a&gt; with one plaintiff in mid-June, signing a “strategic agreement” with music label BMG. At that time, &lt;a href="https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2021/06/21/bmg-roblox-music-licensing-partnership/"&gt;NMPA CEO David Israelite said that&lt;/a&gt; “having some deals with some labels and publishers to host music events is in no way legally adequate” for the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0UtKdS"&gt;In today’s announcement, Roblox emphasizes that “Roblox respects the rights of all creators and uses advanced technology to screen all uploaded music. Roblox has no tolerance for repeat offenders and quickly responds to all submitted DMCA requests.” The company declined to specify on the record whether Roblox’s deal will include a license that covers users playing Sony music in experiences — something that major social media platforms like YouTube have enabled.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo confirms no new CPU or increased RAM in the OLED Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8CPWzCrqAQYz-oOICnF6T9jMpr0=/110x0:1330x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69546301/joy_con_03.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BSfTv8"&gt;Nintendo just announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;new model of the Switch that has an OLED screen&lt;/a&gt;, but it won’t bring major changes to the CPU or RAM currently used in other iterations of the console, Nintendo confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0fesx"&gt;“Nintendo Switch (OLED model) does not have a new CPU, or more RAM, from previous Nintendo Switch models,” Nintendo said to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zM3b3"&gt;The company didn’t mention anything about improvements to those in its &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/4mHq6Y7JSmg"&gt;announcement video&lt;/a&gt;, on its &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/oled-model/"&gt;marketing page dedicated to the new console&lt;/a&gt;, or in its page listing &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/switch/tech-specs/#oled-section"&gt;the technical specs for the device&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s not surprising that this is the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4j3Ip3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4mHq6Y7JSmg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="R413Nr"&gt;Nintendo also confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that all Switch docks are interchangeable, meaning the non-OLED Switch can sit in the dock included with the OLED Switch and that the OLED Switch can slot into the older Switch dock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBjq5k"&gt;As for Bluetooth headphone support, something &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22315790/nintendo-switch-pro-4k-oled-upgraded-what-we-want"&gt;we really wanted from an upgraded Switch&lt;/a&gt;, it sounds like that’s not in the cards, either. “We have nothing to announce on this topic, but like the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch Lite consoles, Nintendo Switch (OLED model) supports Bluetooth tech for the Joy-Con controllers,” Nintendo tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. And even though you’ll hear “enhanced audio” from the onboard speakers, Nintendo says there are no changes to the audio experience when you listen through headphones or your TV’s speakers when using the OLED Switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fD2GkX"&gt;The new OLED Switch will be released on October 8th for $350. In addition to the bigger screen and enhanced audio, it also looks to have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564942/nintendo-switch-oled-screen-new-kickstand"&gt;a much-improved kickstand&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
