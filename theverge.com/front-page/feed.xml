    <title>Microsoft says Bing’s ‘Tank Man’ censorship was a human error</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vZvjmR656ik9VAzw9-3xX_FykS0=/2x0:329x218/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69409375/Tianasquare.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5bDTkb"&gt;On Microsoft’s search engine Bing, searching for “Tank Man,” the iconic figure from the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in China, turned up no image results in the United States for part of Friday. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj8v9m/bing-censors-tank-man"&gt;Vice was able to produce the same results&lt;/a&gt; in the US, and heard from multiple users from other countries who ran into the same issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLTXln"&gt;Stranger still, searching “Tank Man” or “Tiananmen Square Tank Man” turned up normal search results in Bing, it’s just images that were mysteriously missing. When &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; contacted Microsoft for an explanation, it said “&lt;em&gt;This is due to an accidental human error and we are actively working to resolve this.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KV2qfVdLPMUtGauWzxdci8QTuWs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22638218/Screen_Shot_2021_06_04_at_12.54.59_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Search results for “Tank Man” after the accident.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NoL7SF"&gt;It’s an unfortunately timed accident given that June 4th, 2021 is the 32nd anniversary of the student-led protests in China — an uprising in response to changes in the country that was met with assault rifles, tanks, and a massacre. Microsoft did eventually restore results to the specific search, though it’s still noticeably missing the well-known image. Adding in a mention of “Tiananmen” or “Tiananmen Square” pulls up what you’d expect, however. It’s not clear why Bing would weigh generic images of tanks more heavily than a famous piece of visual history, but we’ve reached out to Microsoft see if that’s normal. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uCFXMtJY_t9JzVIZhi6KwJP8Bp0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22638266/Screen_Shot_2021_06_04_at_1.34.44_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Search results for “Tank Man” after Microsoft addressed the issue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EXBNXH"&gt;Bing’s presence in China is somewhat complicated. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/23/18195200/microsoft-bing-search-engine-blocked-in-china-internet-censorship"&gt;The search engine disappeared&lt;/a&gt; from the country for nearly a day in 2019 seemingly because China Unicom, the state-owned telecom company, was ordered to block it, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/714ac466-1f64-11e9-b126-46fc3ad87c65"&gt;according to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft did not disclose the cause of the outage, but service was eventually restored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dp3nc6"&gt;Google’s experienced issues exploring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/15/17981834/google-ceo-sundar-pichai-china-project-dragonfly-wired25-summit"&gt;a modified version of Google Search&lt;/a&gt; for China, but faced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/10/18134563/human-rights-amnesty-google-dragonfly-china-search"&gt;harsh pushback from employees&lt;/a&gt; and US regulators over how the product could impact users in the country. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YGwdGB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xlcEAN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees push back against returning to the office in internal letter</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GCTTu1RK2SvQ48pwnzR5gvDR58E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69409300/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2rit5s"&gt;Apple employees are pushing back against a new policy that would require them to return to the office three days a week starting in early September. Staff members say they want a flexible approach where those who want to work remote can do so, according to an internal letter obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FS3kub"&gt;“We would like to take the opportunity to communicate a growing concern among our colleagues,” the letter says. “That Apple’s remote/location-flexible work policy, and the communication around it, have already forced some of our colleagues to quit. Without the inclusivity that flexibility brings, many of us feel we have to choose between either a combination of our families, our well-being, and being empowered to do our best work, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; being a part of Apple.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pcqkLF"&gt;The move comes just two days after Tim Cook sent out a note to Apple employees saying  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;they would need return to the office on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays&lt;/a&gt; starting in the fall. Most employees can work remotely twice a week. They can also be remote for up to two weeks a year, pending manager approval.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDz5Y8"&gt;It’s an easing of restrictions compared to Apple’s previous company culture, which famously discouraged employees from working from home prior to the pandemic. Yet it’s still more conservative compared to other tech giants. Both Twitter and Facebook have told employees they can work from home forever, even after the pandemic ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YwWV2X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A clear divide&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iFDei0"&gt;For some Apple workers, the current policy doesn’t go far enough, and shows a clear divide between how Apple executives and employees view remote work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1rbKhx"&gt;“Over the last year we often felt not just unheard, but at times actively ignored,” the letter says. “Messages like, ‘we know many of you are eager to reconnect in person with your colleagues back in the office,’ with no messaging acknowledging that there are directly contradictory feelings amongst us feels dismissive and invalidating...It feels like there is a disconnect between how the executive team thinks about remote / location-flexible work and the lived experiences of many of Apple’s employees.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNhrWZ"&gt;The letter, addressed to Tim Cook, started in a Slack channel for “remote work advocates” which has roughly 2,800 members. About 80 people were involved in writing and editing the note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9StMcc"&gt;Apple employees say that embracing remote work is paramount for the company’s diversity and inclusion efforts. “For inclusion and diversity to work, we have to recognize how different we all are, and with those differences, come different needs and different ways to thrive,” they say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gvp6LU"&gt;Here are the specific asks outlined by employees in the note:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="nSJ0Q8"&gt;We are formally requesting that Apple considers remote and location-flexible work decisions to be as autonomous for a team to decide as are hiring decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDEzWK"&gt;We are formally requesting a company-wide recurring short survey with a clearly structured and transparent communication / feedback process at the company-wide level, organization-wide level, and team-wide level, covering topics listed below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0J7Kju"&gt;We are formally requesting a question about employee churn due to remote work be added to exit interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GAWpbQ"&gt;We are formally requesting a transparent, clear plan of action to accommodate disabilities via onsite, offsite, remote, hybrid, or otherwise location-flexible work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6gwYRd"&gt;We are formally requesting insight into the environmental impact of returning to onsite in-person work, and how permanent remote-and-location-flexibility could offset that impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="P3kQoz"&gt;The letter was sent out for Apple employees to sign late Friday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqGW6r"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fR6ftS"&gt;Read the full letter below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="SHvu9z"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10592033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>TikTok says the repeat removal of the intersex hashtag was a mistake</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tessellated TikTok logos against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Yp5JK2SsRPG3dGrnOGaImYPkUEo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69408728/acastro_190723_1777_tiktok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HvqKBf"&gt;Pidgeon Pagonis, an intersex activist, noticed last week that the #intersex hashtag wasn’t working on TikTok. They couldn’t click the tag on one of their own posts and trying to search for intersex pulled up a “null” page. This was the second time Pagonis noticed the tag disappearing, and they worried that TikTok had banned it just as they were about to start a series of celebratory videos called Intersex Joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDvsUT"&gt;Pagonis usually feels safe on TikTok because people on the platform are generally receptive to intersex topics. After growing up with secrecy, lies, and shame around being intersex, Pagonis sees TikTok and other platforms as spaces where intersex people “can connect with each other and also advocate for ourselves and each other, and then other people can learn about intersex.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VaRiUr"&gt;But when the easiest way to discover intersex content on TikTok disappears, that erasure follows the historical mistreatment of intersex people. “My community is erased with a scalpel, and with words and linguistics,” says Pagonis, “but this time they’re literally erasing the word.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JuqcCC"&gt;TikTok tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that in both of the instances Pagonis noticed, the tag had been removed by mistake and was subsequently restored. But because there was no public statement about the accidental removal, Pagonis and others were left to speculate about whether it was being intentionally censored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fMyfOm"&gt;The muddiness around content removal and moderation on TikTok is an ongoing frustration for the app’s users. TikTok has &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/community-guidelines"&gt;community guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s no public list of specific words and phrases that are banned, and it’s not clear how much moderation is done algorithmically versus by actual people. Previously, TikTok has limited the reach of posts by &lt;a href="https://www.dazeddigital.com/science-tech/article/50444/1/tiktok-admits-to-censoring-lgbtq-hashtags-gay-lesbian-transgender"&gt;LGBTQ people&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/2/20991843/tiktok-bytedance-platform-disabled-autism-lgbt-fat-user-algorithm-reach-limit"&gt;disabled people&lt;/a&gt;, and people who were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21181496/tiktok-ugly-poor-users-no-promotion-guidelines-leak"&gt;deemed “ugly” or poor&lt;/a&gt;, and has been accused of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/1/21277505/tiktok-black-creators-censorship-algorithm-donation-diversity-council"&gt;suppressing Black creators&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="poe6Ov"&gt;People use different tactics to skirt TikTok’s jumbled moderation. Some lesbians on the app jokingly refer to themselves as “&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/liqawn/sorry_ill_only_respond_to_l%C3%A9_dolla_bean/"&gt;le dolla bean&lt;/a&gt;” based on the “le$bian’’ spelling that’s used to avoid their videos being removed. “It became this whole joke,” says Mar Hicks, a historian of technology, “because things that have the word lesbian in them were either getting flagged for deletion or causing the users’ accounts to get in trouble.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxhFQJ"&gt;Creators on TikTok feel that they have to be overly cautious about what they post, “because the rules change at any given moment, there’s no transparency,” Hicks says. The sudden disappearance of tags, intentional or not, has “incredibly problematic effects and negative effects on communities that are already marginalized and erased.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AF7tto"&gt;Queer people and people of color have found the guidelines are enforced “wildly differently” says Hicks, meaning their content will be suppressed or removed for supposed violations, but they get no response when they report abuse from other users. “Not only is it hurting their ability to speak and be seen on the app, but it’s also allowing them to get attacked and have hate speech thrown their way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wS0F66"&gt;Other platforms, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/24/21454554/facebook-acitivists-suspended-accounts-coastal-gaslink-pipeline"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/qj8b4x/twitter-said-it-restricted-palestinian-writers-account-by-accident"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/30/22460946/instagram-making-changes-algorithm-censoring-pro-palestinian-content"&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;, have chalked up the restriction of certain accounts or content to technical bugs, moderation errors, or problems with their algorithms. Hicks says the lack of transparency from TikTok is a serious problem, “and the same goes for any platform that is not being transparent about its standards, and its moderation tactics, and the extent of how automatic it is.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKQ8Wq"&gt;“I thought this was my happy place,” says Pagonis, whose fondness for TikTok has been shaken now that the intersex tag has vanished more than once. They still want to share videos about intersex experiences. But they’re frustrated at the lack of clarity, and wish the platform would be more intentional about uplifting marginalized voices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia and Valve are bringing DLSS to Linux</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hZvH4aEOKGkfqZe_nIsoOkH9J7E=/8x0:2632x1749/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69408431/twarren_rtx3080_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xIcCCe"&gt;Linux gamers using Valve’s Proton compatibility tool to run Windows games will be getting a performance upgrade in the future: Nvidia has announced that it’s working with Valve to bring FPS boosts using its DLSS technology featured on its RTX cards. It’s almost enough to make me want to revisit Linux gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMlmCl"&gt;DLSS, or Deep Learning Super Sampling, is a technology that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22463608/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-ti-review-test-benchmarks"&gt;lets gamers get more performance&lt;/a&gt; without having to give up too much image quality. It does this by running the game at lower-than-native resolution (say, rendering the game at 1080p when your monitor is 4K), but then upscaling the image to native resolution using some mightily impressive algorithms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lF3KWd"&gt;The tech will, of course, be exciting for people with Linux gaming computers, but it’s also interesting considering the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453584/valve-portable-gaming-pc-switch-rumor-report"&gt;rumors of Valve creating a handheld gaming device&lt;/a&gt;. We argued that DLSS could make &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22348095/nintendo-switch-nvidia-dlss-graphics-ai-explained"&gt;the next-gen Switch hit way above its weight-class&lt;/a&gt;, and the same would be true for a handheld PC without a ton of graphics horsepower, which would likely be running Linux. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h2cCCs"&gt;While Nvidia hasn’t released a list of which Proton-powered games will be getting DLSS, there are actually a surprising number of candidates. Running Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fnvidia-rtx-games-engines-apps%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F4%2F22519316%2Fnvidia-valve-proton-linux-dlss-ai-upsampling" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;list of games&lt;/a&gt; that support DLSS through &lt;a href="https://www.protondb.com"&gt;ProtonDB&lt;/a&gt;, a site that lets users report how well games work when using Proton, shows that a good portion of DLSS-enabled games are already working on Linux. That’s around 30 games out of a little over 50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t7LlNT"&gt;There is, however, an interesting question raised by Nvidia’s DLSS list — a few of the games on it actually have native Linux ports, but it seems that those may not be getting support for the tech just yet. An Nvidia spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the announcement only relates to Windows games running with Proton, which could lead to an odd quirk where gamers potentially get better performance by running the Windows version through an emulation layer, rather than the native version. We’ll only really be able to tell if that’s actually the case when the feature is released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgCkvN"&gt;Nvidia hasn’t mentioned a timeframe when DLSS will be coming to Proton (though it did mention that support for Vulkan was coming this month, and that DirectX support would be coming in the fall), but it’s nice to see that it’s still pushing to bring Linux gaming up to par with the Windows experience. As someone who tried to be a Linux gamer in the long long ago, using &lt;a href="https://www.winehq.org"&gt;vanilla Wine&lt;/a&gt; and, later, &lt;a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover"&gt;CrossOver&lt;/a&gt;, the work Nvidia and Valve are doing with Proton has made me consider setting up a Linux gaming rig again. Now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22345891/nvidia-amd-rtx-gpus-price-scalpers-ebay-graphics-cards"&gt;if only I could get a graphics card&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s why you can’t use the Siri Remote’s best feature on Disney Plus and other apps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rae05jsZeZ7Xy96tJWJe7bcRUQ0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69408279/DSCF3939.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The redesigned Siri Remote for Apple TV.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LEFtbk"&gt;Apple’s new Siri Remote introduced a gesture that makes it easy to scrub through content by turning the control pad into a scroll wheel. But a number of Apple TV users noticed that the feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22518296/apple-new-siri-remote-hbo-max-disney-plus"&gt;doesn’t work properly&lt;/a&gt; on some services, like HBO Max, or at all on others, like Disney Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQyWtu"&gt;A spokesperson for Disney Plus confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the feature — one of the best on the redesigned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22446699/apple-tv-4k-hd-siri-remote-review-features-price"&gt;Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; — isn’t supported on its service. It’s not a service issue, though, but instead related to custom video players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2k9Pz"&gt;Some streaming apps available on Apple TV use their own players, while others use the tvOS media player. The jogging gesture works with streaming apps that use Apple’s native media player, but it is not yet supported for third-party developers that use a custom media player, and that includes Disney’s streaming titan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ezjArd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The feature is supported on apps that use the tvOS media player, which Disney Plus does not&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KEE18v"&gt;What that means is that beyond just Disney Plus, the scrubbing tool may not work for any video app that uses its own media player. It’s not clear when exactly Apple will make the feature available to these app developers. But the Disney spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Disney Plus does plan to develop the tool for its own service once it does eventually become available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wcucg6"&gt;The issue had been the topic of discussion in a &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/appletv/comments/nrem4m/disney_doesnt_work_with_new_apple_tv_remotes/"&gt;Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt; from user batsforbreakfast21, who noted experiencing issues on Disney Plus but not other services like Netflix and Apple TV Plus. Other users expressed having issues with HBO Max and Peacock as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0ymlh"&gt;Neither Peacock nor HBO Max immediately returned requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cI4rcS"&gt;Ideally, the issue will be resolved quickly. Until then, the older and often &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22394083/siri-remote-apple-tv-goodbye"&gt;unfairly maligned Siri Remote&lt;/a&gt; doesn’t seem so bad, right? Anyone?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Dorsey would rather give you a bitcoin wallet than Twitter features worth paying for</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jXOrt3x6CjmbUr2ca_nHzvRTb3Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69408127/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VEEp0E"&gt;Twitter Blue — the social network’s first subscription product that adds an undo button to tweets among other minor additions like changing the color of icons and adding folders for bookmarks — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22464291/twitter-blue-subscription-service-canada-australia-undo-reader-mode"&gt;launched on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. It’s limited to Canada and Australia for now but has already garnered attention for lacking the features people would be willing to pay Twitter for, like no ads, or better tools to handle harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="klVH51"&gt;Which makes Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s thread today, the day after the product launched, somewhat humorous and frustrating. What can we say: the guy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22230028/jack-dorsey-donald-trump-twitter-ban-moderation-bitcoin-thread"&gt;loves to talk about bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;, even when other more pressing matters are at hand! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tzZlQm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Square is considering making a hardware wallet for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bitcoin?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#bitcoin&lt;/a&gt;. If we do it, we would build it entirely in the open, from software to hardware design, and in collaboration with the community. We want to kick off this thinking the right way: by sharing some of our guiding principles.&lt;/p&gt;— jack (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1400839179513339905?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Do8kR8"&gt;I’m not a Bitcoin expert, but sure, making a product in the open, with the goal of being inclusive and open source sounds fine by me, especially since Square is already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297935/square-bitcoin-purchase-170-million-investment-cryptocurrency"&gt;heavily invested&lt;/a&gt; in the currency. As with most things people tweet, best to take this as off-the-cuff musing rather than an official product announcement. Dorsey’s made similar pronouncements &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1204766078468911106?s=20"&gt;via Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; — like funding a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21010856/twitter-jack-dorsey-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-research-moderation"&gt;decentralized version of Twitter&lt;/a&gt; — that have only made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242718/twitter-bluesky-decentralized-social-media-team-project-update"&gt;small amounts of public progress&lt;/a&gt; since they were tweeted into the ether. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zI7y12"&gt;What this might highlight, though, is how Dorsey’s attention is split acting as the CEO of both Twitter and payment company Square. The issue &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/3/4/21163146/jack-dorsey-activist-investor-paul-singer-elliott-management"&gt;has been raised before&lt;/a&gt; by one of the company’s investors, Elliott Management. Running Twitter is a job he’s been increasingly checked out of, with the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitters-jack-dorsey-a-hands-off-ceo-in-a-time-of-turmoil-11603822774"&gt;reporting in October&lt;/a&gt; that Dorsey is “hands-off to the extreme, delegating most major decisions to subordinates in part so he can pursue his personal passions.” He came out and said today at the Bitcoin 2021 conference in Miami that if he wasn’t running Square and Twitter, he’d be working on bitcoin. He seems pretty good at finding a way to work on bitcoin anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KqGIsn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Jack Dorsey in Miami: “If I were not working at Square or Twitter I’d be working on Bitcoin” &lt;a href="https://t.co/qzqssqAUd1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qzqssqAUd1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Rob Wile (@rjwile) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rjwile/status/1400855150743494657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KQ33zw"&gt;Twitter’s recent sprint of new product announcements suggests &lt;em&gt;someone&lt;/em&gt; wants to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22319527/twitter-kayvon-beykpour-interview-consumer-product-decoder"&gt;change things&lt;/a&gt; at Twitter. Social audio features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570150/twitter-spaces-clubhouse-voice-rooms-testing"&gt;Spaces&lt;/a&gt; and creator subscription systems like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22301375/twitter-super-follows-communities-paid-followers"&gt;Super Follows&lt;/a&gt; are legitimately interesting — just maybe not to Dorsey. But as &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/what-twitter-blue-gets-wrong"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;’s Casey Newton notes&lt;/a&gt;, Twitter Blue, as an example of the company’s new focus on power users, doesn’t really offer many features that power users want. And if his silence on the subject is any indication, perhaps Dorsey and users are aligned in their disinterest towards the paid service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sb1ep"&gt;Jack, if you’re listening, there’s absolutely nothing stopping you from becoming a wandering ascetic, living off fake money you minted from an overclocked GPU. Just please, if you hate it so much, let someone else run your website. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDIukX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HA4QKi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile employee files suit after HR asked invasive questions about her OnlyFans account</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-saP0D0IsKjlMdLfQxIO6gMz4U8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69407426/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hvfLAr"&gt;A sales rep at a T-Mobile store in Fort Worth, Texas has filed a gender discrimination suit against the company after a member of the HR team inappropriately questioned her about having an OnlyFans account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GycML4"&gt;Caitlyn Stevens had been working at T-Mobile for nearly seven years when a male colleague became angry with her about how she was handling a customer interaction, the complaint says. He approached her “in a physically aggressive manager,” forcing a coworker to step in and stop the man from hitting her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcr5mF"&gt;Stevens reported the incident to the store manager. Rather than disciplining the male colleague who’d allegedly tried to hurt her, the manager relocated Stevens to a different location, according to the complaint. The location got less foot traffic, resulting in fewer sales for employees, Stevens says. “I did not feel like it was fair that I went to a slower location based on what had just happened,” she explains in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kq6rWZ"&gt;When Stevens submitted a complaint to HR, a man on the team called her and began asking questions about her personal life, including “whether she had a ‘sugar daddy’ and whether she had an OnlyFans account.” Stevens was shocked. “I immediately started crying,” she tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I told him I did not feel comfortable and he still continued to ask the questions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VLOzl"&gt;According to Stevens, the male HR rep said “we’ve heard that you have an OnlyFans account, is that true?” Then he added, “We’ve heard that people have seen nude pictures of you.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6oRYan"&gt;Stevens says the questions felt violating. “I felt sexually harassed, I felt uncomfortable,” she says. “The nature of the questions, when I’m literally reporting a physical assault, is not okay.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvPhAN"&gt;Stevens’ attorney, Vincent White, a partner at White, Hilferty and Albanese, says the incident shows T-Mobile sided with Stevens’ male colleague over her. “T-Mobile chose to stand with a man who had a history of violence in the workplace over a woman who was a high performer at the company for seven years,” he said in a statement. “Caitlyn Stevens’ personal life had nothing to do with store operations, while threatening coworkers with violence hinders the productivity and well-being of the entire workplace.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3DF1D"&gt;This isn’t the first time that a woman has been shamed or retaliated against for having an OnlyFans account. In April 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/otilliasteadman/mechanic-fired-onlyfans-account-indiana"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that a mechanic in Indiana was fired from her job after her bosses found out she was making amateur porn on OnlyFans outside of work. In December 2020, the &lt;em&gt;New York Post &lt;/em&gt;tried to “out” an EMT who was making ends meet through OnlyFans (whatever the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt; was trying to do here backfired — the publication was widely criticized for “doxxing someone simply for trying to earn a living” &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/onlyfans-medic-lauren-kwei-new-york-post-interview-1104943/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The incidents point to how far some companies will try to go to control the lives of their workers, while also refusing to pay people enough to allow them to maintain a single stream of income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5IINI"&gt;Stevens turned down a settlement in order to speak out about what happened. “I think she chose a much harder path here, but she realizes that this is indicative of a broader trend that many women are facing and feels strongly about changing the culture by telling her story,” says Ariella Steinhorn, founder of Lioness Strategies, a communications firm assisting in Stevens’ case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0fErus"&gt;Stevens has taken a medical leave of absence due to the stress of the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pvZkmd"&gt;T-Mobile did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition review: the right parts at a high price  </title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Long battery life, fast performance, questionable value&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="LTBhVZ"&gt;The new Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition is a slight undoing of progress, depending on how you look at it. As many gaming laptops are going thinner, this one is heavier and thicker than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21459895/alienware-m15-r3-gaming-laptop-review-intel-rtx-nvidia-15-inch"&gt;previous generations&lt;/a&gt;. Its design has been tweaked slightly in ways both good and bad, and it has fewer ports than before, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="47EX9J"&gt;Despite all of that, it’s a cause for a small celebration because of the Ryzen processor it uses, marking AMD’s return to Alienware products after a 14-year gap when the brand exclusively used Intel CPUs. And it’s a welcome return, even if this laptop won’t appeal to everyone. AMD’s high-end mobile processors have been a boon to gaming laptops for the last couple of years, bringing long battery life and fast performance that sometimes outpaces and undercuts laptops that have competing Intel processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wD8NBH"&gt;The Ryzen 7 5800H processor brings that magic to the M15 R5 Ryzen Edition, and gaming performance with its RTX 3060 doesn’t struggle to get above 60 FPS in graphically-demanding games — all thanks to being a high-wattage component. This R5 that I tested has 16GB of RAM and a 512GB NVMe SSD for a total cost of about $1,616 currently, which isn’t cheap despite being close to the most affordable version that Alienware makes. If money isn’t an issue, it can be upgraded to the more powerful Ryzen 9 5900HX with Nvidia’s RTX 3070 and more storage and RAM for $2,379. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OxCgpr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10590627"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dpH0QK"&gt;The high price is something that I couldn’t ignore while reviewing this laptop, especially since Dell (Alienware’s parent company) makes a &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-12839518?sid=VergeM15R5Review060421&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fgaming-laptops%2Fg15-ryzen-edition-gaming-laptop%2Fspd%2Fg-series-15-5515-laptop%2Fgn5515esxus" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,225&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368010/dell-g15-amd-ryzen-edition-15-inch-gaming-laptop-release-date-price-specs"&gt;G15 Ryzen Edition&lt;/a&gt; that has &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/help-me-choose/cp/hmc-g-series-video-card-laptops" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;similar GPU specs&lt;/a&gt; that should come close to what this pricier M15 R5 can do. And, if you can settle for a slightly lesser processor, there’s a $900 model in the works that has the RTX 3060, but it isn’t available yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/guD4hJMKoPrMUKowDC8q4iViNPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513767/cfaulkner_20210511_4579_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alienware ditched the glossy bezels for an all-matte look that I prefer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RSFWQOFhnK9vCAFEsaOZLQwJrEM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513763/cfaulkner_20210511_4579_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This model comes in a single colorway. It’s a dark gunmetal grey.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YpkWUo"&gt;The value doesn’t fare well outside of Dell’s world either. Asus is currently the go-to brand for excellent AMD-based gaming laptops that are easier to recommend for people who want something more portable and feature-packed, without sacrificing battery life. Compared to a similar M15 R5 configuration, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;ROG Zephyrus G15&lt;/a&gt; offers a QHD display, more storage, a better processor and a powerful RTX 3070 (albeit a lower-powered GPU than you’ll find in the M15 R5) for a few hundred dollars less. The new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465565/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Strix G15 Advantage Edition&lt;/a&gt; looks more garish next to Alienware’s laptop, but it also has fast gaming performance and high-end features for a lower price. Neither of these models feature a webcam, but that might be something you can live without. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="3WfM7n"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10591033"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AouYJZ"&gt;The M15 R5 is 19.25mm (0.75 inches) thick for most of the machine (thinner at the front, but slightly thicker in the back) and it weighs 5.34 pounds. Some configurations weigh more, going up to 5.93 pounds. Its heft is jarring if you’ve picked up an ultrabook recently, but it’s an asset in helping its high-wattage RTX 3060 graphics chip (125W maximum graphics power, 1,702MHz boost clock) to perform similarly to a low-wattage RTX 3070. Compared to thinner laptops that have a low-powered 3070, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22276367/asus-tuf-dash-f15-2021-intel-core-i7-nvidia-rtx-3070-review-gaming-laptop-specs-price"&gt;Asus’ TUF Dash 15&lt;/a&gt;, Alienware’s laptop makes up for the difference in CUDA cores with sheer power. It will likely be a solid performer well into the future — perhaps longer than some lower-powered 3070s —  despite having a technically lesser component. It’ll just be more of a chore to lug around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KWVLTW"&gt;The M15 R5 Ryzen Edition fared well while running some demanding games at their highest settings. &lt;em&gt;Red Dead Redemption 2&lt;/em&gt; managed to reach 63 frames per second. &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; ran at about 80 frames per second with its ray tracing shadows feature and DLSS switched on. &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt; ran at an average of 68 frames per second. None of them came close to fully taking advantage of the default 1080p display’s 165Hz refresh rate, but most people likely have older games in their library that should be able to display at very fast frame rates on this laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hRVdCTPFejOAFt1ge1jvnXhBRGE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513768/cfaulkner_20210511_4579_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The best parts of Alienware’s styling have been preserved from previous generations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KY7VLAdE23PihLTAx6N9PGe0en0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513764/cfaulkner_20210511_4579_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Though, the keyboard layout has gotten a little more cramped with this generation. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="of5Abq"&gt;It didn’t take long for this laptop to make a good impression with gaming performance. It took even less time to learn that it gets warm to the touch even while idling with no apps, and that when games (especially graphically-demanding ones) are running, it can get very loud. A fast and quiet gaming laptop is an oxymoron, and the M15 R5 is really just one of many offenders. But I didn’t notice signs of thermal throttling after long periods of gaming, nor did I encounter unexplainable slow-down. You just might want to wear some headphones while gaming. The speakers shoot sound out of the sides of the laptop. It’s serviceable for YouTube videos or video calls, but it doesn’t deliver enough depth or bass for entertainment purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLo0pu"&gt;This Ryzen-based gaming laptop can handle any sort of casual browser-based workflow with ease. It shouldn’t have surprised me that the M15 R5 has great battery life, since AMD’s processors have proven to bring efficiency to other gaming laptops, but it still did. This one’s 86Wh battery lasted for about seven hours of mixed use, through sustained use of Microsoft Edge with 10 or so tabs, Spotify, Slack, and some video calls. That’s great for an Alienware laptop. The M15 R3 that I reviewed last year clocked in at just one hour. Though, other AMD-based gaming laptops have the M15 R5 beat. The Strix G15 Advantage Edition lasted over nine hours for my colleague Monica Chin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4kCs9"&gt;One area where the Ryzen Edition got a little hung up is with a video export test in Adobe Premiere Pro. Our video team’s five-minute, thirty-three second 4K file took just over seven minutes to finish exporting. That’s not a bad result, but it’s not going to be fast enough for creators to quickly turn around projects and not nearly as fast as laptops with Intel processors can manage.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The display has generous viewing angles and a satisfying amount of contrast.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fmloy2WnfoM9QZ1bIBgjoAM_OdI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513770/cfaulkner_20210511_4579_0008.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unlike some gaming laptops, this one has a webcam (though it’s not great).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="w60SyS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10590952"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aWmvRj"&gt;The M15 R5’s design is different from earlier models in minor ways. Sometimes, it’s for the better. For instance, this newer model is matte-textured all around, including on its screen bezels, which looks better than the glossy bezels used in previous generations. Some people might like the M15 R3 and R4’s two-toned color design, but the R5 comes in a gunmetal silver color that is striking, and the black plastic covering the keyboard is relatively free of distractions, aside from the backlit keyboard and illuminated Alienware logo. One of my favorite changes is inside of the laptop: Alienware lets you easily upgrade the RAM and storage if you want. Some previous models had RAM soldered onto the motherboard, but this one’s more futureproof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZO8CW"&gt;Alienware shuffled around the keyboard layout, though, and it’s worse off than before. The M15 R5’s keys are still enjoyable to type on, but I make more typing mistakes because the volume keys have been delegated to the right side of the keyboard instead of the top. Also, the arrow keys were previously positioned a little lower than the rest of the keyboard to make them easy to find, but those have been shoved up in this model, resulting in a smaller right shift key. This might not be a problem once you get accustomed to typing on the M15, but it still feels like a step backwards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxacMt"&gt;The port selection isn’t as generous, either. The Ryzen Edition features three USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports, one USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port, an HDMI 2.1 port (capable of 4K output at up to 120Hz), a headphone jack, and a 2.5Gbps ethernet port. It’s not a bad lineup, but it could be better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPOoJG"&gt;Missing from this model, and all other new models that Alienware recently unveiled, is the proprietary amplifier connector for its external GPU enclosure, which has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2021/6/1/22464110/dell-alienware-graphics-amp-egpu-discontinued"&gt;officially discontinued&lt;/a&gt;. Intel-based versions of Alienware’s newest laptops, like the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-12839518?sid=VergeM15R5Review060421&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fmember%2Fshop%2Flaptops%2Falienware-m15-r6-laptop%2Fspd%2Falienware-m15-r6-laptop%2Fwnm15r6erbrs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;M15 R6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-12839518?sid=VergeM15R5Review060421&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fcty%2Fpdp%2Fspd%2Falienware-x15-r1-laptop%2Fwnx15r1esos" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;X15&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-12839518?sid=VergeM15R5Review060421&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dell.com%2Fen-us%2Fshop%2Fcty%2Fpdp%2Fspd%2Falienware-x17-r1-laptop%2Fwnx17r1esos" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;X17&lt;/a&gt;, will support Thunderbolt eGPUs, but the M15 R5 won’t because it lacks a Thunderbolt port. So, you’re just stuck with the GPU that’s inside. Thankfully, the graphics performance is great by default, but there’s a lot of unused space on the R5’s rear where that amplifier port used to be. It would have been nice if Alienware had filled it with an SD card reader and an extra USB-C port. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7IkNjwS4qeS4A6n6beXmJeNhtEc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513772/cfaulkner_20210511_4579_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alienware should have put more ports where its GPU amplifier port (RIP) used to be located.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ls0JFP0YMcMlD4tumG_U-ooKkrU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22513765/cfaulkner_20210511_4579_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Alienware logo is just one of a few elements that glows when the laptop is powered on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s4Gr3s"&gt;The M15 R5’s performance didn’t come into question during my testing. I don’t think I’ll ever tire of seeing the great battery life AMD’s processors bring, and it’s great that this GPU can hold its own next to pricier components like the RTX 3070.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="H6ZNJz"&gt;But as a whole, Alienware missed the landing when it comes to value. If you want more features for your money, even if it involves swapping some of the M15 R5’s power for a QHD screen and better portability, you should look elsewhere. The M15 R5 isn’t the jaw-dropping value that it needed to be (and that I’d hoped it would be) to steer everyone away from the 2021 gaming laptop frontrunner (so far), the Asus ROG Zephyrus G15. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The pandemic was the bloodiest year for driving in over a decade</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="weather" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sFMNOUkTGx79r-9Kn4Q59LqZT-A=/0x57:4800x3257/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69407067/1228316860.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Luis Sinco / Los Angeles Times / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZiGX0t"&gt;Road deaths jumped 7.2 percent in 2020 from the year before, hitting a 13-year high, even though people weren’t driving as much, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). But while &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/press-releases/2020-fatality-data-show-increased-traffic-fatalities-during-pandemic"&gt;NHTSA’s numbers&lt;/a&gt; paint a grim picture, they offer only a glimpse at what’s shaping up to be a historically bloody year of driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SJZNFu"&gt;Overall, 38,680 people died in car crashes in 2020, the highest number since 2007. But it’s worse than it sounds, since the number of miles driven in the US dropped by 13 percent. That means every mile someone drove last year was more dangerous than it was the year before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="27ql0J"&gt;Heeding the call to “stay home,” Americans drove less during this pandemic year. But those who did get behind the wheel engaged in more reckless behavior, like drinking and driving, speeding, and failing to buckle up. But while this certainly raises questions about our judgment as drivers, it also cast a harsh light on the hidden dangers in our nation’s road system.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nRAIFk"&gt;“It’s mind-boggling and extremely frustrating to see the tremendous loss of life from COVID compounded by preventable traffic crashes,” Pam Shadel Fischer, senior director of external engagement at the ﻿Governors Highway Safety Association (GHSA), said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qz5n2C"&gt;NHTSA found that fatalities rose in most major categories, including passenger vehicle occupants (up 5 percent), motorcyclists (up 9 percent), and bicyclists (up 5 percent). The number of pedestrian deaths in 2020 — 6,205 — was flat compared to 2019, which is still alarming, given that year was among the deadliest for pedestrians in 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZrS8o"&gt;These estimates are &lt;a href="https://injuryfacts.nsc.org/motor-vehicle/overview/comparison-of-nsc-and-nhtsa-estimates/"&gt;actually fairly conservative&lt;/a&gt;, since deaths in driveways, parking lots, or private roads are excluded. Also, if someone dies more than 30 days after their crash, it doesn’t count. That means as many as 1,000 deaths aren’t getting counted every year, according to the National Safety Council (NSC), a 108-year-old nonprofit focused on health and safety in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eZ0hBm"&gt;Using the NSC’s criteria, last year was even worse than the government is willing to admit, with an estimated total of 42,060 road deaths, up 8 percent from 2019. This also takes into account a similar decrease in total vehicle miles traveled compared to 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6aBXU"&gt;There’s plenty of anecdotal evidence to back this claim of more reckless driving. A report from last year by the GHSA noted that police in Colorado, Indiana, Nebraska, and Utah have clocked drivers going more than 100mph on highways, while in New York City, automated speed cameras issued 24,765 speeding tickets on March 27th, 2020, early in the lockdown, which was nearly double the number issued daily a month earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rencmQ"&gt;But the rise in reckless driving may say more about road design in the US than it does about Americans’ skills as drivers, said Greg Shill, associate professor at the University of Iowa College of Law and a faculty member at the National Advanced Driving Simulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n74aGb"&gt;The assumption of many traffic engineers in the US is that wide roads are safer. This relates to the concept of “induced demand,” in which road-widening projects encourage more people to drive, thus failing to improve congestion. In a year with less driving, those wide roads proved to be dangerously tempting to many drivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4uaKBt"&gt;“I’d call it the monkey’s paw of highway engineering,” he said. “Highway engineers got their wish (free flowing traffic, “Level of Service A” in the parlance) but with it came an extraordinary increase in deaths per mile traveled.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ienkbo"&gt;It’s very difficult to reverse these projects once they’ve been completed. Racial justice advocates are calling for some urban highways to be torn down altogether, but more in the name of reinvesting in communities of color that have been destroyed by racist highway projects, and less so in the name of safety. And Vision Zero, the project aimed at reducing the number of traffic fatalities to zero, has been criticized as an empty slogan without a proven record of success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DtfKa5"&gt;Shill argues that better transit is needed to get people out of their cars, but in a pandemic year, when public transit ridership across the country &lt;a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TRANSIT"&gt;plummeted&lt;/a&gt;, it’s unclear what benefit better subways and buses would have brought. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ieJ5bO"&gt;There are a host of other ideas: automated speed enforcement; reforming &lt;a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3846597"&gt;the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways&lt;/a&gt;, the 862-page manual governing traffic signs and signals; and cutting speed limits in dense areas to 20 or 25 mph. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hGVX8d"&gt;“I don’t want to overstate it, because turning around a transportation system is like turning a battleship,” Shill said. “But the new administration and new USDOT leadership seems to be genuinely concerned with this and is engaging with it. I’m eager to see what they do.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CIPcOC"&gt;But the likelihood of progress in the near term is bleak, and in the meantime, over 100 people are dying in vehicle crashes every day. We have internalized these deaths as the necessary trade-off for having the freedom to drive as much as we want. And in a year when we weren’t driving as much, those costs were laid bare for all to see. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this story about why it’s time to scrap racist bird names  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Maui parrotbill" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sewd3CDM2ebYtxUDC-DjRGa9Va8=/0x192:4734x3348/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69407061/558233783.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bYFUhi"&gt;Some 150 birds named for people tied to slavery and white supremacy could eventually&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;get new monikers as part of an ongoing reckoning with racism within the world of birding. That includes Jameson’s firefinch, named for a British naturalist who bought a young girl while in Africa “as a joke” and then drew pictures of her being brutally killed. In a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2021/bird-names-racism-audubon"&gt;new story&lt;/a&gt; this week, &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; reporter Darryl Fears breaks down the horrific history of ornithology that has managed to be scrubbed clean in many history books. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="z7F6HZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Indigenous peoples understood the animals long before white settlers supposedly “discovered” them&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TKlLoC"&gt;Fears also writes about the names these birds already had, given to them by Indigenous peoples who understood the animals long before white settlers supposedly “discovered” the creatures. There’s a push now to return to some of those names or use new ones in local languages, which continue to be mocked by a cadre of birding elite that is still largely white. Just last year the American Ornithological Society &lt;a href="https://americanornithology.org/an-apology-from-aos/"&gt;apologized&lt;/a&gt; for “inappropriate comments” its members made &lt;em&gt;nearly 10 years ago&lt;/em&gt; about a proposal to rename the Maui parrotbill to the Hawaiian name Kiwikiu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j9ViUr"&gt;I can’t do justice to Fears’ reporting here; you’ll have to read it yourself. But I can tell you that while the movement to end systemic racism within environmental science and conservation has picked up steam, it’s far from new — and there’s still a long way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F2gMle"&gt;The Audubon Society, the leading bird conservation nonprofit in the US, is still named after a man who enslaved Black people and &lt;a href="https://www.audubon.org/news/the-myth-john-james-audubon"&gt;criticized&lt;/a&gt; the emancipation of enslaved people in the Caribbean. In April, the CEO of the Audubon Society, David Yarnold, &lt;a href="https://www.audubon.org/news/national-audubon-society-announces-ceo-david-yarnold-step-down"&gt;stepped down&lt;/a&gt; after employees &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/12/audubon-society-claims-intimidation-threats-436215"&gt;came forward&lt;/a&gt; with their experiences with racism and sexism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="R62G6H"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Environmental organizations cannot operate with impunity”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YcQ1wA"&gt;“Environmental organizations cannot operate with impunity … For too long, boards have looked the other way as executive leaders have ignored or directly perpetuated racism,” said Andrés Jimenez, executive director of nonprofit Green 2.0, in &lt;a href="https://diversegreen.org/audubon-change-in-leadership-opens-door-for-opportunity/"&gt;a statement responding&lt;/a&gt; to the leadership shakeup. Jimenez’s organization puts out a report each year that has tracked diversity within environmental organizations and foundations since 2017. This year’s &lt;a href="https://grist.org/justice/green-groups-promised-a-racial-reckoning-in-2020-is-it-happening/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; found a slight bump in the average number of people of color and women on staff. It was a show of some progress — but fell far short of a full reckoning with the legacies of racism and discrimination against Black, Indigenous, and other people of color &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286924/science-racism-strike-stem-black-lives-matter-protests"&gt;within science&lt;/a&gt; and environmentalism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f1TO1r"&gt;Fears’ recent reporting follows Black birders and ornithologists making inroads in spaces that have often pushed people of color to the margins. He tells the story of Corina Newsome, one of the original organizers of the Black Birders Week that began last year following a now-notorious episode of a white woman calling the police on a Black birder in New York’s Central Park. (It’s Black Birders Week again this week.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xDr81O"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Black people, especially Black women, queer and trans people, people with disabilities, and other systemically marginalized groups have to go above and beyond to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SafeInNature?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SafeInNature&lt;/a&gt;.

(@hood_naturalist) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hood_naturalist/status/1400642352453128195?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mdhN94"&gt;“A lot of times when you think about Black people in nature, a lot of people associate that with a threat — that Black people can’t exist in nature without being threatened,” Anna Gifty Opoku-Agyeman, another organizer of the first Black Birders Week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21279801/viral-video-christian-cooper-black-birders-week-protests"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;. “So this idea that Black people are thriving in nature — they are embracing nature, they are incredibly joyful and excited about showcasing the natural world to the rest of us — is a perspective that we desperately need.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D2606L"&gt;Still, navigating the birding world while Black is fraught, Fears writes. Newsome, an ornithologist and community engagement manager for Georgia Audubon, tells Fears about the stereotypes she faces in the field. And she’s candid about what it feels like to work under the name “Audubon.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g7o4Ec"&gt;But if a new, more diverse generation of birders is successful in their push to rename both birds and institutions, a lot of titles could eventually change — including several birds named after John James Audubon. Check out Fears’ &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/interactive/2021/bird-names-racism-audubon/?utm_campaign=Hot%20News&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;_hsmi=131599593&amp;amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz%E2%80%94EfBBEzUP2qwQ02JCmgyajxveoy3zUDuSvEWmGzAuQMjBEzjMhqJ0iVuvSZlQc_6uz1uNei4G2zmfT17zemlyeZpGC0158J5TZIlIE214FDnD20uY&amp;amp;utm_content=131599593&amp;amp;utm_source=hs_email"&gt;full story&lt;/a&gt;: it shows just how much is in a name. &lt;/p&gt;
