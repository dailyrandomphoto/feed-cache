    <title>Authorities have taken down the dark web’s largest illegal marketplace</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pz8ozm"&gt;DarkMarket, reportedly the world’s largest dark web marketplace, &lt;a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/darkmarket-worlds-largest-illegal-dark-web-marketplace-taken-down"&gt;has been taken offline&lt;/a&gt; by a Europol-coordinated international operation, according to authorities (via &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-internets-biggest-darknet-just-got-taken-down-1846044148"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;).&lt;/em&gt; German law enforcement arrested the Australian man believed to be the operator of the illegal site, and seized 20 servers that hosted it, bringing an end to what had become a hotbed of illegal activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qEFkd4"&gt;Before its closure, DarkMarket hosted close to 500,000 users and had facilitated over 320,000 transactions, according to Europol. The dark web marketplace traded everything from drugs and counterfeit money to stolen credit card details and malware. Per Europol’s estimate, the site traded the equivalent of €140 million in today’s money, in a mix of bitcoin and monero. European authorities plan to use seized DarkMarket servers from Ukraine and Moldova to investigate the buyers and sellers who used the site for criminal transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXIW8G"&gt;DarkMarket was uncovered as part of a larger investigation into web-hosting company Cyberbunker, &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/jan/13/australian-man-arrested-in-germany-over-worlds-largest-darknet-marketplace"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. Cyberbunker (which is actually located in a former NATO bunker) housed servers for both The Pirate Bay and WikiLeaks in the past, and if this DarkMarket case is any example, seems to be a valuable starting point for future investigations into other illegal sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcE0ZR"&gt;The last several years have seen a vise-like grip tighten around dark internet venues like DarkMarket. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/3/18528211/wall-street-market-silkkitie-valhalla-dark-web-takedown-police-germany"&gt;Wall Street Market&lt;/a&gt;, another dark web marketplace, met a similar end in 2020 during a European investigation and other sites &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/26/21403362/empire-market-dark-web-drug-marketplace-police-shutdown-silk-road-alphabay"&gt;like Empire Market&lt;/a&gt; have disappeared entirely, whether out of fear of prosecution or the operators cutting their losses and taking the money. Whatever advantage sites like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/14/15975140/alphabay-dark-web-drug-marketplace-police-shutdown-silk-road"&gt;Alphabay&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/2/4794780/fbi-seizes-underground-drug-market-silk-road-owner-indicted-in-new"&gt;The Silk Road&lt;/a&gt; had years ago seems to have disappeared as government agencies have gotten more aggressive in hunting down these marketplaces and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/17/18226718/alphabay-takedown-drug-marketplace-federal-arrest"&gt;more capable of understanding how they work&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this report that uses GPS to prove Parler users stormed the Capitol</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the Parler logo seen in front of..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4XLZc_8zIB8ZCyRuNyC_D72RUaQ=/0x163:4216x2974/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68658995/1230527893.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zIpMGT"&gt;You should &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/parler-users-breached-deep-inside-u-s-capitol-building-1846042905?rev=1610480731991"&gt;go read this &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224689/parler-posts-gps-data-archived-independent-researchers-amazon-apple-google-capitol"&gt;Parler’s leaked GPS data&lt;/a&gt; to show that its users were among the mob that stormed the Capitol last Wednesday. The report comes in the wake of the social network’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/10/22223956/parler-ceo-john-matze-lawyers-vendors-abandoning"&gt;near-complete removal from the Internet&lt;/a&gt;, and is a good read for anyone who’s been following the story. The reporters, Dell Cameron and Dhruv Mehrotra, had to sift through tons of posts to build a map of the riot:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="YMnG5x"&gt;Gizmodo has mapped nearly 70,000 geo-located Parler posts and on Tuesday isolated hundreds published on January 6 near the Capitol where a mob of pro-Trump supporters had hoped to overturn a democratic election and keep their president in power. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="RCOHeB"&gt;When Parler went down, a researcher was able to exploit &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/parler-hack-data-public-posts-images-video/"&gt;some terrible security practices&lt;/a&gt; to download almost all its data — including videos that contained tagged GPS locations. This is how &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo&lt;/em&gt; tracked the mob’s movement: from a Trump rally held earlier in the day to, eventually, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217601/congress-capitol-building-takeover-coup-photos-pro-trump-mob"&gt;inside the nation’s Capitol building&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="COijLr"&gt;Since the Capitol riot, almost every company that Parler works with has dropped them as a client, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;Amazon, which hosted the site’s data&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221648/google-suspends-bans-parler-play-store"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, which hosted the app on their stores. The companies banned the site because of claims that it held calls for violence against the US government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTNSY7"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Gizmodo’s&lt;/em&gt; report doesn’t show how wide-spread the problem was on the site, it certainly shows that that Parler was actively used by people who took place in the attack. It goes into detail about what the mob did, and how the GPS data shows certain moments that have been burned into many of our memories, so &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/parler-users-breached-deep-inside-u-s-capitol-building-1846042905?rev=1610480731991"&gt;it’s well worth the read&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia and AMD address the great GPU shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/If9npGXS6maQ24zBKQaJBcPMTPI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68658906/shollister_201117_4303_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WdhVgK"&gt;Nvidia’s new RTX 3080, 3070, 3060 Ti and 3090 and the AMD RX 6800 and 6800 XT are all incredibly hard to find, selling out instantly whenever they appear, due to an incredible level of demand that makes these GPUs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;worth many hundreds of dollars more than MSRP&lt;/a&gt;. A Trump tax and surging cryptocurrency prices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22217206/nvidia-amd-gpu-trump-tax-china-tariff-exemption-expire"&gt;may be about to make them even more expensive, too&lt;/a&gt;. Many older graphics cards are sold out online as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XspOJm"&gt;This week, Nvidia and AMD finally have some updates — and it’s bittersweet news. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V8ryaZ"&gt;On the plus side, AMD tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; it expects to sell more of its own reference design RX 6800, 6800 XT and RX 6900 XT cards on its own website in the first quarter of 2021 at their sticker prices, which should mean $579, $649 and $999 instead of inflated ones. But AMD is only committing to make them available “to as many gamers as possible,” which may not reassure buyers &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/amds-radeon-rx-6800-cards-sell-out-instantly-sparking-cries-of-paper-launch"&gt;who felt AMD had a paper launch to begin with&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9GnCLw"&gt;Nvidia, meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4398578-nvidia-corporation-nvda-presents-19th-annual-j-p-morgan-tech-auto-forum-conference-transcript"&gt;is now saying&lt;/a&gt; that supplies of its GPUs to both consumers and partners  “will likely remain lean through Q1,” and we’re not even talking about the first quarter of the year — Nvidia’s fiscal Q1 doesn’t end&lt;em&gt; until late April&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;That’s an awfully long wait. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ewaPiu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The true price of a PlayStation 5","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"},{"title":"Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"},{"title":"Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21534142/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3070-review"},{"title":"Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21726429/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-ti-review"},{"title":"AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21571414/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-review"},{"title":"AMD Radeon RX 6800 review","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21572796/amd-radeon-rx-6800-review-4k-gaming-test-benchmarks"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="g0Fq6r"&gt;Again, it’s demand, not just supply constraints, that are keeping graphics cards out of our hands. Nvidia tells us that since launch, its $499-and-up RTX 30-series GPUs have sold almost twice as much as the RTX 20-series did after the same amount of time. (The RTX 30-series is a much bigger upgrade than the previous gen was, mind you — there weren’t a lot of games that took advantage of Nvidia’s ray tracing at the time, and people’s GTX 10-series cards were still holding up just fine.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPvvEd"&gt;Nvidia does at least seem to think crypto miners aren’t snapping up all the cards quite yet, despite the sky-high prices we’ve recently seen for Bitcoin and Ethereum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7UYmew"&gt;“If crypto demand begins or if we see a meaningful amount,” said CFO Colette Kress &lt;a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4398578-nvidia-corporation-nvda-presents-19th-annual-j-p-morgan-tech-auto-forum-conference-transcript"&gt;at a recent investor conference&lt;/a&gt;, “we can also use that opportunity to restart the CMP product line to address ongoing mining demand.” CMP refers to Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/us/Graphics-Card/GV-NP106D5-6G-rev-11-12-13"&gt;dedicated crypto mining GPUs&lt;/a&gt;, which strip away the video ports miners don’t need because they aren’t driving graphics to a monitor, making them them more profitable for Nvidia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B5ppHa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Only Asus has admitted to higher GPU prices so far&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6uB41J"&gt;As far as whether &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22217206/nvidia-amd-gpu-trump-tax-china-tariff-exemption-expire"&gt;Trump’s taxes&lt;/a&gt; might impact the price of graphics cards, Nvidia isn’t saying much — but AMD CEO Lisa Su claims the company is trying its best to keep prices down. Here’s a quote &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16409/amd-ceo-dr-lisa-su-interview-on-2021-demand-supply-tariffs-xilinx-and-epyc"&gt;transcribed by AnandTech&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="uPYXzN"&gt;We knew about the expiration of some tariff policies, and in advance worked towards a more flexible supply chain as it relates to AMD. We are committed to keeping GPU pricing as close to our suggested retail pricing as much as possible, because it’s the only way to be fair to the users. Normally when we have GPU launches, our own branded cards are available initially but then fade away for our partners to pick up. This time around we’re not phasing out our RX 6000 series, enabling us to sell direct to customers as low as possible. We’re encouraging partners to do the same. Not only tariffs, but the COVID environment has increased shipping and freight costs, which are hard to avoid. As we get into a more normal environment, this should improve. This also matters for our planned graphics updates through the first half of the year, as we have a lot of product coming to market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xfrMLa"&gt;That sounds good, but it’s still fairly noncommittal — and feels like a step back from &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/amd-expects-aibs-to-sell-radeon-rx-6800-series-at-msrp-in-4-to-8-weeks"&gt;what AMD told &lt;em&gt;Hardware Unboxed&lt;/em&gt; in November&lt;/a&gt;, about how partners should be able to sell the RX 6800 XT at its original $649 MSRP within eight weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IA4R40"&gt;During their back-to-back CES 2021 keynotes today, AMD praised how its new graphics cards gave the company “leadership at the high end” and noted that “many gamers are excited about the Radeon RX 6000 series,” while Nvidia acknowledged that “these products have been hard to find, and we want to thank you for your patience as we continue to work hard to catch up.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDN4uG"&gt;It’s going to be a wait, and you shouldn’t be surprised if Nvidia’s just-announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226546/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3060-specs-price-release-date"&gt;$329 GeForce RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt; is hell to buy, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/10/29/21539965/nvidia-rtx-3070-preorders-sold-out-micro-center-best-buy-newegg"&gt;just like its predecessors&lt;/a&gt;. Like many have asked: why can’t we just buy one and they ship it when it’s ready?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IaPQPa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The gaming industry keeps failing miserably at selling its most important products","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ushZvs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 8:48 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added AMD CEO Lisa Su’s thoughts on Trump’s tariffs and pricing, thanks to AnandTech.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Galaxy S21 Ultra may be the next big gadget to come in brown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n_w7UJ-kedwkqSE56U1tVZV7bxE=/0x0:720x480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68658892/ErjR_QYXcAMdE1r.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra lineup.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Roland Quandt &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349058979578654725" target="_blank"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YtPDA9"&gt;Samsung’s next top-of-the-line smartphone may come in brown, according to leaked &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349057583638839304"&gt;marketing&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349058979578654725"&gt;renders&lt;/a&gt; of the entire Galaxy S21 lineup shared by &lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; writer Roland Quandt, and I have to say that it’s giving me some &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2011/fond-memories-microsoft-zune-brown/"&gt;serious Microsoft Zune vibes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ULPFtC"&gt;The phone won’t &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; come in brown, though — it appears there are five colors planned for Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra, including that brown, and you can see all of them at the top of this post and pictured below. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DazcvkXo4koT1qgPJigV-Oc21_A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22231665/ErjQbLTXUAI_3Ww.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Roland Quandt &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1349057583638839304" target="_blank"&gt;on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another render of the S21 Ultra lineup.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P7Zd81"&gt;Other notable phones have been brown-&lt;em&gt;ish&lt;/em&gt;. I’d argue that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/19/16323570/apple-new-iphone-8-review-plus-2017"&gt;the gold iPhone 8’s aluminum&lt;/a&gt; could look like a very light brown in the right light, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/18/17871816/apple-iphone-xs-max-review-camera-processor-battery-price"&gt;gold iPhone XS’s back&lt;/a&gt; has some brown tones. Samsung edged toward brown with the “Mystic Bronze” color offered on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333566/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-5g-announced-price-release-date-1449-99"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 5G&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21372109/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra-review-camera-price-photos-s-pen-notes"&gt;Galaxy Note 20 Ultra&lt;/a&gt; (though that color also has a lot of pink, in my eyes). But unlike those recent iPhones and Samsung phones, the S21 Ultra’s brown can’t be mistaken for a gold or a bronze — it’s a dark, earthy brown, and I kinda like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XPxMv3"&gt;Samsung is also expected to announce two versions of the non-Ultra S21: the Galaxy S21 and a larger Galaxy S21 Plus. Each of those models will come in slightly different sets of colors, based on the renders shared by Quandt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5NV8v"&gt;The S21 may come in four colors, including a white and a lighter black that seem to be S21 exclusives. (The white is my personal favorite of all of the phones.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this NYT story about losing $220 million in bitcoin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="bitcoin strength in numbers 1020" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bm1P_8jADe9zYCrvuv7ATOvifL0=/1x0:1020x679/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68658418/20130520-07511828--btc.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZYsYyB"&gt;There aren’t many good ways to lose $220 million, but &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html"&gt;this &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; highlights a particularly egregious one — losing millions of dollars in bitcoin because you forgot the password to your digital wallet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ZMyTe"&gt;Stefan Thomas’ 7,002 bitcoin (worth roughly $220 million) are locked away in an IronKey hard drive, according to &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt;’s Nathaniel Popper. The problem is he can’t remember the password, and he’s just two failed password attempts closer to losing them forever due to IronKey’s strict security protocols. There is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alexstamos/status/1348999856111591424"&gt;the possibility of paying someone to crack the drive&lt;/a&gt;, but Thomas would have to have the time and money to make that happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFzWFX"&gt;It’s a darkly comedic scenario, and Popper’s story hits all of the cryptocurrency classics to help explain it. There’s mention of the volatile nature of bitcoin’s value and the currency’s mysterious creator, but what the article makes staggeringly clear is how common losing bitcoin actually is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5sn9X"&gt;Two other people get singled out in Thomas’ story of woe, but it’s a surprisingly common tale. Of the 18.5 million bitcoin currently in existence, roughly 20 percent (around $140 billion) are lost in inaccessible wallets, Popper writes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nmPE0y"&gt;There have been other high-value wallets locked out in the past, with contents ranging from &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/i-forgot-my-pin-an-epic-tale-of-losing-dollar30000-in-bitcoin/"&gt;$30,000&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/quest-to-liberate-bitcoin-from-old-zip-file/"&gt;$300,000&lt;/a&gt;, but Thomas’ story is a reminder of how persistent this problem is among bitcoin users and how expensive it has become. The secure and decentralized nature of bitcoin is great — until it collides with simple human forgetfulness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6xgGmb"&gt;You can read the whole story &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/12/technology/bitcoin-passwords-wallets-fortunes.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and appreciate just how much &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schadenfreude"&gt;schadenfreude&lt;/a&gt; bitcoin continues to generate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD will let consumers buy the Threadripper Pro directly</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ewUyXFbhAjVTw85ZzpCkdPSZAEo=/173x0:1073x600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68658343/489185_threadripper_pro_chip_1920x600.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: AMD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JmM3g8"&gt;If you’ve yearned for the power of the Threadripper Pro, but &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/first-tests-amds-ryzen-threadripper-pro-new-muscle-in-workstation-cpus"&gt;haven’t wanted to buy a ThinkStation&lt;/a&gt;, you’re in luck: starting in March, AMD will begin selling the CPUs directly to consumers, ending Lenovo’s exclusive access to the processor line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g5DRq7"&gt;While the vanilla Threadripper seems like the peak of computing power to many (myself included), &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16396/the-amd-wrx80-chipset-a-few-boards-for-3rd-gen-threadripper-pro"&gt;there are certain benefits the Pro line offers&lt;/a&gt; that would be seriously beneficial to those who need them: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rulfnL"&gt;Memory channels are doubled, from four to eight&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5drrJ9"&gt;PCI-E lanes are doubled, from 64 to 128&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QRsVtF"&gt;Memory capacity is expanded from 256GB to 2TB (!!!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="GE6WXD"&gt;To sum up those massive numbers into a more real-world picture, the Threadripper Pro allows users to work with larger datasets due to its expanded memory capacity. It also allows double the expansion for users who need tons of graphics or networking cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VpGknQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;AMD Ryzen Threadripper PRO processors will now be directly available to consumers starting in March 2021!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Boasting up to 64 cores, 128 PCIe 4.0 lanes, and 8 channels of memory, Threadripper PRO is the world’s fastest workstation processor: &lt;a href="https://t.co/MKtJBTJT0A"&gt;https://t.co/MKtJBTJT0A&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/cj1SorEKUY"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cj1SorEKUY&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— AMD Ryzen (@AMDRyzen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AMDRyzen/status/1349093643840323584?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="on5bVD"&gt;Of course, all of these features mean nothing without motherboards that can support them — after all, what would be the point of 128 PCI-E lanes if the motherboard only had 4 PCI-E 16x slots? &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16396/the-amd-wrx80-chipset-a-few-boards-for-3rd-gen-threadripper-pro"&gt;This &lt;em&gt;AnandTech&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; points out three motherboards that should be coming to support the CPUs, but it’s not likely that we’ll see the same amount of variety and choice that we do with consumer motherboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6jEIc"&gt;There’s no word yet on pricing, but regular Threadripper CPUs aren’t exactly cheap. Still, if you need the capabilities of this kind of CPU, you’re probably making some money using it (hence the “pro” moniker), and these chips offer some features, like 64 threads and PCI-E gen 4, to workstation users that Intel simply doesn’t provide outside its server products.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US to require negative test from international travelers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Entertainment &amp;amp;amp; Tourism Industries In New York City Struggle Under Pandemic Restrictions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VrsSENZYpn3CQQRGRsrV2pnwyZk=/0x160:5087x3551/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68658201/1284450539.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Noam Galai/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="G4q1cQ"&gt;Anyone traveling to the United States on an international flight will have to show proof of a negative COVID-19 test within three days before&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;the trip, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0112-negative-covid-19-air-passengers.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Tuesday. The order will go into effect on January 26th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pb16i5"&gt;The sweeping requirement comes a few weeks after the CDC mandated that anyone flying in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/25/22199682/covid-test-uk-travelers-us-cdc-virus-mutation"&gt;from the United Kingdom&lt;/a&gt; must receive a negative test result within the 72 hours prior to their flight. That order was based on concerns about a more contagious coronavirus variant spreading through the UK. That variant is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22206522/coronavirus-test-variant-contagious-uk-gene"&gt;already present&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e64LzS"&gt;Testing “can make travel safer, healthier, and more responsible by reducing spread on planes, in airports, and at destinations,” even though it doesn’t eliminate all risk of COVID-19 spread, CDC Director Robert Redfield said in a &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/media/releases/2021/s0112-negative-covid-19-air-passengers.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wsJ911"&gt;US airlines &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-transportation-officials-airlines-spar-with-cdc-over-testing-vs-quarantines-for-international-flights-11603996361?mod=article_inline"&gt;argue&lt;/a&gt; that this type of program should replace travel bans and other restrictions that are now in place. People who are not citizens or permanent residents are currently &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/travelers/from-other-countries.html"&gt;not allowed to travel&lt;/a&gt; into the US if they’ve been in countries including China and the UK in the 14 days before their trip. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMEbDM"&gt;“We believe a well-planned program focused on increasing testing of travelers to the United States will further these objectives in a much more effective way than the blanket travel restrictions currently in place,” Nick Calio, chief executive of Airlines for America, a trade group, said &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2021/01/05/airlines-testing-international-covid-flights/"&gt;in a letter&lt;/a&gt; to Vice President Mike Pence earlier this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fRtrJa"&gt;Testing might catch some travelers infected with the coronavirus, but it’s not a perfect system: someone might test negative the day before a trip, and then develop symptoms or contract the virus on their way to the airport. COVID-19 is also already spreading at record levels within the US. An average of around 250,000 cases are reported each day. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Exclusive: Apple held talks with EV startup Canoo in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zbwGAeCNL-Dc9hiPI5oafigJnsA=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68658125/canoo_Design_Exterior_09.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Canoo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tOxNU7"&gt;Apple held meetings with California EV startup Canoo in the first half of 2020 as part of the Silicon Valley giant’s secretive effort to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163939/apple-self-driving-car-john-giannandrea-ai-siri"&gt;advance its own electric vehicle project&lt;/a&gt;, three people familiar with the talks have told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The two companies discussed options ranging from investment to an acquisition, according to two of the people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qcBkxi"&gt;Canoo’s scalable electric vehicle platform, or “skateboard,” is largely what drew Apple’s interest, the people said. The platform is different from ones developed by other startups and larger automakers because it integrates more of the car’s electronics, allowing for greater flexibility in cabin design. It also features steer-by-wire technology, which also increases design flexibility and is not yet widely adopted in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9bfWU"&gt;Canoo was more interested in taking on an investment from Apple, two of the people said. Ultimately, the talks fell apart. Canoo has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22179588/canoo-delivery-vehicle-nasdaq-spac-merger-listing-public"&gt;since become a publicly traded company&lt;/a&gt; after merging with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;blank check fund&lt;/a&gt; that was listed on the NASDAQ in late 2020. Apple has made at least one other acquisition in the mobility space in recent years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18758820/drive-ai-self-driving-startup-shutting-down-apple"&gt;buying Drive.ai in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oq1mYL"&gt;“Canoo doesn’t openly comment on strategic discussions, relationships or partnerships unless deemed appropriate,” Tony Aquila, Canoo’s executive chairman, said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Apple declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7rcEe2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The talks happened at a crucial financial moment for Canoo&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U7BVy8"&gt;News of Apple’s interest in Canoo comes as &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports that the tech company is &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/uk-hyundai-motor-apple/apple-hyundai-set-to-agree-electric-car-tie-up-says-korea-it-news-idUSKBN29F0C1"&gt;negotiating with Hyundai to make a self-driving electric vehicle as early as 2024&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s vehicle project, codenamed “Project Titan,” has shapeshifted multiple times over the years. But the company has now &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-07/apple-s-aapl-tesla-tsla-killer-won-t-ship-for-at-least-half-a-decade?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reportedly refocused on making an autonomous electric vehicle&lt;/a&gt; and has been holding meetings with automakers as small as Canoo and as big as Hyundai as it looks to outsource things like technical design and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ostxcV"&gt;Hyundai and Canoo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21133461/hyundai-canoo-electric-cars-partership-kia"&gt;previously announced a plan to co-develop electric vehicles in February 2020&lt;/a&gt;, though that project appears to be unrelated to the startup’s talks with Apple. Canoo refers to its partnership with Hyundai in recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an “engineering services agreement” that will see the companies co-develop a platform to power a “small segment electric vehicle.” But Canoo has not disclosed whether it has been paid for the Hyundai deal, or whether any work has begun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p1sE4y"&gt;Canoo was founded in late 2017 by a small group that split out from struggling EV startup Faraday Future, including multiple former BMW executives. As &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;first reported, the effort was funded by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20899436/discrimination-lawsuit-canoo-foreign-backers-ev-startup-british-chinese-government"&gt;a Chinese investor who is the son-in-law of a former CCP leader&lt;/a&gt;, and the family in charge of Taiwanese tech company TPK, which supplies touchscreen technology to Apple. Canoo plans to make commercial electric vehicles, like delivery vans or food trucks, as well as a consumer-focused van that will be sold on a subscription basis. All of Canoo’s vehicles are powered by that same scalable skateboard technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="THdRzC"&gt;The talks with Apple came at a crucial time for Canoo, which lost $182.3 million in 2019 while working on its first prototype vehicle and entered 2020 with just $29 million in the bank, according to &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001750153/000121390020041124/f424b31220_hennessycapacq4.htm#TOC001"&gt;a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="tB6p7P"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Canoo met with companies and investors across Silicon Valley and China before going public&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QCWDDY"&gt;Canoo took meetings with a variety of companies from Silicon Valley, China, and elsewhere in 2019 and 2020, the people said. But as deals failed to materialize, the startup needed short-term money. It took a $7 million loan from the government’s pandemic Paycheck Protection Program and, as talks with Apple dragged on, another $15 million total from Pak Tam Li (the Chinese investor) and the Chiang family (the owners of TPK) in March 2020, according to the SEC filing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fwAYXs"&gt;Canoo eventually started negotiations with the blank check fund, Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp. IV, later in the year. It was one of the first startups to jump on this trend of using a so-called “special purpose acquisition company” to shortcut the traditional path to becoming publicly traded. As that deal was worked out, the Chiang family put another $80 million into the startup, and the soon-to-be executive chairman invested $35 million, according to the SEC filing. Canoo raised some $600 million when the deal closed near the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sUb0V0"&gt;While Canoo now has the money it sought at the beginning of 2020, that hasn’t softened its ambitions to work with big companies like Apple. The startup said in that same SEC filing that it is “currently in discussions with multiple other blue-chip industry participants interested in leveraging Canoo’s technologies and engineering expertise for their own commercial products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KugtI1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Origin updates EVO15-S and EVO17-S with new RTX 3000 series GPUs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Origin EVO15-S angled to the left, open, on a red and black background. The screen displays the Origin logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lDrowTpiE4GeqHf4ZNJM0jgBmWY=/0x267:1600x1334/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68658070/evo15_s_right_wide_angle_open_keyboard.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Origin EVO15-S, now available with RTX 3000 graphics.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Origin&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5XxNcR"&gt;Origin has upgraded its EVO15-S and EVO17-S gaming notebooks and its NT-15 and NT-17 workstations to include Nvidia’s latest GeForce RTX 3000 mobile graphics cards (up to an RTX 3080 with Max-Q design). &lt;/p&gt;

You can select a 300Hz 1080p display (a new option for the 2021 models), a 144Hz 1080p display, or a 60Hz UHD display (which is an OLED on the 15-inch models). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GitHub reportedly fired a Jewish employee who warned co-workers to stay safe from Nazis</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7gUmJe"&gt;GitHub reportedly fired a Jewish employee after he posted a message in Slack that said “stay safe homies, Nazis are about” the day of the attack on the US Capitol, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-github-backlash-jewish-employee-termination-2021-1"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="duOMMw"&gt;The message sparked controversy inside the company, with one colleague criticizing him for using divisive language. GitHub’s HR team chastised the employee for using the word “Nazi” in a company Slack channel. Two days later, GitHub allegedly fired him, citing vague patterns of behavior. The employee asked &lt;em&gt;Business Insider &lt;/em&gt;to remain anonymous for fear of online harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFGQdP"&gt;The move shows a lack of understanding on the part of GitHub management, both about the gravity of the attack on the US Capitol and the contextual use of the word Nazi. After &lt;em&gt;Business Insider &lt;/em&gt;published its report, the company was widely criticized on Twitter for trying to “both sides” the issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oivAJ1"&gt;Now, roughly 200 of GitHub’s 1,700 employees have signed a letter asking executives to take a stronger stance against anti-Semitism and white supremacy. They also want to know why the employee was fired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VhdsGZ"&gt;GitHub CEO Nat Friedman told workers that “the company is actively looking into the circumstances surrounding the separation of an employee last week and will take any and all appropriate action following a thorough investigation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ugllTz"&gt;The employee said he posted the message because he was concerned for his relatives and co-workers living in Washington, DC. He had family who died in the Holocaust and saw that some of the rioters were associated with neo-Nazi organizations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VaBDSw"&gt;GitHub, a developer platform, was acquired by Microsoft in 2018. The day of the attack on the US Capitol, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/us-capitol-siege-business-leaders-react-jamie-dimon-alexis-ohanian-2021-1"&gt;Microsoft President Brad Smith retweeted a statement&lt;/a&gt; calling on President Trump to “put an end to the chaos and to facilitate the peaceful transition of power.” &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/11/facebook-halts-political-donations-after-capitol-riot.html"&gt;Microsoft also said it would pause political contributions&lt;/a&gt;, much like Facebook and Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gnBVpU"&gt;Before his Slack account was deactivated, the employee expressed bewilderment at the blowback he’d received from his message. “I did not know that, as a Jew, it would be so polarizing to say this word,” he said in a Slack channel for Jewish employees. “We grew up saying [Nazi]. It was a story we told because we had to— the decimation of whole lines of ancestry were at the hands of people who went by that title.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkhWhx"&gt;This is the second time GitHub has faced significant criticism from employees in recent years. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/10/9/20906605/github-ice-contract-immigration-ice-dan-friedman"&gt;more than 150 workers signed a letter asking the company to cancel a  $200,000 contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement&lt;/a&gt;. It also comes on the heels of recent employee activism at companies like Twitter and Google. In December, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150355/google-fires-timnit-gebru-facial-recognition-ai-ethicist"&gt;Google fired AI ethicist Timnit Gebru&lt;/a&gt;, prompting a wave of condemnation from tech workers across Silicon Valley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SaqB4i"&gt;GitHub did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
