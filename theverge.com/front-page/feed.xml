  &lt;p&gt;How stable are stablecoins?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="L9tyJa"&gt;What if a digital currency wipeout could injure — or even destroy — the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem? Lately, there’s been a focus on stablecoins, the quiet &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-11/latest-hack-shows-power-of-stablecoins-in-decentralized-finance"&gt;power players&lt;/a&gt; of the cryptocurrency space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3MHUa"&gt;Questions about stablecoins, particularly one called Tether, have been knocking around in  financial circles for months: are they as stable as they ought to be? A vocal group of people — including &lt;a href="https://www.thestreet.com/jim-cramer/jim-cramer-fixated-tether-cryptocurrency"&gt;the likes of Jim Cramer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nouriel/status/1333485054589345793"&gt;Nouriel Roubini&lt;/a&gt;, podcasters &lt;a href="https://cryptocriticscorner.com/2021/05/25/episode-1-tether-a-stable-discussion/"&gt;Bennett Tomlin and Cas Piancey&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://bitfinexed.medium.com"&gt;pseudonymous blogger Bitfinex’ed&lt;/a&gt; — have raised questions about Tether as a possible systemic risk to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. On August 9th, Tether put out an &lt;a href="https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tether_assuranceconsolidated_reserves_report_2021-06-30.pdf"&gt;attestation about its reserves&lt;/a&gt;, a way of reassuring users that the most popular stablecoin is, well, stable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Va3zUm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some Tether critics fear that its &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; use is to keep the price of Bitcoin high&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ylye56"&gt;The attestation seems unlikely to reassure Tether’s most vocal critics, some of whom fear that its &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; use is to keep the price of Bitcoin high. The company has also been investigated by the New York attorney general for claims around its backing and settled with the NYAG earlier this year. As part of the settlement, Tether is prohibited from doing business in New York state, the capital of the US financial world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8CvU3g"&gt;Fears around stablecoins aren’t just limited to Tether. After months of hemming and hawing from regulators, chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission Gary Gensler &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608096/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-sec-gary-gensler-regulation"&gt;has now clearly asked&lt;/a&gt; for more authority to regulate cryptocurrency. “We have a role as a nation to protect those investors against fraud.” Janet Yellen, the Treasury secretary, met with the President’s Working Group on Financial Markets to &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/risks-of-crypto-stablecoins-attract-attention-of-yellen-fed-and-sec-11626537601?mod=article_inline"&gt;discuss stablecoins specifically&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXeQkM"&gt;Right now, there’s no standardized way for stablecoins to disclose the assets that back them. It seems like an obvious target for regulators, but there’s also a way to do an end run around the needs for stablecoins at all. In fact, the way to get rid of stablecoins might just be… the dollar but digital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gH8Q5V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is a stablecoin?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="YS5IoP"&gt;These digital currencies, which are pegged to other assets such as the US dollar or the Euro, are primarily used as payment mechanisms. Stablecoins’ name reflects the idea that the peg makes them less volatile than cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum or Bitcoin, which can vary widely in value. Typically, when someone sets up a stablecoin, there’s a reserve for the assets, which are held as collateral. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tb010p"&gt;Some stablecoins are centralized, as well. With cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, if you’re hacked and lose money, well, sorry, you’re fucked. This isn’t the case for some stablecoins; when &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-10/hackers-steal-600-million-in-likely-largest-defi-crypto-theft"&gt;$600 million was stolen from PolyNetwork&lt;/a&gt;, Tether simply froze the $33 million of its tokens that were included in the heist. That rendered those funds useless to the attacker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UaQ0w0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tether is already in contact with the project that suffered the breach.&lt;br&gt;Process: project engages discussions with law enforcement + Tether. Tether validate the freeze and programs reissuance of funds.&lt;br&gt;Happened in the past with Kucoin hack and others.&lt;/p&gt;— Paolo Ardoino (@paoloardoino) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/paoloardoino/status/1425199265832476676?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qy51h3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do people use stablecoins for?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8bE0ui"&gt;Payments, says Bruce Mizrach, an economics professor at Rutgers. The real competitors for stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) are things like Venmo and PayPal. Most of the time, the fees they charge for transactions are relatively low, &lt;a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=267119122101064078121082011082016077034092086004057035102127030103105107076070111087038017120036122008044070111011107011004103009046056035086108127122007023044076099107065093123103028093120117001000099086116006087001069087110113121007004127&amp;amp;EXT=pdf&amp;amp;INDEX=TRUE"&gt;Mizrach found&lt;/a&gt;; Tether’s fees are usually less than a dollar, while out-of-network ATM fees are about $3.08. (About 1 percent of transactions have fees higher than $25, though.) The same is true of USDC, another stablecoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JxGtL4"&gt;They’re also used as a place to store value when investors exit cryptocurrency trades, says Richard Li, CEO of 4K, &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/rolexes-in-defi-nft-marketplace-4k-raises-3m-to-combine-nfts-and-luxury-goods"&gt;an NFT marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. Imagine an investor — we’ll call him Mars Vulrich — wants to lock in some profit he made in Bitcoin. Now, our friend Mars can exit the trade back into US dollars and send that to his bank account, but it’ll take a couple of days. Some of that delay is that Mars has to comply with anti-money laundering laws to exit cryptocurrency back into the US dollar. During that time, if Mars sees a cool opportunity to get into another cryptocurrency investment, he won’t be able to reach that money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7p9vnT"&gt;Now, he could instead exit his Bitcoin trade into a dollar-pegged cryptocurrency. The relatively quick transaction would mean that his funds would be available to go into another investment right away. If Mars is trying to do rapid trading, he might choose to do this instead of moving back and forth between the traditional banking system and cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8Z9eD"&gt;Stablecoins can also be used for margin trading. Our buddy Mars can borrow money from an exchange such as Kraken, which will use its own funds to help execute the trade. But Mars has to put up some collateral for the loan, and stablecoins can be useful for that. Margin trading is risky — it can lead to very big losses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mC6hlE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This seems like something that would interest government regulators, like the Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6wMOjp"&gt;It is! SEC chairman Gary Gensler has suggested that stablecoins might actually fall under the SEC’s authority, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/gensler-aspen-security-forum-2021-08-03"&gt;in remarks at the Aspen Security Forum&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, he said that stablecoins “also may be securities and investment companies. To the extent they are, we will apply the full investor protections of the Investment Company Act and the other federal securities laws to these products.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="w3PCvT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, but that hasn’t happened yet?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2jpUxi"&gt;Nope. Cryptocurrency regulation is kind of a hot topic right now, though, and Gensler used to teach courses on cryptocurrency &lt;a href="https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/biden-sec-pick-gary-gensler-fintech-regulation-and-blockchain"&gt;during his last gig at MIT&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SCjcMC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why might the SEC want to get involved?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9AcH3k"&gt;Well, stablecoins are huge. The most popular one, Tether, launched in 2014 and is pegged to the dollar. It’s got a market capitalization of more than $60 billion. USDT tokens are involved in half of worldwide Bitcoin trades. And there have been questions about whether movements in Tether have created price manipulation in Bitcoin. &lt;a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=182125067086113009120127114015002097041005024009051078099101087029008103065122077006019036021056062013003068066118118092094026104012021061022090010115073108020090100008060035078093120101020122095117024098081092112126085086023022120121100087087112024118&amp;amp;EXT=pdf&amp;amp;INDEX=TRUE"&gt;One academic study&lt;/a&gt; found that a particular player on the Bitfinex exchange uses newly printed Tether to purchase Bitcoin when Bitcoin prices fall, to support Bitcoin’s price. Apparently, this works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LDUXdB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Didn’t Tether get into trouble recently?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dXS6P9"&gt;Why don’t we just go through a quick history? If you want a less abridged version, journalist Amy Castor has &lt;a href="https://amycastor.com/2019/01/17/the-curious-case-of-tether-a-complete-timeline-of-events/"&gt;put together an exhaustive timeline&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://www.mensjournal.com/entertainment/for-better-or-worse-cryptocurrency-depends-on-tether-mens-journal/"&gt;this &lt;em&gt;Men’s Journal&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; also gives you some of the history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rschC1"&gt;The biggest question right now — which has been in play for a moment — is what’s backing Tether. In 2014, it was originally called Realcoin, and the idea was that it would be &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/BL-MBB-23780"&gt;backed by the US dollar on a one-to-one basis&lt;/a&gt;. For some time, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190219054619/https://tether.to/"&gt;the website read&lt;/a&gt;: “Every tether is always backed 1-to-1, by traditional currency held in our reserves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4MePo"&gt;In February 2019, this text changed to: “Every tether is always 100% backed by our reserves, which include traditional currency and cash equivalents and, from time to time, may include other assets and receivables from loans made by Tether to third parties, which may include affiliated entities (collectively, ‘reserves’).” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpuGA4"&gt;If “affiliated entities” raised your eyebrows, well, you’re not alone. See, in 2014, &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/realcoin-relaunches-tether-avoid-altcoin-association"&gt;Tether also announced&lt;/a&gt; a partnership with cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex. In 2017, &lt;a href="https://offshoreleaks.icij.org/nodes/82024464"&gt;the leak of the Paradise Papers&lt;/a&gt; established that the same people control both Bitfinex and Tether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="GyzIJo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tether declined to comment on why money moves between Bitfinex accounts and Tether accounts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nxs602"&gt;“Tether and Bitfinex are two different businesses and groups with two different objectives,” a Tether spokesperson told me when I asked about the relationship between the two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MEv8k5"&gt;In 2019, &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2019/attorney-general-james-announces-court-order-against-crypto-currency-company"&gt;New York state Attorney General Letitia James said&lt;/a&gt;, “Our investigation has determined that the operators of the ‘Bitfinex’ trading platform, who also control the ‘tether’ virtual currency, have engaged in a cover-up to hide the apparent loss of $850 million dollars of co-mingled [sic] client and corporate funds.” Tether’s lawyer admitted that Tether &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tether-lawyer-confirms-stablecoin-74-percent-backed-by-cash-and-equivalents"&gt;was only 74 percent backed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRHKgH"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anyway&lt;/em&gt;, Tether settled the case with New York state. &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.02.17_-_settlement_agreement_-_execution_version.b-t_signed-c2_oag_signed.pdf"&gt;In the settlement agreement&lt;/a&gt;, the office of the attorney general found that Tether had &lt;em&gt;no &lt;/em&gt;reserves to back the stablecoins in circulation for periods of time. On November 1st, 2018, it published a “verification” of its cash reserve at Deltec Bank &amp;amp; Trust Ltd. of the Bahamas, saying Tether was fully backed by cash. The very next day, though, that money began moving from Tether’s accounts to Bitfinex’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZviYl"&gt;Tether declined to comment on why money moves between Bitfinex accounts and Tether accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pnaHnX"&gt;The settlement agreement, by the way, bars Tether from doing business with anyone in New York. Bitfinex and Tether did not admit wrongdoing but paid an $18 million fine; Tether must also provide quarterly reports on its reserves for the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MGkxhg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Oh, wow. So, Tether said it was backed, and the New York attorney general found that wasn’t true?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MnGKPQ"&gt;Yep. &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-ends-virtual-currency-trading-platform-bitfinexs-illegal"&gt;Here’s how Attorney General James put it&lt;/a&gt;: “Tether’s claims that its virtual currency was fully backed by U.S. dollars at all times was a lie.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bE2gru"&gt;Meanwhile, on August 9th, Tether tweeted “Tether has always been fully backed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7vfJGO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tether has always been fully backed and the assurance opinion made available today confirms it once again, and puts Tether ahead of the industry on transparency.&lt;a href="https://t.co/2CLZTLXNjb"&gt;https://t.co/2CLZTLXNjb&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tether (@Tether_to) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Tether_to/status/1424703057926008834?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lLC1Ym"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yikes. Has Tether provided that quarterly report it promised?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hpw6bu"&gt;Mmmmmmm, well, &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tether-first-reserve-composition-report-usdt"&gt;the first move was pie charts&lt;/a&gt;! As of March 31st, about 76 percent of Tether was backed by cash and cash equivalents, including unspecified commercial paper, which is a kind of short-term debt issued by companies. The “cash and cash equivalents” are composed of 4 percent cash; most of the rest of it is commercial paper, which represents about half of Tether’s collateral, or &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/342966af-98dc-4b48-b997-38c00804270a"&gt;about $30 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVZgiO"&gt;The recent attestation is &lt;a href="https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tether_assuranceconsolidated_reserves_report_2021-06-30.pdf"&gt;more detailed&lt;/a&gt;. According to it, about half of the $62.8 billion in assets are held in commercial paper and certificates of deposit. A quarter of the assets are in Treasury bills, a significant increase from the last report — which may reassure some people, since T-bills have a reputation &lt;a href="https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/types-investments/bonds/types-of-bonds/us-treasury-securities"&gt;as very safe assets&lt;/a&gt;. According to the accounting firm Moore Cayman, Tether has more money in its reserves than is required for redemption.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tZg4jP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that a normal report?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2Zm52U"&gt;We don’t know whose commercial paper Tether is holding, and that’s a little weird. I asked the company directly and the spokesperson’s written response was, “We are a tech company and we closely guard our counter-party relationships. At this time, we do not disclose the make-up of our commercial paper holdings.” That is… unusual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="BoP7Uq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are the most transparent stablecoin issuer.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5R0kBR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-07-22/private-equity-firm-got-rich-making-private-equity-firms-rich"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;’s Matt Levine&lt;/a&gt; made a helpful comparison: &lt;a href="https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-prime-money-market-fund-morgan-4812a2702#/portfolio"&gt;this is what JP Morgan discloses on one of its money market funds&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s a lot more detailed than what we got from Tether. You can see the issuer, the specific identification code, how much money is invested, and the market value, among other things, for each holding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2lEYz"&gt;There’s another stablecoin of comparison, and it’s USDC, which is also pegged to the dollar. It’s the second-largest stablecoin, actually! Anyway, USDC’s parent company, Circle, is attempting a SPAC. So we got an attestation &lt;a href="https://www.centre.io/hubfs/pdfs/attestation/Grant-Thorton_circle_usdc_reserves_07162021.pdf"&gt;to its assets&lt;/a&gt;: 61 percent in cash and cash equivalents and 9 percent commercial paper. But USDC has its own issues; Coinbase had been &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-11/coinbase-drops-promise-of-token-s-cash-backing-that-wasn-t-true"&gt;promising that there was $1 in a bank account backing each token&lt;/a&gt;. The attestation showed that wasn’t true.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I6Rz1r"&gt;Of the top 10 stablecoins, the &lt;a href="https://www.gemini.com/dollar"&gt;most transparent is Gemini&lt;/a&gt;, says Mizrach. It’s completely backed by dollars in FDIC-insured accounts. “That’s the model of transparency,” he says. Tether, naturally, would disagree. “We are the most transparent stablecoin issuer,” the spokesperson told me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5DisUd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But Tether’s still worth a dollar?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dn7V4o"&gt;More or less, yeah. Most people who own Tether bought it from someone else, and they’re probably not going to try to redeem it — they’re just going to sell it, instead. There could, theoretically, be a run on Tether, though, like if the economy suddenly tanks or there’s another, more damaging government investigation or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="il0Tdy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there another investigation?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pIt8AV"&gt;Yeah, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-26/tether-executives-said-to-face-criminal-probe-into-bank-fraud?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s about bank fraud, with possible criminal charges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PAdjQ6"&gt;This investigation doesn’t particularly worry Alan Konevsky, the chief legal officer of tZERO, a security token trading platform. “This was a company that was trying to figure out how to get off the ground in a fairly hostile financial services climate where they couldn’t even open a bank account,” he says. “A lot of crypto companies have had difficulty trying to open bank accounts.” Some of the problems Tether has experienced may be due to regulatory uncertainty, he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bQQg6Q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has anyone tried just asking Tether what’s up?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1ohYi2"&gt;Actually, yes. CNBC’s Deirdre Bosa had CTO Paolo Ardoino (who is also the CTO of Bitfinex) and general counsel Stuart Hoegner (who is also the general counsel of Bitfinex) on for a bizarre half-hour interview during which almost nothing was actually said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="apfkKi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZBEqyiO35cQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8ZoS6"&gt;This is worth watching in full if you’re curious, but the highlights are: Tether won’t say more about their commercial paper (due to nonexistent “privacy” concerns), won’t deny the commercial paper is Chinese, and say they’ve never denied a customer who wanted a redemption. The market trusts Tether, Ardoino says, because it’s popular. “We think the market has spoken,” he said. “We believe the market has voted with its feet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JlmX2"&gt;Also, “we are working toward getting financial audits,” Hoegner said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nsEPo2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why didn’t the CEO show for this interview?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KIbEh7"&gt;Here’s what Ardoino had to say about it: “So, our CEO [Jan Ludovicus van der Velde], and our CFO &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/4da3060c-8e1a-439f-a1d7-a6a4688ad6ca"&gt;Giancarlo [Devasini]&lt;/a&gt; are two great businessmen. They are working as hard as they can, they are super hard workers. They are really deeply involved with our businesses and they handle day to day operations, and they also are extremely available to our customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HFqwqu"&gt;Van der Velde and Devasini are also &lt;a href="https://blog.bitfinex.com/profiles/bitfinex-leadership-jl-van-der-velde/"&gt;the CEO&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blog.bitfinex.com/profiles/bitfinex-leadership-giancarlo-devasini/"&gt;the CFO of Bitfinex&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="R2xvE9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you ask Tether about any of this?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="myYiJi"&gt;I did, and I didn’t get any further than Bosa. “At this time, we do not disclose the make-up of our commercial paper holdings,” Tether’s spokesperson said. I also asked if the commercial paper was Chinese. Tether declined to comment on that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BsxQHa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What happens if it makes other people nervous and Tether goes to zero?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="V2BItF"&gt;To be honest, I don’t know. But a lot of other stablecoins have failed! For instance, of all the stablecoins created in 2015, 80 percent failed, according to Mizrach’s research. And 25 percent of those created in 2018 also failed. That makes the failure rate of stablecoins comparable to other digital assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4smAcv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I took a flyer and lost.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="coUvKW"&gt;So let’s say that Tether holders start getting cold feet. A bunch of people decide to redeem their tokens. Our friend Mars Vulrich is among them. Now, per &lt;a href="https://tether.to/legal/"&gt;Tether’s terms of service&lt;/a&gt;, he might not get his money back right away — or he might find himself holding some of the mysterious commercial paper Tether says it’s backed by instead of US dollars. Now Mars has previously sued tech companies that have mistreated him, but Tether’s terms of service say that they can’t be held liable. And, as the TOS clearly spells out, Tether’s tokens aren’t “subject to Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) or Securities Investor Protection Corporation protections.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nArtap"&gt;We may have gotten a preview of what could happen with Tether in a run on a different stablecoin in June. The Iron Titanium token, an algorithmic stablecoin that was partially collateralized, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-17/mark-cuban-defi-iron-finance-crashed-100?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt;fell from $60 to near zero&lt;/a&gt; in the space of a day. Mark Cuban lost his investment, telling &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, “The investment wasn’t so big that I felt the need to have to dot every I and cross every T. I took a flyer and lost.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6t35Eb"&gt;According to Tether, there’s no need to worry. “Tether has never refused a redemption to a customer — and stress-testing of Tether is not hypothetical,” a Tether spokesperson said. “In March of 2020, bitcoin dropped by half in just a couple of days. Just two months ago, we had one of the worst days in bitcoin’s history, with prices falling by 30 percent in a few days in May. During those events, the Tether peg remained solid, all redemptions were honored, and the price across exchanges remained stable. Tether has been stress-tested multiple times and passed with flying colors each and every time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8VoGO"&gt;Tether declined to comment on the in-kind redemptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DT3HAx"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay. So how much risk is there from Tether to other cryptocurrencies?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="r5xyum"&gt;“Tether, being the largest, would jeopardize all but the most transparent of stablecoins,” Mizrach says. Gemini would likely benefit from a failure of Tether, though, and USDC could, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yShDSE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If Tether went to zero, I’m sure there would be panic in the markets.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NK0eYR"&gt;Tether is often used as a parking place for high-frequency traders, Mizrach says. It’s also used for leveraged cryptocurrency trading, Li points out. That means if Tether loses its peg, it can also tank Bitcoin and Ethereum. (Tether is involved in more Bitcoin transactions than the US dollar is.) “It can be construed as part of a systemic risk,” Li says. “But I think the risk is overblown relative to what most people think.” In his opinion, the real risks are people being out of jobs, and then unable to pay their mortgages — as well as the risks of climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q6Cw9a"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tbstat.com/wp/uploads/2021/02/JPM_Bitcoin_Report.pdf"&gt;A report from JP Morgan&lt;/a&gt; in February pointed out that USDT does a lot of the same things in the cryptocurrency world that banks do in traditional finance, but without the same supervision and without deposit insurance. So if people were unwilling or unable to use Tether tokens, “the most likely result would be a severe liquidity shock to the broader cryptocurrency market,” which could lead to everyone trying to sell at once. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kz8kVo"&gt;On the other hand, Konevsky tells me that he doesn’t think it would be as catastrophic as others fear. “It would be painful,” he says. “But I don’t think it will collapse crypto or stablecoins.” There are other available alternatives to Tether, he points out. Li agrees. “If Tether went to zero, I’m sure there would be panic in the markets,” he says. “But it’s probably not going to be an utter collapse.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RN7vXW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there broader consequences for finance outside of the cryptocurrency realm?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ri8gpy"&gt;Yes, &lt;a href="https://www.fitchratings.com/research/fund-asset-managers/stablecoins-could-pose-new-short-term-credit-market-risks-01-07-2021"&gt;according to Fitch&lt;/a&gt;, one of the Big Three credits rating agencies. Let’s say there’s a run on Tether tokens, and Tether has to suddenly sell its commercial paper. That “could affect the stability of short-term credit markets if it occurred during a period of wider selling pressure in the CP market,” especially if other sell-offs were happening at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mwChZz"&gt;The other thing Fitch points out is that during a period of financial stress, Tether may not be stable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O8OSvj"&gt;It’s not just Fitch worried about the broader consequences to the financial system. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Boston Federal Reserve president Eric Rosengren &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/risks-of-crypto-stablecoins-attract-attention-of-yellen-fed-and-sec-11626537601?mod=e2tw"&gt;have also expressed concern&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pYROOa"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So… what, uh, happens now?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7T61do"&gt;Well, there’s a possibility that regulation of cryptocurrency changes — certainly the rumblings from the Treasury Secretary and the head of the SEC suggest that regulatory changes are coming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pscxta"&gt;But one way to make Tether unnecessary is to create a digital dollar, and some US lawmakers seem to be warming to the idea, including &lt;a href="https://www.banking.senate.gov/newsroom/majority/at-hearing-warren-delivers-remarks-on-digital-currency"&gt;Senator Elizabeth Warren&lt;/a&gt; (D-MA). (&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-creates-its-own-digital-currency-a-first-for-major-economy-11617634118"&gt;China’s doing something like this already&lt;/a&gt;.) A digital dollar would drive out all of the dollar-pegged stablecoins, because that would mean zero counterparty risk, Mizrach says. “That’s the biggest risk to Tether,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6T2yIa"&gt;Tether, naturally, disagrees: “We think it’s positive that governments are taking inspiration from private stablecoins, and especially Tether, as the most innovative, liquid, trusted, and popular stablecoin. We believe there’s room in the space for both CBDCs [central bank digital currencies, such as the digital dollar] and private stablecoins like Tether.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="HPFWLF"&gt;Li views central bank digital currencies as inevitable. “I just hope they bring a level of transparency,” he says. He also wants lower fees on transactions. “It’s ridiculous that it’s 2021 and we still pay 2.9 percent fees to process transactions in the traditional world. It’s robbery.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fitbit Charge 5 leaked images show color display and new rounded look</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eoKE9z-k-d0p9pKU_Nud9uvZtS8=/42x0:2613x1714/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69730371/fitbit_charge_5_leaks.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oHhnpn"&gt;Fitbit is apparently preparing an update to its line of Charge fitness trackers, and newly-leaked images offer our best look yet at what will likely be the refreshed design. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MdRs7P"&gt;The renders, &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/fitbit-charge-5-renders-2735036/"&gt;from leaker Evan Blass&lt;/a&gt;, purportedly show the upcoming Charge 5 model. It looks like it shares design notes with Fitbit’s recent Luxe tracker, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22386394/fitbit-luxe-fitness-wellness-tracker-price-release-date-features"&gt;released in April&lt;/a&gt;. There’s an organic feel to the tracker, with a curved screen that blends into a more rounded body. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRWu3o"&gt;Two slim panels on either side of the device look like they will offer capacitive controls, letting users tap and slide to navigate the tracker’s settings. Fitbit has put capacitive buttons on past devices like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21199567/fitbit-charge-4-tracker-gps-nfc-spotify-sp02-announcement-price"&gt;Charge 4&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21450123/fitbit-sense-review"&gt;Fitbit Sense&lt;/a&gt;, but they’re far from universally adored. In our own review of the Sense, we noted that they were fiddly to use, and inferior to physical buttons, especially if you’re navigating controls mid-workout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wBxLe8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://t.co/tsJbpTwgLx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/tsJbpTwgLx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Evan (@evleaks) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/evleaks/status/1426471514975637504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tWDTiq"&gt;Based on these renders, the other big change for the Charge 5 will be the addition of a color screen, which has been a long time coming to the Charge series. Blass has also shared images of three different colorways for the device, including a dark charcoal color, a muted teal, and a beigey-cream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WRucf"&gt;There’s no details on specs so far, but we’re not expecting any big departures from the Charge 4. Expect to see the usual array of heart tracking, sleep tracking, GPS, oxygen saturation monitoring, and the like.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Beta Android accessibility feature uses facial expressions to control your phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mxo-ZN-6YmbL9cubgMG8MxogZ00=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69730234/acastro_180413_1777_android_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8zaKXC"&gt;Google is developing a new accessibility feature for Android that lets you control a phone using facial expressions like a smile or raised eyebrows, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-camera-switches-control-phone-with-face/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The “Camera Switch” feature has arrived with version 12 of Android’s Accessibility Suite app, released alongside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619546/android-12-beta-4-released-platform-stable-af"&gt;Android 12’s fourth beta&lt;/a&gt;. The new version of the app isn’t available via Google Play just yet, &lt;em&gt;XDA&lt;/em&gt; reports, but there’s an APK to sideload if you want to give it a try. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkHebg"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;, facial expressions (which also include looking left, right, or up) can be used to access a number of controls, ranging from scrolling, going home, or viewing quick settings or notifications. Screenshots show you can adjust how sensitive the software is when recognizing expressions, which should hopefully limit the potential for accidental activations. However, there’s also a warning that the feature can be power-intensive, and that phones should ideally be plugged in while it’s in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qiiQlNKCkHMxXraRjdmylEjioBI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22785026/face_controls.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-camera-switches-control-phone-with-face/" target="_blank"&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facial expressions include “open mouth,” “smile,” and “raise eyebrows.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7UFCCgRfllWoyECFYlYZo7vxlNs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22785027/face_controls_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-camera-switches-control-phone-with-face/" target="_blank"&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A settings page for the feature warns that it can be power-intensive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yc5dBv"&gt;It’s not hard to see how the feature could be useful for anyone who might struggle with certain touch controls. And unlike voice commands, facial expressions are silent, which could make the controls easier to use in public or in quieter environments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w3FkE1"&gt;Android has received a number of accessibility features with recent releases, which like these facial expression controls are aimed at making the phones easier to use for people with disabilities. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21426066/android-11-review-features-bubbles-priority-notifications-updates-pixel-oneplus"&gt;Last year’s Android 11&lt;/a&gt;, for example, delivered improvements to the operating system’s voice control feature. Earlier in the year, Google released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/21/21266150/android-accessibility-features-google-assistant-action-blocks-live-transcribe-sound-amplifier"&gt;collection of other accessibility updates&lt;/a&gt; including customizable “Action Blocks,” which let users assign custom actions to large on-screen buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CspUl0"&gt;The arrival of the new feature alongside the latest Android 12 beta suggests it’ll officially launch as part of the operating system update later in the year. But &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; notes that the latest version of the Accessibility Suite app appears to be backwards compatible with Android 11, suggesting it might not be exclusive to Android 12.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The fan-equipped Zephyr Pro gaming mouse is much cooler than the original</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Cooler, quieter, cheaper&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="g6Y20D"&gt;About a year ago, I wrote about a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21400620/zephyr-gaming-mouse-built-in-cooling-fan"&gt;gaming mouse called the Zephyr&lt;/a&gt; that came with a unique feature: a built-in fan designed to cool your palm as you play games. It didn’t blow me away; the fan was loud, vibrated a lot, and didn’t really feel all that cool. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tcfMaF"&gt;But the creators, now known as Marsback, have returned with a new “sweat-proof” gaming mouse called the Zephyr Pro. And it’s a big improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QRGmDp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10703431"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vv4E7F"&gt;The external design hasn’t changed all that much. The Zephyr Pro is a fairly unremarkable-looking gaming mouse with the requisite RGB lighting and a honeycomb chassis to reduce weight and increase airflow. The main RGB lighting strip now runs around the bottom edge of the mouse rather than around the left and right buttons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdMA44"&gt;The Pro doesn’t expand input options any more than its predecessor; there’s still a standard layout of two side buttons and one up top to control DPI sensitivity. It’s understandably lightweight by design but doesn’t feel too cheap, and it worked perfectly well for me through dozens of hours of various shooters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vxm02j"&gt;The main change is in the performance of the fan itself. I often found myself switching it off on the original Zephyr because of the noise and vibration, but both have been cut down significantly with the Pro. It’s not silent, exactly, but unlike the original it’s hard to hear over the hum of a regular PC or laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wz7PBpAQA_uTqrsKxYvYXTR79b8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22784991/DSCF7735.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uwAR1l"&gt;The quieter fan doesn’t represent a reduction in cooling power, according to Marsback. The Pro model I’ve been testing is actually much more effective at cooling, though that’s in comparison to a prototype of the original Zephyr rather than the final product. The fan now fires directly upward instead of at a 45-degree angle, which seems to make a difference. You still shouldn’t expect to feel like your palm is being blasted by an air conditioner, but I do enjoy the cooling effect overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fM7MsM"&gt;The Zephyr Pro has on-board memory and software to let you customize button functionality and RGB lighting, with extensive options for both. Surprisingly, there’s no way to adjust the fan speed — you just switch it on and off with a button on the bottom of the mouse. Unlike the original Zephyr, though, there isn’t really any reason to want to turn the fan down, since it’s quiet enough at full blast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="qGE8qY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best wired or wireless gaming mouse you can buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="qLJjEC"&gt;Finally, one of the Zephyr Pro’s best new features is the price. $59 is pretty reasonable for a wired mouse like this and much more competitive than the $99 original Zephyr. Marsback also currently has an offer for $10 off your first order from its &lt;a href="https://marsback.com/products/marsback-zephyr-pro-gaming-mouse-with-built-in-fan"&gt;online store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpzuz4"&gt;There are certainly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;a lot of good options&lt;/a&gt; at this price point that don’t come with a fan, so this mouse still isn’t going to be for everyone. But as someone who lives in a city with godawful summers, I’ve enjoyed the Zephyr Pro these past few weeks. Gaming hardware tends to run hot, so it’s refreshing to use an accessory that goes the opposite route.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sam53s"&gt;In addition to keeping up with &lt;em&gt;The Good Fight&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;(seems like people either really &lt;a href="https://www.avclub.com/the-ted-lasso-christmas-episode-is-a-gift-1847472927"&gt;loved&lt;/a&gt; or really &lt;a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/tv/apple-tv-plus/ted-lasso-season-2-episodes-4-christmas-review/"&gt;hated&lt;/a&gt; the latest Christmas-themed episode; I liked it but admit I found it a bit jarring that the show hit pause on several promising plot lines so Ted could wear a Santa hat&lt;em&gt;)&lt;/em&gt;, I also got caught up in &lt;em&gt;The White Lotus, a &lt;/em&gt;series that everyone on Twitter is apparently watching. &lt;em&gt;Lotus&lt;/em&gt; has its first-season finale tonight, and while I’m an episode behind right now, I’m sort of pushing myself to see it through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yleKGI"&gt;There are standout performances by Steve Zahn and Jennifer Coolidge, but the show’s just not clicking for me so far. Bad things happen to mostly awful people and one dies, but we don’t know who yet. The show takes place in Hawaii and is apparently trying to make some meta-commentary on white privilege but as &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/first-person/22621960/white-lotus-native-hawaiians-hbo"&gt;Mitchell Kuga writes for Vox&lt;/a&gt;, the show treats most of the native Hawaiians as little more than plot devices for the dreadful vacationers, so what’s &lt;em&gt;The White Lotus&lt;/em&gt; actually saying? I guess we’ll find out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQiLWT"&gt;Now on to the new batch of trailers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NUUT8v"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JYU1kzGn4rk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SHlQh0"&gt;Dopesick &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JsoE0r"&gt;This miniseries is based on the Beth Macy book “Dopesick: Dealers, Doctors and the Drug Company that Addicted America,” and there’s your plot right there in the title. A pharma company causes a drug epidemic by misrepresenting its new painkiller OxyContin as having a low risk of addiction. Michael Keaton, Peter Sarsgaard, Michael Stuhlbarg, Will Poulter, John Hoogenakker, Kaitlyn Dever, Phillipa Soo, and Rosario Dawson star in &lt;em&gt;Dopesick&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to Hulu on October 13th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s6oZai"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rtipQ3EsGWo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="XX6CNj"&gt;Impeachment: American Crime Story&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="z5GAEd"&gt;The story of former President Clinton’s impeachment and his affair with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky is retold in this series “through the eyes of the women at the center of the events,” according to FX Networks’ promo copy. That’s promising, because the way Lewinsky was treated in the press at the time this all went down (recall that it was referred to as the “Lewinsky scandal” not the “president abuses his authority” scandal) was shameful. Lewinsky serves as executive producer on the series, which is promising as well. Sarah Paulson, Beanie Feldstein, Annaleigh Ashford, Margo Martindale, Edie Falco, and Clive Owen star in &lt;em&gt;Impeachment&lt;/em&gt; which premieres on FX September 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jjClsE"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QwVLObz0MGs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TD9PX8"&gt;Clickbait&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JS8nXO"&gt;Regular guy Nick Brewer disappears, presumed kidnapped, and later appears in a livestream holding signs that claim he abuses women and has murdered one as well. Once the stream reaches 5 million views, according to his signs, Brewer will die. Is he being set up, or is something dark lurking beneath the family-man façade? Each episode of this limited series is told from a different character’s point of view. Adrian Grenier, Zoe Kazan, and Betty Gabriel star in &lt;em&gt;Clickbait&lt;/em&gt;, which premieres on Netflix August 25th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8aQQjW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NbwjAK"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1I6p1yxZ_LE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GlAA05"&gt;Prisoners of the Ghostland&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="8wgOoY"&gt;You can certainly say one thing about Nicolas Cage: He doesn’t choose boring roles. And right here in this trailer, he’s quoted as describing &lt;em&gt;Prisoners of the Ghostland&lt;/em&gt; as “the wildest movie I’ve ever made,” so that’s something, right? He plays a criminal in a bomb suit who has to venture into the titular Ghostland —which looks kinda &lt;em&gt;Mad Max&lt;/em&gt;-y and kinda &lt;em&gt;Blade Runne&lt;/em&gt;r-y— to rescue the missing granddaughter of a crime lord. He’s got five days before the bombs, strategically placed on his body, go off. There’s some kind of nuclear explosion involved, too and of course Cage punches some guys and does his usual half-brooding/half-glowering look. Bill Moseley and Sofia Boutella star along with Cage in &lt;em&gt;Prisoners of the Ghostland&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters and on demand September 17th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KMnDEj"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/89UV8vmWXlY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QAhhjL"&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HonBPx"&gt;From Mike Flanagan, the creator of &lt;em&gt;The Haunting of Bly Manor&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Haunting of Hill House&lt;/em&gt;, comes this limited series about isolated Crockett Island, which is experiencing unexplained supernatural events— are they miracles? Eh, not likely. Zach Gifford, Hamish Linklater, Kate Siegel, Annabeth Gish, Henry Thomas, and Michael Trucco are among the cast of &lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt;, which arrives on Netflix September 24th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile investigating report of customer data breach that reportedly involves 100 million people</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KBvzYD9tqzx0TmVwqy1rHF1OuFg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69729070/acastro_191108_1777_t-mobile_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;T Mobile may have suffered a customer data breach | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9wio2Z"&gt;T-Mobile confirmed Sunday that it’s looking into an online forum post that claims to be selling a large trove of its customers’ sensitive data. &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/akg8wg/tmobile-investigating-customer-data-breach-100-million"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that it was in contact with the seller of the data, who said they had taken data from T-Mobile’s servers that included Social Security numbers, names, addresses, and driver license information related to more than 100 million people. After reviewing samples of the data, &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt; reported it appeared authentic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxW1fJ"&gt;“We are aware of claims made in an underground forum and have been actively investigating their validity,” a T-Mobile spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We do not have any additional information to share at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZBesi"&gt;It’s not clear when the data may have been accessed, but T-Mobile has been the target of several data breaches in the last few years, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22211839/t-mobile-customers-call-records-hacker-security"&gt;most recently in December 2020&lt;/a&gt;. During that incident, call-related information and phone numbers for some of its customers may have been exposed, but the company said at the time that it did not include more sensitive info such as names or Social Security numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CI0mEH"&gt;In 2018, hackers accessed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/24/17776836/tmobile-hack-data-breach-personal-information-two-million-customers"&gt;personal information for roughly 2 million T-Mobile customers&lt;/a&gt; that included names, addresses, and account numbers, and in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20978498/tmobile-security-disclosed-breach-prepaid-customers"&gt;2019, some of T-Mobile’s prepaid customers&lt;/a&gt; were affected by a breach that also accessed names, addresses, and account numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sHAFjZ"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.t-mobile.com/responsibility/consumer-info/pii-notice&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/3/22211839/t-mobile-customers-call-records-hacker-security&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_21975880__t_w__r_google.com__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;March 2020 breach&lt;/a&gt; exposed some T-Mobile customers’ financial information, Social Security numbers, and other account information.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>First Asian giant hornet (aka murder hornet) sighting of 2021 confirmed in Washington state</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lfH9zeAulMcQu8msso-4NIfUpVk=/0x230:587x621/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69728625/asian_giant_hornet_attacking_wasp_nest.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An Asian giant hornet attacking a paper wasps’ nest is all kinds of nope.  | Washington State Dept. of Agriculture&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xjQCqG"&gt;The Washington State Department of Agriculture has confirmed the first sighting of a live Asian giant hornet (nickname: murder hornet) in the state this year, the agency said &lt;a href="https://agr.wa.gov/about-wsda/news-and-media-relations/news-releases?article=32673"&gt;in a news release.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fLu70Q"&gt;Yes I am back on my murder hornet BS. And coincidentally, I am writing this about an hour after a regular-sized (enormous) wasp was prowling around in my kitchen and I had to shoo it outside with a broom handle and a lot of swearing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A1pgf2"&gt;You may recall last year, when many of us were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/3/21245617/tldr-murder-hornet-2020"&gt;introduced to the Asian giant hornet&lt;/a&gt; after it was spotted in the US for the first time. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/2/21350034/murder-hornet-asian-washington-state-trap"&gt;WSDA trapped its first specimen&lt;/a&gt; last August, and &lt;a href="https://agr.wa.gov/about-wsda/news-and-media-relations/news-releases?article=31892"&gt;eradicated its first Asian giant hornet nest&lt;/a&gt; in October. I encourage you to read the news release of that eradication event because it’s incredibly satisfying to read an entomologist hero story. Example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="mPkaEf"&gt;In all, the entomologists with WSDA’s Pest Program removed 98 worker hornets. During the early morning extraction, 85 hornets were vacuumed out of the nest and collected another 13 live hornets were collected with a net while observing the nest&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3KcrVb"&gt;Hell yes, entomologists. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aswYn8"&gt;The first murder hornet sighting of 2021 in Washington came on August 11th, via a resident of &lt;a href="https://goo.gl/maps/VB8WeqeVrBjumPGA9"&gt;Whatcom County&lt;/a&gt;, near the Canadian border. The WSDA confirmed it was an Asian giant hornet a day later, thanks to a photo of the hornet attacking a paper wasp nest in a rural area east of Blaine, Washington. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ayfzku"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The murder hornet is the 2020 B-plot you probably didn’t see coming","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/3/21245617/tldr-murder-hornet-2020"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hUbZZL"&gt;“This hornet is exhibiting the same behavior we saw last year — attacking paper wasp nests,” Sven Spichiger, WSDA managing entomologist said in a statement. “If you have paper wasp nests on your property and live in the area, keep an eye on them and report any Asian giant hornets you see. Note the direction they fly off to as well.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWGAKn"&gt;Yes definitely note the direction they fly off to and then go the other way. Quickly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VyAA50"&gt;Just to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/us/asian-giant-hornet-washington.html?smtyp=cur&amp;amp;smid=tw-nytimes"&gt;review&lt;/a&gt;: a queen Asian giant hornet can grow to be two inches long. The hornets are invasive pests that rip the heads off of honeybees and then feed the bodies to their young. They can fly at speeds of up to 20 miles per hour, and their stingers are long enough to puncture most beekeeping suits. The WSDA says a small group of them can kill an entire honeybee hive “in a matter of hours.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="msRVNA"&gt; For comparison (brace yourself): &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mV9DKA6Ek4euW0lXmNOkJg7JW5E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19940124/AGHLookalikeCompWithNames_Web1200x1800.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington State Department of Agriculture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="c46nHJ"&gt;The WSDA says it will be setting live traps in the area where this nest was discovered, and try to catch a live hornet in order to tag it and track it back to its nest. Canadian officials will be doing the same, since the sighting was so close to the border. According to the WSDA, half of its confirmed reports and all of the Canadian authorities’ reports came from the public, so good job everyone, at least we’re keeping an eye out for them. However, they haven’t caught any live murder hornets in traps so far this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vjldCC"&gt;If you live in Washington state and see what appears to be an Asian giant hornet don’t be a hero; snap a photo and upload it to &lt;a href="http://agr.wa.gov/hornets"&gt;agr.wa.gov/hornets&lt;/a&gt; or email &lt;a href="mailto:hornets@agr.wa.gov"&gt;hornets@agr.wa.gov&lt;/a&gt; (lol the hornets have their own email address) and let the professionals handle things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lFAAQ2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter unblocks Indian politicians’ accounts after suspending them for violating disclosure law</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/APdfdgCPwYwMap5Ha_5s9PD7284=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69728156/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Twitter has reinstated several Indian politicians’ accounts, after suspending them for a tweet about a child murder.  | Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YPkrcE"&gt;Twitter has reinstated the accounts of several politicians in India’s opposition party, which were suspended after party leader Rahul Gandhi tweeted a photo of himself with the parents of a girl who was allegedly raped and murdered in New Delhi, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/india/twitter-reinstates-accounts-indias-rahul-gandhi-other-opposition-leaders-2021-08-14/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RahulGandhi/status/1422779132249788416?s=20"&gt;Gandhi had tweeted his support&lt;/a&gt; of the girl’s family, saying that they deserved justice and others had shared his tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJRBC2"&gt;However, Indian law prohibits the disclosure of the identities of children and sexual assault victims. According to a notice posted on the Lumen database, India’s National Commission for Protection of Child Rights requested Twitter take action. A Twitter spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that Gandhi submitted a copy of an authorization letter from the people in the image to the company’s &lt;a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/report-twitter-abuse-india"&gt;India Grievance Channel&lt;/a&gt;, and his account was reinstated. But the tweet in question, which has been shared more than 15,000 times, will remain withheld in India even though it is visible globally. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbiyqY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/7/22614205/twitter-appoints-grievance-compliance-officer-comply-india-rules"&gt;Twitter appointed its grievance officer&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, to comply with new internet rules in India governing social media platforms. It’s been a bumpy few months between Twitter and India’s government; in June, the government warned the company it could face “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/5/22520330/india-warns-twitter-rules-social-media"&gt;unintended consequences&lt;/a&gt;” if it failed to follow the rules, and in July, India informed Twitter that it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564768/twitter-india-legal-liability-users-posts-defamation-digital-media-ethics-code"&gt;lost its legal immunity for its users’ posts&lt;/a&gt; because of its non-compliance. On August 10th, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619718/twitter-indian-government-internet-it-rules-compliance-grievance-nodal-officer"&gt;government determined that Twitter was in compliance&lt;/a&gt; with the rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2viGqA"&gt;Twitter’s moderation policies have also been criticized by Indian officials; police raided &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22451271/police-india-raid-twitter-tweets-government-manipulated-media"&gt;Twitter’s offices in Delhi and Guragon&lt;/a&gt; in May after the platform labeled a tweet from a government official as “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447379/twitter-india-covid19-politician-tweets-manipulated-media"&gt;manipulated media.&lt;/a&gt;” In other instances, however, Twitter has taken action at the government’s request: It suspended more than 500 accounts and reduced the visibility of some hashtags &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/09/twitter-takes-actions-on-over-500-accounts-in-india-amid-government-warning/"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;, that had with links to widespread farmers’ protest, and has also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/24/22400976/twitter-removed-tweets-critical-india-censor-coronavirus"&gt;censored tweets that criticized India’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 6 review: flexible flagship</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;An improved ThinkPad X1 Yoga with an updated screen&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="iL0KEf"&gt;Once upon a time, the Thinkpad X1 Yoga was Lenovo’s flagship business convertible, joining the clamshell &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/12/17226578/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-2018-laptop-sixth-generation-windows-review-price-specs"&gt;X1 Carbon&lt;/a&gt; at the top of the company’s business hierarchy. These days, it has more company. We now have the paper-thin, titanium-coated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224757/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-titanium-yoga-carbon-business-laptops-intel"&gt;X1 Titanium Yoga&lt;/a&gt;, the featherweight &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"&gt;X1 Nano&lt;/a&gt;, and the powerhouse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/26/18019002/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-extreme-review-the-right-mix-of-work-and-fun"&gt;X1 Extreme&lt;/a&gt; kicking around, all of which are excellent, pricey, and could reasonably be considered flagships in their own right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yev80s"&gt;There’s a lot of innovation happening across the ThinkPad line, but the X1 Yoga retains a lot of the hallmark features that have graced old-school ThinkPads over the years. (With a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpad-x1%2FX1-Yoga-G6%2Fp%2F22TP2X1X1Y6%23tab-customize&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22623290%2Fthinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-6-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;starting tag of $1,493.40&lt;/a&gt; — &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1630813-REG%2Flenovo_20xy002pus_computer.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22623290%2Fthinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-6-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,315.28 as tested&lt;/a&gt; — that includes the premium price.) There are some subtle but important upgrades, of course, including a 16:10 (finally) touch display, a new gray color, a wider touchpad, and new security features that will mostly appeal to business users. It’s far from the most cost-effective Windows convertible you can buy, but it does have a lot to offer — especially to long-time ThinkPad fans looking for a modern spin on an established package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XwbJgc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10699890"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l3f6tr"&gt;Starting with what’s new: the 16:10 aspect ratio is here. This is a change that Lenovo has brought to other top ThinkPads this year, including the X1 Nano. I much prefer this to the 16:9 panel we saw on the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpad-x1%2FX1-Yoga-Gen-5%2Fp%2F22TP2X1X1Y5&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22623290%2Fthinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-6-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Gen 5&lt;/a&gt;, because it provides noticeably more vertical space without adding much footprint to the chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w7IrfR"&gt;The other thing to note about this display is its matte texture — you don’t see matte touchscreens very often. Writing on it with the stylus feels basically the same as writing on a glossy panel, though the sound of the tip dragging along is a bit louder on the matte screen. (I also prefer touching the matte texture, though preferences vary.) Mainly, the matte texture makes colors look a bit muted compared to those on glossy screens, but you’ll also see significantly less glare, and work in bright settings is a much more doable prospect. The colors were sharp enough that watching videos was still enjoyable, and I could make out the details well enough, so I found the matte texture to be a positive overall. The panel also didn’t retain any smudges or fingerprints during my testing period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The fingerprint sensor on the ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 6 seen from above." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0rii5pBH-yKexE0ZxnouDQX6pTU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22779116/mchin_210811_4712_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fingerprint reader and power button in one.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad X1 logo on the ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 6 seen from above on a stone table." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fnr7Bp-Hu9GyrnQS5Q0g9_wWPYU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22779114/mchin_210811_4712_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;No fingerprints here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WPzkuv"&gt;The other notable change: the touchpad is bigger. Specifically, it’s 4.33 inches wide, where the Gen 5’s (&lt;a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-yoga-5th-gen-2020-review"&gt;much maligned&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-5"&gt;by reviewers&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/laptop-reviews/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-5-review/"&gt;for its&lt;/a&gt; small size) was just four. It is plenty wide now, though it’s still a bit short, and my fingers hit the plastic frame often as I scrolled. If the trackpad is too cramped for you, the X1 Yoga offers you plenty of other ways to click: There’s a set of discrete buttons at the top of the touchpad (though they lack the red accents that often appear on ThinkPad clickers) as well as the signature ThinkPad TrackPoint in the center of the keyboard. And the unit comes with a tiny stylus, which lives in a garage on the right side of the chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="4jRDAe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10699900"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="32IsSK"&gt;And then there are a number of updated security features, which Lenovo has drizzled across the ThinkPad line. There’s an optional IR webcam with human-presence detection which can automatically lock the computer if you’re not nearby (the webcam itself has a physical shutter, as ThinkPads traditionally do, and delivers a fairly grainy picture), a match-on-chip fingerprint reader in the power button, a dTPM 2.0 security chip (which encrypts user data on the system), and an optional feature called Privacy Guard which makes your screen harder to peek at from the sides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NCMu1X"&gt;But the most noticeable update is to the look. While the Gen 5’s chassis had some gray on it, the Gen 6 is gray everywhere, including the keyboard, touchpad, and hinge. This means that the Yoga looks a bit different from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295588/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-extreme-p-series-p15-p17-p15v-p1-release-date-price-specs-features"&gt;sea of other ThinkPads out there&lt;/a&gt;, which are traditionally very black. It gives the X1 Yoga more of a futuristic vibe than devices like the X1 Carbon and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147697/lenovo-thinkpad-x-series-t-series-lineup-announce-pricing-release-date"&gt;the X13&lt;/a&gt;, though red and gray aren’t nearly as striking as red and black. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k7RT6p"&gt;Anyway, to each their own on the aesthetic. What’s slightly disappointing is how easily scratchable the finish was. I folded my unit into a tablet and placed it onto an outdoor table for a few minutes for some brief drawing and writing, and when I picked it up there were scratches on the palm rests. I was afraid to let the device near anything remotely sharp after that. If this was the effect of a few minutes of writing, I worry about how scratched up this chassis could get from daily tablet use.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o2A106"&gt;Otherwise, I have no complaints about the build quality. There’s a bit of flex in the keyboard deck, but none in the display, and there wasn’t any screen wobble while I was typing or touching the screen. The finish didn’t pick up many fingerprints (an issue I sometimes have with black ThinkPads). The hinge is smooth, making folding and unfolding a breeze — I could pop it open one-handed, with some difficulty. It’s also a fairly portable product, at three pounds and 0.59 inches thick, though a bit heavy to hold as a tablet for long periods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPd X1 Yoga Gen 6 half open, angled to the left, seen from behind on a stone bench outdoors." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mhK5aYiyNSX8iqrlU3sQVgG-noc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22779117/mchin_210811_4712_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aluminum on the top, aluminum on the bottom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad X1 Yoga in tablet mode, seen from above, on a stone bench." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zl6J0Y0KRPN32xf7o9qnJF4yD30=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22779115/mchin_210811_4712_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use it in tablet, tent, stand, or clamshell modes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aUe5r5"&gt;Elsewhere, the X1 Yoga is very good. ThinkPad keyboards are world-renowned, and this one — while flatter than those of some of its siblings — is still comfortable with excellent travel. Note that like most ThinkPads, the Yoga has half-sized arrow keys, and the Fn and Ctrl keys swapped from where they are on the majority of other laptops, which takes a lot of getting used to. (You can remap those keys, but having incorrectly labeled keys can still be an eyesore to some.) The port selection is great, including two Thunderbolt 4 ports (a new addition to the X1 Yoga), a USB 3.2 Type-A, and an HDMI 2.0 on the left, as well as a USB 3.2 Type A, a headphone jack, and a lock slot on the right. The four 360-degree microphones did a fine job of picking up my voice. And the Dolby Atmos speaker system sounds great, with audible bass and very clear vocals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9dJrj"&gt;The X1 Yoga Gen 6 has a million and one configurations, with all kinds of add-ons. One interesting thing: the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpad-x1%2FX1-Yoga-G6%2Fp%2F20XYCTO1WWENUS1%2Fcustomize%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22623290%2Fthinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-6-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;cheapest listed model&lt;/a&gt; (currently $1,493.40) is actually a Linux model. The base specs include a Core i5-1135G7, 8GB of RAM (soldered), and 256GB of storage. My test model (running Windows 10 Pro, not Linux) is listed at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1630813-REG%2Flenovo_20xy002pus_computer.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22623290%2Fthinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-6-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$2,315.28 at B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt; and includes a quad-core Core i7-1165G7, 512GB of storage, and 16GB of RAM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1HokC"&gt;Then there are the various extras. Windows 10 Pro will cost you $60 more than Windows 10 Home. You can bump up to a 3840 x 2400 screen, or a 1920 x 1200 screen with Privacy Guard. Both of these options are only available with the IR camera, which is $30 over the regular camera. Human Presence Detection, also only available with the IR camera, is an extra $15. And you can add 4G and 5G mobile broadband; prices vary depending on the modem you select. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 6 open on a stone bench seen from above. The screen displays an outdoor night scene with an orange banner rippling through and the Lenovo banner on the bottom right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CBm389xUS6rM1XKy5zDiDT7W_pE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22779118/mchin_210811_4712_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;See those scratches on the clickers?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dbXikR"&gt;The Core i7 utilized here is the same processor found in many of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt; on the market and is enough for all kinds of demanding workloads. Intel’s Iris Xe graphics card can lend a hand with work tasks and lighter gaming, though the X1 Yoga isn’t a gaming laptop by any stretch. Apps launched quickly, and I didn’t notice much stuttering or slowdown during my day full of streaming, photo editing, and Slacking on top of around a dozen Chrome tabs. Performance does depend somewhat on your battery profile more than with other Windows laptops — I had to switch off of Battery Saver when I was trying to run a Zoom call on top of a heap of tabs and apps because everything started freezing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esOlrk"&gt;Speaking of battery, the X1 Yoga’s life span isn’t a disaster but was still just fine for a convertible at this price point. I averaged eight hours and seven minutes of continuous use with the screen at medium brightness. That’s not a bad result, but I’ve seen better from the top ultraportables at this level. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mCiomq"&gt;The final observation — which I’m probably a bit too happy about — is that there’s no bloatware on this thing. No McAfee, no Norton, no nonsense that I had to uninstall as soon as I turned it on. I generally hope that laptops above the $1,000 mark won’t come loaded with this stuff, but I regularly see them on pricey consumer laptops from all kinds of companies (including Lenovo). I’m glad that the ThinkPad isn’t loaded with any junk, but consumers should get this experience, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga Gen 6 in easel mode angled to the left on a stone outdoor bench. The screen displays an outdoor night scene with an orange banner rippling through and the Lenovo banner on the bottom right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FmIz4gzxrst-lJY0PR5nYS0N0Fg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22779120/mchin_210811_4712_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloatware-free zone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3TMq79"&gt;With so many add-ons and configurations, and prices ranging from $1,500 to over $3,000, the ThinkPad X1 Yoga can really be what you make it. It can be a midrange convertible with basic specs, or it can be a premium business laptop with the security emphasis characteristic of the ThinkPad line. Among the saturated sea of convertible ThinkPads out there, it’s absolutely one to consider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FN0y6p"&gt;With that said, it’s quite a pricey line for a consumer or self-employed worker. For context, you can get a comparable model of Lenovo’s top consumer convertible, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569871/lenovo-yoga-9i-14-inch-laptop-review"&gt;Yoga 9i&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fyoga%2Fyoga-2-in-1-series%2FYoga-9-14ITL5%2Fp%2F82BGCTO1WWENUS0%2Fcustomize%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22623290%2Fthinkpad-x1-yoga-gen-6-review-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for just $1,529&lt;/a&gt; — which even has the Core i7-1185G7, a step above the chip that came with my test model. X1 Yoga models with that processor start at $1,938. Like the X1 Yoga, the Yoga 9i has a convertible form factor, a physical webcam shutter, a built-in stylus, a one-year warranty, and most of the same software from Lenovo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="abv5Fo"&gt;That raises the question of what all that extra money is really paying for. The X1 Yoga’s 16:10 aspect ratio is certainly a bonus, as are the lack of bloatware and the matte display. On the other hand, the 9i has better battery life (as do many consumer convertibles at that price), exceptional audio, and some truly innovative features like a haptic touchpad and an ultrasonic fingerprint reader. At a certain point, X1 Yoga buyers are really paying a premium for the ThinkPad build. ThinkPads have some unique aspects — their TrackPoint and the unique keyboard arrangement will always have their devotees — but they also have a sleek, professional look and feel. They’re known for their extreme durability (and the X1 Yoga is MIL-spec tested, though the X1 Yoga’s scratch-prone chassis and the flex in its keyboard gives me some pause on that front). Overall, like the MacBook’s bitten apple, the ThinkPad logo is a graphic anyone will recognize. It’s associated with a high level of build quality, longevity, and performance — it commands a certain status among business users and consumers alike.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="AjX25r"&gt;Which is all well and good, if that’s what you want. If you’re looking for a modern ThinkPad that’s competitive with today’s best laptops, and especially if you’re interested in tidbits like Linux and human presence detection, this is probably your dream machine. I just feel obligated to note that if you’re so-so on the ThinkPad branding, you can get most of what this offers for much cheaper. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="xW9RHX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10699920"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Jury decides Apple should pay $300 million in patent dispute</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2gSIul"&gt;Apple must pay $300 million in royalties following a retrial in a patent dispute, a Texas jury determined Friday. As &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/jury-awards-optis-300-million-second-patent-trial-against-apple-2021-08-13/"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the jury found that Apple should pay patent company Optis Wireless Technology and its related companies because the technology Apple used in its iPhones, iPads, and Watches allegedly infringed Optis’ patents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uVPd4m"&gt;Last year, a jury &lt;a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/apple-told-to-pay-506-million-in-texas-patent-trial-verdict-1"&gt;awarded Optis $506 million&lt;/a&gt; in the dispute, but a judge vacated that award in April, and ordered a new trial focused on damages only. US District Judge Rodney Gilstrap said the first jury had not been allowed to consider whether the amount was awarded on the “fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory,” or FRAND, terms required in standard-essential patent cases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="krgeS3"&gt;The five patents involved in the case once belonged to LG, Panasonic, and Samsung, &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2021/08/14/apple_google_patents/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Register&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, but were obtained by Optis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RcXsO"&gt;An Apple spokesperson wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday that the company was disappointed by the verdict and plans to appeal. “Optis makes no products and its sole business is to sue companies using patents they accumulate,” the spokesperson wrote. “We will continue to defend against their attempts to extract unreasonable payments for patents they acquire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mzv9dF"&gt;Last month &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/07/apple-reports-third-quarter-results"&gt;Apple reported&lt;/a&gt; record third-quarter revenue of $81.4 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WjHqaD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 15th 12:10PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added comment from Apple spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
