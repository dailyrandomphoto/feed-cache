    <title>Subscribers of Apple TV Plus will continue to get credit refunds until June</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RUJvIq"&gt;Apple has notified subscribers of its Apple TV Plus streaming service that they’ll continue to get refund credits on their accounts until June, following a second extension of its free trial program earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/01/30/apple-tv-subscribers-will-continue-receiving-credit-refunds-until-june"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9 to 5 Mac&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gl2Iwp"&gt;Apple extended the free year-long trials of Apple TV Plus to customers until July 2021. The trials were included with the purchase of any Apple device (an iPhone, iPad, Mac, or Apple TV) and were initially set to last until November 1st, 2020. This was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21508148/apple-tv-plus-free-period-extended-february-2021-streaming"&gt;the second extension&lt;/a&gt;; an earlier extension had pushed back the free trial end date to February, allowing users who started a free trial between November 2019 and June 2020 to get up to five months of additional access for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XACfxV"&gt;But before Apple issued the first extension of the free trial, some users had switched to paid subscription status in the meantime, and Apple gave these customers refund credits. It’s doing the same thing for the second extension. &lt;em&gt;9 to 5 Mac&lt;/em&gt; says affected subscribers are being advised via email that they’ll receive monthly credits of $4.99 (or the local equivalent) to their Apple accounts, which will be automatically applied for each month the subscriber is charged between February and June. The credits can be used toward App Store purchases. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A good COVID-19 vaccine is good enough </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Eastern Colorado VA Receives Shipments Of Covid-19 Vaccines" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gx1IRkC0DwmKrbqVk_8wUgewcqQ=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68744474/1230141900.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OS3R3M"&gt;Experts have been looking forward to seeing results from Johnson and Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine trials for months. The vaccine is a logistical dream compared to the other two authorized in the US. It’s much easier to store, and it requires only one shot instead of the two required by its competitors. The only outstanding question was how well it actually worked. On Friday, they got their answer — it works pretty well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="aATmbJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:9360449"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Sg4vpd"&gt;In a 43,783 person trial that spanned the globe, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255968/johnson-and-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-single-shot-coronavirus"&gt;the vaccine was 66 percent effective&lt;/a&gt; at preventing moderate to severe COVID-19. Now, 66 percent might seem like a let down compared to the 90-plus percent efficacy from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556286/coronavirus-vaccine-effective-pfizer-fda-safety"&gt;Pfizer/BioNTech&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569345/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-efficacy-announcement"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt;. But that’s a matter of perspective. Before results of those vaccine trials came out, researchers were &lt;em&gt;hoping&lt;/em&gt; for efficacies of &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/11/09/covid-19-vaccine-from-pfizer-and-biontech-is-strongly-effective-early-data-from-large-trial-indicate/"&gt;between 60 and 70 percent&lt;/a&gt;.  (By comparison, seasonal flu vaccines are given the thumbs up &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/vaccines-work/vaccineeffect.htm"&gt;when they’re 40-60 percent effective&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJI5YE"&gt;All that’s to say, the new vaccine candidate is still very good at what it does, as &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2021/01/johnson-johnson-covid-vaccine/617880/"&gt;many people&lt;/a&gt; have &lt;a href="https://slate.com/technology/2021/01/johnson-and-johnson-vaccine-could-be-game-changing.html"&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt;. That’s because 66 percent effectiveness is better than zero, which is where a lot of us are operating right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7AoWBU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;A single-shot J&amp;amp;J Janssen COVID19 vaccine phase 3 results summarized in one table. Great news! Imagine being   protected from death 28 days after a single shot, and   protected from severe disease after 49 days - against all variants. &lt;a href="https://t.co/gGCcDbMglr"&gt;https://t.co/gGCcDbMglr&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/gPCDgG8oNJ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/gPCDgG8oNJ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Prof. Akiko Iwasaki (@VirusesImmunity) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/VirusesImmunity/status/1355149007220310019?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S4ymH7"&gt;Not only that, but the vaccine was 85 percent effective at preventing the most severe forms of the disease. That’s pretty fantastic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r5NCKV"&gt;Here’s the not-so-fantastic thing. The reason that the vaccine was ‘only’ 66 percent effective in the trial is that it didn’t do as well in South Africa, where a worrying new variant is circulating widely. While the efficacy in the US was 72 percent, the efficacy in South Africa was 57 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iP7EHJ"&gt;That’s still &lt;em&gt;not bad&lt;/em&gt;. But it does mean that there’s a clock ticking in the background as the company moves to get the vaccine candidate authorized. The variants are spreading quickly — one was &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/01/28/south-africa-variant-south-carolina/"&gt;first detected in the US this week&lt;/a&gt;. The sooner the world can be vaccinated, the better the chance all these vaccines will be at stopping the spread of the virus.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGS1tc"&gt;“We’ve got to get the first dose to as many people as possible,” virologist Akiko Iwasaki told &lt;em&gt;STAT&lt;/em&gt;. “These variants that are more transmissible and potentially even more lethal are on the rise. I think time is really what we’re fighting against.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BSYtW"&gt;Here’s what else is happening this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="J99UGP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Research&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XedUpW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/covid-immunity-antibodies/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;May I Borrow Your Covid Immunity?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzsU5F"&gt;Monoclonal antibody therapies are an important pandemic-fighting tool. Here’s the inside story of how researchers started work on the treatments. (Roxanne Khamsi/&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JxUhK2"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/01/giving-people-more-freedom-whole-point-vaccines/617829/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vaccinated People are Going to Hug Each Other&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKSx7w"&gt;How should you behave after you get a vaccine? Caution and preventative measures are still warranted, but Julia Marcus makes the case for letting vaccinated people get a little bit closer to normal. (Julia Marcus/&lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iuONS9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/25/undercounting-covid-19-deaths-greatest-in-pro-trump-areas-analysis-shows/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Undercounting of Covid-19 deaths is greatest in pro-Trump areas, analysis shows&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3o7WIg"&gt;In the US, the official death toll is 436,819. The actual death toll is much higher — especially in rural areas and counties that voted for former President Trump. (Olivia Goldhill/&lt;em&gt;STAT&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NZ7J5a"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pVAvco"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/01/29/additional-covid19-vaccines-bring-choices-and-complications-to-rollout/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional Covid-19 vaccines bring choices — and complications — to the rollout&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="poXFAy"&gt;More vaccines are great, but greater choice also means greater logistical and ethical headaches over who gets what vaccine. Expect to see more conversations and articles about how we’ll navigate a world with multiple vaccines as time goes on. (Andrew Johnson and Olivia Goldhill/&lt;em&gt;Stat)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6Z3TR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250574/covid-testing-vaccine-health-department-funding"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Testing sidelined as health departments focus on vaccination&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tEjvrh"&gt;Vaccination campaigns take a lot of resources, and in some cases, they’re resources that health departments just don’t have. Some are being forced to choose between testing and vaccination — and they’re understandably choosing vaccines.  (Nicole Wetsman/&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgcDH7"&gt;If you want even more on vaccination resources, some fantastic stories are out this week:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="vyQLJt"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;has a great story about the &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/are-mass-clinics-the-solution-for-covid-19-vaccination/"&gt;potential and problems of mass vaccination sites&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="H2xUo0"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Undark &lt;/em&gt;has a cool story about the Medical Reserve Corps, a federal effort that’s recruited &lt;a href="https://undark.org/2021/01/27/covid-19-mass-vaccination-medical-reserve-corps/"&gt;thousands of medically-experienced volunteers&lt;/a&gt; who may be asked to assist in vaccinations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NmUY1G"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has another story about how some areas are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22248339/covid-vaccine-certification-pharmacist-class"&gt;requiring potential vaccinators&lt;/a&gt; to go through long training programs that cost hundreds of dollars. The programs are great — but may not be tailored to the urgency of the current moment. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="J99ZXF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/27/1016790/covid-vaccine-distribution-us/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is how America gets its vaccines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="fSyjZv"&gt;Merck had two COVID-19 vaccine candidates in development, but early data showed that neither one was especially effective. The pharma company announced its plans to shut down research on the two candidates this week.  (Riley Griffin/&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="iwKfz1"&gt;Moderna announced this week that while its existing vaccine does provide some protection against emerging variants, they are still developing a booster shot for the B.1.351 strain of the virus. (Berkeley Lovelace Jr/CNBC)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="kQAxM1"&gt;Around 125 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine will be produced by rival drugmaker Sanofi. Production of the vaccines, intended for the European Union, will start this summer in Frankfurt, Germany. Novartis &lt;a href="https://www.novartis.com/news/media-releases/novartis-signs-initial-agreement-provide-manufacturing-capacity-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine"&gt;announced a similar program on Friday&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;h2 id="O6FKq5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perspectives &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="dl2V4H"&gt;Science is cumulative. It builds steadily toward progress, and that’s been my answer to despair during this last year. I can look back over my life and see a degree of advancement that’s staggering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="yAcT9m"&gt;—Vaccinologist Stanley Plotkin, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/01/27/expert-covid-vaccine/?arc404=true"&gt;as told to Eli Saslow, &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="IyAEqs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;More than numbers&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="va9v7r"&gt;To the more than 102,167,789 people worldwide who have tested positive, may your road to recovery be smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Snagu"&gt;To the families and friends of the 2,209,213 people who have died worldwide — 436,819 of those in the US — your loved ones are not forgotten.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Escape from GameStop stock drama with these deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ha59yxERNpinxXZtlreXYznFfAA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68744270/vpavic_042018_3979_0072.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Magic Keyboard for 11-inch iPad Pros and the new iPad Air is $100 off. Scroll down to find the deal&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MvrKbG"&gt;January 2021 has been full of important news, but it’s been a bit lousy when it comes to deals. Still, we’ve done our part in scouring all of the major retailers for discounts on products we care about (and we think you care about, too). There aren’t many brand-new deals to be found in this week’s dispatch, but go ahead and take a look if you haven’t been following them closely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfvWLq"&gt;If you feel caught up on deals, here’s a reminder that you can hang out here to have a quiet moment from all of the ongoing GameStop and AMC stock drama. Then again, if this is the first time you’re hearing about all of that and want to hear more, check out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zL2p85ltIvg"&gt;my colleague Liz Lopatto’s Big Picture video that’s all about it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="lN8iJo"&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ed5sPt"&gt;Sony’s WH-1000XM4 headphones are $278, and well worth it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="za4upJ"&gt;Once in a blue moon, Sony’s latest flagship wireless headphones with active noise cancellation and excellent sound see a deep discount. That’s happening now, actually, and you can save $72 on the WH-1000XM4 — headphones I’d spring for immediately if I wasn’t still well-served by their predecessor. This model is considerably better, though, with support for simultaneous Bluetooth connections, and it has an automatic pause function when you remove them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCRNSh"&gt;I’ve listed a few links below, but this deal is also happening at &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/102869/1036?sharedid=verge%20&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fsowh100xm4ba.html%3F"&gt;Adorama&lt;/a&gt;, where you can get the headphones with a 20,800mAh power bank for no extra cost.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BA4ETR"&gt;Razer’s cheaper Opus headphones are $60 off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9h8suT"&gt;For something far less expensive (and really, not all that different), Razer’s Opus wireless, noise-canceling headphones are $140 at Amazon. They’re normally $200. For this price, it’s a good deal considering these over-ear cans can automatically play and pause music when you put them on, and they have active noise cancellation and USB-C charging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="ArCKF6"&gt;Get a simple smart clock with four smart bulbs for just $30&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3QlNDw"&gt;Best Buy is hosting a fantastic deal on a smart home starter kit of sorts. Lenovo’s Smart Clock Essential (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/8/21553993/lenovo-smart-clock-essential-smart-alarm-clock-review-price-specs-features"&gt;review by Dan Seifert here&lt;/a&gt;) is usually $50 on its own, but it’s in this kit alongside a four-pack of C by GE white 60W LED bulbs that you can control with your voice via Google Assistant, which is what the Smart Clock Essential has built in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="jjIp61"&gt;Apple’s Magic Keyboard is still $100 off at Walmart&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dZDdy6"&gt;Walmart’s exclusive deal on the Apple Magic Keyboard has lasted far longer than I expected it to. Normally $299, it’s $199 now. It’ll work with the 11-inch iPad Pro or the latest iPad Air (also released in 2020, with USB-C charging). When you pop it on, it will grant your tablet its very own dedicated keyboard and trackpad. It essentially provides a laptop-like experience, in case you’re trying to get more done and don’t want to lug around too many devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>After aborted SLS hot-fire test, NASA and Boeing will try, try again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Hot Fire Test of SLS Rocket Core Stage" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WsoPp-puci2qBaLskz8gibZb3SE=/0x0:5382x3588/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68743176/1230627236.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9EUARI"&gt;NASA will make another attempt next month to test-fire its massive Space Launch System rocket after its first try was cut short, the agency said Friday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Sq6Mk"&gt;The rocket’s 212-foot-tall core stage will try to fire its four engines for eight minutes at NASA’s Stennis Space Center in Mississippi. The attempt is the last milestone “Green Run” test before the behemoth rocket gets shipped to Florida for its debut launch toward the moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HP0d7p"&gt;All four of the rocket’s Aerojet Rocketdyne RS-25 engines ignited together for the first time earlier this month. But what was intended to be an eight minute test only lasted a little over a minute — a much shorter runtime than what engineers needed to proceed to Florida. The SLS core has been in development for a decade, and has consistently been late and over budget.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="a3bdRB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It is still possible to launch Artemis I this year with this test in February”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IbyNek"&gt;“Conducting a second hot fire test will allow the team to repeat operations from the first hot fire test and obtain data on how the core stage and the engines perform over a longer period that simulates more activities during the rocket’s launch and ascent,” NASA said in a blog post late Friday night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QlN3a"&gt;NASA is targeting November for the SLS’s first launch, but the agency’s inspector general and the Government Accountability Office, the country’s biggest watchdog agency, say that’s unlikely. Instead, they indicated the launch will likely to slip into 2022. NASA remains publicly optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vsF6pg"&gt;“It is still possible to launch Artemis I this year with this test in February,” NASA spokeswoman Kathryn Hambleton told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ea9kK3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GeForce Now comes to Chrome browsers and M1 Macs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OAr18lXh1kXHyh1lYmNUkIlyZFo=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68743172/GeForce_NOW_Platforms_crop_verge.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j2PY2a"&gt;Nvidia’s GeForce Now game streaming service has launched for the Chrome web browser and M1 Macs in beta (via &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/play-nvidia-geforce-now-games-chrome-windows-macos/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), bringing resource intensive games to laptops and other devices that might not have been powerful to run them on their own. We just tested out &lt;a href="https://play.geforcenow.com/"&gt;the Chrome browser version&lt;/a&gt; on a Mac and a Windows 10 PC, and it seems to be running smoothly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xcKoiP"&gt;GeForce Now already had applications for Windows 10 and Android devices, but expanded to an even wider audience with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573311/nvidia-geforce-now-ios-launch-beta-release-safari-mobile-web-app"&gt;beta launch for Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; in August of 2020, and followed it up by beating &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21573311/nvidia-geforce-now-ios-launch-beta-release-safari-mobile-web-app"&gt;Stadia to iOS devices&lt;/a&gt; with a web app workaround that lets you stream games through the Safari web browser there. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tca61P7zbFbquI9qjszo5qot5BM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22269250/Screen_Shot_2021_01_29_at_4.04.33_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;GeForce Now running in Chrome on MacOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GAykBu"&gt;Now, theoretically anyone with a Chrome browser can start streaming by heading &lt;a href="https://play.geforcenow.com/"&gt;GeForce Now’s site&lt;/a&gt; and creating an account, even on a weak laptop. Or, if you’re on a new M1 Mac, according to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fpt-br%2Fgeforce%2Frelease-notes%2FGFN%2F2_0_27%2FRich%2Fgfn-v2_0_27-rich-release-highlights%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F29%2F22257077%2Fnvidia-geforce-now-launch-chrome-m1-macs#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;release notes&lt;/a&gt; for this new version of GeForce Now, through a new dedicated application. Nvidia’s changelog also lists a few other changes to make the service more useful in a browser, like the ability to create dedicated shortcuts for your games and a new way to share links that can send your friend directly to a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VayPUO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/25/21454917/amazon-luna-cloud-gaming-comparison-google-stadia-microsoft-xcloud-game-pass-geforce-now"&gt;Like Google Stadia and Amazon Luna&lt;/a&gt;, GeForce Now is essentially a PC in the cloud that you “rent” to stream your games. You can play with a mouse and keyboard, a gamepad, even a wireless headset — all of them worked for us seamlessly in Chrome. It is worth noting Microsoft Edge isn’t currently supported, even though it’s a Chromium browser now. Of course, you’ll need to be in a region where GeForce Now is available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dyWKorSMbLVFoMyJInQLgQxPYSc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22269298/edge_geforce_now_supported_not_yet.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;What you’ll see if you try to launch in Microsoft Edge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Rud6Bh"&gt;GeForce Now’s expansion hasn’t been all sunshine and roses. The service has Steam integration, so you can unlock PC games you might already own to stream via the service, but not all games work because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272558/nvidia-geforce-now-opt-in-agreement-game-developers-publishers-licensing-cloud-gaming"&gt;developers have to opt-in&lt;/a&gt;. Many of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161469/nvidia-geforce-now-cloud-gaming-service-developers-controversy-licensing"&gt;weren’t too happy with Nvidia&lt;/a&gt; because GeForce Now let players stream their games without permission (and let Nvidia profit off a monthly membership). And though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575100/google-stadia-one-year-anniversary-cloud-gaming-cyberpunk-2077-launch-test"&gt;its rival Google Stadia&lt;/a&gt; has a smaller library of even more tightly curated games, it can often offer a clearer picture and higher resolution than Nvidia does right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NnrufM"&gt;The full list of devices GeForce Now supports &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce-now%2Fdownload%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F29%2F22257077%2Fnvidia-geforce-now-launch-chrome-m1-macs#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is available here&lt;/a&gt;. GeForce Now will also come &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224359/google-stadia-nvidia-geforce-now-lg-tv-2021"&gt;come to LG TVs in 2021.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QtnEAovBzzNo2IdDd2EoyY-hmDM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22269306/nvidia_geforce_now_chrome.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despite Chrome, Nvidia is still recommending the native app “for the best experience”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk’s SpaceX violated its launch license in explosive Starship test, triggering an FAA probe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="SpaceX CEO Elon Musk Gives Update On Starship Launch Vehicle At Texas Launch Facility" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2zcokmmy3Ta0SgFV2mAWNBWN3h4=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68742730/1171862745.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ccdBcK"&gt;SpaceX’s first high-altitude test flight of its Starship rocket, which launched successfully but exploded in a botched landing attempt in December, violated the terms of its Federal Aviation Administration test license, according to two people familiar with the incident. Both the landing explosion and license violation prompted a formal investigation by the FAA, driving regulators to put extra scrutiny on Elon Musk’s hasty Mars rocket test campaign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXy3VW"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22030125/spacex-starship-prototype-flight-test-12-5-kilometer-launch"&gt;December test launch&lt;/a&gt; of the “Serial Number 8” Starship prototype at SpaceX’s Boca Chica, Texas, facilities was hailed by Musk as a success: “Mars, here we come!!” the chief executive tweeted moments after the rocket exploded on its landing, celebrating SN8’s successful 8-mile-high ascent with his followers. The FAA, which oversees ground safety and issues licenses for private launches, was not so happy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wkzv9Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The FAA, which oversees ground safety and issues licenses for private launches, was not so happy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ImK2hT"&gt;The so-called mishap investigation was opened that week, focusing not only on the explosive landing but on SpaceX’s refusal to stick to the terms of what the FAA authorized, the two people said. It was unclear what part of the test flight violated the FAA license, and an FAA spokesman declined to specify in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpEUof"&gt;“The FAA will continue to work with SpaceX to evaluate additional information provided by the company as part of its application to modify its launch license,” FAA spokesman Steve Kulm said Friday. “While we recognize the importance of moving quickly to foster growth and innovation in commercial space, the FAA will not compromise its responsibility to protect public safety. We will approve the modification only after we are satisfied that SpaceX has taken the necessary steps to comply with regulatory requirements.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kj118R"&gt;The heightened scrutiny from regulators after the launchpad spectacle has played a role in holding up SpaceX’s latest “SN9” Starship test attempt, which the company said would happen on Thursday. The shiny steel alloy, 16-story-tall rocket was loaded with fuel and ready to fly. But at the time, FAA officials were still going through their license review process for the test because of several changes SpaceX made in its license application, a source said. Musk, frustrated with the process, took to Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UuTqPZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Under those rules, humanity will never get to Mars.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FUFOBX"&gt;“Unlike its aircraft division, which is fine, the FAA space division has a fundamentally broken regulatory structure,” he tweeted on Thursday. “Their rules are meant for a handful of expendable launches per year from a few government facilities. Under those rules, humanity will never get to Mars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UqhrC7"&gt;The license violation (and subsequent license review process) has escalated tensions between SpaceX and the world’s biggest transportation agency. For years, Musk and others in the space industry have bemoaned the age-old US regulatory framework for launch licensing as innovation and competition in space skyrockets. In response, the US Department of Transportation — which delegates its launch oversight duties to the FAA — unveiled new streamlined launch licensing regulations last year. They have yet to go into effect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="majcY1"&gt;In the meantime, Musk’s tweet, calling out the FAA to his 44 million followers, was the latest embodiment of the billionaire’s disgruntled attitude toward regulators that deal with his businesses’ rapid rate of development. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4hE52"&gt;SpaceX, founded by Musk in 2002, has sued the Air Force twice, once successfully in 2014 for the right to compete for Pentagon launches, and another unsuccessfully in 2018 for losing out on competitive development funds for Starship and the company’s other rockets. In 2018, when he was fined $20 million by the Securities and Exchange Commission for allegedly misleading Tesla investors via Twitter, Musk told &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes,&lt;/em&gt; “I do not respect the SEC. I do not respect them.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYB2mf"&gt;A few hours before the SN8 Starship test in December, while Musk was in Boca Chica securing approval for the FAA license that SpaceX ultimately violated, he was asked in a virtual interview with &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;what role government should play in regulating innovation. Musk replied: “A lot of the time, the best thing the government can do is just get out of the way.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jared Leto and Anne Hathaway will help Apple re-create the WeWork disaster for TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DcEe8IsHMblxHu1TBS2RoR_cBCQ=/13x0:1908x1263/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68742648/Studio_Project.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Warner Bros. Pictures&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="e6tCPl"&gt;Apple’s television adaptation of the podcast adaptation of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/15/20806366/we-company-wework-ipo-adam-neumann"&gt;the real-life soap opera&lt;/a&gt; that was WeWork now has some major talent attached. Jared Leto, the soon-to-be leading vampire of&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21062568/morbius-trailer-jared-leto-marvel-sony-pictures-venom-michael-keaton-vulture"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Morbius&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Anne Hathaway, are joining the Apple TV Plus series &lt;em&gt;WeCrashed &lt;/em&gt;as Adam and Rebekah Neumann, according to &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/anne-hathaway-joins-jared-leto-in-apple-wework-tv-series?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yk3ke5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WeCrashed &lt;/em&gt;takes its name from &lt;a href="https://wondery.com/shows/we-crashed/"&gt;the Wondery podcast it’s based on&lt;/a&gt;, detailing the meteoric rise and fall of the real estate company that billed itself as a technology company. Many of WeWork’s problems (and, presumably, the plot of the show) were centered on the Neumanns. Adam Neumann was described as a risk factor in &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1533523/000119312519220499/d781982ds1.htm"&gt;the S-1 documents&lt;/a&gt; released before the company’s IPO, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20872777/we-work-adam-neumann-tequila-weed-ipo-eternal-life"&gt;a profile of the Neumanns&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; didn’t do much to dissuade anyone that they weren’t completely out of touch. For example, Rebekah Neumann reportedly fired multiple people because she “didn’t like their energy,” and Adam Neumann apparently had plans to become “president of the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KOao5t"&gt;In many ways, Hathaway and Leto could be perfect for the roles. Each actor has played eccentric one-percenters in the past. Leto took a more sinister turn as a wealthy replicant designer in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/29/16380562/blade-runner-2049-movie-review-harrison-ford-ryan-gosling-denis-villeneuve"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blade Runner 2049&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and Hathaway had a lot of fun in &lt;em&gt;Ocean’s 8 &lt;/em&gt;as a film star at the center of a diamond heist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4Ovkw"&gt;There’s no set release date for &lt;em&gt;WeCrashed&lt;/em&gt;, but there are plenty of other in-development projects mining tech industry drama. If a gangly take on WeWork seems more your speed, &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21011740/nicholas-braun-cousin-greg-succession-wework-adam-neumann-casting-announcement"&gt;Nicholas Braun is playing Adam Neumann&lt;/a&gt; in another version of the story. And if you prefer your scandals to be blood-oriented, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18305303/kate-mckinnon-will-play-elizabeth-holmes-in-theranos-miniseries-dropout-podcast"&gt;Kate McKinnon is lined up to play Elizabeth Holmes&lt;/a&gt; in a retelling of Theranos’ elaborate fraud.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How many stocks will Robinhood let you buy? The numbers keep shrinking</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O3CzxO"&gt;Robinhood only wants users to have a limited number of shares of companies like GameStop, and that number keeps getting smaller and smaller. On Thursday, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254102/robinhood-gamestop-bloc-stock-purchase-amc-reddit-wsb"&gt;halted users’ ability to buy stocks&lt;/a&gt; that were associated with r/WallStreetBets, including GameStop, AMC, and Nokia, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255031/robinhood-gamestop-stop-purchases-reddit-wsb-stock-market"&gt;the company promised that users would be able to buy limited quantities on Friday&lt;/a&gt;. Today, it &lt;a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/"&gt;released a shifting support document&lt;/a&gt; that details just how limited things are — and to slightly paraphrase Lando, the deal’s getting worse all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgRoXm"&gt;When trading opened earlier today, users were limited to owning five shares of GameStop in aggregate, meaning they could only own up to five — if they already had three GameStop stocks, they could only buy two more — but even that restriction hasn’t lasted. Soon, the number of shares you could buy in GME dropped to two and then finally down to a single share. That’s right: you couldn’t buy more than one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MmkTns"&gt;As the day went on, and the markets closed, the number of restricted stocks kept increasing, from 13 to 23 to over 50 at the time you read these words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3t8tB"&gt;Here’s the latest set of restrictions, according to &lt;a href="https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-due-to-recent-market-volatility/"&gt;Robinhood’s support page&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The list of Robinhoods restricted stocks" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ARCcNuCMmVbpJAnG0cjESkVv5Jo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268985/robn.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The current list of over 50 restricted stocks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yb850o"&gt;Included in the update are Starbucks, Beyond Meat, and General Motors. There are no longer any companies on the list that you can buy more than five shares for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6l3izy"&gt;Here’s the version of the chart we originally published:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B70-KTUxb74fFFbYpzGy-oIH32M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268592/robinhood_trade_restrictions_changed.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The chart at 2 PM ET, with smaller limits and more companies.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nytJoU"&gt;And here’s what it looked like even earlier today:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A chart showing Robinhood’s stock limits" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IKGAU_kpDj2bQ2ZIFXi9JIGcVMk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22268376/Screen_Shot_2021_01_29_at_9.29.59_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The limits chart at 12:30PM ET on January 29th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M2EkVM"&gt;While GameStop is the most (in)famous of the Wall Street bets, it’s not the only one, and Robinhood has been expanding the list of which companies are limited throughout the day. One of the stocks added is AMD, which is currently limited to just a single stock as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcu1u8"&gt;Robinhood is also limiting the options contracts you can get for certain companies. To put it extraordinarily simply: buying an options contract doesn’t mean that you actually own the stock. It allows the owner of the contract to buy or sell the stock later on at an agreed-upon price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UoLLqC"&gt;For example, if GameStop is at $343 a share now, and I thought it was going to go up, I could purchase a call option to buy it at $400. If the stock went over $400, I could then make money by using my option to buy that stock, now worth more, for $400. However, those contracts expire, and if the stock price doesn’t rise as high as I expected, I may lose money, which is a situation &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-28/cohen-sundheim-lose-billions-to-reddit-traders-running-amok?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;many hedge funds are finding themselves in&lt;/a&gt;. (As always, this isn’t financial advice, and I’m not a financial adviser. This is just an explainer of the mechanics using arbitrary numbers.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ke6sXd"&gt;If you buy an option, Robinhood could also theoretically &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254857/robinhood-gamestop-amc-shares-sold-surprised-users"&gt;sell it out from under you&lt;/a&gt; under certain conditions, something it’s warned it would do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="52Obq1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tried to buy back my shares that robinhood sold without my permission and get this error message &lt;a href="https://t.co/pbcPrnozx7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/pbcPrnozx7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Laoch (@LeCoque77) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LeCoque77/status/1355243490339389440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CFosWP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility"&gt;In a blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Robinhood attempted to justify the decision to halt and then limit trading, but, like the limited stocks, users aren’t buying it. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22255245/google-deleting-bad-robinhood-reviews-play-store"&gt;The app was review-bombed on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, with many users leaving one-star reviews, complaining that the company wasn’t living up to its goal of “democratizing finance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ge3XGR"&gt;A Robinhood spokesperson pointed &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to the aforementioned blog post, saying that the company has been clear with customers that it would be monitoring the situation and making adjustments “as needed,” and that the limits have been labeled as subject to change.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>G4 will return with a weekly series on Twitch and YouTube</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2_igDWMViUIAqIETSZtyeOo6AYI=/0x0:2011x1341/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68742438/B4_G4_Final_Logo_V1.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gpcQVY"&gt;The revival of G4, a network focusing on video games with programs like &lt;em&gt;X-Play&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Attack of the Show!&lt;/em&gt;, is underway. The company announced today that it’s launching weekly series &lt;em&gt;B4G4&lt;/em&gt; on Friday, January 29th. The series will air on Twitch and YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CrRNDL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;B4G4&lt;/em&gt; is part of the lead-up to the network’s return this summer. It will feature original sketches, music parodies, game reviews, and more. Viewers will also be able to provide feedback on that content via the network’s Reddit community.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rYOCEI"&gt;Twitter accounts for &lt;em&gt;Attack of the Show!&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;X-Play&lt;/em&gt; teased G4’s revival &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/24/21337355/sdcc-2020-g4-tv-return-teaser-video"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; during the digital version of San Diego Comic-Con; both shows are expected to return. The network has been hunting for talent via a Twitter campaign. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s Oversight Board wants your feedback on whether the company was right to ban Trump</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/00OM7NUGMbfXYp61DaS9IqPfhxU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68742361/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Thoo7t"&gt;Facebook’s Oversight Board, the independent body empowered to review the social network’s most complex platform moderation decisions, is now &lt;a href="https://oversightboard.secure.force.com/apex/VisualAntidote__HostedFastForm?f=i6VO6LLfXbOt%2Bdjzhn2zNj%2B5yLrazO6pIHWc5cVT/zWMmmWJHflKUJzl708kZWe1"&gt;accepting public comments&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;“indefinitely” ban former President Donald Trump&lt;/a&gt; in the aftermath of the US Capitol attack on January 6th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbAFa6"&gt;The two posts in question include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217788/facebook-remove-trump-video-emergency-situation-mob-violence"&gt;one-minute video Trump posted to his account on January 6th&lt;/a&gt; repeating false claims that the US election was stolen from him and offering words of sympathy to the Capitol rioters, some of whom were, at that moment, continuing to endanger the lives of Congress members and Capitol police. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZGP9tH"&gt;The second is a written post in which Trump wrote, “These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously &amp;amp; viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly &amp;amp; unfairly treated for so long. Go home with love &amp;amp; in peace. Remember this day forever!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGmSfP"&gt;Facebook removed the video, took down the post, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22218009/trump-facebook-ban-block-posting-24-hours-capitol-riot"&gt;subsequently banned Trump from its platform and Instagram for 24 hours&lt;/a&gt; before saying the ban would remain in place indefinitely and at the very least through Inauguration Day. Although Trump’s pages remain live, he has not been permitted to post anything on Facebook or Instagram since January 6th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RJuJBC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Oversight Board has the power to overturn Facebook’s decision&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4IohG7"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242616/facebook-refers-decision-suspend-trump-oversight-board"&gt;referred its decision to the Oversight Board&lt;/a&gt; last week, citing the unprecedented actions company leadership felt compelled to take after Trump’s incitement of a riot that left five people, including one police officer, dead. The Oversight Board, which was formed last year and is made up of 20 experts from around the world with a large degree of background and employment diversity, expects to make a decision by the end of next month. The board took on its first batch of cases last month, but it announced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254155/facebook-oversight-board-first-rulings-coronavirus-misinformation-hate-speech"&gt;first rulings on five cases earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, upholding only one removal and overturning four others.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kze5r"&gt;“We believe our decision was necessary and right,” Facebook’s Nick Clegg, its vice president of global affairs and communications, said in a statement last week regarding Trump’s ban. “Given its significance, we think it is important for the board to review it and reach an independent judgment on whether it should be upheld.” Facebook is looking for clarity on not just whether it made the right decision to ban Trump, but also in what circumstances it should take comparable action against political leaders in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NcgYBT"&gt;Now, the Oversight Board wants the public to weigh in, too. The board is looking for comments regarding whether Facebook’s decision “complied with the company’s responsibilities to respect freedom of expression and human rights” and what it should do should a similar situation arise in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rs5gtJ"&gt;It’s also looking for comments on how the company should “assess off-Facebook context in enforcing its Community Standards,” particularly when there is a threat of real-world violence; how it should “treat the expression of political candidates, office holders, and former office holders”; and whether Facebook’s rules around account enforcement like suspensions and bans should be made more accessible, as well as appeals around that enforcement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IeSn5O"&gt;The board is similarly looking for feedback on what considerations should be made to ensure Facebook’s rules are applied consistently around the globe, especially when weighed against Facebook’s “newsworthiness” exemption. That exemption is what Facebook has relied on in the past when defending its choice to keep up controversial Trump posts, like Trump’s comments &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/1/21277135/facebook-walkout-protest-virtual-president-donald-trump-posts"&gt;regarding protests against police brutality last summer&lt;/a&gt;, and content from other world leaders that may violate its standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="09gnjX"&gt;The Oversight Board says it will accept public comments until 10AM ET on February 5th, and it lists a number of requirements — submissions must be written in English and be no longer than two pages when written in 12-point Times New Roman font, to name a couple — that must be met to be considered. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xggYEa"&gt;The guidelines say only the Oversight Board will view the submissions to protect privacy and security, and those who decide to give feedback will be given a choice whether to have any of it published or attributed to them publicly as part of its deliberations and eventual ruling. The ruling will contain any public feedback in an appendix attached to the decision so long as the writer consents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUZhN6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
