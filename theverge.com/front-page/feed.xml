    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2LDhBt"&gt;One of the biggest esports tournaments in the world is coming back for 2021. Today, &lt;a href="https://www.dota2.com/newsentry/3066366095803889976"&gt;Valve announced&lt;/a&gt; that The International, the annual &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; championship, will return after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21175145/the-international-2020-valve-dota-2-coronavirus-delay"&gt;a one-year hiatus caused by the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. This year’s iteration will take place in Stockholm, with the group stage starting on August 5th. The International is well-known not only for its intense, global competition, but also for being incredibly lucrative: this year’s tournament will feature a prize pool of $40 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aUI2tt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re waiting to release additional details on attendance options.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3q1qrp"&gt;While we know that the tournament will be taking place, it’s not clear yet whether fans will be in attendance. “As we continue to plan the event around the shifting landscape presented by the ongoing global pandemic, our focus remains on finding ways to hold a high quality tournament in the safest way possible,” Valve wrote in a blog post. “This means we’re waiting to release additional details on attendance options as we gather more information on developments heading into summer. We expect to be able to share more with the community during the month of June.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7hhFXi"&gt;As part of the announcement, Valve also introduced a new &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; feature called supporters clubs. Players are able to buy in-game items like badges and loading screens, with 50 percent of sales going directly to their favorite esports team. The feature will support 17 teams starting today, with more expected to be added over time. “As more content from other teams is submitted and approved, they will be added to this list regularly,” Valve said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ycKYHP"&gt;In 2020, the pandemic forced most esports competitions across the world &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21196237/esports-leagues-online-coronavirus-call-of-duty-overwatch-league-of-legends"&gt;to shift to online competition&lt;/a&gt;. However, this year, some in-person events have slowly started to return. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22303379/league-of-legends-iceland-lol-mid-season-invitational-valorant-champions-riot-games"&gt;Riot is currently holding &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Valorant&lt;/em&gt; tournaments in Iceland&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22380705/overwatch-league-2021-season-live-events-china"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League is planning to hold multiple live matches in China&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon updates the Echo Show 8 and 5 with better cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XssPrkJmTm5RYFqV6YsF-8mGsTY=/0x120:2880x2040/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69273526/Echo_Show_8_Kitchen.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IqSiTj"&gt;Amazon is refreshing a handful of products in its Echo line: the Echo Show 8 and Echo Show 5, plus it’s adding a Kids Edition of the Echo Show 5. The big new feature on both models is the camera, but the upgrade is more impressive on the bigger Echo Show 8. It now has the same 13-megapixel sensor that you’ll find on the Echo Show 10. Instead of moving the screen around to point at you as the 10 does, the Echo Show 8 provides a wider, 110-degree field of view. Within that range, it does the pan and zoom trick to keep subjects centered in the frame. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n6eMGz"&gt;To power that trick and some other new software features, Amazon says there’s a new “octa-core” processor inside the Echo Show 8. Otherwise, it’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/26/20983661/amazon-echo-show-8-review-alexa-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;same Echo Show 8 that we reviewed in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, with dual speakers and a choice of either white or charcoal gray. It still sells at the same price, $129.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="12GFyU"&gt;The other software tricks include using the camera to detect if a human has walked into the room and then plugging that information into routines (like turning on the lights). Amazon emphasizes that this is an opt-in only feature and it even requires users to manually punch in a code during setup to ensure they really mean to turn it on. It also does its human shape detection locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new Amazon Echo Show 8 keeps the same look and speakers as the original" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GHFylEqSBYWflh8nxLO0U6W8HQ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505341/Echo_Show_8_Glacier_Back.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Amazon Echo Show 8 keeps the same look and speakers as the original.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Amazon Echo Show 8 has a physical privacy shutter for the camera" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-1lpPlYxjKIUPbnmK67oDD538zU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505342/Echo_Show_8_Privacy.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amazon Echo Show 8 has a physical privacy shutter for the camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J6oQJh"&gt;Amazon will also let all Echo 8 and 5 devices turn on Alexa’s security mode, so you can remotely view the cameras from your phone. Finally, the Echo Show 8 is getting new AR effects for Amazon’s own video chat service, including “reactions” like filling the screen with hearts or setting custom virtual backgrounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUW7cv"&gt;As for the smaller (and more popular) Echo Show 5, the upgrades are less impressive. The camera is doubling in resolution, from one megapixel to two. It won’t have the horsepower to do the follow mode on the camera. However, the Echo Show 5 is getting a permanent price drop; it’s now $84.99. It comes in the same charcoal and white colors but adds a new blue option.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpqkIt"&gt;If you want to spend $10 more, you can get a Kids Edition of the Echo Show 5 with a wild print on the rear fabric. That extra $10 also includes a year of Amazon Kids Plus services and a two-year warranty against whatever damage your child can inflict on the thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new Amazon Echo Show 5 in blue." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nhZQTJxTKZ9wiRhW74jRoy-hcnk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505358/Echo_Show_5_Deep_Sea_Blue.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Amazon Echo Show 5 in blue.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The new Amazon Echo Show 5 Kids" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/z_xLuI1gCUiNnPbHDRZLwcfCqO4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505351/Echo_Show_5_Kids_Front_and_Back.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Amazon Echo Show 5 Kids.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ah8oJg"&gt;All three versions of the Echo Show should be available for order immediately, but shipping could take a few weeks — even Amazon is not fully immune to chip shortages, it seems. As for fans of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/28/16378472/amazons-echo-spot-camera-in-your-bedroom"&gt;Echo Spot orb&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not seeing any updates today and is in all likelihood not going to make a comeback — Amazon tells us that most customers just opted for the Echo Show 5 instead. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Credit agencies can’t tell my sister and me apart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/23-9PTpkb_Z_NLVelhmyPGb6QLo=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69273553/4557_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;I’ve been locked out of the vast invisible system that determines creditworthiness — all because I have a twin&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="phwyl2"&gt;My twin sister Alita and I have a credit problem: not because we’ve defaulted on loans or skipped bills, but because the US credit rating agencies can’t seem to tell us apart. Sometimes they associate her name with my social security number, sometimes it’s the other way around — and sometimes we both show up under the same SSN. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P4YAZv"&gt;When I applied to work at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, my background check gave my name as Alita Clark; Mitchell Clark was listed as an alias. Over and over, Alita and I have been rejected for credit cards, despite both having good credit. I was rejected for a car loan by a bank that I’ve used for years — despite having enough cash to immediately pay off the loan. Neither of us has had issues with getting access to housing, but it’s hard to feel sure it won’t happen in the future. The problem isn’t banks or lenders but the credit system itself, a vast and invisible information network with little incentive to correct even the simplest of problems.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EvqVGPpjnOgnYmgbFggXEzs3P18=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22493654/goodhire.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Of course, I gave Vox Media my SSN, not my sister’s. She still showed up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UT4cYI"&gt;If it were a single agency or company getting it wrong, I might be able to set the record straight, but the credit system is a thicket of overlapping forces, so densely woven that it can be hard to tell which part of the system is making the mistake. In the US, three companies keep track of almost everyone’s credit history: Equifax, TransUnion, and Experian. Most people will be familiar with their credit score —  a number supposedly reflecting how reliably you pay back lenders —  but these three companies draw on hundreds of data sources to come up with that number. As you can imagine, when you’re collecting tons of data on almost every adult in the country, mistakes happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="jKhdbK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10454209"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5foEsK"&gt;In theory, consumers are supposed to have some recourse when the credit system screws up. Each agency has its own dispute process, with its own standard of documentation and evidence. Credit furnishers, the companies providing the credit reporting agencies with information, are also required to accept and investigate disputes. If those methods fail, consumers can file a complaint with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which will then forward it to the appropriate ratings agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0KbEgi"&gt;But in practice, those investigations are anything but thorough. &lt;a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/consumer-financial-protection-bureau-report-details-how-the-nations-largest-credit-bureaus-manage-consumer-data-2/"&gt;A 2012 CFPB investigation&lt;/a&gt; into how the credit ratings agencies manage data found that they hand off 85 percent of disputes to their furnishers — often without any of the evidence that consumers have included to back up their complaints. A lot of the time, by the time a mistake is resolved, it’s spread to another agency and the whole process has to begin again. The distributed nature of the system makes it impossible to pin responsibility for a mistake to any single party, or make anyone responsible for fixing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0bLeN"&gt;In lots of cases, such as mixed files or in cases of identity theft, the credit bureaus would be in the best position to know if information was incorrect, says Evan Hendricks, a credit reporting advocate who literally wrote the book on credit scores and how the system can go wrong. “But they don’t care. Because of the creditors instructing them to keep it on, they keep it on.” He says it was “the fundamental business model of the credit bureaus to faithfully put on your credit report what creditors furnish and to faithfully keep it on further creditors’ instructions once you dispute it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="9ZmTOy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If I ever want to get a mortgage, I’ll likely have to get a lawyer involved&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XslkEH"&gt;I found this out the hard way. Starting in 2017, I pulled my reports from all three agencies, hoping to figure out which ones had me listed as Alita and how to fix it. Since the system was already too mixed up for fact-based verification to work (I’m often asked about student or car loans that I’ve never heard of), I had to mail in a physical copy of my social security card and driver’s license, then wait for the reports to arrive by mail. Experian seemed to have everything right, but Equifax had my SSN listed as my sister’s. TransUnion had the right social security number, but my name was listed as Alita Clark. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSI9g3"&gt;I filed disputes, sending copies of my social security card, driver’s license, and birth certificate. When I checked back a few months later, it seemed like the fixes had mostly worked. My TransUnion report had my name and SSN, though Alita showed up as an alias. Equifax also had my information right, but it says I was “formerly known” as Alita. Both had my correct credit history. So far, so good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ILaiT"&gt;In 2019, I applied for Apple’s new credit card, wanting to try it as soon as it came out. My application was denied, and after some digging, I realized it was &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209218"&gt;likely being handled by TransUnion&lt;/a&gt;. I requested a report from them and got back a reply addressed to, you guessed it, Alita Clark. After months of working to fix the errors in my reports, they had crept back in — and someone else’s mistake was keeping me from getting Apple’s shiny new credit card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yInYWf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Who are we? Depends on which credit reporting agency you ask&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zVSC6H"&gt;My sister and I both filed complaints with the CFPB, and for a while, the situation seemed to be fixed. I finally got my Apple Card and was even able to access my credit report through online channels again. But it was only a matter of time before entropy slipped back in. I was rejected for a car loan late last year, and today I’m back to not being able to access my TransUnion or Equifax reports online. If I ever want to get a mortgage, I’ll likely have to get a lawyer involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7RiRf"&gt;For her part, my sister says she feels like “a ghost in the shell.” One credit bureau replied to her correction request (which included her social security card and driver’s license) with a letter saying they couldn’t fix it — which was addressed to Mitchell. “Clearly, they didn’t even look so why should I try again,” she told me. As for the reports she was able to get back after they had supposedly been corrected, they were “a bizarre Frankenstein” of our credit histories: alongside some of her real accounts, there are credit pulls from car insurance agencies I looked into, and even one from my local hospital — neither of which have shown up on any of my reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mYZDPj"&gt;To sum up her feelings, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HAxsvjHbP5A"&gt;she sent me this&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TGgytX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10484429"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kMAa5R"&gt;You rarely hear about these issues, but they’re surprisingly common — and not just for twins. People can be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/16/9340511/perstin-experian-bank-death-credit-reporting"&gt;declared dead by credit agencies&lt;/a&gt;, get stuck in limbo after a name change, or just slip through the cracks. &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/reports/section-319-fair-accurate-credit-transactions-act-2003-fifth-interim-federal-trade"&gt;In 2012&lt;/a&gt;, the FTC asked 1,001 consumers to request credit reports from the big three agencies. Roughly 26 percent of the study participants found incorrect information on at least one of their reports. In 2015, the FTC in &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2015/01/ftc-issues-follow-study-credit-report-accuracy"&gt;a follow-up study&lt;/a&gt; asked 121 consumers to examine unresolved disputes — and almost 70 percent of them believed that their errors still hadn’t been corrected. There have been congressional hearings, lawsuits with regulators, and decades of political pressure, but the system simply refuses to shape up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNKA6V"&gt;There has been work done to make the credit reporting process more visible to the general public — in 2014, the CFPB &lt;a href="https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-calls-on-top-credit-card-companies-to-make-credit-scores-available-to-consumers/"&gt;called on credit card companies&lt;/a&gt; to start providing their customers with free access to their credit scores, and &lt;a href="https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/credit-cards/credit-cards-give-free-fico-scores"&gt;now many do&lt;/a&gt;, with some even letting non-cardholders access their score for free. This lets consumers keep an eye on their credit score, which could give them a warning that something’s gone wrong if it seems lower than it should be or if there’s a sudden change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gi9Jrq"&gt;But that’s really only a first step. If you noticed a discrepancy on your credit report, that could just be the start of a long, drawn-out fight with one or more credit reporting agencies. Even when victims sue agencies and win, the damages aren’t great enough to incentivize better behavior. Hendricks tells me that even when cases end up with large punitive damages against the credit reporting agencies, they tend to get reduced. “[T]hey don’t achieve their purpose of punishing the company and more importantly deterring from continuing the same conduct,” he says. “So basically, they just haven’t been spanked hard enough to change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="Bk5e6S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10493160"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bsWULB"&gt;Alita and I both actually have credit cards in our names; I &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; got one as part of writing this article. While my main bank wouldn’t give me an auto loan, I was able to get one through the dealership’s bank, a local credit union. I was also able to pass the credit check that my new apartment complex pulled, somehow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQzGFz"&gt;But we’re both lucky, in many ways. First, neither of us is causing trouble for each other. My sister’s even more financially responsible than I am, and she’s never been in any sort of legal trouble. But if she did default on a loan, would that show up on any of my reports? If I went to jail, would that prevent her from getting a job at some point? Quite honestly, we don’t know. The answer may actually be “it depends on what credit reporting agency you ask.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="qj7JyR"&gt;But there are people for whom this kind of issue could be devastating. It’s not hard to imagine a situation where someone falls on hard times and is looking for a lifeline in the form of credit, and then discovers that they’re ineligible, due to some bureaucratic snafu. As the system currently stands, we have three companies that have a vast amount of control and little meaningful oversight. Until some sort of regulatory power steps in, the tangle of the system may only get worse.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="un7DNi"&gt;We’re in a relatively quiet period for Switch releases while we wait for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22288267/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-switch-re-release-nintendo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skyward Sword&lt;/em&gt;’s remaster to release in July&lt;/a&gt;. Thankfully, today marks the arrival of a new &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/calculator-switch/"&gt;$10 calculator app&lt;/a&gt; on Nintendo’s console, which should stop your machine from gathering too much dust over the coming months. Hell yeah. Math.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxktoO"&gt;The app, which was &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-05-11-nintendo-switch-is-getting-a-calculator-app-priced-gbp8"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Eurogamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is literally just called “Calculator” and is being published by Sabec. It’s single-player, which unfortunately rules out any team-based calculating, and it works in TV and handheld modes, according to its product page. We’d be remiss if we didn’t point out that the app bears a striking resemblance to the &lt;a href="https://www.macobserver.com/tmo/article/iphone-ios-and-the-hidden-scientific-calculator"&gt;iPhone’s old calculator app&lt;/a&gt;, but being charitable, it’s possible that the app is only guilty of drawing inspiration from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/5/3/4297816/iconic-1987-braun-calculator-designed-by-the-legendary-dieter-rams-to"&gt;Dieter Rams’ classic design&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0BE5nU6t2LHNHn--aThvsxZ7dbo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22508817/ezgif_1_8e39159430ef.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sabec / Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Math.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xS81xu"&gt;Unlike Sony’s and Microsoft’s consoles, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217049/nintendo-netflix-wii-u-3ds-switch"&gt;Nintendo’s previous machines&lt;/a&gt;, the Switch doesn’t have much in the way of non-gaming apps. It doesn’t have Netflix, Spotify, or those other pieces of software that we’ve come to expect will appear on basically any piece of electronics with a screen. But now, finally, it has a calculator app. Thank god. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snap suspends two anonymous messaging apps after cyberbullying lawsuit</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rxZY5opdJ-Y2Focq931L4zHCjbc=/73x0:858x523/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69273388/msedge_cu2FZIRvnP.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Images from Yolo’s now-removed App Store listing.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Yolo Technologies&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="now5a4"&gt;Snap will suspend two anonymous messaging integrations from Snapchat after a lawsuit sought to hold them responsible for a teenager’s death, the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-05-11/snapchat-suspends-yolo-lmk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. The lawsuit was &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2021-05-10/lawsuit-snap-teen-suicide-yolo-lmk"&gt;filed on Monday&lt;/a&gt; by Kristin Bride, the mother of a teenager who died by suicide in June after being bullied on the two apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mf6ySx"&gt;“In light of the serious allegations raised by the lawsuit, and out of an abundance of caution for the safety of the Snapchat community, we are suspending both Yolo and LMK’s Snap Kit integrations while we investigate these claims,” a spokesperson for Snap said in a statement. Representatives for the two apps, Yolo and LMK, did not immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YBxOBa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are suspending both Yolo and LMK’s Snap Kit integrations while we investigate these claims”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D28Vdb"&gt;Yolo and LMK are developed by third-party developers, and they integrate with Snapchat via its Snap Kit platform. LMK lets users create polls and Q&amp;amp;As for their Snapchat friends to answer, while Yolo is focused on Q&amp;amp;As. Both services let users send messages anonymously which facilitates cyberbullying to such a degree that the apps should be considered dangerous, the suit alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqQQSp"&gt;Last year, when Carson Bride was found dead by his family, his phone history showed that he’d searched how to “Reveal YOLO Username Online” that same day. The lawsuit alleges that over a period of several months he had been receiving anonymous bullying messages, which made sexual comments and taunted him over incidents at school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="EpcSho"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:831613"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mLR1hR"&gt;As of this writing &lt;a href="https://onyolo.com/"&gt;Yolo&lt;/a&gt;, which the suit says is owned by Yolo Technologies, appears to no longer be available on either the Apple App Store or Google Play Store. &lt;a href="https://www.lmk.chat/"&gt;LMK&lt;/a&gt;, which is developed by LightSpace, is still available for download &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/lmk-anonymous-messages/id1463320976"&gt;on&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lightspace.lmk&amp;amp;hl=en_US"&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; mobile app stores, but attempting to share content to Snapchat generates an error message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOAXBu"&gt;Both apps make various promises about protection against bullying on their platforms, the &lt;em&gt;LA Times &lt;/em&gt;notes. Yolo reportedly warns users during setup that it has “no tolerance for objectionable content or abusive users,” while an &lt;a href="https://lmk.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360047469394-What-is-LMK-doing-to-ensure-safety-within-the-app-"&gt;FAQ from LMK&lt;/a&gt; says it goes “to great lengths to protect our community” with a combination of automated and human moderation. The plaintiffs argue that the two apps violate consumer protection laws by failing to enforce their own terms of service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u46R8Q"&gt;Worries that Yolo could be used for bullying have been around for years. As early as 2019, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/08/download-yolo-app/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; wrote&lt;/a&gt; that the app’s model could be open to “teen misuse.” &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/what-is-yolo-app-snapchat/?europe=true"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mashable&lt;/em&gt; noted&lt;/a&gt; that a previous anonymous messaging app Sarahah was eventually &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-trending-43174619"&gt;kicked off app stores&lt;/a&gt; over its bullying problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="62yweF"&gt;Section 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act generally protects social media companies from the actions of its users. But Section 230 typically applies to posts rather than app functionality, and US courts have recently shown willingness to hold broader platforms liable when a specific integration proves dangerous. Last week, an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22420679/snapchat-speed-filter-wrongful-death-lemmon-snap-appeals-ruling-section-230"&gt;appeals court ruled&lt;/a&gt; that Snap can be sued over a speed filter, following allegations that it encouraged reckless driving. The claim was that the design of the product encouraged dangerous behavior, with users believing that hitting speeds of 100 miles per hour would unlock an achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3vTDA5"&gt;The Bride family is seeking damages on behalf of all 92 million Snapchat users, and for the two apps to be banned from the market until they can prove they have effective safeguards in place. The lawsuit specifically says it doesn’t want to punish the users who sent the bullying messages, only the companies that facilitated them; namely Snap and the developers of Yolo and LMK:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="grBUFL"&gt;The claims in this action are not about third-party users’ communications; hence, this action does not focus on the users’ communications themselves nor does it seek to punish the senders of the bullying and harassing messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eOZuAF"&gt;Rather, the claims here are about how the anonymous messaging apps designed and distributed products and services that are inherently dangerous, unsafe, useless. For decades, anonymous messaging apps been known to cause severe and fatal harm to teenagers, hence, the harms caused by Defendants’ apps were foreseeable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZJLWz"&gt;Bullying problems have been rampant on social networks like Instagram for years. In response, the Facebook-owned social network has introduced a variety of features aimed at curtailing abuse, including warning messages when users post &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21024051/instagram-captions-potentially-offensive-ai-moderation-bullying-edit"&gt;potentially offensive captions&lt;/a&gt; and filters to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/1/17308012/instagram-offensive-comment-filtering"&gt;remove bullying comments&lt;/a&gt;. As of February this year, Instagram said its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278219/facebook-transparency-report-q4-2020-harassment-hate-takedowns"&gt;bullying and harassment takedowns had nearly doubled&lt;/a&gt; since last year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook review: a Chromebook for grown-ups</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s not perfect, but it’s practical&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="0Icn7o"&gt;Recently, I’ve reviewed a large number of Chromebooks aimed at students. They are a target market for many manufacturers, due both to the dominance of Google Classroom across many different grade levels and also to Chromebooks’ affordable price tags (compared to similar Windows and macOS machines). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dfaaqt"&gt;But adults and professionals like Chromebooks, too. Some may be power users running Linux applications, some may make heavy use of Google Workspace in the office, and some may just like Chrome OS. That’s who the Thinkpad C13 Yoga Chromebook is for: it’s a Chromebook for grown-ups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UY4DuZ"&gt;That means it breaks some stereotypical “Chromebook” conventions. Mainly, it’s not cheap: it’s not too far from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; in price. Lenovo isn’t the first company to try this shtick: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, for example, have both targeted this market with $999 Chrome OS machines in the past, and there are &lt;a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/reviews/dell-latitude-7410-chromebook"&gt;Dell Latitude Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; floating around that are even more expensive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dUBXrb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10488215"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vz61jA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s a Chromebook for grown-ups&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oX2bhd"&gt;But the C13 Yoga is my favorite attempt at a premium, convertible Chromebook that I’ve seen to date. It has the ThinkPad features that have made Lenovo so dominant in the business space for so many years: the lightweight and sturdy build, the excellent keyboard, the solid specs, the business-focused privacy features, and more. It’s not perfect, but it’s practical. And ultimately, it works. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kJzb7M"&gt;Put this Chromebook next to other members of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"&gt;ThinkPad&lt;/a&gt; line, and you could fool me into thinking it was another premium Windows machine. ThinkPads are known for their sturdy builds, and this one is no exception. The chassis is aluminum all around. There’s no flex in the keyboard or the screen — and I can’t remember the last time I said that about a Chromebook. The 360 hinge is sturdy, and there’s no screen wobble at all. The C13 achieves all this without getting too clunky: it’s 3.3 pounds and 0.61 inches thick. Lenovo says it’s been tested against 12 “military-grade” certification methods. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eocVN1"&gt;The display on my review unit is a 300-nit 1920 x 1080 IPS panel. The C13 is also one of very few 13-inch Chromebooks that offers a 4K OLED display option — that one gets up to 400 nits. Most people shouldn’t need that one, as the FHD screen is good. It delivers nice colors, good contrast, and impressive details. It does have the cramped 16:9 aspect ratio, something I’ve been glad to see &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22376272/lenovo-thinkpad-x12-detachable-review"&gt;other ThinkPads&lt;/a&gt; shifting away from this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nHHv7h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Nano review: light it up","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"},{"title":"Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Extreme Gen 3 review: a ThinkPad with a twist","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22351156/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-extreme-gen-3-review-design-specs-price-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook seen from the front on a tile counter. The screen displays a white castle surrounded by trees with mountains in the background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bh8rgZ6RYfv1pVzy-O8U1J5mneU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505260/mchin_20190730_4573_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Solid for work and play.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8Mjs1U"&gt;Elsewhere, you’ll see a number of other signature ThinkPad flourishes. There’s a very comfortable backlit keyboard, including the signature red Trackpoint in the center. (It does come with a standard Chromebook layout, rather than the usual ThinkPad layout, though the inverted-T arrow keys remain.) ThinkPad fans will also recognize the discrete clickers on the top of the touchpad, as well as the match-on-chip fingerprint sensor on the right side of the keyboard deck and the tiny webcam shutter. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook webcam." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zBrhUegWPpZfTnzHrE89cYXgiWY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505251/mchin_20190730_4573_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The shutter is so tiny you probably can’t see it here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QQ1uMj"&gt;There are some unique tidbits as well. There’s a Google H1 security chip inside, which works like the TPM chips that you’ll often find in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339981/acer-travelmate-p6-review-2021-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Windows business laptops&lt;/a&gt;. There’s an optional camera on the keyboard deck (in addition to the one on the top bezel) which you can use to snap forward-facing photos if you’re using the C13 in tablet or tent mode. There are two stereo speakers on the bottom of the device which deliver a nice surround quality, though the audio itself is tinny and not great. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="rVM7f5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You’ll see a number of other signature ThinkPad flourishes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The AMD Ryzen 5 sticker on the bottom left corner of the ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ytMKUBI5SfRP8Dt8nQ05ayQZAbY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505255/mchin_20190730_4573_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Powered by AMD Ryzen, in case you forgot.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Thinkpad logo on the bottom right corner of the C13 Yoga Chromebook." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EHaDIAsEyYS0MhaXJaM2ViqYyrg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505250/mchin_20190730_4573_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a ThinkPad, too, by the way.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MyX7Nf"&gt;But the really exciting thing about the C13 is that it’s the first Chromebook to use AMD’s Ryzen Mobile 3000 C-series processors. AMD introduced this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21449826/amd-athlon-ryzen-3000-c-series-processors-chromebooks"&gt;“C-series”&lt;/a&gt; last fall as a line specifically designed for Chromebooks. That said, they’re mostly rebrands of older AMD chips — the Ryzen 5 3500C that’s in my C13 model is basically a renamed Ryzen 5 3500U from the regular 3000 Mobile series. This is two generations old now (the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;5000 mobile Series&lt;/a&gt; came out earlier this year), but it’s still a solid processor for this kind of computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwqEDv"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lenovo.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fthinkpad%2Fthinkpad-c-series%2FThinkPad-C13-Yoga-Chromebook-Enterprise%2Fp%2F20UXCTO1WWENUS0%2Fcustomize%3F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22424783%2Flenovo-thinkpad-c13-yoga-review-price-specs-features-amd" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;base C13&lt;/a&gt; starts at $909 for 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and an Athlon Gold 3150C processor. That’s a terrible deal for $909, but Lenovo pricing is often weird and randomly discounted and this configuration is currently listed at a more reasonable $590.85. The model I have is listed at $1,247 (but currently available for $810.55) — it comes with the Ryzen 5 3500C, 8GB of RAM, and 256GB of storage. That’s still a &lt;em&gt;bit &lt;/em&gt;high for those specs, but it’s a more reasonable value. I appreciate that the storage is a PCIe SSD (rather than the slow eMMC storage that companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review"&gt;sometimes&lt;/a&gt; try to sneak into pricey Chromebooks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KlzwQe"&gt;This is definitely the best-performing Chromebook I’ve used in quite some time. I used the device as my primary driver for a few days, running well over a dozen Chrome tabs and Android apps, and I almost never felt heat or heard the fans unless I put my ear to the keyboard deck. Nothing slowed the system down, either. I was able to edit a batch of photos in Adobe Lightroom with a dump of tabs and apps open and both a Zoom call and Spotify running in the background, and the experience was just fine. Speaking as someone who’s tested a number of sluggish budget Chromebooks recently, it’s really refreshing to see Chrome OS running this smoothly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook on a tile counter, seen from above, half open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E-y4oH1mc44WwUJ34mWQc4pXFPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505248/mchin_20190730_4573_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Powered by a “new” AMD processor.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IsBA5b"&gt;AMD has claimed that its integrated Vega graphics are the best graphics you can get in a Chromebook, and while I can only verify that claim anecdotally, I had a significantly better gaming experience on the C13 than I ever have with an Intel Chromebook. &lt;em&gt;Rest in Pieces&lt;/em&gt;, one of my favorite mobile games, is usually a playable-but-stuttery experience on Chromebooks. But it was quite smooth on the C13, without a stutter in sight. Photo editing, in both Google Photos and Adobe Lightroom, was also no problem on this machine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mv8khr"&gt;I ended up running a couple benchmarks to see how this system stacks up to competition. On AndroBench, which measures the speed of the storage, the C13 Yoga Chromebook was well ahead of the pack on the majority of tasks, and head and shoulders above the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;. On Geekbench 5, the C13 scored an 890 on single-core and a 2963 on multi-core. While those scores aren’t as good as those we’ve seen from our top Chromebook pick, &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/acer-chromebook-spin-713#:~:text=On%20the%20Geekbench%205%20overall,the%20category%20average%20of%201%2C774.&amp;amp;text=This%20outdoes%20the%2083.9%20category,Pixelbook%20Go%2C%20which%20got%2085.9."&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;, (and don’t compare to the likes of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, of course), they’re still close to the top of the Chrome OS pack, beating scores we’ve seen from &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-chromebook"&gt;both&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2#:~:text=The%20Galaxy%20Chromebook%202%20we,with%208%20GB%20of%20RAM)."&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v5/cpu/5203147"&gt;Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ifPTQw"&gt;I also found the built-in stylus to be smooth and responsive on this touchscreen, though it was a bit of a pain to remove from its garage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgVCxU"&gt;One disappointment underscores all of this, and that’s battery life. Though the C13 has a reasonably sized 51Wh battery, I only averaged six hours and two minutes of continuous use with the screen at 50 percent. I ran trials using all kinds of Android apps, and trials using just Chrome, without seeing a massive difference. I’ve seen significantly more than that (with the same workload) from all kinds of Chromebooks, not to mention Windows and macOS laptops. This certainly makes me hesitant to recommend that anyone get the 4K screen option — I can’t imagine that most people will get acceptable battery life on those configurations if this is what I’m getting with the FHD screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The left side of the Lenovo ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook. " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OjExn_oCuIAf6SlsDMBv39dH4IU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505252/mchin_20190730_4573_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ports on ports on ports.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The TrackPoint in the center of the keyboard of the Lenovo ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/95olDWAhcTvQXDMiURe-HM0i1Qk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505254/mchin_20190730_4573_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Don’t forget the keyboard nub.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T8zUfi"&gt;I’d be more willing to let this battery life slide on a budget device (though plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;budget Chromebooks&lt;/a&gt; last much longer than this). But on a $1,247 device, I’m disappointed not to see an all-day life span. Sure, the processor is powerful, and there’s often a trade-off between performance and efficiency. But all kinds of Windows laptops at this price point leave this battery life in the dust. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ez1Rfc"&gt;One other concern: I could never actually get the fingerprint sensor to read my fingerprint. Lenovo says it hasn’t seen this problem before, so it may have been an issue with my unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7aVQHW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Android apps work well on the C13&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d93c6b"&gt;Android apps were hit-or-miss on Chromebooks when I first started reviewing them, but many of them work well on the C13. Messenger used to brick my device every time it got a notification, for example, but it now works just fine. That said, most of the services I use on a daily basis — Twitter, Messenger, Gmail, Reddit, etc. — are equivalent or slightly better experiences in Chrome, and some work-related Android apps (like Slack and Google Docs) are still bad on Chromebooks. So I generally don’t use Android apps too much except for things like Podcast Addict, which don’t really have browser equivalents — but I’m happy to see the ecosystem improving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZaZip"&gt;The C13 also supports Chrome OS’s tablet mode, which has gotten better, especially with the stylus. It supports various handy Android-esque gestures (swipe up to go home, for example). The device sometimes took a second or so to rearrange and resize all my Chrome windows after I switched it back to clamshell mode, which isn’t the worst thing in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XONSxu"&gt;The ThinkPad line is, in many ways, the opposite of what many people consider a Chromebook to be. ThinkPads are traditionally expensive, and they’re very well made. But times are changing (or at least, companies like Lenovo are trying to make them change). Why shouldn’t Chrome OS fans get a ThinkPad option, too?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Lenovo ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook seen from above half open." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w5bLNUpXn_BU3tmACzw7HGF9Yz0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22505257/mchin_20190730_4573_0012.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Looks like a ThinkPad, feels like a ThinkPad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="7cHzRW"&gt;The C13 Yoga isn’t a perfect machine. The 16:9 screen makes me sad, and the battery life is a big miss. It’s a bit expensive for what it offers, as is often the case with laptops targeting business users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W3mlRb"&gt;With that said, the C13 is also the closest thing to a MacBook that I’ve seen yet in the Chromebook space. It has a solid, sturdy build that looks and feels premium. It has a strong processor, an excellent keyboard, and a solid screen, and it comes from a highly respected brand with a devoted base of fans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="8ICB7K"&gt;So while the C13 may not be the right choice for most people — there are more affordable Chromebooks with better battery life that will be a better buy for most consumers — it’s objectively a neat device that will probably make a certain sect of Chrome OS users happy. If you’re a Chrome OS business user who’s been jealous of the premium chassis that Windows and Mac users get, here’s a ThinkPad for you.   &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VW will start testing its Argo AI-powered self-driving vans in Germany this summer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2W10Ltb_-Uk1sQ4cR2CEQ5Vcpxo=/337x0:2526x1459/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69272851/ID_BUZZ_AD_Sketch.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: VW&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H4NQ9d"&gt;Volkswagen will start testing its new autonomous vehicles in Germany this summer, the company announced Wednesday. The German automaker’s electric ID Buzz vans will use hardware and software developed by Argo AI, a Pittsburgh-based startup that is backed by Ford and VW. The aim is to launch a commercial delivery and micro-transit service in Germany by 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1XEIx"&gt;Executives from VW and Argo convened a press conference this week to provide an update on their partnership, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/12/20690722/ford-vw-alliance-self-driving-argo-investment-valuation"&gt;first announced in 2019 as an extension of VW’s “global alliance” with Ford&lt;/a&gt;. And while much of what they discussed was already known, it did provide a closer look at the timeline for launching a revenue-generating service using VW’s vehicles and Argo’s autonomous technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZOOvC"&gt;Argo, which has been testing its vehicles in the US with Ford for the last few years, said it would be launching the fifth generation of its automated driving technology with the VW ID Buzz, which is the electric version of the automaker’s iconic microbus. Bryan Salesky, the startup’s founder and CEO, praised the collaborative nature of Argo and Volkswagen’s partnership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wSUinY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A closer look at the timeline&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZHKs8Q"&gt;“We’re building our technology and partnering with Volkswagen in a way that really sets us apart from what others are doing,” Salesky said. “And we think it really puts us in a position to deliver a safe, smart, and scalable product to deliver on the promise of autonomous driving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y49sO0"&gt;That work has already started. Earlier this year, Argo and VW developed a prototype minivan using the German company’s MEB electric vehicle platform inside the body of a VW T6 Transporter and Argo’s AV technology, including LIDAR sensors, radar, and cameras. In addition, Argo’s software enables the vehicle to “see” its environment, plan for its next steps, and predict the movements of other vehicles and pedestrians on the road. This, in combination with Argo’s sensor suite, allows for automated driving at low and high speeds, Salesky said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cdq0j7"&gt;VW said that it plans to put the vans in service as a ride-sharing fleet under its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/6/16733944/moia-vw-minivan-shuttle-ridesharing-autonomous"&gt;subsidiary Moia&lt;/a&gt;. Since 2017, Moia has been operating a fleet of electric vehicles as part of its “ride-pooling” service in Hamburg, where it has served 3 million customers to date. Those customers have provided a treasure trove of feedback that Moia CEO Richard Henrich says will come in use as the company shifts to a completely autonomous fleet by 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xmF5hl"&gt;“We have learned in recent years that both customers and cities have really high and very specific expectations towards future autonomous ride-pooling systems,” Henrich said. “Customers, on the one hand side, expect ride-pooling to be as easy, convenient, and reliable as riding their own car... But cities, on the other hand, expect ride pooling to help alleviate traffic congestion.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RbNBSy"&gt;The AV industry has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22423489/autonomous-vehicle-consolidation-acquisition-lyft-uber"&gt;consolidating rapidly over the past year&lt;/a&gt;, with many companies being acquired or merging with other companies. It’s a mad dash to keep businesses afloat in the face of lengthening timelines and steep operational costs with little expectation for revenue generation in the near term. Robotaxis, in particular, are seen as being further out than most companies are predicting. VW and Argo say they remain bullish about their ability to hit the target date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5tg4J"&gt;“There is a long way to go still until this high tech becomes an enormous growth market,” said Christian Senger, VW’s senior VP for commercial vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="51RYiS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s $300 million tax bill rejected by EU judges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PHqY0OrfFrzi5dCedc7oP1miAvI=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69272838/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7eRnvK"&gt;Judges from the European Union’s second-highest court have &lt;a href="https://curia.europa.eu/jcms/upload/docs/application/pdf/2021-05/cp210079en.pdf"&gt;rejected&lt;/a&gt; a €250 million ($300 million) tax bill lodged against Amazon in 2017 as part the bloc’s ongoing fight against US tech giants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OsZD1M"&gt;The case was one of a number spearheaded by Margrethe Vestager, the European Commissioner for Competition, in which sweetheart tax deals given to powerful corporations were framed as a form of illegal state subsidy. The most notable of these was a 2016 case in which Apple was ordered to pay Ireland €13 billion ($14.9 billion) in back taxes. This decision was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21325325/apple-eu-ireland-back-taxes-13-billion-overturned-appealed"&gt;annulled&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 by the same court involved in today’s ruling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9xbKhZ"&gt;The Amazon case can be traced back to 2006, when the e-commerce giant established a labyrinthine tax structure in Europe that allowed it to funnel revenue from all EU sales through a subsidiary based in Luxembourg. Internally, Amazon referred to this as &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/18/revealed-project-goldcrest-amazon-avoid-huge-sums-tax"&gt;Project Goldcrest&lt;/a&gt;, named after Luxembourg’s national bird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZSpNzS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon’s Luxembourg subsidiary recorded €44 billion in revenue but paid zero corporation tax&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U8QyAX"&gt;In 2017, the European Commission &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_17_3701"&gt;ruled&lt;/a&gt; that this structure was illegal and had allowed Amazon to avoid around €250 million in taxes. “Luxembourg gave illegal tax benefits to Amazon,” said Vestager at the time. “As a result, almost three quarters of Amazon’s profits were not taxed. In other words, Amazon was allowed to pay four times less tax than other local companies subject to the same national tax rules.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TaUkx"&gt;In Amazon’s most recent financial filings it recorded revenue of €44 billion ($53 billion) passing through its Luxembourg subsidiary. But this subsidiary, which has 5,262 employees, also registered €1.2 billion in losses, and so &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/may/04/amazon-sales-income-europe-corporation-tax-luxembourg"&gt;paid zero corporation tax&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5x5Uah"&gt;In the ruling this morning announced by the General Court of the European Union, judges found that the Commission “did not prove to the requisite legal standard that there was an undue reduction to the tax burden” of Amazon’s Luxembourg subsidiary. The ruling is a significant win for Amazon and a blow for EU politicians hoping to rein in US tech giants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4eytp"&gt;Although the 2017 ruling has now been annulled, today’s decision can still be appealed to the EU’s highest court, the European Court of Justice. The Apple case overturned in 2020 has already been appealed in this fashion and is awaiting a further ruling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DrcaJC"&gt;After details of Project Goldcrest were first revealed, the US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) also filed its own case against Amazon, seeking up to $1.5 billion in back taxes. A federal court judge &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/03/irs-loses-lawsuit-in-attempt-to-get-amazon-to-pay-1-5b-in-back-taxes/"&gt;rejected this case&lt;/a&gt; in 2017, saying the figure claimed by the IRS was “arbitrary, capricious, and unreasonable.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="antBYw"&gt;Although decisions like today’s have upheld the legality of Amazon’s tax arrangements, politicians continue to question their overall fairness. In the UK, after &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; revealed that Amazon’s Luxembourg subsidiary &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/may/04/amazon-sales-income-europe-corporation-tax-luxembourg"&gt;paid no corporation tax&lt;/a&gt; in its most recent financial filings, politicians and activists slammed the system that allowed such skewed financials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FcrrzM"&gt;“Amazon’s revenues have soared under the pandemic while our high streets struggle, yet it continues to shift its profits to tax havens like Luxembourg to avoid paying its fair share of tax,” said UK Labour MP Margaret Hodge. “The government must act and help to grasp this once-in-a-generation opportunity to banish corporate tax avoidance to a thing of the past.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US backtracks on Xiaomi blacklisting</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hW_X6zyKUktbXjIhuKdsWJ2ShXA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69272722/DSC00410.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Sam Byford / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7byo4w"&gt;The US has agreed not to put Xiaomi on a blacklist blocking investment in the Chinese tech company, undoing a move made in the last week of the Trump administration. Xiaomi sued the US government over the designation, but just filed a joint status report with the Department of Defense saying the two parties “have agreed upon a path forward that would resolve this litigation without the need for contested briefing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dKUWtn"&gt;The DoD had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22231786/trump-administration-blacklists-xiaomi-communist-chinese-military-company"&gt;decided to designate Xiaomi as a “Chinese Communist Military Company,”&lt;/a&gt; which could have forced any American investors to divest their holdings in Xiaomi by November this year. After Xiaomi sued the government in response, a district judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/13/22328969/judge-grants-xiaomi-injunction-us-restrictions"&gt;issued a preliminary injunction&lt;/a&gt; to block the blacklisting, calling it “arbitrary and capricious.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oKEUeV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Judge described blacklisting as ‘arbitrary and capricious’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RTwk7z"&gt;The US didn’t appeal the preliminary injunction against it. Xiaomi told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in January that the company “is not owned, controlled or affiliated with the Chinese military, and is not a ‘Communist Chinese Military Company.’”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B2dIdd"&gt;Now it looks like the matter will be settled on better terms. Xiaomi and the DoD have “agreed that a final order vacating the January 14, 2021 designation of Xiaomi Corporation as a CCMC … would be appropriate,” according to the court filing. The two parties now plan to negotiate on an order vacating agency action, with a joint proposal expected before May 20th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon is suing to stop SMS raffle scams</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R7sHfqJzjTUweDKT2DFlEu5t-fM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69272573/ngarun_181114_1777_amazon_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Natt Garun / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oTHjwZ"&gt;Ever get a text message informing you that you’ve won a prize — from Amazon itself? I certainly have, and I’ve even known a person or two who fell for those scams. Now, Amazon is attempting to hunt those scammers down, &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210511006213/en/Amazon-Announces-Lawsuit-to-Combat-Fraudulent-Affiliate-Marketing-Schemes/"&gt;with a new lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; aimed at unmasking 50 unknown defendants in federal court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FJFU5W"&gt;Here’s the text message I received the other day from one such scammer:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Whban3GKO4Yt1MxBjNZUNZ2W8Hw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22508506/amazon_text_message_scam.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="caQzRT"&gt;And here’s where it took me when I clicked:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8miuX4Qtr8qdj5_mYaeOJ5A2IWQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22508196/image__7_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jSdvQM"&gt;According to Amazon’s legal complaint, which you can read in full below, the scam uses Amazon’s logos, web design, and meaningless “surveys” to trick people into buying products (ones that aren’t actually from Amazon), seemingly for cheap. The scammers aren’t necessarily the ones selling those products, either — but because they’re acting as referrers, they get a finder’s fee in the form of affiliate marketing commissions. The Better Business Bureau says &lt;a href="https://www.bbb.org/article/news-releases/23914-bbb-warning-you-won-raffle-from-amazon-watch-out-its-another-scam"&gt;it received 771 reports of scams impersonating Amazon in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, second only to those annoying calls claiming to be the Social Security Administration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJWZMd"&gt;The tricky part is finding the scammers, because Amazon doesn’t actually know who they are, just which domain names they used to host the scam. But by filing a lawsuit against these 50 John Doe plaintiffs, Amazon may be able to get a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doe_subpoena"&gt;doe subpoena&lt;/a&gt; to unmask their identities. The company tells us that’s worked in the past; in 2018, the company &lt;a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2018/amazon-files-suit-malvertising-campaign-alleging-sophisticated-widespread-scheme-deceive-consumers/"&gt;filed a John Doe lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against a very similar scam and was able to track down at least four defendants. Each case ended with a permanent injunction, according to court records, and Amazon says it’s won at least $1.5 million in settlements so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tSARNM"&gt;The lawsuit also gives Amazon time to find them (against the statute of limitations) and puts the scammers on notice, just in case they might like to stop before they get hauled into court. &lt;/p&gt;
