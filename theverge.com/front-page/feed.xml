    <title>This TP-Link router automatically moves its antenna for the best Wi-Fi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SfMK3q17Zp5tLMsaelmxoE-ax-g=/85x0:555x313/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345439/Screenshot_2021_12_29_155732.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;What we all thought routers would look like&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wZAX3P"&gt;In what is likely one of the stranger innovations at CES this year, TP-Link is showing off the prototype for its new Archer AXE200 Omni router. There are plenty of new routers taking advantage of 6E connectivity debuting at this year's CES, but the engineering of this particular router is sure to raise some eyebrows.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yoUykVGgokUJmcBt0yMTMY1hsHg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132988/Screenshot_2021_12_29_155732.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vhi9jL"&gt;The AXE200 features four antennas that automatically fold out and rotate to seek out the best possible signal, wherever it happens to be. While the necessity of this particular feature is debatable, it's pretty wild to see a router come to life and instinctively articulate its arms like some kind of alien homing beacon.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9eWUsZlwCbWKrqFoloVaXjB_zHo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23132976/Screenshot_2021_12_29_161608.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0iI4pQ"&gt;While the effectiveness of this particular feature isn’t certain, the technical specs are definitely impressive. As you might expect from a 6E router, the AXE200 features improved tri-band speed, with a 6Ghz band joining the existing 5Ghz and 2.4Ghz bands. Additionally, the Wi-Fi 6E compatibility allows the router to exploit additional bandwidth and reduce latency overall. The AXE200 is still in the prototype stages, so there isn’t any information regarding the price point or a release window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cE5N7O"&gt;For anyone in the market for something a little more conventional, TP-Link is also premiering its Archer AXE300 quad-band router, which doesn’t feature autonomous antennas but shares the same extraterrestrial design. The AXE300 takes full advantage of WiFi 6E with duplicate 5GHz bands in addition to the 6Ghz and 2.4Ghz bands. The price for this particular unit is to be determined but is scheduled to become available in Q2 of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

    <title>TP-Link is finally making some HomeKit-enabled products</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S4eqIj3p1uIO31UWBMBiU310aiw=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345430/tapo_homekit_4.001.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smart Tapo products with HomeKit from left to right: Color Light Bulb (L535E), Power Strip - Wall (P306), Dimmer Switch (S500D), Light Strip (L930), and Mini Plug (P125).&lt;/em&gt; | Images from TP-Link / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Wb1Jmo"&gt;TP-Link has announced a new lineup of smart home products for the US at CES 2022 under its Tapo brand — including HomeKit-enabled smart lights, plugs, and a smart switch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7zKjEu"&gt;TP-Link has sold smart home products in Europe under the &lt;a href="https://www.tapo.com/uk/"&gt;Tapo brand&lt;/a&gt; since 2019, but now the company is bringing it to the US for the first time. Previously, none of the Tapo products supported HomeKit, but now five of the newly-announced Tapo products will support Apple’s smart home connections. (The company initially promised at CES 2019 to include HomeKit with a smart plug, but later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/12/20801902/tp-link-apple-kasa-smart-plug-homekit-support-canceled"&gt;canceled plans&lt;/a&gt; to push the update.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SKLovp"&gt;The all-new Tapo HomeKit-enabled products are slated to release throughout 2022, starting with the Mini Plug in the first quarter. The Power Strip, Dimmer Switch, and Light Strip are slated for a second-quarter release, while the Color Light Bulb will ship in the third quarter of 2022. None of them require a hub and they can connect directly to Wi-Fi.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lGQgWE8uSdxNVW-3zcTgtA69ohg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23143422/tapo_homekit_3.001.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Images from TP-Link / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tapo smart security cameras from left to right: Outdoor Camera - Wired (C320WS), Pan and Tilt Camera (C220), Floodlight Camera (C720), and Outdoor Camera - Battery (C420)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lsjr38"&gt;TP-Link has also announced four new Tapo cloud-connected security cameras — some of which can record to a microSD card but do not support HomeKit or HomeKit secure video. The first is scheduled for release in the first quarter of 2022, it’s a wired outdoor camera with night vision and 2K resolution that can record to a microSD card as large as 256GB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqxP3c"&gt;The other three are coming in the third quarter of 2022. The Pan and Tilt Camera includes a cover door to block the lens of the 2K camera, smart detection that can notify you of the presence of people, pets, and cars. There's also a new wired Floodlight Camera and a battery-powered outdoor camera — both with 2K resolution — and the latter can connect to a dedicated hub that records video to a microSD card.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wephHpMSYstSa4ETFld3T8syL18=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23143111/Screen_Shot_2022_01_03_at_5.45.34_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: TP-Link&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TP-Link’s Tapo smart sensors and alarm hub communicate via Sub-1GHz long-range wireless.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qdkI2m"&gt;Finally, TP-Link announced a new set of Tapo home security sensors. One is a programmable Smart Button that can wirelessly control other Tapo products — available in the second quarter of 2022. Another is a kit that includes a motion sensor, door/window sensor, and an alarm hub that can connect up to 64 sensors together via a Sub-1GHz wireless connection — a low-powered and long-range radio technology. These sensors are powered by button cells that TP-Link says last for more than a year on this connection, while the required alarm hub needs wall power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXbfLQ"&gt;Prices are yet to be announced on the new Tapo product lineup. And although TP-Link is listed as a participant of the Connectivity Standards Alliance, the group that supports Matter, the company has yet to announce any products that support the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787729/matter-smart-home-standard-apple-amazon-google"&gt;growing universal smart home standard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlqedK"&gt;In the US, TP-Link has sold smart home products (including motion-activated switches and outdoor smart plugs) under the Kasa brand, and the company will continue to do so. That includes a Kasa wired smart doorbell that was originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22215083/tplink-kasa-smart-doorbell-outdoor-camera-light-switches"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; in January of last year, which is now planned for release in February for $59.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Podcasters are letting software pick their ads — it’s already going awry</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OZgAWaOslAj43RYpHS6fCkT_sDw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345434/VRG_ILLO_4937_K_Radtke_Megaphone.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Kristen Radtke / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Ads are showing up in places they shouldn’t&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="zKvxFH"&gt;The podcast industry is working up to something big; you can see it in the acquisitions. All the industry’s major players have, over the past two years, acquired companies focused on one feature: inserting ads into podcasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKQmbd"&gt;Of course, podcasting has always primarily depended on ad revenue, so this incoming era has more to do with getting podcast ads to act like the online advertising we see everywhere else. Wherever there’s a website, there can be a targeted ad, and now wherever there’s a podcast, there’s the potential of inserting a targeted ad, too. Whichever company can make that transition happen the fastest, across the most shows, and with the best data, could not only recoup all those millions of dollars in acquisition costs but make more on top of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxFzCi"&gt;The industry is sprinting toward this programmatic advertising future. However, there are some obstacles along the way, and podcasters are already running into them. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has identified multiple examples of programmatic advertising going wrong, according to sources who asked to remain anonymous over concerns of fraying industry relationships. Ads are showing up in places they shouldn’t, signaling not so much a death knell for the effort, but more of a warning that if the trend continues, early trust between podcast networks and tech companies could fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zldmz3"&gt;Last year, an ad for the TV show &lt;em&gt;The Sex Lives of College Girls &lt;/em&gt;popped up on an American Public Media (APM) podcast it shouldn’t have been approved for: a children’s show, a source familiar with the situation tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Separately, a science podcaster says ads for BP and ExxonMobil were inserted into their program, despite them explicitly blocking ads for oil and gas companies. In both cases, the ads were served through the Spotify Ad Network, or SPAN, which launched last spring. They were either miscategorized or presented without any sort of content rating. A Megaphone support agent, the platform that powers SPAN, told the science podcaster that BP’s ad was filed under the “other” category while Exxon’s was under “elections,” for example. In the case of &lt;em&gt;The Sex Lives of College Girls&lt;/em&gt;, the ad failed to include an age-appropriate content warning. Meanwhile, another source says issues with broad categories are pervasive beyond Spotify. They’ve seen a cannabis brand categorized as an “herbal supplement” and an ad for cellulite-targeting injections under “beauty.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="L8me5D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10776720"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FYKmtd"&gt;Unfortunately, these categories are standard across the industry. They’re how ad companies and podcast networks, guided by the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), label their content so everyone knows what they’re buying and receiving. Clearly, they don’t always work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XygPta"&gt;Prior to this programmatic movement, most podcasters and their sales teams peddled host-read ads baked into a show, meaning they were read, included, and never taken out of an episode. That changed with dynamic ad insertion, which still could work as a host-read ad, but instead of living in a show forever, the ads switched out, hence the “dynamic” wording. Then came programmatic, which relies on dynamic ad insertion with an automated twist. The big idea is advertisers can buy a number of impressions targeting a certain audience, and the ad serving technology will automatically carry out the order across shows and networks, finding the best audience for that marketing at the best price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAx22Q"&gt;The IAB’s categories allow podcasters, who are now hands-off with their ads, to include or exclude business types, theoretically giving them peace of mind that an ad for a specific product won’t run. However, the categories are falling short and leading podcasters and networks to think twice about participating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1uMHbN"&gt;After the &lt;em&gt;Sex Lives of College Girls &lt;/em&gt;incident, APM opted out of Spotify’s programmatic network for both its kids and adult programming, a source familiar says. The science podcaster hasn’t turned their back on automatically inserted ads yet but could if the issue happens again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Quhbzg"&gt;“In order for me to take this deal, I need to be able to know that I can ACTUALLY exclude the stuff I don’t want to advertise on my show,” they say over DM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="flhclA"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"podcasts"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZwQNic"&gt;“We definitely see folks miscategorized,” says RedCircle CEO Mike Kadin, whose platform relies on SiriusXM’s AdsWizz ad inventory to fill programmatic requests. “I have no view of whether that’s intentional, or just mistakes, or whatever, but it definitely happens, and there’s too [many ads], even at our size, for us to manually review every ad.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EdAHnJ"&gt;Some ad serving networks, like Amazon’s Art19, do manually review new advertisers’ content, according to a source familiar with the platform, which requires humans to listen to a lot of audio. It’s unclear how Spotify handles incoming ads, however. We reached out for comment, as well as details on who categorizes the ads, but haven’t heard back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MzzELz"&gt;Taken together, these incidents might not sound all that damning — some ads showed up in places they shouldn’t have — but in an industry famous for its close ties between advertisers, hosts, and listeners, it’s a problem. (Imagine a cannabis ad showing up in a podcast for recovering addicts, for example, or one for cellulite injections in a program about eating disorders — not good.) At the same time, the industry’s future, or at least big platforms’ space in it, hinges on this technology. If it fails, those big podcasts deals, and the hype, likely fade away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MyMBF5"&gt;There are few solutions to address these issues. Even if podcasters wanted to wholly block a specific advertiser, for example, it can be difficult because the technology looks at the ad’s registered domain name, which might not be the brand itself, Kadin says. Plus, ads can be swapped in and out quickly, making it difficult to trace back where and when something occurred. The system isn’t always straightforward, and ultimately, opting into programmatic will likely come down to what’s best for a specific show’s listeners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMLI7I"&gt;“If your audience is very sensitive, this might not be the best solution for you,” Kadin says. “And if your audience is just used to the idea that the podcaster doesn’t choose the advertiser, then that’s also fine.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="uPRdD2"&gt;That’s likely not the way most audiences think of podcast ads, at least not yet, which presents a problem for platforms trying to make programmatic happen. The podcast audience is lucrative because listeners often pay attention to and act on the ads they hear. If they stop doing so, the industry could become less appealing. Someone has to give: either the podcasters who believe their audience can get used to hearing ads the hosts themselves aren’t vouching for, or the listeners who, if display ads are any indication, might start ignoring the ads altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CV3vWy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s a home robot that actually looks useful: a self-driving shelf</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ijXf6J8W7x5rpsl2Gn0-0cuCX6E=/0x11:5152x3446/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345322/Guests_Scene___Press.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TTezXj"&gt;Most home robots unveiled at CES tend to over-promise and under-deliver. Every year, we’re treated to staged demos of prototype “&lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/home/smart-home/samsung-ces-2021-robots-will-clean-your-house-and-pour-you-a-glass-of-wine/"&gt;robot butlers&lt;/a&gt;” that always fail to materialize as real products. But two new bots created by a startup named Labrador Systems look like they’ll break this cycle. Why? Because the company has kept things simple — &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; simple — by building what are essentially self-driving shelves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UpRkR9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Caddie and Retriever robots are designed to move stuff from A to B&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yTnxPH"&gt;Labrador’s robots, named Caddie and Retriever, are designed to help around the house by ferrying goods. They’re both about the size of a side-table and come equipped with wheels and sensors that let them navigate your home. Owners will set a number of “bus-stops” for the machines (e.g. “in the kitchen” and “by the couch”) and the robots will move between these locations on command, automatically steering around obstacles and people. Both bots can be directed by apps or using verbal commands via an Alexa integration. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1A84Np"&gt;The robots’ max load is 25 pounds, or around 11 kilograms. They move at a steady walking pace and recharge themselves automatically overnight. The big difference between the two machines is that Retriever can raise and lower itself and has a pair of conveyor-belt like arms that lets it grab trays (if they’ve been placed in a suitable location). But the selling point for both is the same: “move stuff from A to B.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zWoJcbwMQetpp2xDfctEz-BxRBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144084/Kitchen_Scene___Press.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Labrador Systems&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Caddie and Retriever robots can carry up to 25lbs (11kg). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rzM60o"&gt;Although the robots could be useful to anyone, they’re designed primarily to help people with mobility problems; the elderly, and individuals with chronic conditions like Parkinson’s or arthritis. Mike Dooley, CEO of Labrador, says he was inspired to develop them after seeing his own mother move from walking unaided, to using a cane, to a wheelchair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="aWRxWv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Her hands were becoming her extra pair of legs. She didn’t have them free any more.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4er9Ty"&gt;“I noticed when she was using the walker or the cane, her hands were becoming her extra pair of legs. She didn’t have them free any more,” Dooley tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. In such a scenario,  he says, a robot like Caddie could be incredibly useful just by assisting with simple tasks: moving washing to the laundry, dirty plates to the kitchen, or a book and a pair of glasses to the couch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eemtsB"&gt;Dooley says is mother is now “90 years old and still around, but she’s full time in a wheelchair or a hospital bed and getting caregivers twice a day.” In this scenario, Labrador’s Retriever robot might help out by not only moving items around, but grabbing trays with useful items from tables and cabinets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZmeaZ"&gt;In a live-streamed demo, I saw the Retriever robot wheel itself up to a fridge which had been retrofitted with motors on its door. The fridge swung open and the robot used its arms to slide a tray out from a shelf in the refrigerator and carry it over to another location. Dooley says Labrador will offer this sort of retrofitted set-up to customers, allowing them to create routines that offer extra independence to those who need regular care. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYMMP6"&gt;“A caregiver could be there in the morning, and set up stuff so that somebody has good quality of life when they’re gone,” says Dooley. He gives the example of placing a lunchtime meal in a refrigerator that Retriever can then fetch in response to a voice command. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qVlxwC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10960565"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CKt6C4"&gt;The machines’ simplicity of purpose is informed by Dooley’s experience in the world of robotics. He was previously the first product manager for Lego Mindstorms, the company’s hugely popular toy robot kit. “My charter was to sell 10 to 15,000 units of that kit, and we ended up doing over a million,” he says. “That’s a claim to fame that really impresses six year olds.”  After that he helped launch a robot swiffer named Mint, with the parent company then acquired by Roomba-creator iRobot, and the underlying tech becoming the foundation for its Braava range of mops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwpA20"&gt;This work showed him the benefits of keeping robots simple by narrowing down their functionality. Many home robots fail before they’ve even launched because they try to do too much, promising customers they’ll be emptying the dishwasher or vacuuming the carpet — tasks that are extremely challenging for machines to complete even within tightly-controlled lab conditions, let alone the ever-changing chaos of the average home. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uFV8tK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s the same tech that means you can have Pokémon look like they’re in your room.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hA6SMI"&gt;Caddie and Retriever, by comparison, have fewer moving parts and are designed to work primarily along pre-set paths. Labrador systems is exploring adding more open-ended functionality like manual control and “follow me” mode, but Dooley says the company is happier focusing on more constrained use-cases. “We have this simple mantra, of keeping it very controllable and very understandable,” he says. The machines also use off-the-shelf parts for navigation (mainly infrared and depth sensors — no lidar) and take advantage of recent advances in augmented reality to navigate users’ homes. “It’s the same tech that means you can have Pokémon look like they’re in your room, jumping around,” says Dooley. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LqIhaG"&gt;Despite this simplicity, the machines aren’t yet ready for consumers to use. Introducing &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; automated system to the home is a difficult task (just think of all the ways Roombas can go wrong), and the pressing need to not make mistakes is even greater when the machines are designed to help those with mobility challenges. Labrador started conducting pilots of the Caddie robot last year, placing machines in people’s homes starting in February 2021. But the company is going to be conducting more tests, and only aims to be in full production of the machines “by the second half of 2023.” &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Labrador’s robots could supplement the work of caregivers. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="V2yRVx"&gt;Starting today, interested customers can put down a fully-refundable $250 deposit for a Caddie or Retriever unit. Prices for the machines will be $1500 upfront with 36-month payment plants. That’s $99 a month for Caddie and $149 a month for Retriever, giving total costs of $5,000 and $6,800 for the two machines. After payments have finished, customers will own the bots and be able to keep using their current functionality, but they’ll have to pay Labrador an as-yet-undecided fee for an extended warranty and new feature support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7pmQc"&gt;In our interview, Dooley treads the line between confidence in the machines and humility regarding the difficulty of home automation. Many — if not most — new home robots fail, and few are as ambitious as Caddie and Retriever. But he says the experience with pilot users has been incredibly encouraging. “It’s an entirely new concept, but they say it’s almost like nothing to use it, in terms of thought — you just do it.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B1Aq8e"&gt;And if the technology works out, it could be incredibly useful for those who can access it, helping the West’s aging population keep independent for longer, and reducing the burden on caregivers who do incredible and under-recognized work for so many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kl5iKq"&gt;“We’re not trying to hype this, because there’s way too much hype in robotics as it is,” says Dooley. “We really want to make something that has a practical impact, because if it does it can make a difference in people’s lives.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Garmin’s newest smartwatches aren’t limited to fitness buffs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7l9beREV-2BnpEv8eu9AEjklrfU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345126/vsong_211229_4950_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VQTLmQ"&gt;When you think of Garmin wearables, you’re probably thinking of its running smartwatches — durable and a little bulky, but with excellent GPS, detailed metrics, and long battery life. The company has made strides in recent years to &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-new-garmin-makes-a-compelling-case-for-smaller-smar-1846449491"&gt;expand&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/after-years-of-ugly-watches-garmins-got-some-fresh-sty-1837481085"&gt;beyond&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/this-gorgeous-garmin-hybrid-smartwatch-is-too-damn-comp-1840270728"&gt;its fitness niche&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems to have finally hit its stride at CES 2022 with the Venu 2 Plus and the entry-level Vivomove Sport.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xrIBMS"&gt;It might seem a bit soon for a Venu 2 Plus, given that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22524882/garmin-venu-2-fitness-watch-review"&gt;Venu 2&lt;/a&gt; just launched last April. However, the device fixes one of the more glaring omissions from the Venu 2: voice capabilities. The Venu 2 Plus adds both a speaker and microphone, meaning the smartwatch is now capable of taking and making calls directly from the wrist, as well as adding voice assistant support. The watch works with whatever assistant is on your phone, meaning it works over Bluetooth as opposed to being loaded directly onto the watch. According to Phil McLendon, Garmin’s project lead for the Venu 2 Plus, that was a conscious decision as the “best assistant is the one already on your phone.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kXCDJh"&gt;Size-wise, the watch has a 43mm case, which is a compromise between the 45mm Venu 2 and the 40mm Venu 2S. It also has slightly less battery life, at an estimated nine days in smartwatch mode and up to eight hours in GPS + Music mode (That said, nine days is still quite impressive for a smartwatch). It also has a color touchscreen and the option for an always-on display. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Venu 2 Plus on the voice assistant screen" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bjMbiB9084S-CjVthOWq3QL_iqA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23143030/vsong_211229_4950_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Victoria Song / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Venu 2 Plus adds voice capabilities that were missing from the Venu 2. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o3LlVR"&gt;Meanwhile, the Vivomove Sport is a new hybrid analog and is meant to be an entry-level smartwatch at $179.99. While Garmin’s Vivomove line has always been stylish, they’ve also been extremely pricey. The Luxe, for example, is a gorgeous smartwatch but costs a whopping $499.99. The Style is only slightly cheaper at $299.99. While the Sport has the same hidden touchscreen display, it’s only on the bottom half of the screen. It also opts for a silicone strap, and because it’s meant to be for more casual users, it opts for tethered GPS with your phone. That said, it still tracks blood oxygen levels, sleep, and exercises recorded with the watch still get you the same detailed metrics. It also supports Garmin’s “Body Battery” feature, which evaluates your recovery levels, abnormal heart rate alerts, and women’s health tracking. For safety, it can also send a message with your location to designated emergency contacts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bh7tOS"&gt;I got the chance to spend a few weeks with both the Venu 2 Plus and Vivomove Sport, and my initial impression is that both are solid smartwatches. The Venu 2 Plus is a little big for my wrists but is easy on the eyes in terms of style and readability. I got at least a week in battery life, even with several hours of GPS activities. Calls sounded clear, and the voice assistant features worked decently enough. Siri didn’t understand a few commands, but I chalk that up to Siri being Siri rather than any issue with the Venu 2 Plus. Health features, like Garmin Coach, were also convenient though a bit buggy. However, I can’t deliver a final verdict on performance as I’ve been using a beta version of the software. Overall, I can see this being a neat choice for someone who wants the in-depth fitness tracking Garmin’s known for but not at the expense of smart features.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Vivomove Sport screen with smart notifications showing" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XNArrsoD1dfZoYIw6fJGYpu3l30=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23143027/vsong_211229_4950_0009.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Victoria Song / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vivomove Sport has the same “hidden” smart display as Garmin’s other hybrid analogs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="t2c0RG"&gt;The Vivomove Sport has also been impressive thus far. It didn’t overpower my wrist, and I even got some compliments from a friend who’s a self-proclaimed smartwatch-hater. The mint green color is, dare I say, cute, and it held up well during several runs and strength training workouts. Navigating menus and reading notifications isn’t always the easiest, but that’s not unique to the Vivomove Sport. It’s a tradeoff you’ll find with every hybrid analog watch on the market. I also found battery life to be on the shorter side, in that it lasted me about four days on a single charge. That’s still much longer than an Apple Watch or Samsung Galaxy Watch 4, but not quite as long as some Fitbits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9qG5Uc"&gt;Both watches are available now on Garmin’s website. The Venu 2 Plus has a suggested retail price of $449.99 and comes in three versions: all black, white and gold, and gray and silver.   The Vivomove Sport is $179.99 and comes in black, white, brown, and mint green.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRhNH7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel and AMD tease big CPU announcements for CES</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qRMPGNv0dTXwLX4AHfB10R8yk2E=/0x1:2048x1366/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345108/image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AMD CEO Lisa Su.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: AMD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LACyU0"&gt;Ahead of their press conferences at this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/31/22861669/ces-2022-ends-early-covid-january-7"&gt;truncated&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"&gt;part-virtual CES&lt;/a&gt;, AMD and Intel are teasing big CPU announcements for the show. AMD’s “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lisasu/status/1478003330463019010"&gt;product premiere&lt;/a&gt;” is due to take place at 10am ET today, while Intel has a “&lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/media-alert-intel-mobileye-ces-2022.html"&gt;digital-first live experience&lt;/a&gt;” scheduled for slightly later at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/intelnews/status/1468969003242586126"&gt;1pm ET&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bo4UuO"&gt;Intel’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/inteltech/status/1478079758898446337"&gt;CES tease&lt;/a&gt; is focused on one key spec, 5.5GHz, which is expected to be the maximum boost clock speed its upcoming CPU will be able to reach. That’s a 300MHz improvement over the company’s current flagship, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22763042/intel-core-i9-12900k-review"&gt;Core i9-12900K&lt;/a&gt;, which was announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22763042/intel-core-i9-12900k-review"&gt;late last year&lt;/a&gt; and can reach a top boost clock speed of 5.2GHz. &lt;a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-teases-core-i9-12900ks-cpu-with-boost-clock-up-to-5-5-ghz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VideoCardz&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the new processor could be called the Core i9-12900KS, and may release in late Q1 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XyAYmI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;12th Gen &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IntelCore?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#IntelCore&lt;/a&gt; desktop processors are topping Best CPU lists and widely available to gamers and enthusiasts. And we're not done yet. Next stop: Up to 5.5GHz. &lt;a href="https://t.co/mEUreGSixF"&gt;pic.twitter.com/mEUreGSixF&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Intel Technology (@IntelTech) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IntelTech/status/1478079758898446337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 3, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dnKmBt"&gt;Meanwhile, AMD CEO Lisa Su hasn’t revealed much in the way of specifics in her own CES tease. But the company is widely expected to announce its next generation of Ryzen CPUs at this year’s show. AMD typically uses CES to launch its laptop-focused processors: it announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;Ryzen 5000 mobile lineup at CES 2021&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21054007/amd-7nm-ryzen-4000-cpu-ces-2020-intel-competition-laptop-processors-zen-2"&gt;Ryzen 4000 CPUs at CES 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Improvements expected this year include the &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/uk/amd-confirms-ryzen-cpu-refresh-with-3d-v-cache-early-in-2022/"&gt;use of 3D V-Cache&lt;/a&gt; for a 15 percent performance uplift.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tMT7sr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Happy New Year and welcome to 2022!  We are kicking off the year with lots of new tech - hope you will join us for our &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AMD2022?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AMD2022&lt;/a&gt; Product Premiere on January 4th at 7am PT: &lt;a href="https://t.co/ixOLhxjkuM"&gt;https://t.co/ixOLhxjkuM&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/DT0pXHiLXw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DT0pXHiLXw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Lisa Su (@LisaSu) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LisaSu/status/1478003330463019010?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 3, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WoiPk4"&gt;Despite the imminent announcements, it’s less clear how long it’ll be until you’ll easily be able to buy the new CPUs thanks to the ongoing global chip shortage. Intel’s CEO has warned that supply could be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22739192/intel-chip-shortage-q3-2021-earning-laptop-revenue"&gt;tight until 2023&lt;/a&gt;, while TSMC, which manufactures chips for AMD, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385240/tsmc-chip-shortage-2022-intel-ceo-earnings-graphics-cards-cpus-gpus"&gt;previously said&lt;/a&gt; shortages could continue &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/china/tsmcs-q1-profit-rises-19-strong-chip-demand-2021-04-15/"&gt;into this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Are we ready for the smart front door? Masonite thinks so</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5grQzyDFvMqogneN4-Ps59u0Pu4=/0x0:1280x853/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345065/Masonite_MPwer_Shot2b.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The world’s first residential smart door, the Masonite M-Pwr Smart Door, features integrated power and Wi-Fi, a Ring video doorbell, and a Yale smart door lock.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Masonite&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uSvcvg"&gt;Door manufacturer Masonite is showcasing the first residential smart door at CES 2022, highlighting the home building industry’s shift toward embracing connected technology. The concept was announced earlier in 2021, but CES is the first chance most will have to see the door in action.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ys76BC"&gt;A collaboration between Masonite, Ring, and Yale, the M-Pwr Smart Door is the first residential exterior door to integrate power, lights, sensors, a video doorbell, and a smart lock into the door system.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wKfc9k7jfu_R8vUCZ9Pe4vFJOtE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23133273/Masonite_Mpwr_rendering2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Masonite&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Masonite smart door features strategically situated motion-activated lighting alongside a Yale door lock and Ring video doorbell.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dGaf3f"&gt;The door, a premium fiberglass model available in a variety of styles, colors, and finishes, needs to be professionally installed and connects to a home’s electrical system and Wi-Fi network. The integrated power solution does away with a big issue that homeowners deal with when trying to use this type of technology: recharging batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U6um8i"&gt;The tech packed into this wooden frame includes a Ring Video doorbell (the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20686488/ring-stick-up-cam-smart-lighting-door-view-review-test-price-specs-features"&gt;peephole camera&lt;/a&gt;), a &lt;a href="https://shopyalehome.com/collections/wifi-and-bluetooth/products/yale-assure-lock-touchscreen-with-wi-fi-and-bluetooth?variant=39341913079940"&gt;Wi-Fi and Bluetooth Yale Assure smart lock&lt;/a&gt;, a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth powered PIR motion sensor, a door state sensor that uses the sensor array from the doorbell to determine if the door is open or closed, and motion-activated LED lighting embedded in the door’s threshold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuJCom"&gt;The door also has its own smart hub inside to facilitate connections and a built-in backup battery to keep everything running for up to 24 hours in the event of a power outage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MzciLB"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Masonite Smart Door|105408" data-volume-uuid="4edcf34ec" data-volume-id="105408" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-596" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This video from Masonite shows the smart door in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EugPkP"&gt;All the items — aside from the power cables — are upgradable, so you don’t need to replace your entire door when you want to upgrade to whatever whiz-bang feature Ring comes up with next. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZwzDf"&gt;“Components are homeowner replaceable,” confirms Cory Sorice, SVP and chief innovation officer of Masonite International. “The door will last decades, but the tech won’t — so it’s designed to make upgrades over time.” Sorice also said there are plans to partner with more companies for the components, offering more smart home ecosystem options. “In the future, if you want a Google Nest door, you can have it,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lAl5N"&gt;Currently, you do need three apps to use your door — Ring’s for the doorbell, Yale’s for the door lock, and Masonite’s own smartphone app for programming and controlling the motion-activated LED lighting and checking the door state. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXG6Wk"&gt;This is the most disappointing aspect of the door from a user perspective and misses the mark on a fully integrated experience. The included Yale door lock doesn’t even work with Ring, even though Yale makes a Z-Wave lock that does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dr4Uro"&gt;But from a customer choice standpoint, it makes some sense, as you aren’t locked into a smart home ecosystem and can swap out components if you want. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dhZno2"&gt;The idea of adding power to a residential door is surprisingly a relatively new one, although common in the commercial space. Sorice, who’s the former head of innovation at Chamberlain Group, has a lot of experience with powered doors and smart home innovation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNzw4b"&gt;He worked on Chamberlain’s MyQ smart garage door controller, including the integration with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/7/18167425/amazon-key-garage-business-home-deliveries-prime-ces-2019"&gt;Amazon Key&lt;/a&gt;, a program that allows Amazon delivery drivers to access a customer’s garage or home using connected technology for a more secure delivery. “Through that process, I was able to see how much of a challenge it is to have a Wi-Fi-connected, battery-powered device,” Sorice says. When Masonite approached him to work on a connected door, he jumped at the chance to solve the problem of integrating smart tech into the front door. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6ewza6"&gt;Building a smart residential door turned out to be a bigger challenge than anticipated, particularly the power management and connectivity module that’s the basis for the concept. “Designing the cable system and cable management process, assembling all the components, that took a year and a half,” says Sorice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pRePaC"&gt;Currently, Masonite M-Pwr Smart Doors are only available for new home construction, with the first models being deployed by Barringer Homes in the Plaza Midwood neighborhood of Charlotte, North Carolina. Sorice says additional builder partner announcements should be coming this year. For new home builds, pricing will be determined by the builder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1jxf5S"&gt;Tampa-based Masonite is focused on the builder channel first, but with 70 percent of the market in renovations, it is moving quickly towards offering configurations that will work in retrofit solutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLVFDd"&gt;“We should have some options in the renovation market in one to two years,” says Corey. This doesn’t mean you can pop down to your local Home Depot and pick one up, however. This product will be strictly pro-install, and you’ll also need an electrician on hand to wire everything. Pricing is also still unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0rN0aB"&gt;Ultimately, this type of product isn’t designed for the DIY smart home enthusiast. But it’s a pretty bold move toward the fully integrated smart home, built from the ground up to take advantage of sensors and connectivity to create safer, more secure, and ultimately smarter residential buildings. Paired with other innovations we’re seeing at CES that connect home systems together, such as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22622303"&gt;Moen’s smart water network&lt;/a&gt;, this is an exciting direction for residential IoT.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford says it will double production of electric F-150 Lightning to 150,000 trucks per year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SWE9qnivzhRAKSa3ig9rDn1D9Pc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70345002/akrales_20210526_4595_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zYy5xW"&gt;Ford says its planning to double production of its upcoming electric pickup truck, the F-150 Lightning, to 150,000 vehicles per year by 2023. The news comes as the automaker prepares to start making and shipping its new EV in the first half of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mj2v6i"&gt;Production of both the F-150 Lightning and F-150 Lightning Pro for commercial customers has entered its final pre-build stage this week at the company’s Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Dearborn, Michigan. Deliveries of the first trucks are expected to start in the spring. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1TseoZ"&gt;The number of electric F-150s Ford planned on making in its first few years of production has been a bit of a shifting target. At first, the company was only targeting 40,000 vehicles annually, eventually telling suppliers it expected that capacity to rise to 80,000 by early 2023, &lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/retail/ford-caps-f-150-lightning-reservations-near-200000-production-nears"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Now, that number has risen dramatically to 150,000 trucks by mid-2023, a spokesperson said. (As to how many it will make in its first year of production, the spokesperson said more details would be shared later.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fI81ec"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ford has not disclosed how many electric trucks it plans to make in its first year of production&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iymFxj"&gt;Ford also recently announced that it was tripling production for the Mustang Mach-E, with the expectation that it will reach over 200,000 units per year by 2023. Ford’s electric delivery van, the E-Transit, also goes on sale early this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ti1UNl"&gt;Ford also announced that starting January 6th, the first reservation holders will be able to start selecting the options and trim levels for their trucks. The company is using a “wave-by-wave reservation process” to inform customers when they can go online to spec out their Lightnings. Ford recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826469/ford-f150-lightning-ev-deposits-reservations-closed"&gt;stopped taking reservations&lt;/a&gt; after having collected 200,000 refundable $100 deposits for the Lightning since it debuted in May 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3Wjfq"&gt;The F-150 Lightning starts at $39,974 but can more than double in price depending on which version people buy. Some Ford dealers are reportedly taking advantage of strong demand for the Lightning &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/f-150-lightning-orders-havent-even-started-but-the-truc-1848232090"&gt;by marking up the price&lt;/a&gt; by as much as $30,000. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MmsI8T7o0idNhg1SQ5mS_mK_fG0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22638201/akrales_20210526_4595_0115.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yi4Gsk"&gt;That base model is supposed to offer around 230 miles of range and has a more bare-bones interior, including a 12-inch landscape touchscreen display. Higher trims will come with the same 15.5-inch vertical touchscreen from the Mustang Mach-E, and there’s an extended range battery option that can push the range to around 300 miles. Towing capacity ranges between 7,700 and 10,000 pounds, depending on the configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kvNBq"&gt;As long as they start shipping on time, Ford will join Rivian and GMC as the only automakers with an electric pickup truck on the market. (Rivian started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/10/22774403/rivian-ipo-debut-evs-12-billion-amazon-tesla-valuation"&gt;shipping its R1T pickup in October&lt;/a&gt;, while the first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/18/22843805/gm-ev-hummer-pickup-truck-delivery"&gt;Hummer EVs reached customers&lt;/a&gt; at the end of the year.) Tesla’s long-promised Cybertruck &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615539/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed-2022-elon-musk"&gt;has been pushed to next year&lt;/a&gt;, and CEO Elon Musk has said his company won’t start making them in large volumes until 2023.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon, AT&amp;T reverse course and will delay 5G expansions for two weeks as the FAA requested</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iuFRTAf0PHNydVwYcJ9mEWFLDsw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70344446/vzw-042.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WJ8yHk"&gt;In a standoff that’s pitting Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and the FCC versus the FAA and the airline industry over the two carrier’s plans to upgrade their 5G wireless services, the mobile companies now say they’ve reached an agreement with the Department of Transportation. For Verizon, delaying the launch of the “C-band” spectrum means canceling a celebration scheduled for 1PM ET on Tuesday, marking the beginning of its spectrum upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="4PKeGY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tune in to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UltraShow?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#UltraShow&lt;/a&gt; on 1/4 at 1PM ET and see where streaming, gaming, and the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NFL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NFL&lt;/a&gt; are going.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="13Jh1R"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Verizon&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="rMYxwM"&gt;We’ve agreed to a two-week delay which promises the certainty of bringing this nation our game-changing 5G network in January, delivered over America’s best and most reliable network&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="IuoOgm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="S6Cpgi"&gt;At Secretary Buttigieg’s request, we have voluntarily agreed to one additional two-week delay of our deployment of C-Band 5G services. We also remain committed to the six-month protection zone mitigations we outlined in our letter. We know aviation safety and 5G can co-exist and we are confident further collaboration and technical assessment will allay any issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="e5TVMG"&gt;FAA Communications deputy assistant administrator Jeannie Shiffer provided a statement to The Verge saying, “Safety is the core of our mission and this guides all of our decisions. The FAA thanks AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon for agreeing to a voluntary delay and for their proposed mitigations. We look forward to using the additional time and space to reduce flight disruptions associated with this 5G deployment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFugOD"&gt;She also says that the agreement will see the companies use mitigations similar to those already in place in European countries. The deal will see those mitigations put in place around 50 airports for six months, and now the FAA says, “While U.S. standards and operating environments are unique, we believe this could substantially reduce the disruptions to air operations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3F09yQ"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T CEO John Stankey and Verizon CEO Hans Vestberg wrote, “Agreeing to your proposal would not only be an unprecedented and unwarranted circumvention of the due process and checks and balances carefully crafted in the structure of our democracy, but an irresponsible abdication of the operating control required to deploy world-class and globally competitive communications networks that are every bit as essential to our country’s economic vitality, public safety and national interests as the airline industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1amsgq"&gt;The companies said they would not give in to the FAA and DOT’s request to delay their (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22763502/verizon-att-cband-5g-faa-delay-safety-aircraft"&gt;already delayed by 30 days&lt;/a&gt;) C-band spectrum upgrades for an additional two weeks. The executives continued to propose mitigations like the ones used in France, creating a buffer zone around certain airports and lowering power levels nationwide.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bh1Ukl"&gt;According to the FAA, the controversy exists because of “concerns that the 5G signal could interfere with the accuracy of an airplane’s radio altimeter, without other mitigations in place,” according to the FAA. Those altimeters are crucial for automated landings, and the FAA claims that rolling out the changes could disrupt air travel or impact safety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXV9sV"&gt;Earlier this year, an FCC auction &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;sold the two carriers rights to use so-called “C-band” frequencies at a price of nearly $70 billion&lt;/a&gt;. Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T are eager to roll it out so that in addition to offering ultra-fast 5G connectivity in specific areas using high-band millimeter-wave technology and much slower 5G over low-band frequencies, the new spectrum will provide in-between performance over much wider areas. T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746708/att-5g-plus-expansion-tmobile"&gt;currently uses mid-band spectrum that isn’t in the C-band&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mMGE1k"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 3rd, 9:59PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added a statement from FAA, information about the agreement, and confirmation that Verizon has canceled its launch event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Galaxy S21 FE officially joins Samsung’s crowded midrange lineup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BwdK3tp4I1yjbLPPi9iSg7d79c4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70344380/ajohnson_220102_4951_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The less-expensive Fan Edition of the S21 includes a 6.4-inch 120Hz display.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yWTBNU"&gt;After a year of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532816/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-production-reportedly-halted"&gt;will-they-or-won’t-they speculation&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung has, at last, announced the Galaxy S21 FE. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506470/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-review-camera-processor-price"&gt;the 2020 Galaxy S20 FE&lt;/a&gt; (the FE stands for Fan Edition), this device features most of the flagship-level specs of the Galaxy S21, including a Snapdragon 888 chipset and 120Hz display, at a lower price: $699 for the 128GB base model. With the S21’s nearly midrange price tag and a compelling upper-midrange option in the Galaxy A52 5G, it’s yet another addition to an already crowded spot in Samsung’s lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3q4q6Q"&gt;The Galaxy S21 FE offers a 6.4-inch display, slightly larger than the S21’s 6.2-inch panel. Outside of that size difference, the S21 FE has a whole lot in common with the S21. Its screen is a 1080p OLED panel with 120Hz like the S21’s. Even the design language is consistent, with the camera bump blending into the phone’s side rails. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jIOLTVTm2NWjrnGvIuBEYYNbNc8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142239/ajohnson_220102_4951_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The camera bump is matte plastic rather than metal like the S21’s.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OVfhHi"&gt;The FE includes a flagship-worthy 5nm chipset (Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 in the US, Samsung’s own Exynos elsewhere) and a 12-megapixel f/1.8 main camera with optical stabilization, same as the S21. It even does one better on battery capacity, with a 4,500mAh cell compared to the S21’s 4,000mAh (though its slightly bigger screen likely evens out battery performance). Fast 25W wired charging, 15W wireless charging, an IP68 weather-resistance rating, and both flavors of 5G (sub6-GHz and speedy mmWave) are all carried over from the S21. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0oA7eh"&gt;So what does paying more for the S21 get you? More RAM — 8GB in the base configuration versus the S21 FE’s 6GB — and a higher-res telephoto camera. Aside from the previously noted screen and battery size differences, that’s about it. The Galaxy S21 FE will sell for $699 with 6GB of RAM and 128GB of storage or $769 for 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage. It ships with Samsung’s Android 12-based One UI 4.0 installed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="g4AI1u"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy S21 review: nice for the price","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="gmLQPC"&gt;I’ve had the S21 FE in my hands for a few days, and it feels to me like a device that rides the ever-muddled line between a flagship and a midrange phone. The back is composite plastic with a matte finish, which feels midrangey to me, but the screen is big and bright with all the buttery smoothness of its 120Hz refresh rate — flagship territory for sure. Overall performance feels flagship-worthy, too, with the exception of a little lag in the camera’s portrait mode live preview. Oh, and there’s no charger in the box, which is a flagship thing now, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Prj0nwwxLY04hOolUfQvKdyDKFQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142237/ajohnson_220102_4951_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21 FE ships with Android 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZE3LuI"&gt;Samsung introduced the S20 FE last year as a lower-cost, full-featured alternative to the S20. Also priced at $699, there was a bigger gap between it and the $999 base model S20, which made it a heck of a deal. Things are a little different this time around, with the S21 coming down in price to $799. There’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;the Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt;, one of Samsung’s higher-end budget phones for $499. And don’t forget that Samsung lowered the price of admission for its foldables — with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; priced at $999, it’s part of the conversation, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0XIB8PEBtXEXQztEVE6Y4gfJVFM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23142241/ajohnson_220102_4951_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The S21 FE features a gently curved metal rail. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ifze6E"&gt;It’s more than a little confusing, but it’s not a new strategy for Samsung. As &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-G04G95B9fc"&gt;Dieter noted in his overview of the S20 lineup&lt;/a&gt;, Samsung takes this “a phone at every price point” approach because it can. It also happens to be really good at mixing and matching features for different price points, and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-device-2019-four-years-security-updates"&gt;solid support policy&lt;/a&gt; backing most devices makes its budget and midrange phones tough to beat. With the S21 FE, Samsung is taking yet another cut into a market that it’s happily slicing thinner and thinner.&lt;/p&gt;
