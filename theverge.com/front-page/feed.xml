    <title>Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zLjcArAq4sGebo8JT2J9VP6QFsQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976955/vpavic_200930_4216_0258.6.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mf4umG"&gt;Thinking about picking up a new Apple Watch? It’s never a bad idea to wait until there’s a good deal, and thankfully, those happen with some regularity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FtR5HF"&gt;There are currently three models to choose from, all of which support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294434/apple-watchos-7-features-sleep-tracking-face-sharing-fitness-apps-2020"&gt;watchOS 7&lt;/a&gt;. The latest model, and the highest end, is the Apple Watch Series 6 with GPS and Wi-Fi connectivity, which starts at $399. If that’s a little too expensive, you can drop about $120 off the price by buying an Apple Watch SE, which also launched this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Im58vs"&gt;Finally, the three-year-old &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;Series 3&lt;/a&gt; is the most affordable Apple Watch model to date. It has a starting retail price of $199, but it frequently goes on sale. If you’re looking for something to last a few years, though, it’s probably worth looking at one of the other two watches, as it’s not clear how much longer Apple will deliver software updates to the Series 3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X6WKu4"&gt;While deals are a fairly regular occurrence, there will be times where there are no price drops on new models. For those times, we also include some deals on refurbished models.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OlUIlK"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 3&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="c2iEiy"&gt;The regular price for the 38mm Series 3 is $199 ($229 for the 42mm), which is a decent deal. It’s a great entry-level Apple Watch if you are looking for a smartwatch with reliable battery life and don’t want to burn a massive hole in your wallet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ns6w5t"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch Series 3 (non-LTE) review: third time’s the charm","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/21/16680206/apple-watch-series-3-non-lte-smartwatch-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="q5eI6X"&gt;Currently, the 38mm Series 3 is $169 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K37HKT8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/955948/9383?subId1=VergeBestAppleWatchDeals020321&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-38mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F499753351%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is $30 off its usual price of $199. If you are looking for the Series 3 in 42mm, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Watch-GPS-38mm-Space-Aluminium/dp/B07K387Y7K?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/955948/9383?subId1=VergeBestAppleWatchDeals020321&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-3-GPS-42mm-Sport-Band-Aluminum-Case%2F185638711&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, have knocked $30 off its price as well, bringing it down to $199. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3G29qi"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GaARPa"&gt;Starting at $279 for a 40mm version or $309 for the 44mm, the Apple Watch SE is a good midrange wearable and shares some features also found on the flagship Series 6 model, such as a built-in accelerometer and hand-washing detection. But it doesn’t have the always-on display found on the Series 5 and Series 6. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="0eLZZK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch SE review: pay a lot less to give up only a little","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="6p1Qub"&gt;The best deal right now on the Apple Watch SE 40mm with GPS is at Amazon, which has knocked &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5ZRFRG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$10 off its normal price in gold&lt;/a&gt;, bringing the price down to $269. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYyAAC"&gt;The 44mm with GPS is also on sale at several retailers. The lowest you can currently get this model for at Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5V7H7H?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$294 in gold&lt;/a&gt; or $300 in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5QB5QT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-40mm/dp/B08J5XTRZD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt; (coupon applied). Walmart also has this model on sale for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$294 in rose gold&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Watch Series 5&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HHeb9o"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20869098/apple-watch-series-5-always-on-screen-features-price-best-smartwatch"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple Watch Series 5&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="V9q5MF"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 5 was released in 2019 and was discontinued roughly a year after release once the Series 6 was announced. Similar to its successor, the Series 5 includes an always-on display, unlike the Apple Watch SE. It also includes the ability to take EKGs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="i1kiM0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple Watch Series 5 review: the best smartwatch","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20869098/apple-watch-series-5-always-on-screen-features-price-best-smartwatch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="sfuj8N"&gt;It’s a bit tough to find this watch these days because it has been discontinued, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733684510526102382" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; currently has a ton of discounts on this Apple wearable with up to $300 in savings available with any purchase of a Series 5 including six months of Apple Fitness Plus at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="db57c9"&gt;The best deal we found is at $319, where you can get the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733684094435036455" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;40mm Series 5 with a silver aluminum case&lt;/a&gt; with a black-and-white Nike band that supports GPS and cellular networks (if you pay for a monthly plan). You can buy a silver cased Series 5 in the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733683827044548413" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;40mm&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733683773803230050" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;44mm&lt;/a&gt; sizes for $349. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nZ2ORl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10367797"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xtEsXh"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-SE-GPS-44mm-Gold-Aluminum-Case-with-Pink-Sand-Sport-Band-Regular%2F804932402%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496141/apple-watch-series-6-review-blood-oxygen-monitor-watchos-7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Watch Series 6&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; deals&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="oTrUCf"&gt;The flagship Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 40mm and 44mm, with respective starting costs of $399 and $429. The Apple Watch Series 6 features more sensors than previous models, including a sensor that allows the device to detect your body's blood oxygen levels.&lt;/p&gt;

Otherwise, you can pay $385 for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5XF5SR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;navy blue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5QC43Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-40mm-Aluminum/dp/B08J5W4WXX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;white&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJw2UJ"&gt;Walmart has &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-Watch-Series-6-GPS-40mm-Silver-Aluminum-Case-with-White-Sport-Band-Regular%2F361742962%3Fselected%3Dtrue&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAppleWatchDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a white aluminum case with a white band&lt;/a&gt; available for $385. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzhqCk"&gt;If you want a 40mm model that supports GPS and Cellular, Amazon has this configuration down to its lowest price of $430 if you buy in &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-Cellular-40mm/dp/B08J5XBJVP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-Cellular-40mm/dp/B08J5R3K3Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;space gray&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-GPS-Cellular-40mm/dp/B08J5FXJN6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="E4pYhf"&gt;If you are having a hard time finding an Xbox Series X or Series S, you have another chance to buy one. Microsoft’s direct website has restocked both of its next-gen consoles, the &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fconfigure%2F8wj714n3rbtl%3FranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3D0wLgH49VWzI%26ranSiteID%3D0wLgH49VWzI-ByUBad8S0WSF3c3KVROFqg%26epi%3D0wLgH49VWzI-ByUBad8S0WSF3c3KVROFqg%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAID2000142_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__ibtbmob2ickfqgzzkk0sohznyv2xps6eb31gajjy00%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%25280wLgH49VWzI-ByUBad8S0WSF3c3KVROFqg%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_ibtbmob2ickfqgzzkk0sohznyv2xps6eb31gajjy00" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-us%2Fconfigure%2F942J774TP9JN%3FranMID%3D24542%26ranEAID%3D0wLgH49VWzI%26ranSiteID%3D0wLgH49VWzI-v_.u2wHFftuXuqZ6GaMZ2w%26epi%3D0wLgH49VWzI-v_.u2wHFftuXuqZ6GaMZ2w%26irgwc%3D1%26OCID%3DAID2000142_aff_7593_1243925%26tduid%3D%2528ir__ibtbmob2ickfqgzzkk0sohznyv2xps6ebn1gajjy00%2529%25287593%2529%25281243925%2529%25280wLgH49VWzI-v_.u2wHFftuXuqZ6GaMZ2w%2529%2528%2529%26irclickid%3D_ibtbmob2ickfqgzzkk0sohznyv2xps6ebn1gajjy00" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Series S&lt;/a&gt;. Like some other gaming gadgets released late last year, these consoles are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;extremely difficult&lt;/a&gt; to buy, but if you move quickly, you can grab one right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9cSMZS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226823"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="llSpqU"&gt;If you are new to the Xbox console family, &lt;a href="https://www.antonline.com/Microsoft/Electronics/Gaming_Devices/Gaming_Consoles/1416536"&gt;Antonline has a compelling bundle for the Series S&lt;/a&gt;. For $405, you get the Series S console, an extra controller, plus three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aCIQXi"&gt;If you secure either console and wonder what to buy next, you might want to think about what games to add to your library. One of the hottest titles right now available on Xbox is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0886YWLC9/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=4&amp;amp;imprToken=00bbf77e-c13d-0a3f-8c7&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yakuza: Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Of course, if you want to get a ton of bang for your buck, I strongly suggest you buy a subscription to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Membership-Digital/dp/B07HRDSTZ4?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; for console or &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-3-Month-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Microsoft-Digital-Download%2F309259942%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_0bkRzx3mmxyLTxrwUx0Mo389UkET-wxvWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3D0bkRzx3mmxyLTxrwUx0Mo389UkET-wxvWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=VergeXboxSeriesXSRestocks02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Game Pass Ultimate&lt;/a&gt;. But I strongly suggest Xbox Game Pass Ultimate as it includes additional perks, most notably a membership for Xbox Live Gold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BXin5w"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9532770"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w6T2Lp"&gt;I also advise you to buy an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08DF26MXW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;extra controller&lt;/a&gt; if you are playing a game with a local co-op with a friend or family member.  When it comes to additional storage, both consoles have rather limited storage: 512GB on the Series S, 1TB on the X. You can buy an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Storage-Expansion-Solid-State/dp/B08K3S6WJM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;SSD expansion card that only comes in 1TB&lt;/a&gt;, and it is very expensive, costing $220. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3D1Dj1"&gt;If you plan to download some older games that do not take full advantage of the next-gen hardware and don’t want to deplete your limited SSD storage, you can grab &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Game-Drive-Xbox-Special/dp/B072LX7WLP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an external hard drive&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Medium union effort stalls, falling one vote short of majority</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D9TYfn7oUcWkgoSKeuKxUwQ7EfE=/109x0:1513x936/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68892302/MWU_Group_Photo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dDSEaM"&gt;The Medium Workers Union is pausing organizing efforts after it failed to win a simple majority of support in an online vote last Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ti8Vx"&gt;“This election did not have the outcome we hoped for, but we’re not going anywhere,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mediumworkers/status/1366418860019245057/photo/1"&gt;the union said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “The vote was never to decide whether our union exists, but whether management would recognize us as a bargaining unit.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oD0yeU"&gt;The final tally was 75 yes votes, 68 votes for no, and seven abstentions, putting the organizers just one vote short of the previously agreed threshold of 76 yes votes. Notably, organizers believe these same votes would allow them to win recognition in a National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election due to abstention rules, which would give them 52 percent of the total votes cast. However, the union is abiding by its previous agreement with management and counting the tally as a loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5xbJj"&gt;The union can hold another third-party election at any time, although it says it is pausing organizing efforts for the moment. It has also made it clear that it does not plan to move forward with an NLRB election in the immediate future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aC5Cmb"&gt;“Medium’s CEO Ev Williams has said leadership will continue to speak with workers directly to listen to their concerns, regardless of the election’s outcome,” the union said. They noted Williams also promised not to retaliate against organizers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPhlj4"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Medium spokesperson said: “We will respect our employees’ collective decision and the election’s outcome. We will also continue to listen to and speak with employees directly so we can quickly address concerns, continue to adapt, and together, build a successful company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6GBEY"&gt;The Medium Workers Union declined to comment further on the election outcome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXOqY3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cm9uEg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pixel update adds sharing features for Recorder, plus better underwater photos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tTANl0twl7frI2f1439rws6KWTE=/152x0:1787x1090/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68892256/google_recorder.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Pixel owners can now access backups and share their recordings on the web. | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OaYu7b"&gt;Google’s latest feature drop for Pixel phones makes it easier to share audio recordings, adds better integration for an underwater housing accessory, and wraps up a couple of other updates into a neat little package for Pixel owners. The update is available starting today for some owners of Pixel 3 phones and newer, and it will continue to reach others over the next two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XvvQXY"&gt;First up, recordings made via the Recorder app will now be backed up at &lt;a href="http://recorder.google.com"&gt;recorder.google.com&lt;/a&gt; where they can be shared with anyone. The site, discovered last week by &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/02/24/google-recorder-web-app-pixel/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, offers the same transcription and search features included in the app itself. It’s somewhat similar to &lt;a href="https://otter.ai/"&gt;Otter.ai&lt;/a&gt;, a tool for transcribing Zoom meetings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxkmRR"&gt;The update also includes better support for an &lt;a href="https://krakensports.ca/product/universal-smart-phone-housing-2/"&gt;underwater phone housing&lt;/a&gt; sold by Kraken Sports. The housing, which is a $325 universal accessory that lets you use your phone’s camera underwater, will now allow Pixel owners to use their own native camera app rather than Kraken’s app. That should result in higher-quality underwater photos since the native app is able to capture and process more data than third-party camera apps can.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aTbBLO3RO6QNvxN3FXq_7VMvk0U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22331646/IWD_wallpapers.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Images: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cTEfbg"&gt;Other minor updates include a new bedtime screen when the phone is placed on a Pixel Stand, plus three new wallpaper options with illustrations celebrating International Women’s Day on March 8th that actually look kind of cool; they’re illustrated by Spanish duo &lt;a href="https://cachetejack.com/"&gt;Cachetejack&lt;/a&gt;. Finally, Smart Compose — the feature that automatically suggests words and phrases as you type — comes to a bunch of messaging apps, including Android Messages, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Slack.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Future hurricane seasons might start two weeks early  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Satellite imagery of Tropical Storm Arthur on May 18th, 2020." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fCJuzMMmvBqJ4r0gegpjW9-xVDQ=/0x334:2000x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68892249/arthur_true_color.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Satellite imagery of Tropical Storm Arthur on May 18th, 2020. | Image: NOAA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gMltx2"&gt;Next year’s Atlantic hurricane season could begin on May 15th if officials decide this year to move its formal start date up by two weeks. The decision will likely be made this spring, during meetings held by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and World Meteorological Organization (WMO).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHS618"&gt;2022 is the earliest that the start date can be officially changed, a spokesperson for NOAA’s National Hurricane Center told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an email. But come May 15th of this year, the agency will start issuing its Tropical Weather Outlooks, which are &lt;a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/aboutnhcprod.shtml#:~:text=The%20Tropical%20Weather%20Outlook%20is,0600%2C%201200%2C%201800%20UTC."&gt;routine forecasts&lt;/a&gt; that it typically doesn’t start releasing until hurricane season starts on June 1st. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YslNel"&gt;The proposed changes come as climate change makes hurricane season &lt;a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/hurricanes-and-climate-change/"&gt;more unpredictable&lt;/a&gt; and more advanced technology makes it easier to spot tropical storms early in the season. Changing the start date could better reflect these new realities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="fvtFwA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Changing the start date could better reflect these realities&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QDVk4R"&gt;The official hurricane season, which runs from June through November, includes 97 percent of tropical activity, according to the National Hurricane Center. Wind shear,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;a change in wind speed or direction that can tear storms apart, is typically &lt;a href="https://www.noaa.gov/stories/peak-of-hurricane-season-why-now"&gt;robust in May and then begins to weaken&lt;/a&gt; throughout June and July — allowing stronger storms to form. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bI5kzH"&gt;The designated season has been around in a few forms for decades. When the first hurricane warning system in the US was established in 1935, it scheduled a special telegraph line to connect its weather stations between June 15th and November 15th. Those official dates were changed to June 1st and November 30th in 1965. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dkuiqd"&gt;Since then, high-resolution satellite imagery has made it easier for forecasters to see storms that they might not have identified 30 or 40 years ago, Phil Klotzbach, a research scientist in the department of atmospheric science at Colorado State University, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/2/21546117/hurricane-eta-2020-atlantic-season-records"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOEjZI"&gt;Tropical storms arrived ahead of schedule last year, kicking off the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726487/2020-atlantic-hurricane-season-end"&gt;most active Atlantic hurricane season on record&lt;/a&gt;. As a result, the National Hurricane Center issued 36 “special” Tropical Weather Outlooks before June 1st, 2020. The first named storm of the season, Arthur, developed on May 16th. That made 2020 the &lt;a href="https://www.newsweek.com/tropical-storm-arthur-forms-making-it-atlantics-sixth-named-storm-before-hurricane-season-six-1504607"&gt;sixth year in a row&lt;/a&gt; to have a storm named before the official start of the season. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sK76jb"&gt;With the season less than 100 days away, the National Hurricane Center is already issuing reminders to the public to get prepared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vT2VUU"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The official start of the hurricane season is June 1st, just 100 days away.

    <title>iPhone 13 might finally bring a smaller notch and faster screens, Ming-Chi Kuo reports</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The large FaceID notch is still there, but it eventually feels normal." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9AtFkoWMaJOGdfX1xjd7UOEG_Kc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68892094/vpavic_4243_20201018_0144.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6JlYgD"&gt;Apple’s 2021 iPhones might finally have a smaller notch and, for some models, faster refresh rate displays, according to a new note from Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo. He also shared rumored information about other upcoming iPhones, including when we could see a foldable phone from Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P7OHVu"&gt;Let’s start with the iPhone launching this year, which we’ll call it the iPhone 13. Kuo says the iPhone 13 lineup will consist of the same models as the iPhone 12, meaning that despite &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-apple-iphone/apple-iphone-12-mini-sales-slow-as-smaller-smartphones-lose-appeal-report-idUSKBN2A91N0"&gt;reports of poor sales of the iPhone 12 mini&lt;/a&gt;, the smaller phone could still get a refresh this year (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/iphone-13-pro-120hz-kuo/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The two iPhone 13 Pro models will also have 120Hz refresh rate screens thanks to LTPO display technology, according to Kuo, finally bringing the iPhone on par with many Android flagships’ high refresh rate screens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NTmlca"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some iPhones may have a hole-punch display in 2022&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c1BlUG"&gt;The iPhone 13 models will all have a smaller notch, Kuo says, though if you wish that Apple would do away with the notch entirely, you might have something to look forward to in 2022. Kuo reports that at least some of the 2022 iPhone models will move to a hole-punch display, which could be similar to many Android phones like Samsung’s Galaxy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;S21&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;lineup&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Google’s Pixel phones&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-some-2022-iphones-punch-hole-display/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPImQU"&gt;However, in addition to a selfie camera, the iPhone’s notch currently contains components used for Apple’s Face ID biometric authentication system, and Kuo didn’t elaborate on if or how this rumored hole-punch display for iPhones could still pack in everything needed for Face ID. And if you’re dreaming of a iPhone with no visible notch or hole punch, Kuo says that Apple may launch a truly all-screen iPhone in the second half of 2023 at the earliest, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/03/01/kuo-apple-8-inch-foldable-iphone-2023/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PQxNYY"&gt;Kuo also says the iPhone 13 devices will still have a Lightning port, will have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21142381/qualcomm-x60-modem-5g-phones-faster-power-efficient-5nm-carrier"&gt;Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X60 modem&lt;/a&gt; (which is a step up from the &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/10/21/iphone-12-qualcomm-x55-modem/"&gt;X55 modem included in the iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;), and will have larger battery capacities than the iPhone 12. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gOLusR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A new iPhone SE could support 5G&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F8d5qq"&gt;There’s also a new iPhone SE in the works that will support 5G and have an improved processor, according to Kuo (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-iphone-se-2022-5g/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). This new SE is expected to have a similar form factor as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/22/21230308/apple-iphone-se-2-2020-review-features-specs-camera-price"&gt;current $399 model with a 4.7-inch screen&lt;/a&gt; and could launch in the first half of 2022, Kuo says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m8vPLt"&gt;Kuo has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229885/apple-iphone-5g-se-model-delay-size-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that Apple has a larger iPhone SE in the works that uses a Touch ID sensor integrated into the power button, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21525780/apple-ipad-air-2020-review"&gt;which would be similar to the new iPad Air&lt;/a&gt;, but it sounds like the 5G-capable iPhone SE may be something different. Kuo said in the new note that “there is no visibility on the current schedule” for Apple to bring power button Touch ID (or, notably, USB-C) to iPhones, &lt;a href="https://appleinsider.com/articles/21/03/01/iphone-not-migrating-to-usb-c-or-getting-touch-id-on-power-button-any-time-soon"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;AppleInsider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the future of this rumored larger iPhone SE uncertain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XKXKdr"&gt;Apple is also working on a foldable iPhone with a 7.5- to eight-inch display that could launch in 2023, Kuo says. However, the project seems to be in a very early stage, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/03/01/kuo-foldable-iphone-2023/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;’ article about Kuo’s report&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="gwqkgo"&gt;A 2023 launch would be dependent on Apple being able to solve “key technology and mass production issues” this year. He says the product has “not yet officially kicked off,” so it appears to still be in the research stage and previous rumors have indicated Apple could still decide not to proceed with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rn8eA6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; has &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-15/apple-considers-foldable-iphone-minor-changes-planned-for-2021-models"&gt;also reported&lt;/a&gt; on Apple’s early plans for a foldable iPhone, saying in January that the company “hasn’t solidified plans to actually launch” the new device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IsAfAM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

But the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/27/22301558/covid-vaccine-one-dose-johnson-fda-approval"&gt;newly authorized&lt;/a&gt; Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot has some key advantages that &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-02/28-03-01/04-COVID-Oliver.pdf"&gt;experts say&lt;/a&gt; could help make the vaccination campaign more equitable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mgYPNB"&gt;Unlike the first two vaccines, produced by Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech, the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine can be stored in the refrigerator and only takes one shot to protect people from COVID-19. It could be sent to community clinics, which are equipped to reach people in rural areas or who don’t have regular contact with the health system. Because it only takes one dose, it could help vaccinate people who might be difficult to reach twice, like people experiencing homelessness. Officials could also easily bring it to people in jails and prisons. All of those groups are also at high risk of catching and becoming seriously ill with COVID-19. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qeTGHT"&gt;“This vaccine could make it easier to reach some disproportionately affected groups,” said Sarah Oliver, an epidemic intelligence service officer with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at a vaccine advisory committee &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/acip/meetings/downloads/slides-2021-02/28-03-01/04-COVID-Oliver.pdf"&gt;meeting this weekend&lt;/a&gt;. The committee’s COVID-19 vaccine working group felt that the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine will improve vaccine equity in the US. So far,&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Black and Hispanic people in many states have been vaccinated at low rates, and communities hit hardest by the pandemic have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287123/covid-vaccination-death-inequity-race-maps"&gt;slowest to be vaccinated&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmhCuM"&gt;Mass vaccination sites have the facilities and personnel to handle the Moderna and Pfizer / BioNTech vaccines, which have to be stored in freezers and require two doses.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;These massive sites are able to get thousands of doses in arms each day but can be inaccessible to people who don’t have a car or easy form of transportation. The site &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/28/health/covid-vaccine-sites.html"&gt;in East Hartford, Connecticut&lt;/a&gt;, for example, isn’t accessible by city bus. So far, 82 percent of the people getting vaccinated there are white. Only around &lt;a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/hartfordcityconnecticut/PST045219"&gt;30 percent&lt;/a&gt; of people who live in East Hartford and Hartford are white. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HX00ar"&gt;Those sites also aren’t designed to reach or connect with people who may be reluctant to get vaccinated. “They’re not there to counsel you,” said Marcus Plescia, the chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/28/health/covid-vaccine-sites.html"&gt;in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “You go to get the shot, end of story.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmEWT7"&gt;Some states are already planning to use some of their doses of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine to reach groups that are harder to vaccinate. Washington state &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkCNBC/status/1366349330081345541"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; it might use it to vaccinate people working in the fishing industry, who live in shared housing on ships. New York City plans to use it to vaccinate homebound seniors. “We’ll have nurses and other medical professionals go apartment by apartment to those who cannot even leave their apartment and make sure they are safe,” Mayor Bill de Blasio &lt;a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/106-21/transcript-mayor-de-blasio-plan-vaccinate-homebound-seniors"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; during a press conference this month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEoDGp"&gt;Doses of the Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson vaccine will be limited to start. Just under &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2021/02/28/world/covid-19-coronavirus#cdc-johnson-and-johnson-vaccine"&gt;4 million doses&lt;/a&gt; are being sent to states this week, and none will be sent next week. The company says they will have a total of 20 million doses available by the end of March. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Discovery Plus is the perfect background noise streaming service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B5RFL2KkCIXGvR2SidySE99sJ0M=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68891662/house_hunters.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="udlLX8"&gt;The word discovery implies there’s something new to find, but I’ve spent the past few weeks steadily making my way through a show that’s been on the air for more than 20 years, thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/22018581/discovery-streaming-service-launch-date-price-shark-week-hgtv-food-network"&gt;Discovery Plus&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;em&gt;House Hunters&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WqrP5H"&gt;Thanks to &lt;em&gt;House Hunters &lt;/em&gt;(and &lt;em&gt;House Hunters International, &lt;/em&gt;alongside &lt;em&gt;Tiny House Hunters&lt;/em&gt;) my days spent inside, working from home and doing nothing but watching TV, have transitioned almost exclusively to Discovery Plus. It exists as white noise in my apartment: the buzzing of couples arguing over whether to pay the full $560,000 for a house in the nice neighborhood closer to the cute bistro or take a chance on the $480,000 home that needs some work but is way under budget emitting from my TV set. From the time I start working until the second I’m beginning to wind down, &lt;em&gt;House Hunters &lt;/em&gt;plays continuously on its dedicated channel housed within Discovery Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sifGJC"&gt;“Our bet is when the world makes a full rotation, that the content people have chosen when they could choose anything on TV or cable, the content that they love and run home for — &lt;em&gt;90 Day&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fixer Upper&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Property Brothers&lt;/em&gt; — they’re still going to love that,” Discovery CEO David Zaslav &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/28/business/media/cable-tv-streaming-discovery.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in a recent interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gr7Hga"&gt;Discovery Plus, home to shows from networks like HGTV, TLC, Investigation Discovery, and the Food Network, launched at just the right moment, when ambient television was becoming a fixture in people’s homes during the pandemic. Author and journalist Kyle Chayka referred &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Fcultural-comment%2Femily-in-paris-and-the-rise-of-ambient-tv&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F1%2F22307034%2Fdiscovery-plus-ambient-tv-hgtv-food-tlc-house-hunters-90-day-fiance-diners-driveins-dives" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;to ambient TV as something&lt;/a&gt; “you don’t have to pay attention to in order to enjoy but which is still seductive enough to be compelling if you choose to do so momentarily.” For Chayka, that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498727/emily-in-paris-review-darren-star-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Emily in Paris&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. This reasoning is also what makes &lt;em&gt;House Hunters&lt;/em&gt;, as well as 90 percent of the series on Discovery Plus, perfect ambient television. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QLLGLK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Streaming also makes ambient TV possible in a way cable television can’t&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9w47rN"&gt;Streaming also makes ambient TV possible in a way cable television can’t because there’s a total ad-free option. Loud commercials that play every seven minutes cease to exist. Functionally, I have the option to throw on a &lt;em&gt;House Hunters &lt;/em&gt;channel that streams episodes of the show 24/7 and forget about it. Streaming services are designed to make viewing as effortless as possible and keep people’s attention once they’ve started watching TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ce3xKH"&gt;So far, it’s working out better than expected for Discovery Plus. The company has signed up &lt;a href="https://corporate.discovery.com/discovery-newsroom/discovery-inc-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020-results/"&gt;more than 11 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; to the platform since it launched in early January. Discovery’s target audience is people between 25 and 54, a wide bracket but one with the most disposable income as of 2019, &lt;a href="http://statista.com/statistics/980324/us-mean-disposable-household-income-age/"&gt;according to Statista&lt;/a&gt;. The disposable income of a household led by a person between the ages of 25 and 54 ranged between $69,700 and $91,400 in 2019, Statista reported. Add in that cord-cutting continues to happen at an accelerated rate and that millennials are one of the biggest groups to sign up for three or more streaming services, and Discovery Plus’ potential is obvious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlXF5m"&gt;Zaslav chalked up the impressive initial signups as proof that “people really don’t change that much,” when talking to the &lt;em&gt;Times. &lt;/em&gt;That’s probably true, but having an ad-free option that does for adults and college students what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169873/disney-plus-streaming-marvel-star-wars-new-shows-movies-star-hulu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Frozen 2 &lt;/em&gt;on Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21519095/cocomelon-netflix-moonbug-blippi-hulu-streaming-youtube-children-entertainment"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cocomelon &lt;/em&gt;on YouTube and Netflix&lt;/a&gt; repeats do for kids has become essential in my home. To quote a popular TikTok meme, &lt;em&gt;House Hunters &lt;/em&gt;on Discovery Plus leads to “empty head, no thoughts.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Fsbsr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;To quote a popular TikTok meme, ‘&lt;em&gt;House Hunters’ &lt;/em&gt;on Discovery Plus leads to “empty head, no thoughts”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ajR4Lj"&gt;There’s another term for this: waiting room television. Like daytime TV talk shows or new soap opera episodes, shows like &lt;em&gt;90 Day Fiancé, House Hunters, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives &lt;/em&gt;are just interesting enough to catch someone’s fleeting attention, but they’re monotonous enough to not become total distractions. They simply exist to keep people entertained if they want but can float into the background if someone would rather check in on Instagram or read a book instead — or, in my case, work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="731LKZ"&gt;Discovery Plus still has a long way to go. There are basic product features that need to be fixed (finding on-demand videos instead of 24/7 channels is more difficult than it should be), and I haven’t seen any new series or specials that have caught my attention. Discovery also has to ensure that it’s keeping the vast majority of those who do sign up. For now, Discovery filled a need I didn’t know I had while working at home — pure, ongoing, ambient TV that I don’t have to think about for hours the second I hit play. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Workspace picks up new features designed for remote work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Second screen in Google Meet" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/chasco0-Ge9AbcxbJosfcIjlnpU=/397x0:4672x2850/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68891527/Companion_UI_SeriesOne_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second screen in Google Meet.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ctw7Nd"&gt;Google is adding a &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/workspace/the-future-of-work-with-google-workspace"&gt;smattering of new features to Google Workspace today&lt;/a&gt;, including new tools for categorizing your focus time in Google Calendar and Chat, better ways to join Google Meet videoconferences with multiple devices, and a version of its office suite for frontline workers. It’s also taking Google Assistant for Workspace out of beta and making it generally available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nt9Ex4"&gt;The company is trying to &lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/workspace/the-future-of-work-with-google-workspace"&gt;categorize these features&lt;/a&gt; as part of a new push for what it calls “collaboration equity.” For Google, it’s a high-minded way of explaining the tools it’s trying to create so people working from home are not put at a disadvantage compared to people working from an office (when people are allowed back into offices, that is). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eu5j8E"&gt;The idea that comes closest to hitting that mark is Google’s tools for setting your status across its suite of products. In addition to setting up out-of-office and working hours, users will also be able to create a new event type called Focus Time. When you set up a block of Focus Time, Google says it will limit “notifications during these event windows.” You can also set your location, letting co-workers get a better sense of your availability and time zone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PnW9KO"&gt;The key is that Workspace’s various tools like Gmail and Chat will be aware of your current status and location and adjust your notifications to suit. It’s not nearly the ideal universal status indicator, but it’s a step in the right direction — as long as you live mostly in Google Workspace and aren’t mixing in other tools like Slack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RXoPI4"&gt;The new types of statuses on the calendar also allow Google to make a kind of work-focused “time well spent” chart, only this one shows how much time you’re wasting in meetings every week. Google says this “Time Insights” breakdown will only be available to workers, not their bosses.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google Calendar Time Insights" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dDs2Mj1zBZEwQ9TjgIyG86LUZfw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336618/time_insights.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Calendar Time Insights.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PhMpeT"&gt;Google is also introducing “second-screen experiences” for Google Meet. It essentially allows people to log in to a meeting from multiple devices, making it easier to share screens (or get other work done) without the meeting taking up your whole laptop. The idea is that home workers could use a Google Nest Hub Max or their phone to log in to the meeting but still be able to present from their main computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ML6INC"&gt;On phones, Google Meet is picking up a mobile tile view for video calls, picture-in-picture support, and split screen. It’s not clear whether those tools will work across both Android and iOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgasUZ"&gt;Google is also building up its lower-cost &lt;a href="https://workspace.google.com/essentials/"&gt;Google Workspace Essentials offering&lt;/a&gt; with support for Chat, Jamboard, and Calendar — all of which were weird omissions at launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HSjyWu"&gt;Finally, Google says it’s launching “Google Workspace Frontline,” which it calls a “custom solution” for frontline workers. It seems to be a simplified way for administrators to configure a Google Workspace setup for workers in retail or in the field. It will also make it possible to create &lt;a href="https://www.appsheet.com/"&gt;AppSheet apps&lt;/a&gt; (simple, form-based apps) within Google Sheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oq7JYZ"&gt;Put together, the set of feature updates Google is announcing today seem mostly designed to make meetings either less painful (because you can more easily multitask during them) or easier to avoid (because you can set up Focus Time and also discover how much time you’ve given away in the Time Insights sidebar). &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rocket Lab unveils bigger rocket and plans to go public via SPAC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="World’s First Battery-Powered Rocket Engine To Make Space More Accessible" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YUZ5rf2VZSOrLaicOqokZtxlmTw=/0x0:5184x3456/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68891501/476478078.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peter Beck’s Rocket Lab is going public.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Phil Walter / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2ijiBv"&gt;Small launch firm Rocket Lab announced plans on Monday to go public through a merger with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC, marking the latest deal in an industry where SPAC mergers are becoming increasingly common. The firm also unveiled a new rocket called Neutron that its chief executive said will be capable of launching humans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FWu6h2"&gt;The SPAC deal values Long Beach, California-based Rocket Lab at $4.1 billion and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021. Once the merger is done, Vector Acquisition Corporation, the SPAC Rocket Lab is merging with, will change its name to Rocket Lab USA, Inc, and the Nasdaq ticker symbol will be RKLB.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ismgDM"&gt;“This milestone accelerates Rocket Lab’s ability to unlock the full potential of space through our launch and spacecraft platforms and catalyzes our ambition to create a new multi-billion-dollar business vertical in space applications,” Rocket Lab CEO Peter Beck said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O0OzoO"&gt;Rocket Lab will have $750 million in cash when the deal closes, fueling development of the company’s next rocket dubbed Neutron, a fully reusable launch vehicle capable of lifting eight tons to orbit. The rocket is “tailored for mega constellations, deep space missions and human spaceflight,” the company said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZ9Taa"&gt;Rocket Lab’s workhorse Electron rocket has launched 18 missions since its first flight in 2017 from the company’s main launch site in New Zealand. That rocket is in the early stages of transforming into a reusable vehicle. After a launch, its main booster stage will eventually be plucked out of midair by a helicopter instead of crashing into the ocean, like it does now in its test phase. The company plans to test that helicopter maneuver later this year, following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21578725/rocket-lab-electron-launch-recovery-reusability-parachute-dress-rehearsal"&gt;a successful splashdown recovery test&lt;/a&gt; last year. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WcSXGeyCH-0wgbNXT4-L-eodpbw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22336608/electron_recovery.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Rocket Lab&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rocket Lab’s Electron first stage floats under a parachute for a return splashdown test after launching satellites to space.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FpwgRQ"&gt;Plans for Rocket Lab’s next rocket, Neutron, were revealed on Monday. With a debut flight slated for 2024, Neutron will stand just over 130 feet tall and be a “direct alternative to” SpaceX’s bigger Falcon 9 rocket, an &lt;a href="https://www.rocketlabusa.com/assets/Project-Prestige-Investor-Presentation.pdf"&gt;investor presentation&lt;/a&gt; said. It’ll be capable of launching humans and sending astronauts to the International Space Station, a task traditionally handled by governments but that is shifting more to private companies. SpaceX and Boeing are NASA’s current contractors for sending astronauts to the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jxmBI"&gt;In the past, Beck has said Rocket Lab would never reuse a rocket or build one bigger than Electron, and he vowed to “eat his hat” if he ever recants. He didn’t eat a hat when his company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20757441/rocket-lab-electron-reusable-helicopter-recovery-spacex"&gt;announced plans to reuse Electron&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, but now with the release of Neutron, he actually blended a Rocket Lab baseball cap in a blender and ate it on camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x43Hcp"&gt;“There’s a lot of things at Rocket Lab that we said we were gonna do, that we’ve done,” Beck said in a video his company tweeted on Monday. “And a few things at Rocket Lab that we said we’d never do, which we have also done. So I think with this project, it’s about time I finally ate the hat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nK32Pk"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NbLgCY"&gt;Currently, Rocket Lab, founded in 2006, is the industry leader for dedicated missions launching small satellites. Dozens of other small launch firms have been established since, jockeying for a slice of the market. But potential shortfalls in traditional funding and fears that demand for small launchers is overblown — or that there’s just too many launch companies now — have driven a recent wave of consolidations and SPAC mergers in the space industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aiSiI0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;SPACs&lt;/a&gt;, or “blank check” companies, are traded publicly to raise money before merging with a privately held company, presenting a quicker route for a private company to go public besides the more traditional initial public offering process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="slh7a1"&gt;Last month, small launch firm Astra announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22262004/astra-rocket-launch-startup-spac"&gt;plans to go public via SPAC&lt;/a&gt; at a $2.1 billion valuation, citing 50 customer launches lined up and over $150 million of contracted launch revenue so far. Richard Branson’s Virgin Galactic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936896/virgin-galactic-public-offering-nyse-spce-space-tourism"&gt;became the first space tourism company to go public&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 through a merger with Social Capital Hedosophia, a SPAC. In-space transportation firm Momentus Space &lt;a href="https://momentus.space/investors/"&gt;announced plans&lt;/a&gt; last year to go public after merging with Stable Road Acquisition Corp. And just a few months ago, space-based broadband startup AST &amp;amp; Science &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/ast-science-to-go-public-via-special-purpose-acquisition/"&gt;also said&lt;/a&gt; it’s doing a SPAC merger to go public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Gxzt0"&gt;On Monday, the same day as Rocket Lab’s announcement, Spire Global, a space-based satellite data company with over 100 satellites in space, announced its own plans to go public through NavSight Holdings, Inc., another SPAC. &lt;/p&gt;
