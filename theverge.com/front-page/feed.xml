    <title>Facebook rolls back ‘nicer’ News Feed that boosted mainstream publishers</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6x25Yo"&gt;Facebook has reversed a change to its News Feed algorithm that prioritized authoritative news sources, even though some employees asked that the “nicer” News Feed become permanent, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/2020-election-misinformation-distortions"&gt;&lt;em&gt;according to The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UtVBy"&gt;Following a sharp increase in misinformation on the platform in the immediate aftermath of the 2020 US presidential election, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612728/facebook-news-feed-us-election-change-mainstream-news-misinformation"&gt;Facebook changed how it weighed&lt;/a&gt; the quality of news sources based on a “news ecosystem quality” (NEQ) score. Outlets including the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;, NPR, and CNN saw Facebook traffic rise, while more partisan sites that published incendiary or misleading news about the election saw Facebook traffic decrease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TJptF1"&gt;CEO Mark Zuckerberg had authorized the change to the News Feed in the days after the election when it became clear that unverified stories about election fraud and incorrect results were running rampant on Facebook. At a recent company meeting, some Facebook workers asked if the “nicer News Feed” could become permanent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5JB6v"&gt;But the change was always meant to be temporary. “This was a temporary change we made to help limit the spread of inaccurate claims about the election,” Facebook spokesperson Joe Osborne said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “News stories make up a small portion of what people see on Facebook overall, and political news makes up a smaller fraction of that news content. We’re still ensuring that people see authoritative and informative news on Facebook, especially during major news cycles and around important global topics like elections, COVID-19, and climate change.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mu60dk"&gt;Facebook took other steps to try to limit election misinformation, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21548736/twitter-facebook-throttle-trump-tweet-election-theft"&gt;with mixed results&lt;/a&gt;. The platform announced in October it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21506798/facebook-ban-political-ads-after-us-presidential-election-trump-biden-results-notification"&gt;ban US political ads&lt;/a&gt; after the election, and it planned to label posts about the election and redirect users to authoritative information. It also restricted paid promotions of election-related posts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MkKhZ8"&gt;The company says since the election, it’s seen a decline in the amount of political content on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wa8oBp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Checking in on everyone who went remote this year&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p-large-text" id="YtzU3H"&gt;2020 has been a &lt;em&gt;year&lt;/em&gt;, not least because much of the world pivoted to remote work. Industries that typically rely on in-person connections, like fitness and religious institutions, found themselves having to engage their audiences through live streams. Ad revenue disappeared from influencers and YouTubers, who are used to working remotely so long as they make money. Fashion influencers whose livelihoods depend on peddling an image of beauty and aspirational clothing were without events to attend or reasons to get dressed. Everyone needed to adapt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brc2fz"&gt;In this piece, we look back on a few people we previously interviewed this year to hear how their remote transition has gone — do they anticipate staying remote? What have they learned from this challenging year? And will we collectively agree to forget 2020 ever happened and try to resume normalcy in 2021?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhB6In"&gt;Check out what they said below, and click through on the posts to read the original pieces mentioning them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="0IyvrQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21193904/instagram-therapy-live-sessions-covid-19-coronavirus-posts-influencers"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What she was up to when we last chatted at the end of March&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="fR2b50"&gt;In March, Mancao began pivoting her therapy Instagram account to address COVID-related stress and anxiety. She had just posted her first couple test posts covering the pandemic, including one called “COVID-19 Compassionate Reminders,” which suggested checking in on friends and family who are immunocompromised and donating to small businesses that might be struggling. She saw her Instagram as a way to reach people who might be interested in therapy but might not be able to financially afford it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="R1j4uM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How she’s doing now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wopFkg"&gt;Nine months later, Mancao says she’s actually moved her content away from pandemic-related topics because ample information is already available, and “COVID content overload can really exhaust and burn people out.” She’ll post about the pandemic if necessary, though, like when she recently posted about setting boundaries with friends and family who might want to hang in-person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wrdu4U"&gt;Although Macao’s business has managed to stay afloat with new clients, she says other therapists she knows have struggled. Clients lost their insurance and income and can no longer afford services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ffXazA"&gt;Many of her clients talk about burnout and the struggle with working, living, and having time off all in the same place: their home. She herself has focused on practicing what she advises, like not working from her bed and finding a routine that works for her. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gANF9i"&gt;“This year really taught us to find that balance between staying connected and having boundaries,” she says. Instagram is still a powerful, and free, place for her to spread information, but she’s found that throughout 2020, a post caption doesn’t capture the nuance of every situation and circumstance.&lt;/p&gt;

Dana encourages us to think of and pray for the people in our lives as we string lights and hang ornaments in the coming days.

Thank you for joining us for this service of Morning Prayer and Reflection. Your support is appreciated!

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="AQbEIK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21209540/passover-easter-seder-zoom-holiday-celebration-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the cathedral was doing in April, right before Easter Sunday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="dpVQU4"&gt;Eckstrom and the team at the Washington National Cathedral in Washington, DC, were preparing for virtual Easter services when we last chatted. The team had already been streaming live services on Sundays, but Easter was a major test of their remote work. It’s an essential day for the cathedral, which is typically packed with 3,000 people in the building. The remote operation involved only 10 people in the building at once with the clergy tailoring the service to the pandemic. They took “spiritual” communions in which they consecrated the bread and wine without actually consuming it. They said a special prayer, too, which expressed that they wanted to take communion but couldn’t at that time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="V8lc8C"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the church has been doing since&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PbNTas"&gt;The team is now preparing for Christmas services, and in the months since the pandemic started, the cathedral’s services have reached 1.8 million people and average between 6,000 and 7,500 people streaming Sunday morning services. The cathedral team has focused its live stream efforts on how best to make services resonate remotely, rather than making them an “afterthought.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1eNei"&gt;“We will be doing essentially two separate versions of the same thing for the foreseeable future, and that’s a kind of a radical shift for us to put as much energy and attention into an online experience as we are into the in-person experience,” Eckstrom says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWSTGR"&gt;Although some global viewers might eventually return to their home church when cities, states, and countries eventually open up, Eckstrom says some attendees say the virtual ceremonies have become a routine they want to continue. The cathedral considers the online world a second location at this point and will continue to stream after the pandemic wanes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83KsCo"&gt;At the same time, however, monetizing the streams hasn’t been easy, especially with no in-person visits. The cathedral anticipates a loss of $5 million this year, mainly because of the lack of tourists buying things in the gift shop and café, and from the loss in event rentals. The team now solicits online donations, and although people have given money, it hasn’t made up for the lack of in-person visitors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tFUp1n"&gt;“People want to make a visceral physical connection,” he says. “And that’s really hard to replicate online. We can use some of [the in-person cathedral experience], but not all of it, so we’re really anxious to be able to reopen the door, so that people can have that experience that we’ve been working on developing for about 113 years.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="SBr7tJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21228400/vanlife-influencers-instagram-youtube-coronavirus-pandemic-impact-space-food-income"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where in the world they were at the end of April&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="PBYuCz"&gt;Theo Gove-Humphries and Bee Roper had planned, before the pandemic, to fly themselves and their van from the UK to Canada and make their way throughout North America. But as soon as their visas were approved, Canada banned most inbound flights. The UK then shut its borders, too. The couple decided to move into the home of a friend, who themselves was stuck abroad, and focused on writing an ebook about their Scandinavian travels. YouTube sponsorship opportunities slowed down and their ad revenue decreased, so they need to find a way to diversify their income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="9MVHW4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Where they are now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Tl2GVo"&gt;Gove-Humphries and Roper say their YouTube revenue is back, and they’re “thriving” on the platform now that everyone is stuck at home and streaming videos. They left the UK as soon as they could and traveled to Portugal where they own property and a barn, which they’ve focused on fixing up. This is the first time they’ve lived in a house in six years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ueQzug"&gt;“Owning the land where we are right now in Portugal was one of our best decisions because living in a van full-time, it’s all fine and well, but I always had that feeling that we never really belonged somewhere, like there was nowhere to fall back on,” says Gove-Humphries. “So having our own land where we can go, where we know that we’re not going to be moved on, or we know that we’re legally allowed to be here, is quite good. Even if you’re not here, it’s good for your mental health to know that you have got somewhere to fall back on, and this worked out brilliantly.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c8Tacj"&gt;Roper says multiple people they know, fellow vanlifers, looked into buying their own homes since the pandemic for this same reason. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWmgdI"&gt;“It is quite scary when the whole world locks down, and you’ve got no way you’re allowed to be,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCCHVw"&gt;Still, they look forward to traveling again. Their original North America trip is still on the table, but they’re thinking it’ll happen in 2022 rather than next year, realistically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="f93KZY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Katie Baki, yoga teacher&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="zXbe0j"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195288/zoom-yoga-online-classes-coronavirus"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How Katie Baki was teaching at the end of March&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="UKRPbM"&gt;Katie Baki almost immediately started hosting donation-based yoga classes on Zoom when the studios she worked at shut down in March. She appreciated being able to see students’ practice when their cameras were on and being able to record classes for later. She managed to set the mood by emailing her students Spotify playlists so they could recreate the yoga class ambiance in their own homes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="u7aqyb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How classes have been going since then&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Qbb31X"&gt;Baki now teaches four classes remotely a week for her own clients and two classes for a virtual studio. Her clients have stuck with her throughout the pandemic, which she greatly appreciates, but she says finding new students is “seemingly impossible” without the reach of in-person classes. Plus, she now competes directly with bigger studios that can afford to charge less than her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="az6K03"&gt;“I don’t know if it’s sustainable, to be completely honest,” she says. “I’m sure that there are ways, but the teachers that I’ve spoken with, every yoga teacher is struggling. A lot of them only teach once a week, and a lot of students expect them to be free classes, and our industry got hit really, really hard, and it’s been challenging.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SiGThQ"&gt;Zoom classes have more or less acted like a Band-Aid on a large wound for Baki, and she’s ready to get back to in-person classes. She might continue teaching a couple remotely for viewers outside of her area, but otherwise, in-person classes are where she feels both she and the students get the most benefit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ysEUd4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Elizabeth Savetsky, fashion influencer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MUzSxH"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21184344/coronavirus-covid-19-fashion-influencers-street-photography-instagram"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How she was making fashion content at the end of March&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="u8Fdim"&gt;Elizabeth Savetsky’s fashion Instagram feed pivoted quickly when the pandemic took hold in the US. Instead of her usual glitzy looks and fun event photos, she posted herself with minimal makeup and her natural, wavy hair. She sang to her followers, who never knew she had a nice singing voice. She couldn’t rely on the same style or type of content she had been making previously, and couldn’t hire a photographer to help her take photos. At the same time, she had to strike the right tone and figure out what her followers wanted — they loved her luxurious, cool looks before, but would they still want that when they were all at home wearing sweatpants?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TaRjjd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How she’s adjusted to the pandemic’s fashion trends&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Yiq340"&gt;After months of being stuck at home, Savetsky says her followers seemingly want lighthearted, aspirational content again. She participated in her first professional photoshoots in around six months recently and says her followers crave a fantasy world where they could be dressing up and celebrating the holidays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kU1fEA"&gt;“People aren’t traveling,” she says. “People aren’t getting to do their normal holiday season glamorous gatherings and parties and all of that, and so to be able to give them a little bit of that on Instagram is, that’s kind of [my] angle.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lOH4JD"&gt;That’s only the Instagram grid, however. Savetsky says throughout the pandemic she’s given her followers a peek into her real life, and they likely will want that to continue. The brands want that, too. Savetsky says the brand deals are coming back to her account but now involve more focus on her struggles and day-to-day life. Her followers are buying from her posts, too, she says, which she thinks reflects the lack of spending in other areas of their lives, like travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="ji5Him"&gt;“I feel like my audience really responds to this real factor. It’s nice to have the fantasy, but it’s not relatable, and people want to see your everyday life, especially when the world is hurting,” she says. “I think it’s kind of shown me that it’s not about the setting, or about the product, but it’s about me, and people wanting a window into my life.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s Fitbit acquisition wins EU approval</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7SxDgsnWXxb9swTM4lSm-jT9mPc=/0x1:4000x2668/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68528743/20200919FitbitSense5.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Fitbit Sense from Fitbit’s lineup of health tracking wearables.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Brent Rose for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KE6CG7"&gt;Google’s acquisition of Fitbit is nearing completion now that the European Commission has &lt;a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/IP_20_2484"&gt;approved&lt;/a&gt; the search giant’s $2.1 billion takeover of the wearable tech company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxRykz"&gt;When Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20943318/google-fitbit-acquisition-fitness-tracker-announcement"&gt;announced the acquisition in November 2019&lt;/a&gt;, Google hardware chief Rick Osterloh said that the Fitbit purchase was “an opportunity to invest even more in Wear OS as well as introduce Made by Google wearable devices into the market.” But regulators quickly got involved, and in August, they formally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/4/21353947/google-fitbit-acquisition-eu-investigation-antitrust-health-tracking-data"&gt;began investigating&lt;/a&gt; Google’s purchase of Fitbit over data privacy and antitrust concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ggwqPE"&gt;In approving the deal, Google has now agreed to a number of concessions to ease EU concerns. Among the concessions, Google has agreed not to use Fitbit data, including GPS and health data, gathered from any user in the European Economic Area (EEA) for targeted advertising. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="a6zr5Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Fitbit deal clears one of its last major hurdles&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U8n2vK"&gt;Additionally, the company is ordered to maintain a technical separation between its business and that of Fitbit’s and to give EEA users the option to approve or deny the use of Fitness health data to inform other Google services like its search engine and Google Maps product. The approval of the deal also stipulates that Google maintain commitments related to Fitbit’s Web API and its own Android API that foster competition. These commitments will be in place for 10 years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xd3w6J"&gt;“We can approve the proposed acquisition of Fitbit by Google because the commitments will ensure that the market for wearables and the nascent digital health space will remain open and competitive,” said Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission executive vice president, in a statement. “The commitments will determine how Google can use the data collected for ad purposes, how interoperability between competing wearables and Android will be safeguarded and how users can continue to share health and fitness data, if they choose to.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VHmCNN"&gt;Australian regulators have also been looking into the acquisition. Late last month, &lt;a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/consultation-begins-on-proposed-google-fitbit-undertaking?utm_source=linkedin_accc&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=google_fitbit_consultation"&gt;Australia’s Competition &amp;amp; Consumer Commission (ACCC) published three Google concessions&lt;/a&gt; meant to allay competition and privacy concerns related to data collected by Fitbit and Google wearables for the purposes of advertising as well as long-term interoperability with Android phones and third-party apps and wearables. The ACCC is currently seeking feedback on the proposals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ovPer1"&gt;In November, Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer of Google parent company Alphabet, said &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-10-29/google-cfo-expects-fitbit-acquisition-to-clear-by-end-of-year"&gt;she expects the bid for Fitbit to be completed by the end of 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fEAjVd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Make the most of wearing a mask</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OFH5h34_7Y1VKYO92ThH0_apgFw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68528727/akrales_201215_4325_0188.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rexi Co’s mask with fringes.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HUWWZD"&gt;After COVID-19 started dominating the headlines, one of the changes that we started making in our lives (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21303553/face-mask-coronavirus-cdc-etiquette-public"&gt;well, most of us, anyway&lt;/a&gt;) was to wear a mask. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xf1QdV"&gt;As you probably remember, initially masks were difficult — sometimes impossible — to find. Disposable masks were reserved for medical and emergency personnel (and in some places, shortages were so problematic that people were sewing masks to send to hospital workers). The rest of us &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/8/21209653/coronavirus-cdc-face-masks-covering-verge-staff-scarves"&gt;improvised the best we could&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9s7hpk"&gt;However, human ingenuity (and capitalism) will out. Now there are lots and lots of companies out there vying for your masking dollars. There are craftspeople selling their designs on individual sites, artists putting out weird and wonderful constructions, and larger companies providing funny, snide, or positively frightening masks. And why not? As long as you’re committed to wearing a piece of cloth across your face when you’re in a public space, why not use it to enhance your outfit, shout out a message, or just have fun? Be bold! Make a fashion statement!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d6mmDK"&gt;Here are a few of the weird, wonderful, or just plain nice masks that I’ve come across. They’ve been recommended by colleagues from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, pointed out by friends, or just jumped out at me from news items. You probably can find a lot more out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="MJw8vL"&gt;Practical and pretty&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0VrY14"&gt;If you’re just looking for a useful but attractive mask for daily use, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fbaggu.com%2Fcollections%2Freusable-masks&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22174639%2Fmasks-fashion-etsy-baggu-vida-covid-19#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Baggu&lt;/a&gt; offers its masks in sets of threes, in either plain colors or bright patterns. You can order one of two types of fasteners: adjustable ear loops or ties that loop behind the head and then knot at the base of the neck (which can be more comfortable if ear loops interfere with your glasses or hearing aids). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1flwC"&gt;Planning to dress up for the holidays — for, say, an intimate outdoor dinner with your favorite person? Well, nothing says sophistication like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshopvida.com%2Fproducts%2Fholiday-face-mask&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22174639%2Fmasks-fashion-etsy-baggu-vida-covid-19#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Vida’s holiday masks&lt;/a&gt;, which have artistically patterned gold or silver foil laid against a black background. If Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers were making movies today, these are the masks they’d be dancing in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="R2G0kY"&gt;Activists can put their values front and center with Suay’s &lt;a href="https://suayla.com/products/face-the-future-face-mask"&gt;Face the Future&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href="https://suayla.com/collections/masks/products/ssxbxr"&gt;Fear the Kids&lt;/a&gt; masks. According to the company website, when you buy one of these great-looking masks, you’re also donating a mask to Indigenous youth and contributing to Seeding Sovereignty, an Indigenous-led collective. Suay also offers a variety of other masks and accepts contributions to purchase farm boxes for garment worker families.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GZzuzX"&gt;Masks protect you, but they also hide half your face. This can be a real problem for people, such as deaf individuals who rely on lip-reading and / or facial expressions, seniors who have less hearing than they used to, or babies who learn by watching their parents’ faces. While there are some masks out there that have plastic cut-outs for your mouth, &lt;a href="https://www.theclearmask.com/"&gt;a company called ClearMask&lt;/a&gt; sells disposable masks in packs of 24 that offer full-face visibility. They are available both in non-medical and medical (FDA-cleared) versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6fCK9v"&gt;Just for fun&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LhWv1L"&gt;If you feel your friends aren’t freaked out enough as it is, you can really make ’em jump with Aggressive Fashion’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F795212859%2Fface-mask-alien-dust-mask-facehugger&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22174639%2Fmasks-fashion-etsy-baggu-vida-covid-19#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;facehugger neck gaiter&lt;/a&gt; that can be pulled up and used as a mask — and lets you look like John Hurt on a &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; bad day.  On the other hand, if cute is more your style, what can be cuter than a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F797196990%2Fbaby-yoda-sublimated-mask&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22174639%2Fmasks-fashion-etsy-baggu-vida-covid-19#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Baby Yoda mask&lt;/a&gt;? (Yeah, I know, he’s got a name now, but he’ll always be Baby Yoda to me.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="97Wgqq"&gt;One &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffer, who says she’s had it with people who can’t be bothered to wear their masks properly, has ordered a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F908022009%2Fchristmas-holiday-themed-fabric-face%3Fref%3Dyr_purchases&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22174639%2Fmasks-fashion-etsy-baggu-vida-covid-19#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Christmas-themed item&lt;/a&gt; that says, in no uncertain terms, “The mask goes over your nose.” I’d strongly suggest that if you see this coming your way, either adjust your mask or cross the street.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ElNuw"&gt;Do you like the music of &lt;a href="https://www.orvillepeck.com/"&gt;Orville Peck&lt;/a&gt; — or just have a hankering for fringes? Why not treat yourself to Rexi Co’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Flisting%2F801688772%2F6-fringe-black-face-mask-reusable-with&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22174639%2Fmasks-fashion-etsy-baggu-vida-covid-19#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;mask with fringes&lt;/a&gt; that will sway as you sing (although your voice will be a little more muffled than Peck’s). There are actually &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.etsy.com%2Fmarket%2Forville_peck_mask&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22174639%2Fmasks-fashion-etsy-baggu-vida-covid-19#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a variety of fringed masks out there&lt;/a&gt;, so shop carefully — some of the ones being offered don’t have a full mask behind the fringes, so won’t do you a lot of practical good.&lt;/p&gt;

You can use an Android / iOS app to create your own message or to draw an animation that bounces along the front of your mask. (You remove the electronics to wash the mask.) And just think: once the pandemic is over, this will still look great in a dark bar or club.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="17ckOw"&gt;If you’re a true comic book nerd, or just admire upcycle art, you may want to consider something from the collection of artist Gabriel Dishaw. His &lt;a href="https://www.gabrieldishaw.com/"&gt;series of masks&lt;/a&gt; created with, among other things, the remains of Louis Vuitton luggage, are extraordinarily creative (and have been purchased by, among others, &lt;a href="https://fb.watch/27rs-Q5dzJ/"&gt;singer / songwriter T-Pain&lt;/a&gt;). You need to be aware, though, of two things: first, these one-of-a-kind masks are going fast, and second, they tend to cost somewhere in the $2,000 range.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JlBjCn"&gt;For something truly science-fictiony, there is the &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/philippegorov/blanc-mask-face-the-outdoors-with-your-modern-day-armor"&gt;Blanc full-face mask&lt;/a&gt; currently in Kickstarter (but already well past its pledge mark and due to ship in mid-March). This robotic-looking mask covers your entire face, with a strip of clear material to see through (something like &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0076984/mediaviewer/rm3646952448/"&gt;the original Cylons&lt;/a&gt;), and filters air using two HEPA filters. Once it ships, the panels of the mask can be swapped to provide a variety of individualized designs; according to the manufacturers, it not only offers protection, but “allows you to regain control of your visual identity, emotions, and expression.” Not to mention scare the heck out of any small children in the area.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix adds an audio-only mode to its Android app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/79OlQfCE8QmQrj26h9CuU3wcAAU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68528650/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hxYlIh"&gt;Netflix is giving viewers the chance to ignore the visuals of shows and movies entirely and go full audio. In an update first spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/netflix-prepares-audio-only-mode-background-listening/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA-Developers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/16/netflix-is-rolling-out-an-audio-only-mode/?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Netflix has started rolling out an audio-only mode for its Android app users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xe6im7"&gt;When watching a video, subscribers will see a “video off” button at the top of the full-screen video player. Once the video is turned off, a blank screen will appear along with all of the playback controls, like a scrub bar, forward and backward buttons, and speed adjustments. You can see that screen below, thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/16/netflix-is-rolling-out-an-audio-only-mode/?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Police&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.androidpolice.com/2020/12/16/netflix-is-rolling-out-an-audio-only-mode/?scrolla=5eb6d68b7fedc32c19ef33b4" target="_blank"&gt;Android Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HbpR3e"&gt;There’s also an audio-off option in the app’s settings, which lets viewers decide whether they always want the audio off or only when they’re using headphones or external speakers. It’s unclear when all Android users might receive this update; two &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffers weren’t able to access the audio-only mode just yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HaGMkf"&gt;This is an intriguing update, though, if only because audio is having a moment. There is, of course, all the buzz around the podcasting industry and Spotify’s efforts to overtake it, but also Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/7/17832320/twitter-periscope-ios-audio-only-broadcasts-podcasting-feature"&gt;launching&lt;/a&gt; audio tweets and apps like Clubhouse and TikTok focusing on audio as critical to their success. I wouldn’t have expected Netflix to include an audio-only mode, but if it wants people to spend more time on the app, that means supporting them in situations when they can’t fully give their attention to a screen. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Canoo reveals a new electric delivery vehicle ahead of stock exchange debut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i42TD1uioD1qsZz_GtbcLBNam2g=/318x0:2040x1148/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68528429/Canoo_MPDV_Exterior__14_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Canoo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xkrzpp"&gt;California EV startup Canoo has announced a new multipurpose electric vehicle aimed at last-mile deliveries and other small businesses, which starts at $33,000 but scales up in size and cost. Due in 2022, the vehicle is the centerpiece of what new executive chairman Tony Aquila told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;amounts to a “re-founding of the company” ahead of its debut on the NASDAQ stock exchange at the end of next week, thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21374272/canoo-ev-startup-spac-ipo-reverse-merger"&gt;a reverse merger with a so-called blank check company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTJT4A"&gt;It’s Canoo’s second vehicle, following the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20882538/canoo-evelozcity-ev-subsicrption-electric-vehicle"&gt;subscription-only van it debuted last year&lt;/a&gt;. Canoo still plans to make that EV — in fact, the new multipurpose vehicle is built on the same technological platform that Canoo developed for the van, and they share similar design features — but Aquila told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the company’s immediate focus has changed. “When I invested in [Canoo], I didn’t invest in it for the lifestyle vehicle. To me, I saw that as a derivative, but that the real asset was this multipurpose delivery platform,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zysYWi"&gt;“The way I would look at it is this is a re-founding of the company, just kind of like Elon did to Tesla,” Aquila said, referring to how &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-the-origin-story-2014-10"&gt;Elon Musk got involved with the now-famous electric vehicle company shortly after its founding and changed its trajectory&lt;/a&gt;. Aquila, who comes from a finance and software background, invested $35 million in Canoo this summer through his firm before the merger and before he was elevated to chairman. “He put money in [Tesla], just like I did, became the chair, had a different vision, comes out of the tech world. So I can completely relate and appreciate what he’s done for the industry.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JZ1Ksp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Two models — small and big — with different battery pack options&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EdXnW4"&gt;The new vehicle will initially be sold in two variants, though Canoo says more will eventually be offered. The smaller one (which is the one that starts at $33,000) is 14.4 feet long, 6.4 feet wide, and 6.2 feet tall, and has 230 cubic feet of cargo space. Canoo will offer three different battery pack options, too: 40kWh (with an estimated 130 miles of range), 60kWh (190 miles), and 80kWh (230 miles). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DmBLZv"&gt;The company will also make a larger version that is 17.1 feet long, 7.2 feet wide, and 8.4 feet tall, with 500 cubic feet of cargo space, which Aquila said is “unheard of for this industry.” The same battery pack options will be available, though the range estimates drop to 90 miles, 140 miles, and 190 miles, respectively, thanks to the extra weight. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="leNehU"&gt;The vehicle can be further customized from there, according to Canoo, which suggests options like storage lockers, a roll-up door, or ramps in its press release. Aquila said this kind of customization presents a “real gold opportunity ... to go after and bring EVs to the middle of America” by targeting small business owners who will want to switch to electric vehicles. He also claims it will help “return capital” to these vehicle owners (thanks to things like the low to no maintenance of EVs), to the tune of as much as $50,000 to $80,000 over seven years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5zUPr"&gt;Canoo didn’t share details on pricing above the $33,000 base model. Limited deliveries will start in 2022 with wider production in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="eoaubB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10232356"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CH6fvb"&gt;Debuting a second vehicle, spinning up a new business model, and evolving into a publicly traded company are major milestones for Canoo, which is only three years old. That said, the public listing comes as no surprise, as multiple EV startups (as well as other companies, including suppliers in the broader electric vehicle space) have been either prepping public listings or have already gone public during what’s become a bona fide gold rush — one fueled by Tesla’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21286562/tesla-stock-most-valuable-automaker-slot-as-more-workers-contract-covid-19"&gt;soaring valuation&lt;/a&gt; as well as the sudden popularity of startups merging with these “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition companies&lt;/a&gt;,” or SPACs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="fWj3U0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Canoo has come a long way in just three years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="91H6Ji"&gt;Few startups have been able to follow Tesla into the electric vehicle space over the last decade. Most that have came from China and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21274457/nio-q1-earnings-deliveries-chinese-government-investment-bailout"&gt;still have limited track records to boot&lt;/a&gt;. But this new wave of attention and funding could unlock the kind of money required for companies like Canoo to try their hand at the cash-hungry affair of vehicle design and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PRgvdu"&gt;Canoo was founded in late 2017 by a few former BMW executives who had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/13/17111026/evelozcity-stefan-krause-interview-electric-cars"&gt;tried to pull buzzy but troubled EV startup Faraday Future&lt;/a&gt; out of a financial nosedive. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2017/12/12/16651026/faraday-future-investigation-money-debt-finances-yueting"&gt;Thwarted&lt;/a&gt; by Faraday Future’s founder, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/10/30/20879811/faraday-future-ceo-founder-jia-yueting-carsten-breitfeld-bankruptcy"&gt;stubborn Chinese tycoon Jia Yueting&lt;/a&gt;, those executives split off and created Evelozcity, which they &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/25/18279906/new-ev-startup-canoo-will-only-sell-cars-on-a-subscription-basis"&gt;eventually rebranded to Canoo&lt;/a&gt;. Boosted by money from a touchscreen magnate in Taiwan, a financier with CCP ties in China, and a businessman in the UK close to Prince Andrew, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20899436/discrimination-lawsuit-canoo-foreign-backers-ev-startup-british-chinese-government"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;first reported&lt;/a&gt;, Canoo assembled a team of around 300 people in Los Angeles to develop the electric van and its underlying technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Z1MdKY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Canoo’s first subscription-only EV is a refreshing rethink of the VW Microbus","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/24/20882538/canoo-evelozcity-ev-subsicrption-electric-vehicle"},{"title":"SPACs, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zxtjxi"&gt;In August, Canoo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/18/21374272/canoo-ev-startup-spac-ipo-reverse-merger"&gt;announced the merger with the blank check company&lt;/a&gt;, Hennessy Capital Acquisition Corp IV. The deal is expected to close next week, with Canoo becoming a publicly traded company on the NASDAQ under the ticker “GOEV.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zr8CQL"&gt;Canoo’s founders always intended to use the van’s modular platform to power other vehicles, but Aquila is supercharging that vision by accelerating those plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kqo1b0"&gt;With that in mind, there are changes being made to Canoo’s corporate structure. Ulrich Kranz, one of the BMW executives who co-founded Canoo and the current CEO, is no longer on the company’s board of directors. He’ll instead be a “special adviser” to Aquila, and while he’ll remain CEO, his contract was renegotiated and now includes language that accounts for the possibility of him being replaced, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1750153/000121390020041124/f424b31220_hennessycapacq4.htm"&gt;according to filings&lt;/a&gt; with the Securities and Exchange Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pTm9WA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s like a baseball team. Everybody’s got to play their position.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PhfOzT"&gt;“I want to build a world class company here, and what I’ve said to everyone is, look, you’re going to go as far in this company and as big as this company as we all collectively do. But it’s like a baseball team. Everybody’s got to play their position and they’ve got to play it really well for every season, and those positions can change over time,” Aquila told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;when asked about Kranz’s new contract. “There’s definitely a role [for Kranz]. There’s definitely advice that can happen. But to scale an organization at this level, I mean, that’s a different experience than he has.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z723Qh"&gt;(For what it’s worth, if Kranz is removed as CEO but remains as Aquila’s adviser, his salary will more than triple from $648,000 to $2.5 million, per the agreement filed with the SEC.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E4cPaQ"&gt;Aquila also told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that one of Canoo’s founding investors, Pak Tam Li, will not be on the board despite owning between 32 and 36 percent of the company after the merger is complete, per SEC filings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lO4kHS"&gt;Li, who also goes by Li Botan, heads up a &lt;a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/china/policies-politics/article/1940984/son-law-ex-senior-chinese-leader-jia-qinglin-named"&gt;massive investment firm in China&lt;/a&gt; and is the son-in-law of Jia Qinglin who was the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/29/world/asia/wang-jianlin-abillionaire-at-the-intersection-of-business-and-power-in-china.html"&gt;fourth-most senior leader in China&lt;/a&gt; before retiring in 2013. Aquila told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that this choice was made to avoid any trouble with the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which has authority over deals that could be problematic from a national security standpoint. (Li’s involvement in Canoo was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/8/20899436/discrimination-lawsuit-canoo-foreign-backers-ev-startup-british-chinese-government"&gt;first reported by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last year&lt;/a&gt;.) “It’s best to be ahead of things rather than try to deal with them [after],” Aquila said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9M1QED"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article previously claimed Canoo’s stock ticker will be CNOO. It will be GOEV. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We tested Harley-Davidson’s new Serial 1 electric bikes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mi2XNuXyXBcvqrAUYHFl9250uQA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68528385/ahawkins_201210_4346_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qnpg3e"&gt;After years in development, Harley-Davidson finally pulled back the curtain on its new lineup of electric bikes last month. The Serial 1 bikes won’t go on sale until spring 2021, but I got the chance to test-ride a few of them on a recent chilly afternoon in Brooklyn. And my initial impression is they totally live up to the hype. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfcF43"&gt;A quick refresher for those who missed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21564315/harley-davidson-ebikes-serial-1-price-specs-date"&gt;the initial announcement&lt;/a&gt;: Serial 1 is a standalone electric bike company that spun out from Harley-Davidson last October. Initially, Serial 1 will sell four bikes, ranging in price from $3,399 to $4,999. The brand names are Mosh/Cty, a city bike, and the commuter Rush/Cty, which comes in three variants (regular, Step-Thru, and Speed). Each comes with a mid-drive motor capable of generating 250W of continuous power and hitting top speeds of 20mph — except for the Rush/Cty Speed, which can go faster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Eyq9ZT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I’ll admit, I was a little skeptical that Harley-Davidson could pull this off&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mFsFHu"&gt;I’ll admit, I was a little skeptical that Harley-Davidson could pull this off.  When you hear about companies that specialize in combustion engine vehicles releasing their own electric bikes, most of the time, it’s just a brand licensing deal. (Think &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/2/21161230/jeep-ebike-electric-bike-quietkat-manufacturer-preorder-price-specs-date"&gt;Jeep’s e-bike&lt;/a&gt; or those &lt;a href="https://www.motortrend.com/news/news030317-humbike/"&gt;Hummer bikes&lt;/a&gt; from last decade.) Other times, it’s a much-hyped project that ends up falling victim to larger corporate forces, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/12/21256722/gm-ariv-shuts-down-ebike-production-covid"&gt;General Motors’ Ariv e-bikes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ABZ3a5"&gt;But this is not that. These are e-bikes designed and crafted by a dedicated team of bike enthusiasts inside Harley-Davidson’s product development skunkworks. And that dedication and craftsmanship shine through in the final products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJwDzU"&gt;Simply put, these are gorgeous bikes, with a clean design that threads all the wiring internally through the frame. The mid-drive Brose Mag S brushless internal motor was powerful and whisper-quiet. Both the motor and the battery are situated very low on the bike, much lower than normal. According to Serial 1’s product manager Aaron Frank, this creates an extra low center of gravity, which improves the handling and cornering.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9DvOcUfmGIm0dDRbUzQJtBOKSgI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22177007/ahawkins_201210_4346_0002.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aGdwin"&gt;“Harley-Davidson knows as much or more than anyone about designing and engineering a great-handling, very naturally responsive two-wheeled vehicle,” Frank told me. “And all of those lessons — from designing motorcycles about mass centralization, about consistent geometry, about ride handling — [were] applied to this vehicle, both at the design stage and in the testing stage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9gtimZ"&gt;I did most of my testing with the Rush/Cty Speed, which is the only Class 3 bike in the lineup. That meant a top speed of 28 mph, which had me frequently leaving &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; video team in the dust. (Sorry, Becca and Alix!) Thanks to the Enviolo automatic gear shifter, getting up to that top speed felt effortless. I hardly realized how fast I was going before glancing at the modestly sized Brose digital display. (I really liked the petite Brose display; too many drivetrain makers opt for oversized displays that are mostly unnecessary. Less is more, in my opinion.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NOum4srzo5YF7D1-TSgc4V4YRAo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22177010/ahawkins_201210_4346_0012.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k9liPP"&gt;I only had the bikes for a couple of hours, but it was my first experience with a CVT (continuous variable transmission) shifter. The rear hub Enviolo transmission is fully enclosed, electronically powered, and never needs maintenance. Using an app that connects to the bike via Bluetooth, you can set your ideal cadence so the bike always feels like it’s in the perfect gear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GEHYs8"&gt;I didn’t get a chance to futz with the settings, which was a little bit of a bummer because there were times I felt like I was spinning my legs like a pinwheel. Given more time with the bike, I would have loved to play around with that feature a little more and find the right setting for my riding style. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gkXI7w"&gt;The Mosh/Cty and Rush/Cty Step-Thru come with 529Wh battery packs, while the Rush/Cty and Rush/Cty Speed come with the more powerful 706Wh packs. The same team that developed the batteries for Harley-Davidson &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/14/20692388/harley-davidson-livewire-electric-motorcycle-test-drive"&gt;electric LiveWire motorcycles&lt;/a&gt; also developed these batteries. The integrated batteries are mounted very low on the frame, which helps with the mass centralization and improved handling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fKeSf9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One of the things that really surprised me was how well the bikes handled off-road&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dMaIcM"&gt;I can’t comment on the Serial 1’s charging time or range estimates, as I didn’t have long enough with the bikes to go the necessary limits. Depending on the power level, the Mosh/Cty is supposed to get 35–105 miles of range, while the Rush/Cty variants each get about 25–115 miles of range. That’s a pretty huge disparity, but a lot will depend on what power level you’re using. The higher the level, the less range you can expect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CeOr8P"&gt;One of the things that really surprised me was how well the bikes handled off-road, especially considering Serial 1 is marketing them (specifically the Mosh/Cty) as “the ultimate urban playbike.” Granted, this is only based on a few minutes riding over tree roots and wet leaves in Prospect Park, but the Rush/Cty Speed was nimble and handled better than expected. That said, I don’t expect to be popping wheelies anytime soon like &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GzP-fwPJNxs"&gt;the actor in the Serial 1-produced promo video&lt;/a&gt; — at least not right away.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wes6fT"&gt;The tires are Schwalbe Super Moto-X, and they come in two sizes: 27.5 x 2.4-inch and 27.5 x 2.8-inch. But one of the bike’s best features is a built-in 620 cubic-centimeter storage space at the base of the downtube, which should be enough room to store &lt;a href="https://mobil.abus.com/uk/on-road/Locks/Folding-Locks"&gt;an Abus folding lock&lt;/a&gt;. Think of it as your bike’s glove compartment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JdVHwd"&gt;But forget all of that for a minute: are they worth $3,000 to $5,000? That’s the real question. There are plenty of e-bikes — really good ones, too — that can be had for much cheaper. And those bikes don’t come with all of the baggage of having the Harley-Davidson name on the chainstay. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nUlJ73NupdFkfayE-o9Co4BDO_g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22177009/ahawkins_201210_4346_0009.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ik9xW426fAHkl-juktaZnKgVSqo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22177008/ahawkins_201210_4346_0007.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kG3T3b"&gt;Serial 1 won’t be competing with budget e-bikes from Swagtron or Lectric or modestly priced e-bikes from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21299601/rad-power-bike-radmission-electric-bike-ebike-price-specs"&gt;Rad Power Bikes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21227976/vanmoof-s3-electric-bike-review-price-specs"&gt;VanMoof&lt;/a&gt;, or Blix. Rather, the company is taking aim at major manufacturers like Giant, Trek, and Specialized, which sell premium e-bikes for high-end customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpncOU"&gt;Bikes from those companies sporting similar parts cost about the same as Serial 1’s bikes. If Harley-Davidson wants to go helmet to helmet with those major manufacturers, it has the name recognition and cultural capital to do so. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C06Gd8"&gt;“This isn’t just about a short-term, opportunistic grab at a moment in marketing or something,” Frank told me. “We’re very, very dedicated to building a permanent place for Serial 1 in this bicycle business.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now try on makeup from your home with the power of AR</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Image of the new model view and the Try it on button" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P4CNzH9Xk4Z04G3odXu1YowZqe8=/0x477:1125x1227/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68528357/IMG_0322.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gGKckP"&gt;Google’s new shopping feature will let people virtually try on makeup, the company announced in a blog post. Another feature will show the products on various models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3zYwjH"&gt;Only lipstick and eyeshadow are part of the feature. It is also limited to a few brands, such as L’Oreal, MAC Cosmetics, Black Opal, and Charlotte Tilbury.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Gif of a user swiping through various models and seeing what different shades of eye shadow look like on them" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4XofV9dW0JxlwJqNUNERs5WukHo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22176470/E814_AR_Beauty_Gifs_Eyes_v03.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can see what various shades look like on various skin tones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NhnEt5"&gt;To try it out, you can search for the line you’re eying. If it’s a supported brand, you’ll see a new card that shows a model, and the specific shade that they’re wearing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KguuBW"&gt;To change the shade, you use a list at the bottom; to change the model, you use the list at the top. It looks like Google and their partners have included models with a pretty wide range of skin tones to make it easier to find someone who matches you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AlnjZx"&gt;If you want to see what it would look like on &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;, there’s be a “Try it on” button. Clicking that will launch the camera, and then digitally apply the makeup. As with the models, you can change shades.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Photo of someone with digitally added makeup" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QXYdllHBeJZD3FgInSgaNhF_GsE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22176522/IMG_0321.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The interface lets you choose which color you’d like to “try on”.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A comparison of the same makeup using Google’s AR preview and the real thing " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MzOcw9UFd3GY5ULSHRSfV5cxZQM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22177041/IMG_0324.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Mitchell Clark&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On the left is the AR preview of NYX’s Vivid Brights Sugar Rush eye shadow, and on the right is me actually wearing NYX’s Vivid Brights Sugar Rush.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zO2ZW8"&gt;(It’s worth noting that my makeup skills are a bit rusty, but you can get the idea of how well the shade maps into real life.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vpTmtq"&gt;The facial tracking works about the same as a Snapchat filter, which is to say pretty well, but not perfectly. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Picture of the app where it was trying to add eye shadow to my upper lip" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aa_7DebHjTtPol4cgSQcv4ZMvFk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22176511/IMG_0319.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Like any AR, it’s not perfect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4NWmEy"&gt;This feature is rolling out when people may be hesitant to go to a physical store and use a communal tester. I didn’t order the products, so I can’t say how true the AR is to real life, but it should at least give you a better idea of how the shade will work with whatever look you’re going for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jV4FA7"&gt;Google has some examples in their blog posts of what you can try on. Some of the ones I found the most striking were the Stila Glitter and Glow and NYX Vivid Brights Creme eyeshadows, and the Revlon Lip Polish Vinyl Ultra HD lipstick  — talk about a name that appeals to tech enthusiasts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GoPro Remote launches alongside camera updates for faster data transfer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xc9i9DJwucjs-R6w_e0jGfjDCUI=/0x1318:7680x6438/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68528424/The_Remote_Product_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new GoPro Remote costs $79.99.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: GoPro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="09K8E9"&gt;GoPro just announced a new $79.99 wireless remote control alongside free firmware updates that bring performance and feature improvements to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437419/gopro-hero-9-review"&gt;Hero 9 Black&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/1/20891984/gopro-hero8-black-review-action-camera-image-stabilization-price-specs-features"&gt;Hero 8 Black&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20921641/gopro-max-review-360-camera-specs-price-features-test-video"&gt;Max&lt;/a&gt; cameras. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OJFHHa"&gt;The miniature Remote, as it’s called, is both rugged and waterproof to a depth of 16 feet. It features large glove-friendly buttons and a status display to see what mode your camera is in. One Remote can control common camera features like on / off, shutter button control, and mode changing for up to five cameras within a distance of about 200 feet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YV4OZNVWUnfLc7DlJGSuhff3LQM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22177156/The_Remote_Bike.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: GoPro&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Remote makes it easy to control your GoPro camera when mounted on a helmet, for example.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u5Izga"&gt;The Remote can be attached to your wrist, control bar, or steering wheel, for example, offering remote control of GoPro’s Hero 9 Black, Hero 8 Black, or Max mounted to your helmet, &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BvPoFk0lFFH/"&gt;kite lines&lt;/a&gt;, or roll bar — anywhere you want just so long as the camera is within range of the Bluetooth LE signal. Older GoPro cameras are not compatible with the new Remote which supplants GoPro’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgopro.com%2Fen%2Fus%2Fshop%2Fmounts-accessories%2Fsmart-remote%2FARMTE-002.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F17%2F22180159%2Fgopro-remote-firmware-1-5-faster-content-trasfer#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Smart Remote&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7mhz4p"&gt;GoPro is also rolling out firmware updates for the Hero 9 Black, Hero 8 Black, and Max cameras today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmDJzm"&gt;Hero 9 Black owners will see the most dramatic improvements after installing the version 1.5 update. Changes include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ANqI0H"&gt;Up to 30 percent faster wireless data transfer from the camera to the GoPro app on phones&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xNaOXd"&gt;Compatibility with new Remote&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="J150hZ"&gt;Improved HyperSmooth 3.0 cold-weather performance&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KGF67S"&gt;A shortcut slider button for slow-motion capture&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qHyNIJ"&gt;Improved GPS accuracy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Lwblnp"&gt;Improved live streaming with the Max Lens Mod&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="zRJz2p"&gt;In addition to adding support for the new Remote, GoPro says the new Hero 8 Black firmware can boost wireless transfer speeds by up to 15 percent, while Max data transfers are improved by up to 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11WhnR"&gt;The firmware updates are available now at &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gopro.com&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F17%2F22180159%2Fgopro-remote-firmware-1-5-faster-content-trasfer#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GoPro’s website&lt;/a&gt; or via its app. The $79.99 Remote is available to buy in North America starting today, but won’t be available elsewhere until February.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Hades is my game of the year </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YUp0gw7JXV3BkHpKKnwIFHYkAEc=/200x0:1280x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68528301/hades_switch_screenshot06.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pek01f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;One more try. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KISPlX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496904/hades-supergiant-games-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a game that does so many things so well, it’s hard to describe them all. It’s a fine-tuned isometric action game that takes the elaborate interweaving systems and combat of Supergiant’s previous titles to soaring new heights. It’s a roguelike that transcends the limitations of the genre with great &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21507969/hades-supergiant-endgame-storytelling-narrative-rewards"&gt;storytelling&lt;/a&gt;. It’s one of the most compelling personal dramas told in a video game this year — all of it polished to a dazzling, mirror-like shine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="A3fWmo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Hades is a roguelike with hot gods to kiss and kill","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21496904/hades-supergiant-games-review-nintendo-switch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="s9kekO"&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; had only done one of these things well, it would have been a great game. The fact that it manages to do all of them, though, without missing a single beat, makes it the best game I’ve played this year. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OAG-DGboBub0jbvPkQMHhujK8xk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22151708/hades_switch_screenshot03.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m3OUA6"&gt;In many ways, &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; feels like the culmination of developer Supergiant’s previous titles. It merges them into a cohesive whole: the fast-paced isometric action and omnipresent narration that were the hallmarks of &lt;em&gt;Bastion&lt;/em&gt;, the customization of &lt;em&gt;Transistor&lt;/em&gt;, and the emphasis on worldbuilding and storytelling that’s been the throughline throughout all its titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0pd3mO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;In ‘Hades,’ death isn’t failure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UULITJ"&gt;But the core idea is “one more try.” One more attempt to clear another room. To beat the next boss. To reach the next zone. To unlock a new weapon, skill, or ability that will help you on the next one. To hear a new story from a friend or loved one. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21502405/hades-death-try-something-new-supergiant-games"&gt;And on and on and on&lt;/a&gt;, until “one more try” has turned into 10, it's two in the morning, and you’re still dueling with the denizens of the underworld.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xficI7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; doles out its story in generous doses as players are regaled by their relatives on Mount Olympus and through interactions back at the starting hub on each run. It makes you &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt; about the other denizens of the underworld. I wanted to help my weary mentor Achilles reunite with his lost lover; I plied my fluffy dog Cerberus with gifts and pets because they are such a good boy. Death isn’t failure; it’s a chance to spend time with the friends (and frenemies) that populate the House of Hades, too. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/inE0ybo2kyR2SoSipBpKVUCA9tk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22151710/hades_switch_screenshot05.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ppeODQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; is a great action roguelike on its own. The hack-and-slash combat, the variety of weapons (there are six, each with four different forms that radically change how you can play), and the dizzying amount of abilities and modifiers that are gifted by the gods of Olympus ensure that no two runs are quite the same. The game also cleverly incentivizes players to try new weapons and abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7u7Ym8"&gt;Those abilities play off each other in delightful ways, and there’s no “right” combination. Some of my earliest successes were with builds that at first seemed like they would be utterly useless, like abilities that only activate when I take damage, but then a later boon activates them automatically every few seconds, turning me into a passive damage powerhouse. Even dozens of hours in, I still am surprised when the game will toss out strange combinations that result in powerful synergies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kt9WDj"&gt;The magic of &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just the variety of its gameplay or the satisfaction of perfectly clearing a room or boss battle. It’s how the game pushes you to try just one more loop, promising more information on the family drama of Zagreus, Hades, and the rest of the Olympians or the tantalizing chance of finally breaking out of the underworld this time. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j4okqAxTwJXFiETreDF7XALEDJY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22151711/hades_switch_screenshot01.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="b3Xd7K"&gt;Just one more run. One more line of dialogue. One more try. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXV7fk"&gt;(It helps, of course, that every inch of &lt;em&gt;Hades’&lt;/em&gt; artwork is lush and detailed, with gorgeous characters that make spending hours battling through the underworld a delight.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KsPIlP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Just one more run, one more line of dialogue, one more try&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="g2QEL2"&gt;And much like the ritual lord of the underworld himself, the game is hard — but fair. In my dozens of runs throughout hell, I’ve rarely felt like I was unfairly cheated with bad boons or cheap deaths. &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; rewards players for learning how each enemy and boss fights, how its abilities can combine, but it doesn’t punish players for not mastering the twitch-fast dashes and dodges. In fact, in a welcome move, &lt;em&gt;Hades&lt;/em&gt; offers a God Mode setting that buffs player’s damage resistance and makes sure the entire game is more accessible to all players. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PhiIAl"&gt;“One more time,” Zagreus mutters when he starts his next attempt to battle his way out of hell. &lt;em&gt;One more run&lt;/em&gt;, I think to myself in response, knowing that it’ll absolutely not be the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zheuSu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TR6cJn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
