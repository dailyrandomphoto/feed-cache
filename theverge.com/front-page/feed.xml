    <title>AT&amp;T is giving away six months of Nvidia GeForce Now cloud gaming service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SBaxb5_ISwC-cEq5oFEkCdVMFvA=/130x0:1150x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346147/GeForce_NOW_CES_Image.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lD0L3A"&gt;At its CES 2022 virtual keynote, Nvidia is announcing a partnership with AT&amp;amp;T to offer six months of GeForce Now cloud gaming service for free. New and existing AT&amp;amp;T customers with a 5G-capable device and qualifying plan can claim the promotion through the service provider, allowing them to stream free-to-play titles and supported PC games they already own on the go with the cloud gaming service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hy1SGY"&gt;This promotional offer is for Nvidia’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce-now%2Fmemberships%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F4%2F22865583%2Fnvidia-geforce-now-cloud-gaming-att-5g-plan-deal-ces-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Priority tier of GeForce Now&lt;/a&gt;, not the new RTX 3080 one &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750246/nvidia-geforce-now-rtx-3080-google-stadia-cloud-gaming"&gt;we recently enjoyed&lt;/a&gt;. The Priority tier normally costs $49.99 for a prepaid six-month period (or $9.99 monthly) and includes enough GPU power to add raytracing to some older games at 1080p resolution and at up to 60fps (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778693/nvidia-geforce-now-cloud-gaming-framerate-cap-fps-cyberpunk"&gt;though you won’t see that in every game&lt;/a&gt;). Priority lets you play for up to six hours at a time. It also typically comes with a free digital copy of &lt;em&gt;Crysis Remastered &lt;/em&gt;to keep, though it’s not clear if that comes with the AT&amp;amp;T promotion. At time of posting, it’s also not clear how qualifying AT&amp;amp;T subscribers can redeem their GeForce Now offer or which 5G plans may or may not qualify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m4hJMq"&gt;Nvidia also made new claims as to how GeForce Now is being optimized for AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network (and AT&amp;amp;T Fiber), promising upcoming technological developments from both companies to bolster the GeForce Now service in the future. The goal is to reduce latency and packet loss while playing on a 5G network, though Nvidia doesn’t have any specific new technologies to reveal yet.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mass Effect Legendary Edition comes to Game Pass this week</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zEIwF4qVfTeDTvCClRlFeciuC3I=/114x0:1341x818/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346145/mele_screenshot_garrus_logo.jpg.adapt.crop16x9.818p.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;BioWare&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="x3qkQX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2022/01/04/coming-soon-to-xbox-game-pass-january-2022/"&gt;Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; is starting the new year off strong with the announcement that &lt;em&gt;Mass Effect Legendary Edition&lt;/em&gt; will be among the first games to arrive on the service in January. The alien dating simulator cleverly disguised as an epic space opera trilogy arrives on Game Pass console and PC on January 6th. So if you’ve ever wondered what a Garrus Vakarian is and why people are so obsessed with wooing what looks like a rock-plated chicken lizard, now’s your chance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rk1NyD"&gt;Other titles coming to Game Pass in January include roguelike cave explorer&lt;em&gt; Spelunky 2&lt;/em&gt;, the award-winning, time-warping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22698855/outer-wilds-echoes-of-the-eye-expansion-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Outer Wilds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and a preview of the four-person co-op shooter The Anacrusis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7n3tF"&gt;Coming with the enthusiastic endorsement of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Andrew Webster, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16774194/gorogoa-game-review-iphone-switch-steam"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gorogoa&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a BAFTA-winning hand-drawn puzzle game, launches on Game Pass Cloud, console, and PC today. &lt;em&gt;Olija&lt;/em&gt;, a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252953/olija-game-review-nintendo-switch-steam-pc-ps4-xbox"&gt;dark and haunting&lt;/a&gt;” 2D pixel action game akin to &lt;em&gt;Hollow Knight&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dead Cells&lt;/em&gt; but less punishing, also arrives on Game Pass today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z2j17R"&gt;As new titles arrive, so too must they leave.&lt;em&gt; Desperados III&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Ghost of a Tale&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mount &amp;amp; Blade: Warband&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Pandemic&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Yiik: A Postmodern RPG&lt;/em&gt; will depart Game Pass on January 15th. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/29/18201880/kingdom-hearts-3-review-ps4-xbox-square-enix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts III&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also leaves Game Pass on January 15th, so Keyblade Masters, it’s your last chance to get “&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/2019/1/28/18200454/kingdom-hearts-story-explained-unraveled"&gt;norted&lt;/a&gt;” or otherwise be wholly disappointed in the series’ &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/1/24/18195478/kingdom-hearts-3-review-xbox-one-playstation-4"&gt;lackluster conclusion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD’s new Radeon 6000S series GPUs are here to beef up thin-and-light gaming laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mq00beyN93ddr9HpNOJYZa9d6rY=/234x0:2577x1562/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346141/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_9.29.05_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tuEW7x"&gt;AMD is going for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22620191"&gt;full overhaul of its laptop hardware&lt;/a&gt; at CES 2022, with a full slate of new discrete GPUs for laptops: a new line of RX 6000S models designed for beefing up graphics on thin-and-light gaming laptops and an expanded line of RX 6000M GPUs for more traditional gaming laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6KzOW"&gt;The RX 6000S series of chips is kicking off with three new designs: the RX 6800S, the RX 6700S, and the RX 6600S. AMD says that the new GPUs will enable powerful gaming laptops that are 20 percent thinner and under 4.5 pounds in weight, with a goal of maximizing power efficiency. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/syxzoirWUWjikJ1IAHRAHP82WF0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144256/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_9.30.44_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9xCK0y"&gt;The 6000M series is getting a pair of new entry-level chips — the RX 6500M and RX 6300M — and souped-up versions of some of its existing models, including the RX 6850M, which AMD says is 7 percent faster than its old top mobile GPU, the RX 6800M. Rounding things out are the RX 6650M XT and the RX 6650M, which AMD says offer up to 20 percent faster speeds than the original RX 6600M. (AMD already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/31/22457181/amd-radeon-rx-6000m-series-release-date-rdna2-rog-strix-g15"&gt;has a trio of high-performance GPUs&lt;/a&gt; for mobile devices as part of its RX 6000M lineup: the RX 6800M, RX 6700M, and RX 6600M, which were introduced last year.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FBq0lo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10960873"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="POd4lD"&gt;All the GPUs in both the refreshed RX 6000M and the newly introduced RX 6000S lineups will feature AMD’s RDNA 2 architecture and should pair nicely with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22620191"&gt;AMD’s newly announced Ryzen 6000 laptop CPUs&lt;/a&gt; for customers looking for more power than the integrated RNDA 2 graphics that those chips offer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lrtutd2rHRMVtz7UtYV7iskol2U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144257/Screen_Shot_2022_01_04_at_9.30.55_AM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qtg36b"&gt;Laptops featuring the new RX 6000M and RX 6000S chips are expected to launch in Q1 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYAwUT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alienware’s newest monitor features a 34-inch curved OLED from Samsung</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Alienware QD OLED gaming monitor" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0VoIrU4R5ieX1v8gPEYFgku1euc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346060/qdoledhero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Dell&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="k6ug1E"&gt;Alienware has an exciting new gaming monitor that’ll release in late March 2022. It has plenty of specs that gamers care about, but I’d be remiss not to mention any closer to the top of this post that it features a 34-inch Quantum Dot OLED panel manufactured by Samsung. LG Display has traditionally been the supplier of larger OLED panels (especially in TVs), so hopefully, Alienware’s gaming monitor is the first of many more big OLEDs to come out of Samsung, which has usually stuck with the smaller OLEDs found in tablets and phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZYzK2"&gt;The QD-OLED monitor, as it’s called, seems like a great PC gaming companion, marrying the immersion of a curved display with the unbeatable colors and fast response time that only an OLED can produce. The QD-OLED monitor has a 1800R curve, a more subtle curve than we’ve seen in monitors like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/11/22815110/lg-c1-48-oled-samsung-odyssey-neo-g9-review-monitor-tv"&gt;Samsung’s Odyssey Neo G9&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware QD-OLED gaming monitor" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0BOxiiuv1IoK6WXig8sGDp9lvXw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23128106/qdoledback.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The back side of the QD-OLED isn’t too different from Alienware’s previous monitors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tprMkk"&gt;At its native 3440 x 1400 resolution, Alienware’s OLED display has a 175Hz refresh rate through DisplayPort, or up to 100Hz via its HDMI 2.0 ports at the same resolution. For PCs with a recent Nvidia graphics card inside, this monitor supports Nvidia’s G-Sync Ultimate technology which, in addition to making your games look smoother with Adaptive Sync, promises “lifelike HDR” and better picture quality overall than other standard G-Sync monitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QxaaCC"&gt;Unlike LG’s latest OLED TVs, the Alienware QD-OLED monitor doesn’t feature HDMI 2.1 ports, though it’s not an egregious omission since this monitor doesn’t go beyond QHD Plus resolution. The Xbox Series X supports 1440p, but the PS5 is currently limited to 1080p or 4K, not 1440p.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware QD OLED" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WbPdNJ7KTzyY-sOh9rG6aQHokG4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23128112/qdoledunder.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Dell&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is definitely the least exciting angle of the QD-OLED.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nafEdz"&gt;Alienware says that Samsung’s OLED panel has a Quantum Dot pixel layer, which should give it better color uniformity. It also should support 99.3 percent of the DCI-P3 color space and 149 percent of the sRGB color space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L13IcM"&gt;The QD-OLED has a height-adjustable stand and supports tilting, swiveling, and slanting. Alienware says this model has “improved OLED reliability” and it comes with a three-year warranty that — crucially — includes coverage for OLED burn-in. This all sounds great, but Alienware has so far been quiet about one of the more important specs of this monitor: its price. Don’t expect it to be cheap. Alienware told us that it’ll share a price closer to launch in early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The new Chipolo Card Spot puts Apple’s Find My network in your wallet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JjQLmLShIBD-BXGR_YTqOZXhxLI=/30x0:1950x1280/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346100/Chipolo_CARD_Spot_Blue_Wallet.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9JESOT"&gt;Chipolo has a new Bluetooth tracker it’s announcing at CES 2022: the $35 Chipolo Card Spot, a new version of the company’s credit card-shaped Spot tracker that utilizes Apple’s Find My Bluetooth network for locating missing objects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGQD1s"&gt;The idea of a credit card-shaped tracker for your wallet is nothing new, of course — &lt;a href="https://chipolo.net/en-us/products/chipolo-card"&gt;both Chipolo&lt;/a&gt; and more established competitors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22716868/tile-mate-pro-slim-sticker-trackers-update-range-volume-water-resistance"&gt;like Tile&lt;/a&gt; have been making them for years. But like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372099/chipolo-one-spot-bluetooth-tracker-find-my-apple-airtags"&gt;Chipolo One Spot released last year&lt;/a&gt;, the Card Spot ditches Chipolo’s own Bluetooth tracking network in favor of support for Apple’s Find My mesh network, used by AirTags and other Apple devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="va4boc"&gt;Chipolo has been a smaller player in the Bluetooth tracking world for years, but it’s made its presence more known in recent months thanks to its quick support for Apple’s Find My network (the company actually announced its One Spot tracker before Apple’s AirTags were officially revealed). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sogpuBBwK6UeAWr4ukGRawKYYu8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23128907/Chipolo_CARD_Spot_Thin_as_it_gets.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zvvBi7"&gt;The Card Spot supports the usual Find My feature set, including marking an item as missing with Apple’s Lost Mode and the recently added iOS 15 feature to “&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212765"&gt;Notify When Left Behind&lt;/a&gt;” which, as the name implies, notifies you automatically if you leave your tracker (and the wallet that presumably contains it) behind. Unlike Apple’s AirTags, though, the Card Spot doesn’t have an ultra-wideband radio, meaning that it won’t be able to do the hyper-local tracking that Apple’s first-party tags can do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YP43Gu"&gt;On the spec side of things, the Card Spot has an audible alert that reaches 105dB in volume with a 200-foot range, while measuring in at 0.09 inches thick (or about three times as thick as an average credit card). The Card Spot also offers IPX5 water resistance, although the battery isn’t removable. Instead, Chipolo says that each Card Spot should offer about two years of battery life, with a return program that lets customers ship in their old tracker to be recycled in exchange for a 50 percent off discount code on a new one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9cdkOc"&gt;Preorders start January 4th, with the first Card Spots set to ship in February. Customers will be able to buy the Card Spot for $35, in a discounted two-pack for $60, or a “Spot Bundle” of two One Spot trackers and one Card Spot tracker for $77. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="KjZ2yh"&gt;One of Alienware’s coolest CES 2022 announcements is the 17-inch M17 R5 Ryzen Edition. It looks a lot like the previous iteration, but inside of its chassis, it’s an AMD Advantage machine, kind of like this &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22465565/asus-rog-strix-g15-advantage-edition-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus ROG Strix G15 Advantage&lt;/a&gt;. What that means in Alienware’s case is it’s a showcase for AMD’s new Ryzen 7 and 9 6000-series processors, the Radeon RX 6850M XT graphics chip, as well as a few features enabled by all of that AMD synergy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lMT4bq"&gt;This model supports AMD SmartShift Max, SmartAccess Memory, and SmartAccess Graphics is making its debut on this machine. The simple version of what &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/technologies/smartshift"&gt;SmartShift&lt;/a&gt; translates to is each of the laptop’s components can work together to deliver a fast experience or at least something greater than the sum of its parts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware M17 R5 Ryzen Edition" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_X3Fupy4HSfHIsBPk9VqK9pEGgA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23134066/m17r5ryzenedition2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Alienware&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jfPMvw"&gt;It’s tough to extract from jargon how well a laptop should perform while running all of the latest, most demanding apps and games, but the specs seem very promising. At the highest end (prices haven’t been made public for this configuration, unfortunately), the M17 R5 Ryzen Edition can be configured with the octa-core Ryzen 9 6980HX and a Radeon RX 6850M XT graphics chip with 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM that can draw 175W of power with SmartShift Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="soHkym"&gt;That’s a &lt;em&gt;lot &lt;/em&gt;of power for a GPU in a mobile machine, and I’m excited to see how that translates to stutter-free gameplay, especially on the 4K display option that has a 120Hz refresh rate (3ms response time) and support for FreeSync adaptive sync. This model can be configured with 1080p panels with either a 165Hz refresh rate and a 3ms response time or a 360Hz refresh rate with a faster 1ms response time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fTFrBQ"&gt;This model has two DDR5 SO-DIMM slots and can be configured with up to 64GB of dual-channel RAM clocked at 4,800MHz. There are single and dual storage configs available, topping out at 4TB of maximum storage for both.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware M17 R5 Ryzen Edition" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2IJ5J0AZUN7zje4ixG3hcLbzi4U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23134073/m17r5ryzenedition3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Alienware&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Il9tGv"&gt;If you prefer Nvidia graphics, Alienware is offering multiple options, starting with the RTX 3050 Ti and going up to the RTX 3080 Ti. Prices start at $1,599, but the top-of-the-line model almost certainly costs several hundred dollars more than that. And in terms of ports, every configuration above the base 3050 Ti model includes a 2.5Gbps ethernet port, a headphone jack, three USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports, a power plug, an HDMI 2.1 port, and a USB-C 4 Gen 2 port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UuTfYt"&gt;Unlike the Alienware X-series laptops, this M17 model is aimed at gamers who want a desktop replacement-grade machine, complete with a big display. Alienware says that this machine, along with all of its new X-series and M-series laptops for 2022, features Dolby Vision HDR. However, this model won’t be one that you’ll likely want to lug around very much, as it weighs 6.82 pounds. Look out for this model to release sometime in the spring of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s ThinkPad Z-Series targets — you guessed it — Gen-Z</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad Z13 and ThinkPad Z16 side-by-side on a gridded table with a black background. Both screens display The Verge homepage." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uK2FW2-ccCAsRb2zUYibbs1B6lI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346062/bfarsace_211216_4940_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lenovo’s newest ThinkPads are thin, light, and ready for the boardroom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UYiK84"&gt;Lenovo is trying to make ThinkPads cool to the kids. The company has launched the ThinkPad Z-series, a thin and light ThinkPad line with funky colors, eco-friendly packaging, and a distinctly modern look. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zHbjiV"&gt;“If you’re currently buying, especially in the business market, a consumer-look-and-feel design, this is the product you should look at,” Tom Butler, executive director of the ThinkPad portfolio, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We’re going to bring in all the elements of a robust business-class device, but it’s going to be in more of this consumer, progressive, modern design.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="scGO1v"&gt;There’s a 13-inch model (the Z13) and a 16-inch model (the Z16). Both include some of the most recognizable ThinkPad features: namely, the light-up logo and the tiny red TrackPoint. But elsewhere, it’s a brand new look. The Z13 comes in arctic gray, black, and a blackish “recycled vegan leather.” The packaging is made from recyclable and compostable bamboo and sugar cane, and the adapter is “90 percent post-consumer content.” The screen is 16:10 — the bezels are so tiny you can barely see them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GEDeNs"&gt;These models also lack some of the more idiosyncratic ThinkPad features. The discrete clickers found on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22691965/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-9-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;many ThinkPad touchpads&lt;/a&gt; are gone. The Control and Function keys, famously reversed on most ThinkPads, are in their customary places on Z-Series keyboards. Brian Leonard, Lenovo’s VP of design, says this is to help ease new users’ transitions from other consumer models — and, to be fair, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"&gt;I complain&lt;/a&gt; in every ThinkPad review I write about how much of a pain it is to adjust to the ThinkPad layout. The long-beloved half-sized arrow keys have met the same fate on the Z-Series — full sizes here in order to keep the bottom of the keyboard one smooth line. “What we wanted to do was really go back to the initial concept around ThinkPad, which was really about this perfect black rectilinear box,” says Leonard.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NschMNkabHietNLTVQ2enTdnuIM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23119040/bfarsace_211216_4940_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Options, options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2v0sar"&gt;The other thing you might notice is the camera enclosure. It’s a statement — it’s very visible at the top of the lid, and anyone walking past while you’re using a Z-series will notice it. The specs of the camera and microphone (1080p f2.0 and dual-array mics, respectively) are engraved on the outside. Butler says this bold look was intended to be a “celebration of the camera,” an infrared 1080p shooter that looked fairly usable during my brief hands-on. The design choice, though, was “definitely a big debate” among Lenovo’s team, Leonard recalled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWdE0V"&gt;Perhaps most excitingly, the line is AMD-exclusive — both models use AMD’s latest Ryzen Pro processors, while the Z16 can also include an AMD discrete GPU and the Z13 can house a Lenovo-exclusive Ryzen Pro chip. Such an arrangement isn’t unheard of for high-end ThinkPads. While a number of Lenovo’s consumer models include both AMD and Intel options, much of the X1 series is Intel-exclusive and co-engineered with Intel. Butler says Lenovo similarly worked closely with AMD on the Z-series chassis. “If you try to put something else in there, you’re gonna sub-optimize,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad Z16 open on a gridded table with a black background. The screen displays The Verge homepage." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vXUjUsMzc-7s3rcv5dA-sZ6cbQo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23119038/bfarsace_211216_4940_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lenovo tested a number of prototypes, and also drew from last year’s releases.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wghIXA"&gt;Designing the Z-Series has been more than a two-year process. Lenovo drew from over 1,000 interviews with “different age groups,” Butler says, and also took cues from the performance of some of the funkier, mind-blowingly thin and light ThinkPads it tried last year, including the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22642876/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-titanium-yoga-review-windows-price-specs"&gt;X1 Titanium Yoga&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22335874/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-nano-laptop-windows-business-intel-review-price-specs"&gt;X1 Nano&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VtW0CE"&gt;One early prototype had no delineation between the touchpad and the palm rests, creating a single, smooth slab beneath the keyboard (a look that I suspect other ultraportables may try this year as haptic touchpads grow more common). Lenovo abandoned this because it anticipated (probably correctly) that people might be confused about where to click. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7P9fEe"&gt;The company also tried a webcam that was hidden completely beneath the screen (it was not visible at all on the prototype I saw). COVID-19, which made webcam performance a bigger priority for much of Lenovo’s target audience, did away with this plan. Early units also included a convertible model (also ultimately scrapped — clamshells are a much larger market) and a numpad (Lenovo’s research found that its target audience wants the touchpad centered under the spacebar, which a numpad makes difficult). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VasIft"&gt;So the Z-Series, ultimately, is not as kooky and new-age as the designers may originally have dreamed. Leonard did, though, caveat that the scrapped features may still be on the table for future models. And overall, the sort of laptop Lenovo has its eye on is clear: a smooth, sleek block of aluminum, with as few odds and ends sticking out as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nKevTj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10959256"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mUcsLj"&gt;Is that a good thing? That seems to be what we can look forward to finding out over the next two years as more companies go after such a thin, seamless ideal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MDxVms"&gt;The Z-Series certainly lives up to Lenovo’s marketing: In person, it is every bit as thin, as light, as sleek, and as all-screen as Lenovo claims. But there are also tradeoffs. There’s a bit less key travel than you’ll find on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22691965/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-carbon-gen-9-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;some more established ThinkPad lines&lt;/a&gt;, and keyboard quality is something ThinkPad owners are &lt;a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/X1-Carbon-Gen-9-Lenovo-has-to-be-careful-with-the-ThinkPad-keyboard.537996.0.html"&gt;very, very attached to&lt;/a&gt;. The touchpad is also haptic, and the click feels fairly shallow. I’m sure this is something you’d get used to as an owner — and haptic touchpads have the benefit of being more customizable — but I still didn’t particularly enjoy clicking with it. RAM is also soldered, and port selection is limited: the Z13 only has two USB-C slots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aukj1k"&gt;There are certainly many shoppers for whom these limitations won’t be a problem, and Lenovo has clearly done its research on what its target customers prefer. Still, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; has managed to figure out how to make devices close to as thin as these without obliterating the connectivity or compromising the touchpad (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22820568/samsung-galaxy-book-pro-13-inch-review"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt; has a great business laptop that’s both thinner and lighter). That doesn’t mean the Z-Series doesn’t have other advantages over these — there’s nothing quite like a ThinkPad, as the line’s continued dominance over the business market reflects, and an exclusive partnership with chipmaking-superpower AMD is undoubtedly one of the most exciting announcements to emerge from this year’s CES. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WSMX8h"&gt;But big sacrifices in the name of thinness have also led to disaster in the past (I’m currently typing this on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/17/20696238/apple-macbook-pro-13-inch-2019-review-specs-price-features"&gt;2019 MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; and hating my life). I’m looking forward to trying these models out and am tentatively in favor of the rectilinear future they point to in the PC space. At the same time, I really, really hope Lenovo isn’t falling victim to the “thin at all costs” mindset that brought us the butterfly keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vR4Cmj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GNjALR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s new smart clock swaps the Google Assistant for Alexa</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/om7Yq0iurDzO7O8t88SM-kCi7xQ=/147x0:2370x1482/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346098/lenovo_smart_clock_ces_2022.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TOyjjt"&gt;Lenovo has a new smart clock, and unlike its prior models, the updated Smart Clock Essential comes with Alexa instead of Google Assistant — basically making it an Echo Dot turned smart clock. Most of the major changes to the clock have to do with Lenovo passing the baton to Alexa, but there are still some smaller changes worth noting as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISipFo"&gt;You can still set an alarm, timer, and reminders, as well as control your smart home with the device; any product that’s compatible with Alexa will also work with the Smart Clock Essential. Additionally, you can stream audio from Amazon Music and other streaming platforms, which the smart clock plays from its 3W speaker, a spec that remains unchanged from the previous model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKKBvn"&gt;The fabric case that wraps around the LED clock face is more pronounced than its predecessor, as it extends beneath the face and is visible when you look at the clock head-on. It also has a bit of a sloped design, similar to the way the Echo Show and Meta Portal’s cases are set at an angle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G8JmGn"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TkcjsnsJUc8?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9nb60R"&gt;Aside from that, the segmented LCD clock face still displays the weather and time. According to Lenovo’s demo video, the display will also show basic animations when you ask Alexa for something — a feature the older Google Assistant model didn’t offer. You can tap the device to dismiss an alarm (something that didn’t work all too great in the previous model, as noted in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/8/21553993/lenovo-smart-clock-essential-smart-alarm-clock-review-price-specs-features"&gt;our review&lt;/a&gt;), and it also comes with a USB port so you can charge your phone or other devices. Lenovo notes that, like the older model, the new Smart Clock doesn’t come with a camera and also has a switch to mute the microphone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rMqhUn"&gt;In addition to the new Smart Clock Essential, Lenovo is also refreshing its Smart Frame with an update that Lenovo says will roll out in the first quarter of 2022. When the update arrives, you won’t necessarily need a Google Photos account to show off your photos in the frame — as an alternative, you can upload photos to the device’s built-in memory using your phone. You can also schedule and time virtual “sticky notes” that appear on the screen that contains a custom message for the other members of your household. Lenovo first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/1/6/21051398/lenovo-smart-frame-display-photo-tab-m10-release-date-features-price-ces-2020"&gt;announced the Smart Frame at CES in 2020&lt;/a&gt; and initially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/18/21262296/lenovo-smart-frame-google-photos-integration-discounted-indiegogo-launch-50-percent"&gt;offered it at half price&lt;/a&gt; through crowdfunding site Indiegogo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYhSJl"&gt;Lenovo’s Smart Clock Essential is priced at $59.99. It’s supposed to become available this month and comes in gray or red. The Smart Frame is already available for purchase and costs $399.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s Mobileye announces new EyeQ Ultra system-on-a-chip for autonomous driving </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WMpOoZxSYJpHTLqDMdAv758inkE=/129x0:1520x927/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346061/mobileye_av_nyc_intel_24.jpg.rendition.intel.web.1648.927.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UUUhes"&gt;Mobileye, the advanced driver assist and autonomous driving company owned by Intel, announced the latest version of its EyeQ system-on-a-chip (SoC), which it described as its most advanced system yet. The announcement was made at the 2022 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rIYrPQ"&gt;The new chip, dubbed EyeQ Ultra, is the latest version of Mobileye’s SoC that’s been in production since 2004. The company says the chip will be capable of 176 trillion operations per second (TOPS), putting it in competition with Tesla and Nvidia in the race to produce high-performing computer chips to power autonomous vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nsqcgt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The EyeQ Ultra won’t go into production until late 2023&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wpQiu8"&gt;The EyeQ Ultra won’t go into production until late 2023 and is not expected to be ready for full-scale automotive manufacturing until 2025. But Mobileye is still confident in the chip’s performance, calling it “the most advanced, highest-performing system-on-chip purpose-built for autonomous driving.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xqYMTB8oandAzlAG20SxpxcYM7M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23143137/21065_ME_CHIP_v008_EyeQ7H__002_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Mobileye&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Mobileye’s EyeQ Ultra is the company’s most advanced System-on-a-Chip yet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IyJqNc"&gt;Mobileye says the EyeQ Ultra will equal the performance of 10 of the company’s EyeQ5 chips in a single package. The company claims that vehicles equipped with the EyeQ Ultra chip will be capable of Level 4 autonomous driving, which is defined as the ability to drive without human input under specific conditions. But Mobileye claims its chip will accomplish this while also providing “extreme power efficiency with zero performance sacrifices.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="T5pN7u"&gt;EyeQ Ultra utilizes an array of four classes of proprietary accelerators, each built for a specific task. These accelerators are paired with additional CPU cores, ISPs and GPUs in a highly efficient solution capable of processing input from two sensing subsystems – one camera-only system and the other radar and lidar combined – as well as the vehicle’s central computing system, the high-definition map and driving policy software. At a mere 176 TOPS, the EyeQ Ultra is much more efficient than other AV solutions, delivering the necessary performance and price-point required for consumer-level AVs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="sGdYpr"&gt;Mobileye is leveraging its experience supplying SoCs to automotive clients for over several decades. The company supplies its EyeQ family of products to 13 of the 15 largest automakers in the world, including BMW, Nissan, and Ford. The company recently celebrated the shipment of its &lt;a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/mobileye-celebrates-100-million-eyeq-chips-shipped.html#gs.komc3f"&gt;100 millionth chip&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gGVkwD"&gt;Tesla originally used Mobileye chips for its Autopilot system but &lt;a href="http://www.recode.net/2016/7/26/12285930/tesla-mobileye-self-driving-cars"&gt;severed ties with the company after a fatal accident&lt;/a&gt; where Tesla claims Mobileye’s technology was unable to distinguish between a laterally crossing truck and the sky behind it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ideiAT"&gt;Also at CES, the company announced a smaller, more efficient successor to its EyeQ4 chip for advanced driver assist applications. The EyeQ6L is just 55 percent the size of the EyeQ4 and is designed to be installed in a box attached to the windshield for Level 2 systems. It began testing last year and is due to reach start of production by the middle of 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYaRfi"&gt;Founded in Jerusalem in 1999 by Amnon Shashua and Ziv Aviram, Mobileye develops computer chips and vision systems that power driver assist features, like lane keeping, adaptive cruise control, and blindspot detection. The company also aspires to operate its own robotaxi fleet, recently announcing plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585338/intel-mobileye-autonomous-vehicle-av-testing-nyc"&gt;test its vehicles in New York City&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/7/22659366/intel-mobileye-robotaxi-germany-sixt-moovit"&gt;launch a service in Germany in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Late last year, Intel announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/7/22822279/intel-mobileye-ipo-2022-autonomous-vehicles-robotaxi"&gt;it will take Mobileye public&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG challenges Samsung with announcement of its own massive MicroLED TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M-kF71zQY02FEjPWcSHnWXEwXec=/11x0:1966x1303/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70346115/microled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oXR1yb"&gt;Up until now it’s largely been Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166062/samsung-110-inch-microled-4k-tv-announced-features"&gt;pushing the MicroLED display technology&lt;/a&gt; that many view as the eventual successor to OLED TVs — once the wildly-high prices come down, that is. But now LG is joining the fray. During its CES 2022 press conference, LG announced that its first MicroLED TVs will ship “later this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qtqgVy"&gt;Just like Samsung, LG says the modular nature of its MicroLED displays will essentially allow for any size or shape that an extremely rich client can dream up. The company didn’t really dive into specifics, but one section of the presentation showed a 136-inch 4K HDR MicroLED TV. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LlPAuTMYGaTjLiG1Ut0ufw6oI7c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23144471/LGmicro2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: LG&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;MicroLED displays can be customized to practically any size.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="z5NTLd"&gt;Not to be confused with Mini LED — an evolution of traditional LCD TVs — MicroLED is a true next-generation leap in display tech that preserves the best attributes of OLED without the downsides or organic part. Like OLED, it’s self-emissive. MicroLED uses micrometer-sized LED lights to eliminate the backlight and color filters used in conventional displays. Color reproduction and brightness are also best-in-class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="88zQhu"&gt;For 2022, Samsung is adding an 89-inch MicroLED TV to its product lineup and says the displays are now completely bezel-free. But as I said at the top, these things are too expensive for regular people to ever seriously consider. And I’m not talking about dropping $20,000 on some huge 8K TV. No. For reference, Samsung sold its 110-inch MicroLED TV for well north of $150,000. So the prices will need to come down significantly for MicroLED to come within reach for most consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ffIe3h"&gt;Competition can only help.&lt;/p&gt;
