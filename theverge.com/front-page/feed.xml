    <title>Amazon Music now has a Car Mode for easier use while driving</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mS3JRb_lbsFa3MCp1ouBRrcteVg=/0x84:3500x2417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69091451/CarMode_PR_Version1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aCEhoO"&gt;The Amazon Music mobile app &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?node=23430077011"&gt;is getting a new feature&lt;/a&gt; to make it a little bit easier to use while driving. Car Mode is a simplified version of Amazon Music’s interface, featuring larger buttons, suggested playlists and albums, and easy access to Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gubtBK"&gt;Once enabled, Car Mode is divided into two sections. The upper part near the top of your phone is devoted to playback controls like play, pause, and skip, while the bottom section features a collection of music suggestions which you can switch between with a swipe or a tap. If a hands-free experience sounds better (and it probably should if you’re trying to drive safely) you can trigger Alexa in the bottom right corner with a tap or by using an Alexa voice command (“Hey Alexa, play Elton John”).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oUdiA-wja3rql-3m2vaRWQjruyU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427718/AmazonMusic_CarMode.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CRkTSh"&gt;Car Mode doesn’t add any new functionality to Amazon Music, but its changes to the user interface could make it easier to switch songs or dive into a new playlist without having to take your attention away from the road. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/16/18185644/spotify-car-view-now-testing-android-simple-controls"&gt;Spotify’s own take on simplified car controls&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon Music can be set to switch to Car Mode as soon as it recognizes your phone connecting to your car’s Bluetooth. For anyone with an older car, Car Mode can also be enabled in settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wS3wW3"&gt;Amazon Music might not be as popular as Spotify or Apple Music — it’s on its way &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/22/21077187/amazon-music-service-55-million-customers-spotify-apple-music-prime-members"&gt;with over 55 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; as of January 2020 — but for a growing service that’s pretty easy to try if you’re already have an Amazon Prime subscription, any new feature has the possibility to help a lot of people. Car Mode is available in Amazon Music now on iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chipolo’s new One Spot Bluetooth tracker beats Apple’s AirTags to the punch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PIcKFONp23D8j1_YE8vMKmPyj4c=/7x0:1954x1298/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69091226/Apple_find_my_network_now_offers_new_third_party_finding_experiences_chipolo_040721_big_carousel.jpg.large_2x.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nbliHC"&gt;The first Bluetooth tracker that can work with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"&gt;Apple’s vast Find My Bluetooth network&lt;/a&gt; of iPhones, iPads, and Macs is here. But it’s not Apple’s long-anticipated AirTags tracker; it’s the &lt;a href="https://chipolo.net/en-us/pages/chipolo-one-spot"&gt;Chipolo One Spot&lt;/a&gt;, an updated version of the company’s One tracker that’s designed to exclusively work with Apple’s network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLu17x"&gt;Chipolo calls the One Spot a “special edition” product. While it has the same 12-month battery life (with replaceable battery), 120dB ring, water resistance, and overall design as the regular One tracker, the One Spot &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; works with Apple’s Find My network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="9Di4LZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Apple officially starts letting your iPhone help find lost third-party products","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="HscFen"&gt;That’s potentially an upgrade for anyone who already uses Apple products, given that a Bluetooth tracking tag is only as effective as the number of users who are on the same network. And while Chipolo has been around for a while, it’s still far smaller compared to more established players like Tile or the hundreds of millions of Apple devices around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bc0tl"&gt;The One Spot also features some Find My specific functionality, like a “&lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/use-lost-mode-mmfc0f0165/icloud"&gt;Lost Mode&lt;/a&gt;” that allows users to tag an item as missing — which will, in turn, notify other Find My users if it’s found with a short message and a phone number to help you get your stuff back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c5j34u"&gt;It’s a sort of bewildering product, given the context of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427380/apple-airtags-tile-competitor-production"&gt;Apple’s rumored AirTags tracker&lt;/a&gt; that’s potentially going to be released later in 2021, and it would similarly be a Find My-exclusive Bluetooth tag for keeping track of lost or missing items. Chipolo’s tracker lacks the rumored Ultra-WideBand radio support that Apple’s tag will reportedly feature for more precise tracking, but that aside, it’s hard to imagine what else Apple’s tag will bring to the table that’s not already available on the One Spot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XLoWGI"&gt;Preorders for the Chipolo One Spot will start in May, with shipping planned for the beginning of June. No price has been announced yet. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s first crack at a Clubhouse competitor is a new Q&amp;A platform called Hotline</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l1Q1yzgJNWkQS8Rg76fR8uh__2A=/11x0:1216x803/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69091193/Hotline_StoryHeader.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LhkRYg"&gt;Facebook’s experimental app development division, the NPE Team, has released a new Q&amp;amp;A platform that borrows concepts from buzzy, audio-only social network Clubhouse but with dashes of live-streaming thrown in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrncyZ"&gt;The platform is called Hotline, and it featured its &lt;a href="https://hotline.co/nick-huber-ama"&gt;first Q&amp;amp;A with investor Nick Huber&lt;/a&gt; earlier today, according to a &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/04/07/facebook-tests-hotline-a-qa-product-thats-a-mashup-of-clubhouse-and-instagram-live/"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. A website for the service is online now and allows sign-ins via Twitter, but it features only a waitlist and a tool for applying to host your own show. &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;says Facebook has created designs for mobile versions of the app, though those do not appear to be live at this moment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9qTxS"&gt;News of Facebook building its own version of Clubhouse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276645/facebook-clubhouse-social-audio-app-develop"&gt;first surfaced in February&lt;/a&gt;, though Hotline is said to be a different product than the ongoing Clubhouse competitor being built by the team behind the video chat platform Messenger Rooms, &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;reports. Twitter has been openly testing its Spaces alternative, too, putting more pressure on Clubhouse as whispers of a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-06/clubhouse-is-said-to-discuss-funding-at-about-4-billion-value"&gt;new funding round valuing the company at an eye-popping $4 billion valuation&lt;/a&gt; surfaced earlier this week. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aByTi5MopJNfcE7LjozN7wVTQds=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427545/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_1.03.41_PM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kUTr0N"&gt;Hotline works differently than Clubhouse and Spaces. It allows hosts to use video and to schedule more formal presentations with Q&amp;amp;A built in, rather than the more open-ended, audio-only conversations that take place on Clubhouse. Hotline also allows hosts to record their sessions in both audio and video formats, &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FTZhyh"&gt;The core Q&amp;amp;A component of Hotline involves the hosts fielding questions from the audience supplied via text, while audience members can then upvote which questions they want answered and then respond to the ongoing conversation with emoji reactions. Hosts can also bring individuals from the audience up onto the virtual stage to ask their question live and potentially engage in a longer conversation. In that way, Hotline events seem designed more like a cross between a radio show and a Twitch stream, where the audience is asked to weigh in here and there but control of the conversation remains firmly with the host. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c89qsF"&gt;The project is being led by Erik Hazzard, who joined Facebook when his app tbh, a platform for sending anonymous compliments to your friends, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/16/16485428/facebook-tbh-to-be-honest-acquisition-ios-app"&gt;acquired in 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/2/17528896/facebook-tbh-moves-hello-shut-down-low-usage"&gt;shut tbh down&lt;/a&gt;, despite Hazzard’s success attracting millions of users to the platform. But it sounds like his expertise in creating these new mobile experiences is now being put to good use at Facebook as part of the NPE Team, which in the past has released music-making apps like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174882/facebook-collab-app-store-release-date-price"&gt;Collab&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22303604/facebook-rap-app-bars-experiment"&gt;Bars&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="KkmSX4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Clubhouse defined a format — now it has to defend it","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22362980/clubhouse-social-audio-facebook-twitter-android"},{"title":"Clubhouse’s new direct payments let you toss a coin to creators, and they get 100 percent","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/5/22368929/clubhouse-direct-payments-creators-stripe"},{"title":"Clubhouse announces accelerator program for creators on its platform","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/14/22330281/clubhouse-accelerator-creators-davison-app"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>You can now play every classic Halo on Xbox with a mouse and keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bcS1qO22j6FZ5NpU9KWWK9NXLLc=/0x0:1917x1278/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69090966/halo_mcc_update.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hJJp18"&gt;Today, you can fire up an Xbox game console and play &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; with a mouse and keyboard. It’s hard to believe I’m writing those words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yT8wDK"&gt;Five years ago, I asked a small room of first-party Xbox devs how they felt about supporting mouse and keyboard (now that their boss Phil Spencer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxP3/status/623516307137269760"&gt;had confirmed they were on the way&lt;/a&gt;), but they were seriously skeptical. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18095086/xbox-one-keyboard-mouse-support-november-update-release"&gt;It took two more years&lt;/a&gt; for the Xbox One to get even a handful of keyboard and mouse titles in a November 2018 update. Even though games &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20873038/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-cross-play-beta-how-it-works-ps4-xbox-one-pc"&gt;like &lt;em&gt;COD: Warzone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280358/fortnite-aim-assist-sypherpk-tfue-shooters-epic-games-fairness"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; have paved the way for controller parity, the industry is still understandably wary about mixing console and keyboard players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2q9OS"&gt;But now, keyboard and mouse is a native part of &lt;em&gt;Halo: The Master Chief Collection &lt;/em&gt;(including &lt;em&gt;Halo CE, Halo 2, Halo 3, Halo 3: ODST, Halo: Reach,&lt;/em&gt; and&lt;em&gt; Halo 4&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;a href="https://support.halowaypoint.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059503311"&gt;as of a new April 2021 patch&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s not alone: every Xbox that can play the game will let you adjust your field of view, crosshairs, and bind controls across multiple inputs, like any good competitive PC-grade shooter should. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wkvmJb09LYPnoAYlrXSp7Z3Zvn8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427494/chrome_ov27dewket.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="glu1nG"&gt;Not only does that mean parity with PC, but it might actually make the Xbox version of &lt;em&gt;Halo: MCC &lt;/em&gt;preferable for some. As my colleague Tom Warren points out, it’s easier to avoid cheaters in console games:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gw2HfB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;seeing mouse and keyboard support in Halo on Xbox makes me wish Destiny 2 had this. I’d switch immediately from PC, which is full of hackers, aimbots, and other exploits that ruin the PvP experience&lt;/p&gt;— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1379852440263143424?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vQ2iAt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.halowaypoint.com/hc/en-us/articles/360059503311"&gt;The full patch notes&lt;/a&gt; also mention new accessibility options, a new “Escalation Slayer” game variant, a new map for &lt;em&gt;Halo 3&lt;/em&gt;, and you can easily set your in-game chat and audio devices separately now on PC. And of course, there’s a new season of content dubbed “Raven.” &lt;a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/mcc-season-6-raven-has-landed"&gt;More info on that here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Wbr4fA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ImP5qjZQKNM?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d3siwE"&gt;Me, I’ve played &lt;em&gt;Halo&lt;/em&gt; with a mouse and keyboard almost since the beginning. The first copy I owned &lt;a href="https://www.gearboxsoftware.com/press_release/halo-pc-goes-gold/"&gt;was the Gearbox port for PC&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been a longtime favorite at LAN parties. Ah, do I miss LAN parties.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell’s speckled G15 brings high-end AMD Ryzen processors to value-minded gamers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dell G15 Ryzen Edition" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IlncbVhgpTl5ELQw8owsn-rw1cs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088327/g15lineup.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Budget-friendly gaming laptops are looking better than ever&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WfNhlU"&gt;Alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22131848"&gt;Alienware M15 R5 Ryzen Edition&lt;/a&gt;, Dell is also launching a more affordable 15-inch Dell G15 Ryzen Edition gaming laptop. It’s for people who still want to experience AMD’s fast Ryzen 5000 H-series processors, along with an Nvidia RTX 3060 graphics chip, but for less. If the M15 R5’s $1,793.98 starting price is too high, the G15’s $899.99 entry-level configuration might be a more reasonable price point for you to jump in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f1czH6"&gt;The G15’s speckled design might look familiar to you. That’s because Dell actually launched the Intel-based version of this model already, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22319292/dell-g15-gaming-laptop-2021-announced-china-paint-speckles-specs"&gt;but in China first&lt;/a&gt;. This new Ryzen-based laptop is landing first in China as well, on April 30th, followed by a May 4th release elsewhere around the globe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Dw7cHg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s an Intel version, too, but it’s running last-gen chips&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FRKvJz"&gt;The starting configuration of the G15 Ryzen Edition will be fairly barebones in terms of RAM and storage, shipping with 8GB of 3,200MHz DDR4 RAM, and 256GB of NVMe M.2 capacity. It packs plenty of power otherwise for a $900 laptop, with a Ryzen 5 5600H hexa-core processor and an Nvidia RTX 3060 with 6GB of VRAM. In case you want something more powerful, the CPU be tweaked up to the Ryzen 7 5800H octa-core CPU, RAM can be added (either through Dell or by opening the laptop yourself), and you can configure it with up to 2TB of solid-state storage. The more powerful processor can also come with a bigger six-cell 86Wh battery, though you’ll get a three-cell 56Wh pack at the $900 mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJfDip"&gt;At launch, the G15 can also be configured with a 120Hz refresh rate FHD panel at a fairly standard 250 nits of brightness, or a brighter 300-nit screen with a faster 165Hz refresh rate. Dell says a 360Hz refresh rate screen will be available later in the spring. Dell says the new G15 has adopted an “Alienware-inspired” thermal design to keep it running efficiently, and it certainly looks the part. It’ll come in at least two speckled colors at launch, a green and a grey. Later this year, an all-black model will be available.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Dell G15" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eDa_LwrJ4rKWAvkVlxxAn-aydXM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22422232/g15ryzenlede.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The G15 takes some cues from Alienware’s M15 series of much pricier gaming laptops.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="dbdemy"&gt;This laptop ships by default with non-backlit, spill-resistant keyboard, but there are some upgrades you can make here. The first step up adds orange backlighting beneath the entire keyboard and emphasizes WASD. If orange doesn’t do it for you, there’s a four-zone RGB backlit keyboard that you can customize for a more colorful presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wb4zdQ"&gt;If the Ryzen Edition G15 is anything like last year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328344/dell-g5-15-se-review-2020-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen"&gt;G5 15 SE&lt;/a&gt; in terms of performance, I’m excited to test it out. Assuming that it does, even the lower-end model should be reasonably powerful for people trying to stretch their dollar as far as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAhgPX"&gt;If you really want the Intel version, Dell says a variant of it will launch in the US on April 13th for $799.99, but it’ll feature a last-gen 10th Gen Intel processor. Dell included this bit of information practically as a footnote, to give you an idea of how much emphasis it’s putting behind Ryzen this time around. The starting model features a Core i5-10200H quad-core CPU with Nvidia’s GeForce GTX 1650 graphics chip. Upgrading can net you the vastly more powerful Core i7-10870H octa-core CPU with the RTX 3060, and you can get Thunderbolt ports. Dell didn’t share the price for the high-end Intel model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Znvuns"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Alienware lowered the starting price of its M15 R5 from $2,229.99 to $1,793.98, so I changed the price mentioned in the opening paragraph to reflect this update.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alienware’s M15 R5 is its first AMD-based gaming laptop in over a decade</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-UH-XwL5q9IIRfdfYs7u7uamLjY=/0x0:2160x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69088309/alienwarem15r5lede.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RcZ5Tu"&gt;Alienware has announced the latest revision to its flagship gaming laptop lineup, the 15-inch Alienware M15 R5. It’ll start shipping on April 20th in the US, costing $1,793.98 to start. The company is going big with its messaging that it’ll host AMD’s fast Ryzen 5000 H-series processors (up to the octa-core Ryzen 9 5900HX) and up to Nvidia’s RTX 3070 graphics chip. Dell says this is the first Alienware laptop since 2007 to feature an AMD processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GG4Xam"&gt;In case you haven’t noticed, AMD’s processors have been on a tear in the past year, delivering great performance without compromising on efficiency when you aren’t gaming. This is just the latest company to join along the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321471/asus-rog-zephyrus-g15-gaming-laptop-review"&gt;Asus&lt;/a&gt;, Lenovo, and even Dell with its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328344/dell-g5-15-se-review-2020-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen"&gt;G5 15 SE&lt;/a&gt;, to name a few. AMD-touting laptops are already among some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;best gaming laptops you can buy&lt;/a&gt;. Yet Alienware is possibly the most well-known gaming brand to go AMD yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="q0sGxs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Big boost clocks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SV1J9c"&gt;The base configuration of the M15 R5 has the octa-core Ryzen 7 5800H processor and Nvidia’s RTX 3060. You can upgrade to the Ryzen 9 5900HX octa-core processor and the RTX 3070. Both the RTX 3060 and 3070 have a total graphics power level of 115W with 10W of extra boost available for up to 125W of maximum graphics power. Interestingly, the 3060 has a higher base and boost clock (base: 1,387MHz, boost: 1,702MHz) than the 3070 option does (base: 1,110MHz, boost: 1,560MHz). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1JWLj"&gt;Either way, these are some of the highest clock speeds we’ve seen yet in a reasonably thin 2021 gaming laptop. Alienware is pushing the boost clocks nearly all the way to the ceiling, and it’s great that it’s transparent about these power specs, since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;Nvidia now requires that manufacturers share it&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R5" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dfMrwvr3yTE2o6ne4aOc9aiYSo8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425146/m15r5tilt.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ryzen Edition will ship in this silver configuration.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vycfFh"&gt;Speaking of dimensions, the R5 is thicker and heavier than the previous R4 generation. The base configuration weighs 5.34 pounds (up to 5.93 pounds, depending on the components inside). The R4’s base configuration weighed 4.65 pounds, for comparison. The R5 is 19.25mm thick at its front (up to 22.85mm thick near the hinge), 272.5mm deep, and 356mm wide. Each configuration will ship with an 86Wh battery, like what shipped in the M15 R4 and R3.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPCP0y"&gt;Screen-wise, the R5 can be configured with a range of high-refresh-rate displays. The base FHD screen has a 3ms response time screen with a 165Hz refresh rate, and your options for upgrading are either a dimmer 300-nit 1080p panel with a faster 360Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and only 100 percent sRGB color coverage, or a brighter 400-nit QHD screen that has a 240Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, 100 percent DCI-P3 color gamut, plus G-Sync, which should deliver the smoothest experience even if your framerate dips. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Alienware M15 R5" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u8ZNx3elRaRztqbZyTWPlgJOUXg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22421558/m15r5inpost.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The M15 R5 looks similar to the previous two generations.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6X0UV"&gt;If you want to output to a separate display, the laptop’s HDMI 2.1 port means it can display up to 120 frames per second at 4K resolution if your monitor (or TV) supports it. This laptop also features an 2.5Gbps Ethernet port, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 ports, one USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, one USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 port, and a headphone jack. There’s no Thunderbolt port, but that Intel technology might find its way into an Intel-based version later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KIr2w0"&gt;Dell says this is the first Alienware laptop to feature fast 3,200MHz DDR4 RAM, and it’s also user-configurable with two SO-DIMM slots. This is a move in the right direction, as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21459895/alienware-m15-r3-gaming-laptop-review-intel-rtx-nvidia-15-inch"&gt;M15 R3&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://hothardware.com/reviews/alienware-m15-r4-review"&gt;R4&lt;/a&gt; both had their RAM soldered onto the board, making it impossible to upgrade after you bought it. There are two M.2 slots inside so you can upgrade storage post-purchase, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oic6c0"&gt;The company says the laptop’s paint has been engineered for “increased stain-resistance and premium surface feel.” This model can be configured to feature Cherry’s Ultra-Low Profile mechanical switches. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22333684/alienware-m15-m17-gaming-laptops-cherry-mx-ultra-low-mechanical-keyboard-switches-price"&gt;Dell announced this keyboard collaboration for the M15 R4&lt;/a&gt;, and it’ll be available as a $150 add-on for this new model, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwEDy5"&gt;If you’re looking for a more budget-friendly gaming laptop with a new Ryzen 5000 H-series processor, check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22132051"&gt;Dell’s $899 G15 that was also just announced&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xB8ree"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Following the announcement, Alienware changed the starting price of the M15 R5 to $1,793.98, down from $2,229.99. A spokesperson confirmed that there’s no difference in terms of specs with the starting model, the price was simply reduced.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s new AR toy fulfills the childhood dream of digging a hole to the other side of the Earth</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H9OOrkiNb6fyGZc9q6romuVW8pc=/0x193:1748x1358/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69090916/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_11.15.28_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CWU5oY"&gt;If you’ve ever wondered where you’d end up if you were to transport directly to the other side of the Earth, Google now has a browser-based AR toy that lets you find out. &lt;a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/floom"&gt;It calls the site Floom&lt;/a&gt;, and the experience is pretty simple: you point your phone’s camera at the ground, tap the little tornado object, and it will show you a hole to the other side of the Earth. Then you can open that location in Google Earth to take a look around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GeUpqr"&gt;Testing it out was kind of a joy, and I have discovered that, depending on where I am in my house (and how I have my phone angled), I'm directly above either the Middle East, New Zealand, or the Antarctic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="K5BNWM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Explore the world with Floom, a new experiment that lets you create AR tunnels to get to the other side of the planet ➝ &lt;a href="https://t.co/QDn3ktteJF"&gt;https://t.co/QDn3ktteJF&lt;/a&gt;    &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WebXR?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WebXR&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/HDCmdy31Sx"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HDCmdy31Sx&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Google (@Google) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Google/status/1379843482118930432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dQBVejDTPyIWZpJZqWi9gC_Yldc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427399/Screenshot_20210407_110450.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh, awkward.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3rfepy"&gt;Floom is just one of the experiments that &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/google-ar-vr/webxr-experiments/"&gt;Google announced yesterday&lt;/a&gt; that rely on WebXR, which can &lt;a href="https://immersiveweb.dev"&gt;create AR or VR experiences that work in webpages&lt;/a&gt;. The others include &lt;a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/measureup"&gt;a virtual measuring tool&lt;/a&gt; and a tool that lets you &lt;a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/sodar"&gt;visualize what six-foot social distancing looks like in your current environment&lt;/a&gt;. Google also has an upcoming app that will let you turn your photos library into an AR gallery. At the moment, Floom can only be used with Chrome on Android devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7CBzUn"&gt;These WebXR experiments are the first experience I’ve had with the tech, and it’s reasonably impressive for something that’s running in a phone’s web browser. Google’s experiments have always been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2020/12/15/22176785/google-blob-opera-machine-learning-singing-christmas-carols"&gt;interesting&lt;/a&gt;, but this is the first one that lets me fulfill a childhood dream: digging a tunnel to the other side of the globe. Now all Google needs to add is a visualization that makes it seem like you’re flying through the Earth’s core.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Best Buy’s new Beta program promises concierge tech support for $200 a year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Buy 86th street new york (STOCK)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fkGrQbKpU5Wso2jY3Jw19FMhOds=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69090832/best-buy-logo-stock1_2040.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PYg7mt"&gt;Best Buy is &lt;a href="https://corporate.bestbuy.com/best-buy-piloting-paid-membership-program-in-select-markets/"&gt;piloting a new paid membership service&lt;/a&gt; that would provide exclusive perks, including concierge-style tech support and exclusive pricing. The subscription service, which will cost $200 a year or $180 if you have a Best Buy credit card, bears similarities with Amazon’s Prime subscription as Best Buy looks to expand its services outside the sale of consumer tech products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NSerTM"&gt;The new membership, called &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/633495/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fdni%2Fbest-buy-membership%2Fpcmcat1607119147723.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1607119147723&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy Beta&lt;/a&gt;, grants members access to a slew of benefits, including free standard shipping, unlimited Geek Squad technical support, exclusive member pricing, and a 60-day extended return window. Best Buy confirmed that Beta members will also have 24/7 access to a concierge team, which they can contact by phone, email, chat, or through the Best Buy mobile app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2SbxKGStBpleTLD9SbsH0CkoSjU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22427348/BestBuyBeta_FINAL_scaled.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Best Buy&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here are a few perks included with the Best Buy membership program. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="otWRHQ"&gt;Best Buy already has a $200 membership program called &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/633495/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fservices%2Ftotal-tech-support%2Fpcmcat1494357892646.c%3Fid%3Dpcmcat1494357892646&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Total Tech Support&lt;/a&gt; that provides similar services, but it will be unavailable in the pilot markets. In fact, based on how similar both services are, there’s a possibility that Best Buy will discontinue Total Tech Support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WynMIs"&gt;Best Buy is not the first retail giant to roll out a service to compete with Amazon Prime. Last September, Walmart released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21409944/walmart-free-delivery-subscription-service-walmart-compete-amazon-prime"&gt;its own subscription service&lt;/a&gt; for $98 a year, offering minimal benefits such as free delivery on orders over $35 and fuel discounts at select gas stations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TRHzi6"&gt;Best Buy is piloting the new Beta membership in three states: Iowa, Pennsylvania, and Oklahoma, but the retailer says it plans to expand the annual subscription to select stores in Minnesota, North Carolina, and Tennessee sometime this month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix brings parental guilt to the world of superheroes with the first Jupiter’s Legacy trailer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PsCPunXg9BWHtWekkI5IBh2o7_Y=/315x0:1052x491/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69090401/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_9.24.13_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KwShBS"&gt;Netflix just showed off the first fruits of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/17/17581978/netflix-nx-social-media-sci-fi-fantasy-mark-millar"&gt;its deal&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;em&gt;Wanted&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Kick-Ass&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; a&lt;/em&gt;nd &lt;em&gt;Kingsman: The Secret Service &lt;/em&gt;co&lt;em&gt;-&lt;/em&gt;creator Mark Millar. &lt;em&gt;Jupiter’s Legacy&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NXOnNetflix/status/1379781007272906752?s=20"&gt;a new live-action TV series&lt;/a&gt; based on Millar’s comics of the same name, which seems to be setting up an intergenerational conflict between a team of superheroes and their potentially less heroic children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuREUu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jupiter’s Legacy&lt;/em&gt; is an original concept from Millar, but it does seem to be playing on some classic superhero imagery. (Note Josh Duhamel’s The Utopian pulling a tractor by hand in what could only be described as a classic Superman move.) The main thrust, though, is the tension between an older generation’s pulpier idea of superheroics and a younger generation who might be more interested in the fame that comes along with it. In Netflix’s words:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OzOcmW"&gt;They’re the first generation of superheroes. But as they pass the torch to their children, tensions are rising — and the old rules no longer apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="GcvmwU"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TY3IAqm-gpE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X3Ulsa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jupiter’s Legacy&lt;/em&gt; is just the first of several planned Netflix projects from Millar, the result of the streamer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/7/16106574/netflix-comic-book-publisher-millarworld-first-acquisition-kick-ass-kingsman"&gt;purchasing his publishing house Millarworld &lt;/a&gt;in 2017. Along with &lt;em&gt;Jupiter’s Legacy&lt;/em&gt;, Netflix also plans to debut other Millar originals covering everything from &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BlVq-33DgPm/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"&gt;space bounty hunters to Spanish-language telenovelas&lt;/a&gt;. With this Millar series, Netflix seems poised to carry on the recent trend of &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/22364450/superdads-the-boys-invincible-superman-and-lois"&gt;daddy issues in superhero stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Iwm9bB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jupiter’s Legacy &lt;/em&gt;is set to premiere on May 7th, 2021.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="yRZzjR"&gt;Humble Bundle has launched its latest bundle of games that collects proceeds and sends them to a charity of your choosing. &lt;a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/spring-into-vr-bundle?partner=VoxMedia"&gt;This one’s full of nothing but VR titles&lt;/a&gt;, and the minimum contribution required to get everything in the bundle is just $15. Of course, since it’s for charity, spend more if you feel compelled to. The bundle contains the following games, all of which are redeemable on Steam:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qVyD9y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Borderlands 2 VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="exIXJx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Job Simulator&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="O4DlSk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sairento VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="IrOCET"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Bridge Crew&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="s1MEuE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Surgeon Simulator: Experience Reality&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QpvZ4N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Swords of Gurrah&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="APjjZg"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Espire VR&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VoNmmA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Detached&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="hsNtVD"&gt;These games will work on wired headsets that support Steam VR, which includes the Valve Index, Oculus Rift S, HTC’s Vive, and more. There’s an easy way to get these games running if you have a wireless Oculus Quest or Quest 2 headset. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218827/oculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to"&gt;Just follow our guide on how you can play PC VR games&lt;/a&gt; like the ones above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMDVui"&gt;This bundle will be available until Wednesday, April 21st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1m2fj7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 2:20PM ET April 7th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Humble Bundle doesn’t include the game Arizona Sunshine in the offer, as it originally suggested it would, so I removed it from the post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
