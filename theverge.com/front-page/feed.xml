    <title>Univision enters the streaming race with PrendeTV, a free, ad-supported Spanish platform</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="View of the Univision Building in Los An" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/knVITThfkJZoajpSmbmy2MjD5_Q=/0x0:3504x2336/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656898/71309339.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QR7ySe"&gt;Created “exclusively for the U.S. Hispanic audience,” PrendeTV is Univision’s entry into the streaming wars, offering a collection of free Spanish programming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8Mzwm"&gt;PrendeTV, which gets its name for the Spanish phrase for “switch on,” will launch this quarter, &lt;a href="https://corporate.univision.com/blog/2021/01/12/univision-announces-prendetv-1st-premium-free-ad-supported-streaming-service-built-exclusively-for-u-s-hispanics/"&gt;according to Univision&lt;/a&gt;. The service will have “an unprecedented collection of high-quality, curated Spanish-language series [and] movies,” as well as some other entertainment. PrendeTV will also offer 30 live channels and more than 10,000 hours of on-demand content at launch, according to the company, with the goal to expand that offering once launched. It will be available on desktop and mobile, as well as a free app on connected TVs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlBlfD"&gt;Univision’s biggest competitor in the Spanish marketplace for US customers, Telemundo, does not have its own streaming service. Owned by NBCUniversal, Telemundo instead has a hub and several “channels” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22216867/peacock-office-subscription-streaming-ad-free-premium-plus-netflix"&gt;on Peacock&lt;/a&gt;, NBCUniversal’s own ad-supported streaming platform. Univision CEO Wade Davis, who previously worked on ad-supported streaming strategy at ViacomCBS, told &lt;em&gt;Deadline &lt;/em&gt;in 2020 that “it’s remarkable” there’s not really a “high-quality, differentiated OTT service for this audience that is at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fiSm0H"&gt;“It’s a huge opportunity that is completely open from a competitive standpoint,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="752NaA"&gt;Although Univision is entering an already crowded market, with services like Disney Plus, HBO Max, Peacock, Apple TV Plus, and more launching all within the last 14 months, Univision is banking on PrendeTV being “the only premium, free ad-supported streaming service designed and curated exclusively for U.S. Hispanics.” The fact that it’s free, something that ViacomCBS is also reportedly seeing success with on its own ad-supported platform, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/22/6054639/the-genius-of-pluto-tv"&gt;Pluto TV&lt;/a&gt;, should also help. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxeiVd"&gt;Exact launch dates, new exclusive series, and what platforms it will be available on will be announced closer to launch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JAwA1f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus has a 32-inch 4K gaming monitor with HDMI 2.1 shipping later this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Swift PG32UQ" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pkY_gvaUWofSeGTO_8wF_Qao5bs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656715/asusswifthero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ROG Swift PG32UQ will be a G-Sync-compatible gaming monitor&lt;/em&gt; | Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="53bQpD"&gt;Asus is gearing up to release its first gaming monitor to support HDMI 2.1, which boasts enough bandwidth to display up to 4K resolution at 120 frames per second when connected to a compatible Windows PC, Xbox Series X, or PS5. The ROG Swift PG32UQ is, according to Asus, the world’s first 32-inch HDMI 2.1 gaming monitor, and both of its HDMI ports support the latest standard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0YZpl"&gt;Connecting via DisplayPort 1.4 allows this monitor to display 4K at a 144Hz refresh rate on PC if you have components capable enough to soar that high. For this feature, Asus credits a technology called Display Stream Compression (DSC) that compresses UHD streams without a perceptible drop in visual quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRcvFb"&gt;Like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22216979/acer-gaming-monitors-nitro-predator-xv28-xb27-xb32-ces-2021-may-price-specs-hdmi-21"&gt;Acer Nitro XV28 announced last week&lt;/a&gt;, the ROG Swift PG32UQ won’t ship until sometime in Q2 2021. Asus hasn’t shared a price for this model, but don’t expect anything under $899 — that’s Acer’s price for the smaller 28-inch Nitro XV28. Both have a 4K 144Hz IPS panel with a 1ms response time, but the Asus device might end up being the preferred choice among PC gamers since it has a bigger screen with Nvidia G-Sync compatibility. (The XV28 has FreeSync Premium.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yCDP2S"&gt;Asus says the Swift is currently undergoing the certification process, but at launch, it should be compatible with Nvidia’s variable refresh rate mode to eliminate screen tearing and artifacts. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Asus ROG Swift PG32UQ" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2cMEdh92V2Zt7-esxM6vhX6b8pE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22230184/asusswiftrear.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A rear view of the PG32UQ.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CfM6Qx"&gt;The ROG Swift PG32UQ supports HDR 600, allowing it to reach 600 cd/m2 peak brightness. That’s a bit brighter than the aforementioned Acer Nitro but still comparatively dim next to many other HDR-ready displays. The display is factory-calibrated for color accuracy, with full coverage of the sRGB gamut and 98 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Asus ROG’s 2021 lineup includes its first convertible gaming laptop (ish)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The ROG Flow X13 facing the camera, angled slightly to the right in front of a white background. The screen displays the ROG logo." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5rspNsA9m39ZkYDVm7WFT15RlOw=/0x834:5000x4167/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656695/07_GV301_V5_Lighting.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That’s right — this is for gaming.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Asus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="n6bnxR"&gt;Asus Republic of Gamers (ROG) has unveiled its varied, eclectic, and very cool-looking lineup of new gaming laptops for 2021. The highlight, and the product I’m both very excited and very confused about, is the ROG Flow X13. It’s the company’s first 2-in-1 convertible gaming laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJNyZx"&gt;That’s right — a 2-in-1 gaming laptop. You don’t see that every day. What’s more, as you may have deduced from the name, the X13 is a &lt;em&gt;13-inch&lt;/em&gt; convertible gaming laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSqbdK"&gt;As you can probably see from the above picture, the X13 doesn’t look like your typical gaming rig. It’s the type of thing I wouldn’t be surprised to see someone whip out in a class or a meeting. Portability is a theme here: Asus says you’ll get up to 10 hours of video playback on a charge and that the 100-watt USB-C charger delivers 50 percent in 30 minutes. You can choose between a 120Hz FHD touch display or a 3840 x 2400 touch display. Either way, you get a 16:10 aspect ratio with extra vertical space for multitasking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJCk6f"&gt;All of that sounds nice enough, but the insides are where things get confusing. The Flow X13 includes up to AMD’s Ryzen 9 5980HS, one of the flagships in its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;Ryzen 5000 mobile series&lt;/a&gt;. That makes sense for a gaming laptop. You’d think that should be paired with a pretty powerful GPU — but instead, Asus went with the entry-level GeForce GTX 1650, which just feels like a waste of the 5980HS’s power. Similar combinations have been tried before: take a look at &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;writer Cameron Faulkner’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21295596/lenovo-ideapad-gaming-3-review-laptop-budget-friendly-intel-10th-gen-nvidia-geforce-gtx"&gt;review of Lenovo’s IdeaPad Gaming 3&lt;/a&gt;, which also attempted to pair the GTX 1650 with an H-series processor to disappointing results. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QbSRs0"&gt;Now, for a regular work laptop that might occasionally be used to edit some photos, that combination makes a lot of sense. But if you’re purchasing the X13 expecting incredible frame rates, you may end up disappointed. (Of course, I’ll need to run games on the thing myself before making a recommendation either way.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjdgFl"&gt;The way Asus is trying to get around this is it’s bundling the Flow X13 with an external GPU called the ROG XG Mobile. This can include up to Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 graphics, and Asus says it’ll deliver desktop gaming performance to the X13. It acts as a power adapter as well. Fair enough. But with the bundle of the X13 and the XG Mobile, you’re looking at a price of $2,999.99. Yeesh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NpQ3Bf"&gt;You can preorder the Flow X13 and XG Mobile now at the &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202101AM120000009"&gt;Asus store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f6VmzOReRiST9REu3gZYLlQLcGc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22230738/06_GC31.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have to admit it looks very cool.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zB8zBT"&gt;Another headliner (which is perhaps a bit more practical) is the ROG Zephyrus Duo 15 SE. This is a refresh to the ROG Zephyrus Duo 15, which has two screens — the regular one (a 15.6-inch, 4K, 120Hz panel or a 300Hz FHD panel) and the ScreenPad Plus (a 14.1-inch touch display that’s built into the top half of the keyboard deck — choose 3840 x 1100 or 1920 x 550 resolution). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s9OK8d"&gt;The form factor means that, in theory, you could run a game on the top screen with a Spotify playlist or Discord chat on the bottom screen, though my experience with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21431381/asus-rog-zephyrus-duo-15-review"&gt;previous Zephyrus Duo 15&lt;/a&gt; is that your mileage on that varies by game. Perhaps more promising is that Asus says it’s working with game developers and companies like Adobe to customize content for the dual-screen setup. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus Zephyrus Duo 15 SE angled to the left. The primary screen displays the ROG logo. The ScreenPad Plus displays Asus’s home screen. The RGB keyboard is illuminated. The touchpad displays an LED numpad." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nr-58heZgCEsCwNf09btnnrfC2Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22230743/GX551_C04_v10_ok.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look at that beauty. The touchpad even becomes a numpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2S56wA"&gt;The main update is that the new Duo 15 comes with up to an eight-core AMD Ryzen 9 5900HX and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3080 GPU. There’s a new “Arc Flow” fan design, which Asus says can help dissipate “up to 165W of combined processor power.” You’ll also get up to 2TB of storage and up to 32GB of combined onboard and SO-DIMM memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="He373V"&gt;You can preorder the Zephyrus Duo 15 SE now at the &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202101AM090000010"&gt;Asus store&lt;/a&gt; for $2,899.99. (Yes, it’s cheaper than the Flow X13 bundle.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBkFRh"&gt;Finally, there are two big additions to the esports side: the Strix Scar 15 and Strix Scar 17. Both models have an optical-mechanical keyboard, the first one ever to appear on a Scar model. They’ve also gotten a higher screen-to-body ratio (up to 85 percent), a bigger battery, an updated cooling system, support for Type-C charging, and quad speakers with Dolby Atmos technology. The Scar 17 now offers a 360Hz panel option, the fastest display you can get on a laptop. And both models include the new Ryzen and Nvidia chips, up to a Ryzen 9 5900HX and a GeForce RTX 3080.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Asus ROG Strix Scar 17 seen from above with the RGB keybaord illuminated. The screen displays the ROG logo on a purple background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GI9IXLlNlolpr3NzsWZzTOgIfX0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22230746/01_Scar_17_L.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Asus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Check that per-key RGB lighting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lVSE8h"&gt;The Strix Scar 15 and Strix Scar 17 are coming to North America in Q1 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmNhKu"&gt;Asus also announced the Strix G15 and Strix 17, lower-key Strix models for gamers who aren’t serious esports players. These can also come with a Ryzen 9 5900HX processor but max out at a GeForce RTX 3070 and a 300Hz screen. The G15 is coming to North America in Q1 2021; the G17 is up for preorder now for &lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202101AM090000007"&gt;$1,799.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJv9SN"&gt;These models join a big wave of gaming laptops that have been announced today, following AMD’s launch of its Ryzen 5000 processors and Nvidia’s release of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226544/nvidia-rtx-3080-laptops-gpus-ces-2021"&gt;RTX 3000 GPUs&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22215119/razer-blade-15-17-laptops-screens-graphics-gaming-price-release-date"&gt;Razer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22224929/gigabyte-gaming-laptops-a5-a7-g5-announced-ces-2021"&gt;Gigabyte&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227004/acer-predator-triton-300-se-ultralight-gaming-laptop-intel-nvidia-rtx-ces-2021"&gt;Acer&lt;/a&gt;, and more have unveiled new models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfqvoa"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0n1i5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Anker unveils $129 Soundcore Liberty Air 2 Pro wireless earbuds with ANC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3siE4PBSh7bwlkj9Q5Ik8B9eaLk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656406/anker.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fdl75M"&gt;The Soundcore Liberty Air 2 earbuds are one of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575716/best-cheap-wireless-earbuds-budget"&gt;best options in the budget category&lt;/a&gt;, and now the Anker brand has returned with a more advanced model. The Liberty Air 2 Pro buds are focused on sound quality and active noise cancellation (ANC), and like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/8/3/17645534/best-wireless-earbuds-airpods-jabra-samsung-sony-anker/comment/483871881"&gt;the larger Liberty 2 Pro&lt;/a&gt; feature 11mm drivers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QKqGU5"&gt;The new model has improved ANC with modes designed to fit various situations — the transport mode blocks out lower frequencies, for example, while the indoor mode is better at reducing mid-range sounds like voices in an office. There’s also a transparency mode with two levels of ambient sound enhancement, and Anker is touting “premium call quality” thanks to six-mic noise reduction tech. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UzhApFZfD8xHhzhvSNKi5IW1Rms=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22229805/A3951_Liberty_Air_2_Pro__Four_Up_Earbud_Colors.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="cf3Ed8"&gt;Anker says the Liberty Air 2 Pro should get seven hours of battery life with ANC off, or six with it on. With the case fully charged, Anker is quoting 26 total hours of endurance with ANC off and 21 with it on, so you’re probably looking at getting three to four full recharges from the case depending on your usage. The case can be charged over USB-C or wirelessly with Qi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0oPuer"&gt;The Liberty Air 2 Pro will be available in four colors (black, white, blue, and pink) and will go on sale today for $129.99.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Call of Duty League’s second season will kick off in February</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="Call of Duty League - Launch Weekend" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l_PCguPnqS8_iijr68z15zWp1Fc=/0x11:4350x2911/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656446/1196414800.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Hannah Foslien/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nB44IQ"&gt;The second season of the &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; League will begin play next month. Today, Activision Blizzard announced that the CDL regular season for 2021 will kick off with an opening event from February 11th–14th, though the actual schedule and matchups have yet to be determined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HvZTGU"&gt;The league debuted last year with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/24/21078871/call-of-duty-league-opening-weekend-esports-activision-blizzard"&gt;an ambitious plan to blend city-based teams with esports&lt;/a&gt;, similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21279107/overwatch-league-may-melee-tournament-structure-blizzard"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League&lt;/a&gt;. However, due to the pandemic, the CDL — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21196237/esports-leagues-online-coronavirus-call-of-duty-overwatch-league-of-legends"&gt;along with most other competitive gaming leagues&lt;/a&gt; — was forced to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21177465/call-of-duty-league-cdl-overwatch-owl-online-games-esports-coronavirus"&gt;shift to an online format&lt;/a&gt;. The season culminated with a championship weekend in August where the Dallas Empire won &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21401584/call-of-duty-league-cdl-championship-throne"&gt;a literal throne&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KDPC19"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Call of Duty League’s championship team will win this ridiculous throne","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21401584/call-of-duty-league-cdl-championship-throne"},{"title":"Nadeshot on getting back into Call of Duty with the Los Angeles Thieves","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21552513/100-thieves-call-of-duty-league-cdl-la-nadeshot-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uyrlka"&gt;The 2021 season will introduce &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dkZ5tdr27aE"&gt;a few changes&lt;/a&gt;, including 4 vs. 4 gameplay and a shift to PC. There will also be a new team among the 12 CDL clubs: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21401584/call-of-duty-league-cdl-championship-throne"&gt;the Los Angeles Thieves&lt;/a&gt; will replace Optic Gaming Los Angeles. Like last year, all games will be broadcast exclusively on YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uzYP7s"&gt;While the season won’t start until next month, a preseason event will take place on January 23rd and 24th, where fans from the top three teams last year — Dallas, Atlanta, and Chicago — will be able to vote on who they play against.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber and Lyft drivers in California sue to overturn Prop 22 ballot measure</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-VOTE-IT-LIFESTYLE-TRANSPORT" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-keCH0tReWirV0Yc88h_L9HZLII=/0x1:4257x2839/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656411/1229135526.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YZIkMA"&gt;A group of Uber and Lyft drivers in California filed a lawsuit Tuesday in state supreme court to overturn a ballot measure that allows the companies to continue treating its workers like independent contractors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TdgKJv"&gt;The drivers claim that Prop 22, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21546037/prop-22-california-uber-lyft-ballot-measure-result"&gt;approved by California voters last November&lt;/a&gt;, violates the state’s constitution by “stripping” the state legislature’s ability to empower workers to organize, as well as by “illegally” excluding ride-hail drivers from the state workers’ compensation program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A064OL"&gt;“Every day, rideshare drivers like me struggle to make ends meet because companies like Uber and Lyft prioritize corporate profits over our wellbeing,” plaintiff Saori Okawa said in a statement. &lt;strong&gt;“&lt;/strong&gt;With Prop 22, they’re not just ignoring our health and safety — they’re discarding our state’s constitution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="i3otnM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“With Prop 22, they’re not just ignoring our health and safety — they’re discarding our state’s constitution”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cGlb9Q"&gt;The drivers challenging the constitutionality of Prop 22 are being supported by labor unions like SEIU and the California Labor Federation, which unsuccessfully opposed the measure in the run-up to the election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vAJF25"&gt;But ultimately labor was outspent and outmaneuvered by companies like Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551136/uber-prop-22-victory-national-q3-2020-earnings"&gt;which poured over $200 million&lt;/a&gt; into the “Yes on 22” campaign to exempt them from a California state law that would require them to treat their workers like employees. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549760/uber-lyft-prop-22-win-vote-app-message-notifications"&gt;The companies aggressively opposed the law&lt;/a&gt;, arguing it would eliminate driver flexibility, while also increasing consumer prices and wait times. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFJkZy"&gt;The law, AB5, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/19/21376009/uber-ceo-interivew-california-ab5-drivers-khosrowshahi"&gt;represented an existential crisis&lt;/a&gt; for the companies, none of which have ever turned a profit and which have pursued costly efforts to develop autonomous technology in the hopes of eventually replacing drivers and delivery workers entirely. In response, the companies proposed a ballot measure that would keep their workers as contractors, while also providing a modicum of added benefits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T7az5l"&gt;It’s unclear how successful drivers will be in overturning Prop 22. The measure was written in a way to withstand future challenges, including a provision that requires a seven-eighths majority of the state legislature for any modification, and ensuring that it will be all but impossible to invalidate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PJux0K"&gt;&lt;q&gt;drivers are trying to use this language to argue that Prop 22 was illegal from its inception&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yOYIW2"&gt;But drivers are trying to use this language to argue that Prop 22 was illegal from its inception. The plaintiffs note that California’s state constitution gives the legislature “unlimited” authority to provide for a worker’s compensation system, “so that authority cannot be limited by a statutory initiative.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2VuAB2"&gt;“We look forward to the court affirming that gig companies cannot strip workers of their fundamental right to bargain for better pay and working conditions — and that corporations alone should not dictate the laws in our state,” said Bob Schoonover, president of SEIU Local 721 and SEIU California State Council, in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eKtMXJ"&gt;There have been ballot measures successfully repealed in California in the past, but mostly through additional ballot measures. If the lawsuit fails, drivers’ and supportive unions’ only other recourse to overturn Prop 22 may be another ballot initiative.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8A30yc"&gt;Drivers are organizing car caravans in San Francisco and Los Angeles in support of the lawsuit against Prop 22. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD says RDNA 2 GPU-powered laptops will arrive in the first half of 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6R84GFIUFpr-Y358uIDRfSmESbk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656391/acastro_180529_1777_amd_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zY9Q4p"&gt;AMD says customers eager for a new gaming laptop should be able to buy the first RDNA 2 GPU-powered notebooks some time before July, the company revealed today during its CES 2021 press conference. RDNA 2 is AMD’s new graphics chip architecture and the foundation of the custom chipsets in Sony’s PlayStation 5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series S / X, and now it’s coming to laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7NUB1"&gt;The Radeon RX 6000 series of GPUs were the first to feature AMD’s new RDNA 2 architecture when they were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538010/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-specs-release-date-price-big-navi-gpu-graphics"&gt;unveiled in October of last year&lt;/a&gt;, but those were top-of-the-line desktop graphics cards designed to go head-to-head with Nvidia’s 3000 series line.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="whSNeb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;AMD is on track to launch the first notebooks with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/RDNA2?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#RDNA2&lt;/a&gt; in the first half of 2021, and you'll see mainstream RDNA 2 desktop graphics card designs in the first half of the year as well. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CES2021&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/EW2fBpSFDq"&gt;pic.twitter.com/EW2fBpSFDq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Radeon RX (@Radeon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Radeon/status/1349031886853693441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="F9AM8p"&gt;Today at CES, AMD CEO Lisa Su said the company is “on track to launch the first notebooks with RDNA 2 in the first half of the year with our partners,” adding that “you’ll also see new mainstream RDNA 2 desktop graphic card designs in the first half of the year as well.” To showcase the performance of its mobile GPUs, Su showed off &lt;em&gt;Dirt 5&lt;/em&gt; running at 1440p at 60 frames per second. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3lIDH"&gt;That said, AMD is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22217206/nvidia-amd-gpu-trump-tax-china-tariff-exemption-expire"&gt;suffering from the same severe supply shortages&lt;/a&gt; Nvidia is right now, meaning it may be quite hard to get your hands on any of the new desktop designs if AMD does indeed hit that July deadline to deliver them. Although, perhaps laptops with those new mobile GPUs will be easier to get your hands by then if the desktop GPU shortage persists. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s 2021 Blade laptops are getting QHD screens and Nvidia’s RTX 3000-series graphics</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DOgrcze4ZOk_G1N2VvDiBZrPGFo=/1x0:3652x2434/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656280/blade15hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A top-down view of the 2021 Razer Blade 15 Advanced&lt;/em&gt; | Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sc3q0E"&gt;Razer is bringing a heap of spec improvements to its 2021 lineup of Blade 15 and Pro 17 gaming laptops. The fit and finish of both models are largely the same as before — they are still ahead of the competition in terms of design — though I’m going to assume that they’re still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"&gt;total fingerprint magnets&lt;/a&gt;. However, the switch that I’m most excited about is that QHD screens are finally happening. You’ll be able to get a 1440p QHD display with a fast refresh rate and with Nvidia’s G-Sync variable refresh rate tech built in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpUWtr"&gt;Until recently, 1080p and 4K were the only options for displays on gaming laptops, despite 1440p being an increasingly popular choice among PC gamers looking for a new standalone monitor. This is the year that Razer and other manufacturers will make it an option — and it won’t cost you dearly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gJC5ol"&gt;&lt;q&gt;QHD screens, new RTX graphics, and dual storage are the big takeaways&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PDbhtu"&gt;The higher-end Blade laptops will be equipped with Nvidia’s new RTX 3000-series graphics chips, and so should have an easy time running most games on a 1440p high refresh rate display. The Blade 15 Advanced (Razer’s name for the more powerful variant) with the RTX 3070 and a QHD screen with G-Sync will cost $2,499. You’ll be able to customize this model with up to a special variant of the RTX 3080 that has a whopping 16GB of VRAM. The bigger Blade Pro 17 will start at $2,299 and will feature the RTX 3060.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade 15 Advanced" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/38a0Sh0fJbLpd5LtOBE6nOEIDVo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227315/blade15shot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The design is unchanged, but it now supports Nvidia’s RTX 3000-series graphics chips, along with a QHD screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4ssLG"&gt;Razer is still using GTX 16-series chips for its more affordable Blade 15, which will start at $1,499 and will be equipped with the Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti. It’s customizable with up to the RTX 3070 for $1,999. &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2F&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;All models will be available for preorder starting today&lt;/a&gt; at Razer’s online store, with the base Blade 15 and the Blade Pro 17 arriving first on January 26th. The Blade 15 Advanced will ship in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hJwyyN"&gt;The company is sticking with the 10th Gen Comet Lake Intel processors for this round of Blade laptops. Lower-cost configurations of the Blade 15 will offer the six-core 10750H. The Blade 15 Advanced and the Blade Pro 17 each feature the eight-core 10875H Comet Lake processor from Intel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5WT6iU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Will this Blade 15 have better cooling than last year’s model?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Coo6fZ"&gt;All models will feature Thunderbolt 3 ports, and a newly added HDMI 2.1 output for 4K resolution at up to 120 frames per second. These two ports aside, the I/O varies depending on the computer you get. The base Blade 15 models have an Ethernet port, while the Advanced variants do not. However, Razer makes up for it with a UHS-III SD card reader, Windows Hello IR webcam, 20V charging support via USB-C, and support for Bluetooth 5.2 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22212938/wifi-6e-rollout-starting-2021-smartphones-tvs-laptops-vr-routers"&gt;the new Wi-Fi 6&lt;/a&gt;. The Blade Pro 17 has all of the above features.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Blade Pro 17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oyoqOw1D97CD1ICzONVuXnflqUw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227316/blade17pro.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s the Razer Blade Pro 17, which is also configurable with a QHD display and RTX 3000-series graphics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VrlkiW"&gt;One other noteworthy change that Razer is making across the board is user-replaceable RAM and storage. Previously, only certain models had parts that could be serviced by the user. Additionally, Razer has added a second M.2 slot (up to 4TB of total storage across both slots) so you can simply add storage to what you already had instead of being forced to replace it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aARft1"&gt;Okay, that was a lot. In case I’ve lost you with the spec dump, I’ve made a table that shows what each model offers and the price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="P0Lkl3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10268575"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Acer’s latest Nitro 5 gaming laptop seems more powerful than ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Acer Nitro 5" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tkGzOLr_WNRzFy1dMs2gQDGEkgI=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68656276/nitro52021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer ditched a few of the red highlights seen on previous models for a more subdued look.&lt;/em&gt; | Acer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KmQOed"&gt;Acer’s Nitro 5 gaming laptop has never been much of a technical or design showcase, but that’s changing a bit for 2021. It now has a slightly toned-down look that moves all of the red details (aside from the red backlit keyboard) to the rear part of the hinge. What’s more impressive, though, is that it’s getting big upgrades in the graphics, processing, and display departments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mrrkIT"&gt;For CES 2021, Acer announced that a 15.6-inch and 17-inch version of the Nitro 5 will release with support for the latest Intel 11th Gen Core H35-series processors or AMD’s Ryzen 5000-series CPUs (up to the Ryzen 9 5900 HX). They’ll all have the option to upgrade all the way up to Nvidia’s RTX 3080 graphics chip either route you take with the processor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GEd5je"&gt;In terms of display quality, either size of the Nitro 5 can be configured with a 1440p display with a fast 165Hz refresh rate or a 1080p screen with a 360Hz refresh rate. If you get the Intel version with an 11th Gen CPU, the Nitro 5 will support Thunderbolt 4.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Nitro 5" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lRv9J08m7OYWK_sun18hE4GlIAY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227514/nitro52nd.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;mage: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nitro 5 will be available with 15.6-inch or 17-inch displays.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IQ70Be"&gt;You won’t have many options on launch day in February, though. In the US, Acer is starting with a single variant for $749.99 that has a 15.6-inch IPS display with a 60Hz refresh rate, the AMD Ryzen 5 5600H processor, Nvidia’s GTX 1650 graphics chip, 8GB of RAM, and a 256GB NVMe SSD. It’s $100 more if you want the 17-inch version. There will also be models of the Nitro 5 available with 10th Gen Intel processors ahead of those built with 11th Gen processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9mLw10"&gt;Acer hasn’t shared official US pricing for other configurations, but it did mention that models coming to other regions with AMD Radeon R7 graphics or the RTX 3060, with a 512GB NVMe SSD added in will cost €1,299. We’ll have to wait to see what the final price ends up being for the Nitro 5 with 11th Gen Intel processors and Nvidia’s high-end RTX 3080.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfrIQD"&gt;No matter which variant you might be interested in, Acer shared that each variant is user serviceable for memory and storage. By taking off the bottom cover of the Nitro 5, you’ll find support for two NVMe SSDs and one 2.5-inch SATA SSD (totaling three slots for expandable storage) and up to 32GB of RAM. Acer’s using Intel Wi-Fi 6 chips for all models, along with Killer-branded Ethernet.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fKEASy"&gt;Gigabyte makes some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best gaming- and creator-focused laptops&lt;/a&gt; you can get. But some of its most exciting 2021 releases aren’t its flagship models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQfnGO"&gt;Say hello to the new Gigabyte Gaming line, a slew of midrange gaming laptops aimed at younger consumers. “Gigabyte Gaming series target Gen Z and Millennial users, by offering up machines built for ‘multitasking’ and meeting multiple needs at once, whether it’s learning, commerce, gaming or content creation,” Gigabyte announced in its press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bf3C3H"&gt;The big news is that two of the new Gigabyte Gaming models, the A5 and the A7, are among Gigabyte’s first laptops to include AMD’s Ryzen mobile processors. Specifically, they’re outfitted with the brand-new Ryzen 5000H mobile series. They also include Nvidia’s new GeForce RTX 3000 series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmnE7Y"&gt;Starting at $999 and $1,399 respectively, the 15-inch A5 and 17-inch A7 seem positioned to compete with the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328344/dell-g5-15-se-review-2020-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen"&gt;Dell’s G5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21335740/lenovo-legion-5i-gaming-laptop-review-intel-nvidia"&gt;Lenovo’s Legion 5i&lt;/a&gt;. The former, also powered by Ryzen, delivers excellent performance and not-horrendous battery life — &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;reviewer Cameron Faulkner called it “incredibly capable for the price.” Since we haven’t yet gotten our hands on a Ryzen 5000H or GeForce RTX 3000 chip yet, we can’t yet say what kinds of performance gains you can expect from the A5 and A7 over those products. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="impBJQ"&gt;Specs-wise, the laptops pair those chips with either a 144Hz or 240Hz display. And they adopt Gigabyte’s &lt;a href="https://www.gigabyte.com/MicroSite/275/home.html"&gt;Windforce&lt;/a&gt; cooling system, which includes “anti-turbulence inclined fans, ultra quiet PWM fan and pure copper heat pipe.” The result, Gigabyte says, will be “a sensational experience in both gaming and visual entertainment.” Both models include an SD card slot as well.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Two Gigabyte G5 models perpendicular to each other. One facing the camera displays the Gigabyte G5 logo. The one facing away is slightly closed. Both display a backlit orange keyboard." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eMOJ38W-aQT6uKB3HWF1W9K2S8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227863/GIGABYTE_G5_VC_P0.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Gigabyte&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;And here’s the Gigabyte G5, also with a colorful keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4mCazp"&gt;One of Gigabyte’s most acclaimed midrange laptops of 2020 was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21201164/gigabyte-aorus-gaming-aero-creator-laptop-intel-10th-gen-core-i9-i7-processor-oled"&gt;Aorus 5&lt;/a&gt;. The 15-incher received strong reviews for its decent keyboard, good gaming performance, and neat design: “Its edgy aesthetic even looks a little dangerous,” wrote Katie Wickens of &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gigabyte-aorus-5-sb-gaming-laptop-performance-benchmarks/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCGamer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But it had battery life issues, even for a gaming laptop — &lt;a href="https://www.techradar.com/reviews/gigabyte-aorus-5-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechRadar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; only got an hour and a half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YIlK1D"&gt;However, that model was powered by the Intel Core i7-10750H, and battery life is one area where AMD’s Ryzen mobile processors tended to excel over Intel’s last year. If the Ryzen 5000 series continues that trend, the A5 and A7 could hopefully be an improvement in that category.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5wHEX"&gt;Intel fans, never fear. Gigabyte also announced the new G5 and G7, which are powered by 10th Gen Intel processors. The company writes: “From gig work to game time, the GIGABYTE G5 and G7 offers unrestricted performance made for more. More gaming, more production, more entertainment with reliability, power and speed, engineered ... to meet the new demands of the ‘new normal.’”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Gigabyte G5 angled away from the camera, half closed, with the Gigabyte logo visible." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pgnp8bejfoyGy6QgfRymtrYPBBA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22227876/GIGABYTE_G5_VC_P10.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Gigabyte&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gigabyte says the G5 is suitable for “casual gamers.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3CpRGl"&gt;The G5 starts at $1,099; the G7 will not be available in the US. The A5 and A7 start at $999 and $1,399, respectively, and will be available around the end of February.&lt;/p&gt;
