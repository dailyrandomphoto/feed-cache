  &lt;p&gt;Atlassian CEO Scott Farquhar on the challenges of governing online companies&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Mb5S7P"&gt;A couple weeks ago, Facebook briefly turned off the ability for anyone in the world to post links from Australian news publishers. They just blocked ‘em with a little message. This is a real thing that happened. The company, along with Google, was locked into a fight with the Australian government over something called the Media Bargaining Code, which would have required social platforms and search engines to pay news publishers for linking to their work. Just linking to it. This was a big deal — it would change the way the web works. Both Google and Facebook threatened to leave Australia over the proposed law, until Google cut a deal with Australia’s biggest news organizations, and Facebook turned off their access to the news feed entirely. After a few days, the law was slightly changed, Facebook also paid the money, and access was restored. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MrQts"&gt;What struck me about this is that we’d heard a lot from Google, from Facebook, and from Australian government officials, but we hadn’t really heard from anyone from the Australian tech industry. So I called up Scott Farquhar, the co-founder and co-CEO of Atlassian, Australia’s biggest tech company and one of Australia’s biggest companies, period. Atlassian has always been a global company — even when it was just Scott and his co-founder and co-CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes, their first sales were outside of Australia. That’s the power of the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6kVFBa"&gt;Scott and I talked about why Australia is the test bed for tech regulation around the world, due to its size, location, and how its government is structured. We talked about what happened with the Media Bargaining Code and how it will work in Australia now that it’s passed. And we talked a lot about how to run a global company in an increasingly fractured world, and whether new regulations help level the playing field or just cement incumbents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s498I7"&gt;Okay, Scott Farquhar, co-founder and co-CEO of Atlassian. Here we go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ana7hM"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed-podcast/episode/3X7JLz1d5H0mdpzC1NMxKb" width="100%" height="232" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fpK5kv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iKWNBS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This transcript has been lightly edited for clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vggve2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Scott Farquhar, you’re the co-founder and co-CEO of Atlassian. Welcome to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXlQbl"&gt;Thanks for having me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AIYH6J"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What time is it there for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1sCSZN"&gt;It’s about 10 past 11 in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGkdVh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, you’re in Sydney?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wA1ys"&gt;On a Thursday, I think ahead of where you are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uXBa3U"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Right, so it’s 7PM Wednesday for me and it’s 11 in the morning for you.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P8TiMG"&gt;Living in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K1GLrE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve never talked to somebody in tomorrow. How is it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yv6KX0"&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Laughs&lt;/em&gt;] It’s great. It’s really nice here. The weather’s fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2DnOOi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have a number of questions about Atlassian, how you are running the company and I want to talk about the Australian tech industry.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RPTXvP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, really basic question, you used to be a guy who managed a company from a plane, right? You used to fly to San Francisco, you’d fly around the world. How are you handling that in the pandemic?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="laYkIT"&gt;It’s been great on a personal level. Not taking away that Covid has had many bad stories across a whole bunch of people and companies and individual lives disrupted. But from a personal perspective, I haven’t had to be on a plane every week or every month to go see people in the United States, or travel around the world and see our staff. And we had an executive team that was pretty distributed previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RbsZla"&gt;Some people would be in an office, where they would want to grab their colleagues and be in an office on a meeting. And that was great, but it meant we sort of had three or four meeting rooms dialed in, which is way less immersive than everyone dialed in Brady Bunch-style on Zoom. So that’s been really good as well, to have that sort of increased connection with staff around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2AhOGl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is the time difference just impossible for you to manage? How are you solving that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rIChtd"&gt;I think the world will move from where do you work in an office, to which time zone you work in. And that’s something we’ve been living with. We’ve had offices in a dozen countries or more. So we’ve had that for a very long time. And so the transition hasn’t been that difficult for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKwDko"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I feel like I could ask you “future of remote work” questions for the entire hour, just because it is a distributed company, you are in Australia.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DjrqqZ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But, let’s start at the start. Tell me about Atlassian. You are one of Australia’s biggest companies, you are Australia’s biggest tech company. Give me the story of Atlassian.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKclBq"&gt;So, Atlassian’s mission is to unleash the potential of every team. And we do that by largely turning work into teamwork, getting your teams to collaborate better. And the teams we work most on are the teams involved in digital transformation. They’re the makers, the developers, those people that are working with software and beyond. We help them to be more productive and collaborative. And it started about 20 years ago in Australia with myself and my co-founder, Mike Cannon-Brookes; we still work together as co-CEOs almost 20 years later. We started off really building one product in Sydney called Jira — which is still our largest product — that started off as a bug tracker for software developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQoo0C"&gt;There were a couple unique things about that. One was we were in Australia, which is sort of an unusual place to start a company in 2001. And I think as a result of that, our go-to-market was very, very different. We didn’t sell enterprise software in the traditional way, which was to get a salesperson and sell to the CIO. Our experience was more consuming shareware, you know, games where it was “try before you buy.” And so we took that approach to enterprise software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkehNg"&gt;The way that Jira got marketed and sold was on the internet. It got sold at a low price, it got sold globally, you could easily download and install it. And that sort of started a flywheel of our business. And over time we’ve grown from that two employees at the turn of the century, to over 5,000 employees now around the world. And of course our products have grown from just one, in Jira, to dozens of products that handle all sorts of these cases around collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POjeDz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You recently acquired Trello.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1XU9p"&gt;Yeah, that was a couple years ago. And Trello has, I think it’s 50 million accounts or more that we disclose. And millions of users using it and it’s got incredible CSAT [customer satisfaction]. And people of all walks of life use it, from people using it in their personal life to manage information, all the way through to large companies. We’ve got hundreds of thousands of users in large companies using Trello to manage their work. So, we’ve got products like Trello, Jira, Confluence is a knowledge management product. We’ve got a whole range of products that help our collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SHPGqJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For a long time, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; ran on Trello. And at one point, I realized, we were planning our wedding in Trello. And I was like, “This is too much, I’m spending too much time in this software.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y0KG3B"&gt;You’re not alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxJzlM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why enterprise software, for a couple of 20-year-olds in Australia? In early 2000, enterprise software was not the thing, right? It was photo sharing apps or whatever. Why enterprise software?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jn2wXf"&gt;Mike and I both did a scholarship co-op program. In that, part of what you do is work for companies, as well as do your university course, like a sandwich program. And in working for these large companies in Australia, both of us realized that we didn’t want to go work for a big corporation. We wanted to build something for ourselves and build something new. And so we wanted to do a startup, but we weren’t really sure what it would be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hijSid"&gt;The first incarnation was we provided support for third-party companies. So, there’s a company in Sweden, providing an application server, and they were great products but terrible support. And we thought, well, okay, we can provide the great support from Australia. Which was a terrible business because we were providing support to people in Europe, and people in the United States, and so you’re up at 3 in the morning. I remember my phone was set to the loudest ringtone to wake me up and you’d sort of stumble out of bed trying to sound lucid at that stage. And that product or, I guess, that service we provided was so bad that we decided we wanted to build something else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdT0AU"&gt;At the turn of the century, there was just so much blue ocean in software. We built a ticketing system for managing those software customers, we built a website tracking system for tracking people moving across our website. And the thing that we were really excited about was that ticketing system, and turning it into a ticketing system that everyone could use. Because we felt that, back then, there was software that cost $100,000 to install, and there was free software, open-source, but there was really nothing in between. And we felt there was a huge market gap there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8aFf1h"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was the path to go from two people, “Okay, we’ve got a software product we like, now we have some customers,” to where you are now, which is Australia’s biggest tech company? Was that linear progression? Or was it fits and starts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cphuzn"&gt;The product we ended up on, Jira, has been pretty successful from the start. In the early days, you’re doing lots of hustle. We didn’t have any venture capital behind us. It was just two of us bootstrapping. Coming out of university, we didn’t have money behind us that we’d saved to bootstrap. It was really put on credit cards at that stage. And so, we would do the usual hustle. We would go to conferences around the world. We couldn’t afford to sponsor a booth, so we would turn up at a conference with business cards and use those little beer tables that were usually set up around the place to open our laptop and do demos for people, just in the hallway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ssAH0q"&gt;In fact, at one of those conferences, we realized there was a podcast much like this [one] that was live-streaming from one of the sessions. So we stood at the entrance and we pasted or, you know, got stickers and put them on the beer. So, we went to the local beer shop, got cases of beer, then as people walked in, we put an Atlassian sticker on the beer can and gave it to every person in the audience. And so, that was sort of the guerilla marketing that we did in the early days. And then, over time, we sort of built the flywheel up, obviously hustling customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuGBKp"&gt;And then one day, we got a fax from American Airlines. And I asked Mike, had he been working with American Airlines, and he said no. And neither had I. And so, we’re like, “Wow, this really works.” They had faxed through the credit card number, and we’d never heard from them. And we’re like, this software business works when people send you money for effectively doing nothing. Obviously we’d spent a lot of time on the products, but we hadn’t had to hustle every individual customer. And that was probably a turning point for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HR0cTb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, that kind of brings me to the larger set of questions I want to ask, which is, as tech companies get bigger, their relationships to the countries they’re in and the countries they operate in get more complicated. There’s all this discussion of regulation. But American Airlines is an American company. You were in Australia and they just faxed you an order and you suddenly had a customer in America. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9RU0mY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How quickly did you go global? Because the promise of the internet for a software company is that you have a global market from the first day, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VcVlfI"&gt;Totally. I think our first sale was in the UK. We did a few more in Europe and Nordic countries. Then I think we had some sales in the US. And I don’t think we got an Australian company in our first 10 sales. And so you’re global from day one. And I think it’s interesting to see how that changes because, I think we’re seeing a new breed of companies. If you go back maybe 50 or 70 years, companies employed people locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0G76xt"&gt;Effectively, they sold their goods locally. They were governed by a government that was elected by people locally. If they polluted, they polluted locally. And of course, that was the place that their employees would be working in or put in the environment that they kind of existed in. And if you go back to the ‘70s, we moved to the sort of megacorporation or the global corporation that disconnected a lot of that local thing, and opened up supply chains and other areas and disconnected that link between a company and a physical location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rUIF9O"&gt;And I think, at Atlassian, we’ve got staff in dozens of countries around the world. We’re headquartered in the UK, we sort of feel like we’re Australian-backed. Most of our customers are in the US. So we’re a global company by default. And we benefit from that. We get to employ people in all these places and sell to people in all those places. But we’re also governed by laws in all these countries, both employment laws and, you know, how we sell in those countries. And so I think that’s just fascinating to see how the world evolves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keCoU0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Before we came on, I was doing the research. I watched some of your other interviews. I noticed that when you are on the Australian media, they glow. They’re very proud of Atlassian as a big, Australian tech success story. Do you think of Atlassian as an Australian company? You just described it as a global company, but in the local coverage, there is a national pride around your company. Is that how you feel?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eB9DtP"&gt;Atlassian’s the largest technology company in Australia. And the largest, I think, employer of people in technology, in Australia. And we’ve got Australian heritage and we’re really proud of that. I think that if you went to any of our offices around the world, you would feel like it has some Australian roots and Australian heritage, even if it was in many different cultures that we cater towards. So I’m proud of our Australian heritage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jWh3xd"&gt;We want to do as much as we can to support the Australian technology industry. And I think that, because we opened our office in Australia first, we got to tap into an Australian culture and community. We weren’t competing for talent with any technology companies in the US. And so we probably had more of a captive audience for our staff in the early days, which meant we had great tenure, and that helped us build amazing products. So I think we’ve benefited a lot from Australia. And selfishly, I live in Australia. I have three children here in Australia, and I want to make sure that Australia keeps up with the global technology arms race that we’re all in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GptL22"&gt;And Australia produces between 1 and 2 percent of the world’s GDP (gross domestic product). And if we want to continue our quality of life, we need to produce between 1 and 2 percent of the world’s software in order for us to keep up with that. And that’s kind of why I’m a bit of an evangelist for the technology industry in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4mYC4N"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But there’s a little bit of a tension there, right? The new breed of companies like Atlassian, like Facebook, like Google, you name it, are inherently global companies. They are conceived of that way, they begin that way. Atlassian began that way. And now we are seeing some of this nationalistic spirit, “Hey, our country has to do well.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3iOWA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;One of the reasons I wanted to talk to you is, my frame is the United States, which is a very complicated place to live most days lately. The clash between Facebook and Google and the Australian government, seemed asymmetric because those companies are really big. But even in just talking to you for 15 minutes, you’re saying, “I want Australia to succeed.” What is the dynamic there? What is the balance there? How should I think about that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WpcqEc"&gt;Well, I think it’s interesting for your audience to know that a lot of the things that are happening in Australia are a bit of a test bed for how things may end up in the world. And because they’re a regulatory regime, like we’re a parliamentary democracy, so we don’t really have a sort of third system of government, an executive branch. The legislature does, you know, both run the country and enact their laws. And so that means a lot of laws can happen faster and can be enacted a lot faster than they can in other jurisdictions. We’re also a relatively small country. You know, 25 million people is a lot smaller than many other countries. And so we can, I guess, move a little bit faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FowyCO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What you’ve seen in Australia is a bit of a test bed of legislation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FXIgtd"&gt;And so what you’ve seen in Australia is a bit of a test bed of legislation on a whole bunch of different areas. Whether that is encryption and privacy, antitrust involving media with big technology. Skilled migration is a big issue for us. There’s a lot of things that are being tested out here in Australia that I think are having global implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYjiZ1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let’s talk about the News Media Bargaining Code. This is kind of an inflection point, I think, in regulation around the world, particularly as it relates to Facebook and Google. The quick version, for people listening: The Australian legislature was going to pass a law saying Facebook and Google &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/19/21227263/australia-facebook-google-ad-revenue-media-coronavirus-economy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;had to pay the media industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; in Australia to post links from news. Both those companies were unhappy about that; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22243468/google-threatens-to-remove-its-search-engine-from-australia-if-new-law-goes-into-effect"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;they threatened to leave&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, full stop. Google made a deal with publishers; Facebook said, &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287776/facebook-block-news-australia-regulation-media-link-sharing"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“We’re turning off links from those publishers.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; Some time passed, there was a compromise, Facebook paid the publishers, and now they’re back in effect.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMlXQJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re sitting there as one of the co-CEOs of Australia’s biggest tech company. How are you watching this battle between the country you’re in and the American tech giants?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9JU94j"&gt;It’s been fascinating here in Australia. Atlassian doesn’t have, really, anything to gain or lose in this particular instance directly. But we are involved, because we want to make sure that we live in a country where the rules make sense, in a country where we can attract great people to come work in the technology industry, and where the laws don’t adversely impact the way that technology gets developed in Australia. Those jobs go elsewhere and so that’s where we come at it from, not because we directly benefit or are hurt by this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98GCBA"&gt;And to further do what you said, in Australia and probably globally, we all recognize the need for a free press, a free media that is vibrant. But globally, media’s traditional method of funding, being advertising, has been eroded. Classifieds, you know. You don’t go into the newspaper to buy a car anymore. We have carsales.com.au in Australia, we have realestate.com.au. So those places have pulled a lot of the media dollars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wnSkfa"&gt;But also, Google and Facebook are now benefiting, I guess, in terms of just advertising dollars, not necessarily from news, but from advertising dollars. And so the government has said, “How do we have a vibrant media ecosystem that is free and fair, that we all benefit from, and how do we fund that as a country?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjPrzQ"&gt;They looked around and said, “Well, you know, Google and Facebook are making a lot of money. They also happen to be using news links in their products,” and so, in somewhat, I think, conflating two different issues, they said, “Well, they must be benefiting from the news and they should have to pay a lot for that benefit.” Then, what happened is, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22283777/australia-new-media-bargaining-code-facebook-google-paying-news"&gt;Media Bargaining Code&lt;/a&gt; said, “Well, Google and Facebook are large. They’re maybe not monopolies, but close to it in terms of digital advertising.” So it would be unfair for any individual news company to try and negotiate with a monopoly, which I think is totally fair, right? Like, the mom-and-pop news company with 50 people that produce news isn’t the sort of person who’s going to be able to negotiate with Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k33tCj"&gt;On the flip side, Facebook and Google have said, actually, “News itself is one of many things on our platform and even if news disappeared, it wouldn’t make a huge difference to the engagement we have with our platforms,” and so that was where the stalemate ended up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlxnxZ"&gt;What happened is, Google realized that pulling out of the country, which is what they would have to do. The way this code is written is, you can’t just turn off news, you actually have to turn off news globally, to every person, which is very difficult for Google to do. And for Facebook, it was a little bit easier, because people actually post news in Facebook. Like, Facebook doesn’t scrape the web in any way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GeknWK"&gt;And so we got to see two different reactions to the government, as to how that happened. So at the end of the day, what’s ended up as the compromise, is that, this law has gone through, which basically mandates named companies to have to go and negotiate. However, no company has been named, yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BaCbPj"&gt;So even though Facebook and Google have done all these deals, they’ve really done those deals to prevent being named by, effectively, the minister for communications. The problem we’ve ended up with is that, at any stage, that minister for communications could threaten to name them and bring them back to the bargaining table again, and again, and again. Time will tell how that plays out, but if you came up to an election and the government wasn’t getting favorable news coverage, would they be able to, effectively, direct dollars from two old-school media companies, from technology, by threatening and saber-rattling?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XvEZyn"&gt;And so we’ve sort of ended up with a very interesting stalemate at the moment, as a result of this bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k4Kvv2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Atlassian, basically, said, “This bill is not a great idea.” You have &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.atlassian.com/blog/technology/regulating-technology"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a statement of principles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; up on your website about how you think regulation should work. You’re in Australia, Facebook and Google are gigantic US companies, they do own, basically, the entire digital advertising market. How do you square all of this, as you think about, “Well, the next generation of companies are inherently global?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Udx4zL"&gt;There’s a couple things. One, as a global company based in Australia, our Australian reputation matters to our business and we want to bring more people here, so we spend a lot of time thinking about, “How do we have good laws that get made?” And, what we found is that politicians, until maybe five years ago, they didn’t really understand what technology was or that there’s a vibrant industry there. It’s amazing when you look through the newspapers, how many photo ops there are with politicians in a high-visibility vest, visiting some factory and, kind of, that’s their view of where jobs come from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T2TI4s"&gt;They’re still building things, creating things, but those things are software or they’re digital goods, and there’s less opportunity for photo ops in a high-visibility jacket, but that’s where the jobs are gonna come from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCnMYi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You should just start getting people the jacket when they visit the office.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H0U9tW"&gt;Walk through the office space with a high-visibility jacket. Watch out for that desk in the corner. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OFc8CK"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Laughs]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bAR0oX"&gt;But that’s what’s happening, all these jobs are becoming digital. Software is disrupting every industry, so our job as a company is to help educate our politicians on this. So we’re trying to find people that can speak both languages. We’ve got a head of policy, David Masters, who came from Microsoft, and he can speak both technology and politics. We’ve defined our principles, where, effectively, “How do we engage with policy makers?” and some of those principles are things like, “Treat the ailment, don’t kill the patient. Consult early, consult often,” those types of things, to make sure that we kind of have the principles for how we think laws should be made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqVf1y"&gt;And if I could ask for one thing, it’s that both technology invest the time to understand the political landscape that politicians operate in, and politicians spend time to understand the technical landscape that technology companies operate within.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7Infx"&gt;I’ll give you an example of the second. We had a different bill, which was, in Christchurch, we had a terrorist attack, maybe one or two years ago, and it was really bad, because one of the terrorists&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18272342/facebook-christchurch-terrorist-attack-views-report-takedown"&gt; live-streamed the terrorist attack&lt;/a&gt;, whilst it was happening, on Facebook. And, horrible: no one should have to ever turn on Facebook and see something like that being live-streamed, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2019/4/4/18294951/australia-live-streaming-law-facebook-twitter-periscope"&gt;the way the law was written&lt;/a&gt; meant that, effectively, you had to prevent a live stream of a terrorist attack if it was being filmed by the terrorist. Of course, if it’s being filmed by someone else, it was actually fine, according to the law. And if you’re a person trying to determine, with machine learning algorithms, how to do this, it’s really difficult. Like, I don’t know how Facebook would do it, apart from banning all live streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Qbz2e"&gt;This law was effectively conceived and passed within a week of this tragedy, and so you’re like, “I agree, we should do something, but it feels like this law was rushed in and I don’t know, actually, it’s gonna prevent anything happening in the future, because actually complying with it is near impossible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P1vT3e"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is one of the balances that doesn’t exist in the United States, for example. Our government is very slow and often deadlocked. The Australian government seems very fast and often maybe too fast, but isn’t that better? Like, isn’t it better to have a government response and say, “Here’s how we think the tech industry should work.” &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M1btFk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I mean, that law, eventually, was changed. I know there was a law about encryption that was eventually changed in Australia. Isn’t that a better cadence to be on? Speaking from product language, that seems like an iterative cadence where you’re trying to find the fit, as opposed to doing nothing, forever.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lf1zX6"&gt;I do love the speed at which we can do things and engage, but it has to be in engagement with industry and so, when things are rushed through in a week, there’s clearly not any engagement happening. A good example is the encryption bill. There is a trade-off, as everyone in technology understands, between privacy and security. If you use the telephone in Australia, your telephone line can be tapped, according to a communications act that happened in 1970, that bound telecommunication providers to allow governments to listen in on phone calls, if they have a warrant and those types of things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8GUCA"&gt;Now, people using end-to-end encrypted devices, like if you’re using Signal or WhatsApp, the government can’t listen in on those and so the government can’t prevent any terrorist attacks that might be coordinated using those tools. On the other side, consumers want encryption and privacy, to make sure that the government can’t listen in on their messages or even so those messages can’t be seen at a later date by a third party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xyUOPa"&gt;There’s a fundamental trade-off between those two, and Australia passed, effectively, an anti-encryption bill that said, “The government can designate any company, and they have to put in back doors for the government, in order for the government to be able to listen in.” And, there’s things in the bill that says, “Well, that should not introduce a systemic weakness into that particular platform,” but it’s not defined what systemic weakness means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7b6CED"&gt;So that’s up to the eye of the beholder and again, most people would say, “Either it’s encrypted or it’s not, there’s not a halfway point where it’s half-encrypted or it’s encrypted with a back door or some keys there.” And so though that bill has had, subsequently to the bill being passed — so, it’s currently law — it’s had parliamentary inquiries to go look at how to fix it up. Politicians, once they’ve sort of fixed the thing the first time, there’s not as much energy in politics to go back and revisit something and make it right. There just really isn’t much benefit to politicians to make those laws be great, as opposed to just get them across the line.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1moRqk"&gt;So we’re still waiting on that law to be adjusted and improved. Even things like having an independent judicial review, under strong recommendations, haven’t come through yet. I think, we’ve seen in the US, potentially, with FISA warrants and other things out there, that independent eyes and independent review make a great difference to the public’s ability to have confidence in these areas. And so even though it was passed in 2018, it hasn’t been changed yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sNIKDb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How does that affect how you think about building products, right? There is a regulatory apparatus that is doing things. They might pass laws. It might be a while before those laws are enacted, or improved or, even enforced. But, Atlassian is still building products in Australia. You’re shipping products in Australia. Does that feel like an unstable relationship? Does that feel like something you can count on? How does that affect what you actually make?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5IJgt"&gt;Well, as a global company, it’s not just Australia’s laws that affect us, it is the laws in every country that we operate in. If we just set Australia, the US, and Europe as three unique examples: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/28/17172548/gdpr-compliance-requirements-privacy-notice"&gt;Europe introduced GDPR&lt;/a&gt;, which is the General Data Protection Regulation, and that has been around privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lordQ6"&gt;But the laws in the US and Australia don’t correspond with GDPR and so we’ve had to do specific things just for Europe. And in many cases, there are areas of conflict between those two jurisdictions. So there used to be a privacy shield which would go between the US and Europe to effectively say that one nation’s laws will apply in certain ways to the other nation, which allows companies to operate and work across both areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gw957K"&gt;I think the privacy shield was recently struck down by the Supreme Court and so now, as a company, we really operate in an uncertain environment. That’s the thing that is probably the hardest overhead on companies, is that the uncertain environment across different jurisdictions, where everyone wants to make their laws, and in many cases they are conflicting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUwMgu"&gt;In Europe, GDPR would basically say I must do end-to-end encryption, because I can’t share private data, and Australia’s law says I must share private data with the government, under certain conditions. It makes it very difficult to build one product, globally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZTkm7M"&gt;And like all regulation that provides sort of a tax on everything, it really benefits incumbents and large companies. Atlassian’s getting to that stage now, where we’re larger and we probably benefit, because it would hurt some of our upstart challengers to come have to have all this overhead that we can advertise over a large platform and a large number of products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I74Mpk"&gt;I just worry about what that means for innovation, globally. As an example, Clubhouse, which has come to the fore in the US, violates GDPR because it leverages your telephone address book to share things. It already can’t use Twitter’s network, it can’t use Facebook’s network, because those are closed, so it used your phone book’s network. But that means &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nSje9R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Clubhouse could never have been created in Europe.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QQfbD1"&gt;Clubhouse could never have been created in Europe. I think that’s just an interesting state of the world you end up in, where the laws are so conflicting across different jurisdictions and what, potentially locking down which start-ups can exist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DF8mt0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, it’s funny, I was saying that we planned our wedding in Trello. Clubhouse, I wouldn’t have been so unhappy if they had been kept away from my phone book, because they sent me a notification that our wedding planner was talking about something on Clubhouse. I was like, “I haven’t talked to her in a decade.” Like, why would I? And, there’s a push and a pull there, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8JgR03"&gt;But, that’s an interesting part because they can only use your phone network, it’s the only thing available to them. If they’d used your Facebook friends or your Twitter network, they would have ended up with a much more high-quality network and you would have had a better customer experience, but the laws, or even those companies, prohibited that, and largely those companies prohibited it because of the laws that happened. You know, Facebook, with Cambridge Analytica, used to actually share your network with everyone, and people thought that was a great thing, until someone stole those data, used it in a nefarious way, and now they don’t share it with anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdgCcN"&gt;We are sort of seeing the impact that the regulatory environment that everyone operates in, now we’re seeing that in, actually, how products get built.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYcVMD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So this brings me to the question that I ask every executive who comes on the show. The journey you’ve described is starting Atlassian, now being the co-CEO of a large company, there were two of you, you were excited to get a fax with a credit card number from American Airlines. Now we are here, talking about a globally fractured internet, and how to build and ship products in that internet. What is your decision-making process like? How do you evaluate all of these things? What has that development been like for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lGoOnH"&gt;There are two things that I consider when making decisions. One is our mission as a company, and our mission is to unleash the potential of every team. That factors into how we think about things long-term, the areas we need to build for. And the other area that we take into account is our values as a company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="18LnxM"&gt;We have five distinct values that every one of our employees knows and lives every single day, including “open company, no bullshit,” which is one of our values to talk about transparency and working together. Another one is, “be the change you seek.” We expect our employees to take an active role in shaping Atlassian. So, between the mission that drives where we’re going and our values that kind of drive how we’re gonna get there, that sort of factors through every single decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yPiKj2"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Put that into practice for me. David Masters, your head of policy, who, by the way, the audience should know, he’s on the call on mute, he’s in the background here. David comes to you and says, “Rupert Murdoch, and Sundar Pichai, and Mark Zuckerberg are in a fight with the Australian legislature. We should do or say something.” How do you evaluate that and guide his course of action as your head of policy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fninhd"&gt;Well, if we want to unleash the potential of every team, one of the things we need to do is have, firstly, great staff, who are going to come and work for us at Atlassian. And we need to operate in a world where we have laws that allow us to do that. And so, for us, the derivation of that is that policy framework about how and where we engage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BLSeMo"&gt;And there are certain areas where we as a company engage proactively. You know, we have these principles that say, “Right, we’re going to proactively engage in things.” There’s certain things we’ll engage in reactively. So we will put it through the lens of “how do we help the world?” So we’ve engaged proactively on debates such as same-sex marriage in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1VGkV"&gt;Actually, Australia was behind the US in legislating that. Atlassian was a big proponent of helping us get there, because we believe those sorts of things really matter to our employees. We’ve had other areas where, you know, we don’t proactively engage, like we haven’t sat down and looked at the competition framework for Australia, but when something happens, we spend a lot of time educating people. And so, that all fits through that lens of how we as a company can make an impact in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdCfpo"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me put a cynical hypothetical decision in front of you. You’re a wealthy tech executive, you’re in Australia, you are part of a growing and vibrant Australian tech economy, Google says, “If you pass this law, we’re leaving.” Did it ever occur to you to think, “Well, I should just invest in a couple of founders, to build an Australian Google, to immediately replace that product.” Because that seemed like a very natural opportunity at that moment.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBLGQG"&gt;It’s interesting, in fact, that’s almost what happened, except Microsoft stepped into that frame. It’s actually interesting, Ben Thompson from Stratechery, and I’m sure he stole it from somewhere else previously, talks about strategy credits. You know, there’s areas where, because of your strategy, there’s a strategy tax, which I think impacts your business. Where your sort of local maxima aren’t reached, because you’re trying for a global maxima, and the strategy credit. And in this case, Microsoft and Microsoft’s Bing was a bit player, like sub-10 percent market share in Australia. I don’t know a single person that was using it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XvrcSJ"&gt;I’m sure it could be an amazing search engine, just not quite as amazing as Google. And when Microsoft heard that Google was threatening to leave Australia, they called our prime minister and said, “We would &lt;a href="https://news.microsoft.com/en-au/2021/02/03/microsoft-supports-australian-government-proposal-addressing-news-media-and-digital-platforms/"&gt;happily live under any regulatory framework&lt;/a&gt; you want to come up with. You know, please make it as onerous as possible to make Google leave, so that we can come in and save the day, and be the white knight as the only search engine in Australia.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPfzQ7"&gt;And you know, that was very effective from Microsoft. I think that really got Google back to the bargaining table, and from Microsoft’s perspective, they don’t make much money from Bing, comparatively, so they would have been very happy to shut Google down in Australia and take that market share. So we have started to see the sort of geopolitics, you know, multi-3D chess game come out, where people and companies are actually using politics and legislation as competitive weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1hTNg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’m imagining Brad Smith at Microsoft being like, “Wait, we just brought Google back to the table? Like, “That’s not what we wanted to do here.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9BcNGP"&gt;Well, you see why Brad Smith is at the seat of the table at Microsoft, and you know, he’s on the executive team. Our head of policy, Erika Fisher, who runs all of our legal and HR, and compliance and policy, she sits on the executive team, because what you’re starting to see is that public policy is becoming a strategic business consideration. And of course, as Atlassian is the largest Australian technology company, our job is to help the local ecosystem, but it is something that is as strategic an asset as your products or your go-to-market these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nBKFtJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Australia, in the world, is in a physically interesting position, right? You are close to China, you have these deep cultural connections to the UK, to America. Do you think you perceive that geopolitical fight that is brewing between all the big countries in the world differently than your average American tech company CEO?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4utv6m"&gt;Well, a couple of things on that. One is that there’s actually a book called &lt;em&gt;The Tyranny of Distance&lt;/em&gt; that was written about Australia. If you go way back, Australia was a colonized country, and they’ve got to work out what to trade. Unlike India, we didn’t really have a spice trade, where we were trading stuff back. We couldn’t sell lumber, that didn’t make any sense, and there was really nothing to sell back to the UK, until when we imported sheep. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9zCzRN"&gt;There’s a saying that Australia was built on the sheep’s back, and why is that? It’s wool. Wool was the first thing that was light enough, and valuable enough, to be worthwhile shipping all the way back to England, in order to pay for the spades and shovels and other things that the Australian economy needed to keep growing. And so, our geography has actually shaped the Australian psyche and the Australian economy over a very long period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dI3OWP"&gt;And it’s only maybe, I think in the last 10 years, we’ve shut down all the local car manufacturers in Australia. Because it didn’t make sense for us to build cars here and then ship them on ships around the world, to these geographically disparate and remote locations. So what is really exciting for us as a country, is now with these digital goods, we can build software — or Cochlear, which is an ear implant company, even though they don’t ship something virtually, they ship something very light and very easy to do. They can build and ship something around the world, and that’s how Atlassian came to be, is that, if we were trying to build physical goods from Australia, we wouldn’t have survived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DlmD6x"&gt;So that’s actually built into the Australian psyche, from very early on. Now, to get back to your question about how we see geopolitics as a result of this: I think Australia is unique, because our largest trading partner is China. Our largest, I think, cultural partner, would be the United States, and as a company, Atlassian sells to almost every single country in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VAbfyb"&gt;So we get to see a unique perspective of how that all plays out, and I would say from our vantage point, or my personal vantage point, the increasing parochialization of the web — or the splintering it into a Chinese web, a European web, a United States web, an Australian web — is not good for the world. These economies of scale that we used to get, where effectively 2,000 engineers could build a product that scales to the whole world, now we’re gonna need 20,000 engineers to build that same product 10 different times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDbe4m"&gt;And that’s not a really good use of resources, and so that worries me. And you know, if governments lose trust in each other’s regulatory functions, because they have different approaches to data, security, privacy, then you’re gonna see these roadblocks emerge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7oywcE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned the splintering internet, the phrase that we use at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; is “splinternet.” Do you see that actually happening? Is that a perceived danger, or is it a real and growing danger?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ExOnNY"&gt;I think it’s a real and growing danger. I don’t think we have seen it getting implemented in companies just yet. But also, by the time it happens, it will be very difficult to undo, because the reason it will happen is because the different governments will have entrenched their particular viewpoint. So when the Australian government won this, in their mind, won a battle over Facebook and Google, and then Europe does in a different way, there’s no incentive for them to go back then and harmonize the two different approaches. And so then suddenly, Google, instead of having a lot of employees in one place that can build stuff globally, are just gonna have to start building it two different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4CXLgV"&gt;And like, you won’t notice it to start with. It’ll just be the number of employees dedicated to a country, or a particular jurisdiction, goes up. And that’s sort of a dead weight loss for society, and probably the biggest worry is how it entrenches the incumbents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhsnZ7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I hear you on the incumbents thing, and that’s a point well taken. Let me push you on the loss to society point. Over a year ago, pre-pandemic, in a different lifetime, I had an economist on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vergecast&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, his name is &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stitcher.com/show/the-vergecast/episode/how-america-gave-up-on-free-markets-with-thomas-philippon-65219088"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thomas Philippon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, and he was saying, one of the big issues in the American economy in particular, is that software companies make more and more and more money, but they actually contribute less and less to the real economy. They hire fewer people.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQHMTy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So if GM wants to make 100,000 more cars, they have to hire X number more people, they have to purchase X number more car seats, their suppliers will have to hire more people. There’s just a net increase to the economy, to the productivity of a company like GM. Google wants to ship another billion web pages, they have to hire three more people and a new data center, and that’s it, and there’s no net gain to the economy.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FBmuXs"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Wouldn’t part of the argument here be, “Okay, well, if Google has to build a European Google, and an Australian Google, they might just hire more people in Australia. They might bring more senior software engineers to Australia, to build a version of Google that is local, and responsive to the needs of the people in Australia.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yB06Q"&gt;I think every government wants more jobs in their jurisdiction. That doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s good overall, as a maximum. I think if you go back and say, “Well, we used to deliver a lot of CDs to music shops. And you know, there are a lot of jobs in people that would press the CD, pack the CD, put them in cars, and drive them around. A lot of people in retail, that were involved in selling CDs. And yet we buy all our music online. Should we go back to having people doing all that, just to create jobs?” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBv8Tt"&gt;Like, no, actually, it’s way more convenient, and we actually sell way more music, and we’ve got more musicians producing music, than ever before. And so, it’s sort of what jobs do we want? I think there’s a big discussion to have around how the largesse is divided in the world. So you know, taxation policies and redistribution policies, whether that is universal basic income, whether that is taxation, whether it is a social safety net, whether it’s free health care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kfhQ7n"&gt;There’s plenty of different ways in which governments can redistribute money from wealthy to less wealthy. But I don’t think creating jobs for jobs’ sake, the old Depression-era, “Let’s dig a hole and then fill it in, to create jobs,” is the right way to think about it. We’ve got to think about, what’s the best experience we want? And then, great, how do we redistribute that, or create new jobs in this new economy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZV3HA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We have spent a lot of time talking on policy, and to be fair, I invited you here to talk about policy, but you said public policy is a strategic advantage for a company like yours. How much time do you spend on products versus policy?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLIcrp"&gt;As the CEO, I always wish I could spend more time on products. That’s my love and my passion is building stuff for our customers. Our customers don’t buy our policy, our customers don’t buy our packaging or our pricing. Our customers buy and use our products, and so that’s where I want to spend most of my time. Our senior executive team, I would say that — let’s say GDPR for example, it was named internally, something like the Generalized Destruction of Product Roadmaps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nyHjIp"&gt;That law came into place and every person in product had to stop whatever they were doing that they had on their roadmap to provide for customers globally, and instead had to pivot. We had hundreds of people building these data protection regimes, and for privacy it’s a great thing. But it wasn’t top of the list our customers were asking for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6izjqn"&gt;And so sort of having a statement, or at least a voice in these discussions, to make sure that these laws are implemented in the right way that achieves the policy outcomes, achieves the way that politicians — and again, politicians are elected by people — so ultimately it’s the will of the people, what gets done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cb4bqB"&gt;And so how do we do that in a way that actually makes it the best way for technology firms to do this, and that’s, I guess, why I spend time on the public policy. I don’t pretend to know better than politicians what the world wants, what voters want — that’s their job. But in terms of translating that into laws that can be implemented to achieve the outcomes, I think that’s where we in technology can help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rX1JPm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have a co-CEO, most companies don’t have co-CEOs. What’s the split between you and Mike?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m0NNhm"&gt;On a good day, he does 80 percent of the work and I get 80 percent of the credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="55iTUm"&gt;That’s the way we’d like it to go. But practically, both of us have done every job in the business, from cleaning the bins out when we first started Atlassian, to running every department. We sort of mix it up every other year or so. Today, I run the go-to-market functions and the sort of G&amp;amp;A [general and administrative] functions, so legal, HR, and finance. And Mike runs all the product functions. So all the product management, the design, the engineering, and so forth. And so that’s how we split it up, but we’ve done everything at various stages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wt8Oft"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, the reason I ask, that seems like the natural split, right? There’s the sort of policy side of the house, and the product side of the house, that goes to the other question I asked you. But is there a time that you made a trade-off in the product, because of a policy concern?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JbKowS"&gt;GDPR is probably a great example of where we have done that. As sort of the broadest-reaching legislation. We are now looking at data residency, is an interesting one, and companies and laws are such that data needs to physically reside in a data center on that country’s land, in order for it to be applicable to certain rules. And it’s a little bit backward-looking, because you know, kind of where the bits physically live on disc is a weird way to think about the cloud, which most people don’t think about when they open their browser. They don’t really think about the physical location of the bits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JLqGIM"&gt;But from a policy perspective, that’s the way the world has ended up. However, things like privacy shields, in Australia there’s the Cloud Act between the US and Australia that allows certain things to happen under those data residency regimes. And again, the ability and what we need to put in data centers, what data needs to reside in different locations. There’s things like identity, which kind of need to reside everywhere, because you know, you don’t sign in to log into Australia, you say, “I want to log in,” and then we redirect you to Australia. So all those sorts of laws about how data is protected in each country, and how it can be shared between countries, really affect concrete product decisions and the efforts that we put in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AcDe7I"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jira is used everywhere, it’s used by the biggest companies in the world. My understanding of big companies as customers and clients, is that they are themselves very demanding, especially when they are themselves global. How do you balance, “Okay, the Fortune 50 all uses Jira, those are big contracts, here’s what they want from us, we might have to tell them no, because of the GDPR.”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ycNwCM"&gt;As a company, we serve from 10-person teams to 100,000-person teams, and so you’re right. Like, we run the full gamut of that. At the top end, it’s not a matter of saying, “No, I can’t serve you, because of these laws.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xuqayi"&gt;It’s a matter of how do we actually comply with these laws. There’s a company in Australia that are looking to use our cloud product, and because of the regulation, they’re saying, “Well, we ourselves operate in 13 different countries, and before we can sign off on your cloud product, we need to get sign-off from our regulatory authorities in 13 different countries to do that.” And again, I imagine the laws governing this are pretty similar across the board, but the fact that they’re different in 13, even if they’re 1 percent different, means they need to get sign-off in all those different locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAOtxx"&gt;Again, I think as a technology industry, we could do a better job of helping these governments harmonize their laws, or interpret them and say, “Well, all cloud companies interpret the Australian law this way, so how can we standardize on that,” and that will make it easier for people to consume that. It would make it easier for governments to sort of harmonize their laws.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZ0MR3"&gt;So, there’s definitely things we can do on our side. But I think there’s also things governments can do, to take the same law someone else does, or say, “I’ll do it your way.” In fact, it’s interesting, we have a neighbor called New Zealand, and you know, I don’t know, it’s like in the US, in New Zealand, anything that’s great, that’s [from] New Zealand, we claim it as Australian. Maybe everything good that comes out of Canada gets claimed as American.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L8uujU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1NA7D"&gt;But we do that for all of New Zealand. One of the things they’ve done is, a lot of their laws — because they’re a much smaller country, a couple million people — many of their laws just say, “We do what Australia does.” So, for example, drug testing, kind of the equivalent of the FDA in the US, New Zealand doesn’t have one, they really just say, “We’ll do what Australia does.” I think the world would be a lot simpler if we could do that more often and harmonize laws across different jurisdictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIGDWH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So I obviously have a very US-centric view. I grew up here, I passed the bar exam here. So my entire world view is from the United States. You’re describing something that the United States would never do, right? Like, the United States would just never be like, “We’re just gonna do what Australia does.” Like, it is impossible. Beyond New Zealand, do you see that happening in other places?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwUaTn"&gt;You know, there’s a lot of things we do harmonize on. We’ve got the Paris Accord for climate change, and you could argue whether it’s perfect or not. But we got 200 countries around the world to come together all effectively to have a standardized measurement system and standardized targets. And we can have a whole different discussion about how Australia is doing that, and I think we’ve bent the rules slightly in terms of how we’ve interpreted them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q17VVE"&gt;But I think if we can do that on climate change, you know, really complicated things, then there are other areas where we can put together international bodies to work out what is the union of all the different laws and things people are considering. Data privacy is a good example. I would settle for one data privacy act across all of the United States, let alone internationally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jteCHQ"&gt;Because you’ve got one in Europe, you don’t have one US-wide, and California is looking to do one. And then, of course, there’ll be other states that’ll follow in California’s footsteps. And so if we can harmonize those things, the Cloud Act between Australia and the US is a good one, Privacy Shield between the US and EU where we try and harmonize laws. I’m optimistic that there are big things we can do there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGeepC"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As an Australian CEO, you’re obviously raising your children in Australia; it’s remarkable that you know about the law change in California at a state by state level. How distracting is the United States to you as an Australian CEO running a global company?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2Jgxh"&gt;There’s a couple of aspects on that. One is employees. And I will say that, not just legislation, but it’s been a very tumultuous time in the US over the last 12 months and we have about half of our staff globally there. And a lot of them have had to go through a pandemic, very difficult racial tensions that have happened. A very tumultuous election has happened. And so I’m just really feeling for everyone in the US at the moment, in terms of like, what they’ve had to go through over the last 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BqFKZv"&gt;And as CEO, I’m responsible and try to do our best to help that. And then, you know, the United States, beyond that, has a big influence on the world, and a very large customer base of ours. Just under half our customers are in the US. And so I’m very acutely aware of what happens at a politics level, and at a regulatory and a competition level over there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sv62NT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you say “acutely aware,” do you get a briefing book in Trello every morning that says, “Here’s what the United States government did overnight?”&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xz8jkN"&gt;It is funny. When I got my first investment from Accel, so this was sort of 2009, 2010, I would fly over there and I’d go into the offices. And I remember one day, I think this is very early on, there was a revolving door of CEOs at Twitter. I can’t remember who was in or who was out right then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b8eR3M"&gt;And I was in a meeting and I just brought that up. And they were sort of amazed, like, “How did you find that out in Australia?” And I was like, “What do you mean?” He’s like, “Well, how do you... How do you know?” I was like, “Well, I read the same news articles you read.” [&lt;em&gt;Laughs&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wgsrhi"&gt;It’s not like you’re in the Twitter board room and understood it firsthand. Like, you found out about it from the same communication channels. And so I don’t think there is a difficulty these days, being the expert on any local area, because all that information is available online. And so we can be just as informed about what’s happening in the US from Australia. And the same thing, I think I’d advise people in the US to be up to date with what’s happening in Australia, given how it’s sort of a test bed for legislation that may come down the line. And I think we’ve already seen this. Just today we saw, I think it was Congress, basically talk about a bill where they would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327661/microsoft-google-cicilline-antitrust-committee-bill-klobuchar-buck-kennedy"&gt;allow media companies to collectively bargain against big technology&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wYcvYB"&gt;And in some ways that would be a better solution than what we have in Australia, because then if all the media companies collectively bargain and say, “Well, our news is worth X.” And Google says, “No, it’s not,” and they shut them off. Well, then that sounds like it’s actually pretty fair because they’ve equally bargained on both sides. But I think that would not have come to the floor if it wasn’t for Australia’s legislation paving the way. So I think people, globally, should be kind of looking to Australia and other countries that are enacting legislation as really a stepping stone to what might happen locally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DLU8a4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Yeah, it’s interesting, all of the antitrust action in the United States began with that media collective bargaining activity, which has grown from that to something much bigger. Also, I have to compliment you, you said today but it is tomorrow for you. So well done. I would’ve not gotten that time zone right. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hW4HuW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I want to end by asking about something that is much harder to see, right? I can go read Australian news coverage, you can come read American news coverage. It is very hard for us to see what is happening in China. You said China is Australia’s biggest trading partner, I’m assuming Atlassian does business in China?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MUn5y4"&gt;We do a small amount of business in China. It is, yeah, a small amount of business. It’s not zero, but it’s not a huge amount compared to, I guess, the population that is there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Enz4K7"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As I think about the splinternet and the fracturing in the global internet. Obviously, the difference between the Chinese internet and the rest of the global internet is vast. Again, Australia is in a unique position, you have a different perspective than I do. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LGd9Y6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How should we think about that market, which a lot of companies want to go into and grow, versus how that government treats some of its citizens, how that government treats the flow of information on the internet there, how the government exports technology. I’m just imagining you have a much different perspective on it than I do.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yUoz7f"&gt;I don’t know your perspective, but mine is that, well, first of all, we don’t have engineering in China. We have, I think some partners in China, but not employees there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qhlgh4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By the way, by perspective, I just meant I live in the United States. That’s all I meant.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DqXhyx"&gt;Yeah. From a China perspective, it’s interesting to see. Like they’re a rising superpower, right? The US was a rising superpower after the second World War. You know, prior to that, they didn’t really have global dominance, and China is trying to do that themselves, as well. However, you know, their values are so different from what we’ve come to see as liberal democracy, Western values where rule of law from a democratically-elected perspective is really respected, competition, other things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnUKNS"&gt;Just a very different set of cultural values. I’m sure they would look at ours and say we’re weird, but there’s a lot of things, I think, that mean it’s going to be very difficult to harmonize these two worldviews over time. And so, from a commerce perspective, almost every CEO says, “I’ll make China work.” You know? “I’ll be the first CEO to ever make China work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NBCmdX"&gt;And I think there’s enough data points now to show that it is near impossible for someone outside of China to go in and make it work. Whether it’s intellectual property theft or it’s just the rule of law over there, or just other things that you don’t understand culturally about it. And so, I feel optimistic that those two worldviews can coexist. But I don’t think they’re going to merge anytime soon. And so when I look at global growth markets, I don’t put China as something that’s gonna be, you know, 20 percent or 30 percent of Atlassian’s revenue, even though there’s a lot of stuff that we do that would hugely benefit from the way we work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdezV3"&gt;I think even some of the cultural aspects around collaboration and being open and transparent would make business work better there. It’s not a big area of investment compared to, say, India, which has a largely English-speaking population, and also, a much more solid rule of law. I think those types of economies have bigger growth prospects for technology companies like ours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7IwQyN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Let me wrap up by asking just a big “step back” question. You and Mike, you’re two kids, you went through a workshop program, you start shipping a product, you realize your support product is more interesting than the thing that you were trying to do. This is like a classic founder story, right? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A3bvST"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’re two people, you start a business, you pivot into the tool you made to solve your own problem. That grows into Atlassian. Atlassian is a gigantic global company. Now you are more aware of California privacy law than even I am. Like, that’s a great journey. But it all depended on you being able to address a global market from the beginning without — in 2001, 2002 — the pressure of multiple regulatory regimes and privacy regimes, and all that happening. Is that still possible for two founders in Australia now, or two founders somewhere else?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpi3fN"&gt;I think it’s still possible to do that. I think it’s still possible to build a global company from anywhere in the world, and that’s great for everyone. It’s why you see huge amounts of venture capital plowed into really early companies because basically, the size of the market now is way, way, way bigger than we ever perceived it to be. There’s billions of people on the internet, and all of them could potentially use your product. So I think that that is still very possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yrxb2J"&gt;I wanna just keep the balloon up, as a big warning that we shouldn’t take that for granted. It didn’t exist 30 or 40 years ago. Like, there were multinationals, but it took them 50 years to become a multinational. Whereas these days, you can be multinational from day one. I don’t take that for granted because it could go away really, really quickly, and I think we would all lose out in that scenario as consumers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qe7olg"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All right. Well, Scott, you’ve given me far more time of tomorrow than I anticipated. Thank you so much for being on &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decoder&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="C0V9Kh"&gt;Nilay, thank you, it’s been a pleasure. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google’s new Nest Hub tells you how well you slept last night</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bsoos1kmOLyT9stwXIgips_XI5k=/0x9:1100x742/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68973918/Nest_Hub_Lifestyle_Your_Evening_with_Sleep_Sensing.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s new Nest Hub looks very similar to the prior model, but adds advanced sleep tracking features.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sr0JvY"&gt;Google has announced a new version of its Nest Hub smart display. The updated Nest Hub includes several enhancements over the model that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price"&gt;debuted as the Home Hub in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, including a refined design, faster processor, and louder speaker. But the most significant upgrade is found in its ability to measure your sleep without requiring you to wear anything. The new Nest Hub is $99.99, comes in four colors, and will be shipping on March 30th, with preorders starting today, March 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2xrDzB"&gt;The new Nest Hub looks basically identical to the prior model, but you can now get it in a light blue color (Google calls it “mist”) in addition to the light pink, light gray, and dark gray options. Google says it has refined the bezel around the screen to be flush with the rest of the frame, which should make it easier to clean. The display itself remains unchanged — it’s a seven-inch, 1024 x 600 pixel touchscreen LCD with Google’s automatic ambient brightness and color adjustment features. There still isn’t a camera on the Nest Hub — if you want to make video calls from a Google smart display, you need to pony up for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20855944/google-nest-hub-max-review-assistant-smart-display-price-specs-features"&gt;larger Nest Hub Max&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqkpHE"&gt;Google claims the new Nest Hub has 50 percent better bass performance thanks to a larger speaker (now up to 43.5mm in diameter), addressing one of our biggest complaints with the original model. A third microphone and on-device machine learning chip have been added to improve its response to voice commands. Google claims that the Nest Hub will now learn your common commands over time and then process them locally to speed up responses, as well. Inside the new Hub is a faster processor and a Thread radio for smart home devices. Google tells me that the Thread function is not available at launch, but when it is enabled, it will allow the Nest Hub to behave as a Thread border router and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21427139/amazon-apple-google-zigbee-alliance-open-source-smart-home-standard-2021-launch"&gt;CHIP hub&lt;/a&gt;, with support for compatible devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3dQMK94V8TP0DykMDA_SdR82Omc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22372561/Nest_Hub_all_colors.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Hub is now available in four different colors: light pink, light blue, light gray, and dark gray.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xHrDbn"&gt;Those hardware improvements are appreciated, but the biggest difference between the old model and the new one is the ability for the Nest Hub to track your sleep patterns and rate your quality of sleep. The new Hub does this thanks to its integrated Soli sensor technology, which can measure your movement during the night, even down to your breathing patterns. The company has been trying to find the right use for Soli technology since it first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923660/google-pixel-4-xl-review-camera-radar-face-unlock-90hz-display-telephoto"&gt;debuted on the Pixel 4 smartphone&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. Since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/9/30/21496318/google-soli-radar-motion-sense-rick-osterloh-pixel-5"&gt;reaffirming its commitment&lt;/a&gt; to the technology last year, Google has used Soli in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21725036/google-nest-thermostat-2020-review"&gt;Nest Thermostat&lt;/a&gt; and now the latest iteration of the Nest Hub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mIScjm"&gt;Google takes the data captured by the Soli sensors, combines it with your sleep schedule and routines, and analyzes it to give you a summary of your sleep duration, consistency, and restfulness. It’s able to do all of this without requiring you to put special devices under your mattress or wear a tracker on your wrist. It also can track your sleep automatically — there’s no need to tell it when you’re going to bed or when you wake up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXQqNA"&gt;The data presented by the Nest Hub tells you how long you slept, how consistent you are with what times you go to bed and when you wake up, and a general restfulness score. It identifies when you’ve coughed or snored during the night, as well as any times you might have gotten out of bed. Google says there is a configuration when you first install the Nest Hub by your bedside to tell it exactly where you sleep, so it can ignore your partner’s movement if you share a bed with someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9ZLhGi"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Google Nest Hub sleep tracking|101211" data-volume-uuid="1b1d95568" data-volume-id="101211" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-274" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="chorus"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kkv5iS"&gt;Google claims it is not evaluating your sleep cycle patterns (such as deep, light, or REM) at this point, but it didn’t rule out doing so in the future. Other popular sleep tracking devices generally include this info in their reports though how accurate it is remains up for debate. “I tend to trust when the devices might tell me someone is awake, verses when someone is asleep,” Susheel Patil, clinical director of the Johns Hopkins Pulmonary Sleep Medicine Program, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21455863/withings-scanwatch-review-health-sleep-features-price"&gt;last fall&lt;/a&gt;. “But I don’t put a lot of emphasis on the differentiation between light sleep and deep sleep.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LumROQ"&gt;Google tested Nest’s ability to accurately track when someone was asleep and when they were awake by comparing it to the type of sleep study done in labs and clinics, called a polysomnography, in 33 volunteers. “That’s the gold standard that we use in the clinical community,” says Logan Schneider, a sleep researcher at Stanford University who consulted on the project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZxGaA"&gt;The Nest also measures breathing rate, which it compared to polysomnography as well. In addition, the team measured it against breathing rates captured by other medical devices, like bands people can wear during sleep, Schneider told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NOWX77"&gt;The Nest Hub also uses other sensors to inform what could be affecting your sleep, including the ambient brightness and temperature in the room. Wrist-worn sleep trackers are generally not able to measure those data points, which gives the Nest Hub a small leg up when it comes to context.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i74cnSPjxrp-ZccZpodrFqGC-A4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22372534/Nest_Hub_and_Google_Fit___Details.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Hub syncs with the Google Fit app and displays stats on its screen when you wake up each morning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A2WL3W"&gt;Google says that movement data captured by the Soli sensor is represented by spectrograms, which display the intensity of movement throughout the night. It is not individually identifiable, and the captured audio and raw data is processed locally on the device itself. Google does send what it refers to as “sleep event data,” which includes the time you went to bed, time you woke up, coughing, and restfulness to the cloud. You can view this data on the Hub itself, either by tapping the screen or using a voice command to ask how you slept, or in the Google Fit app on a smartphone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kAF0lW"&gt;A bedside monitor like Nest has advantages over a wrist-worn sleep tracking device — users don’t have to deal with any discomfort of sleeping with a device strapped on, and don’t have to remember to charge it before bed. That could give people more consistent data on their sleep, instead of just information on nights they decide to wear a smartwatch. Collecting that information over time is also an advantage over medical tests, which are often invasive and only take a snapshot of someone’s sleep on one or two nights. “You’re gathering more data to get a more realistic snapshot of what a person’s sleep is like every night,” Schneider says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KQ2Qvu"&gt;For now, Google says that the Nest can’t diagnose any sleep-related medical conditions. It’s a general wellness device, but like many health-tracking products, it’s not a medical device. But that’s something that could come in the future, Google product manager Ashton Udall told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;during a briefing. “Coughing and snoring, obviously, can be really telling for more serious conditions,” he says. “We think there is really a rich, rich future in being able to give people more insight.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="l37UrF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Nest Hub’s sleep tracking can’t diagnose medical conditions, at least for now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fVe0kq"&gt;Google says it has partnered with the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) to provide guidance on improving users’ sleep, which it provides in the Fit smartphone app. It will give suggestions on how you can get better sleep based on your own data, including the tried-and-true “go to bed at the same time every night” as well as smart home routines and reminders for when to go to sleep. After 14 nights, the Hub will present a recommended schedule for when to go to sleep and when to wake up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CESOod"&gt;Outside of sleep tracking, the Nest Hub also uses the Soli sensor to enable some basic gestures, such as “tapping the air” to play or pause music or video. You can also wave your hand across the device to snooze an alarm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UYBMh1"&gt;Google says the sleep sensing features will be available as a free preview for all Nest Hub owners until next year. The company would not say how much the features might cost once the preview period ends, but it is working on integrating the Nest Hub’s sleep tracking with Fitbit’s existing sleep tracking features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFkB4J"&gt;Sleep tracking gadgets have gained popularity in recent years, with most smartwatches and fitness bands offering the feature. Google’s betting that the Nest Hub’s sleep tracking that doesn’t require you to wear anything, charge anything, and or even tell it that you’re going to bed will make it easier for people to use consistently. It also provides some more context than average, thanks to its luminance and temperature monitoring. But the question is still out there on whether all of this data can lead you to actionably improve your sleep or if it’s just more noise in a noisy world.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Corsair’s K65 RGB Mini gaming keyboard is for people who think less is more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Corsair K65 RGB Mini" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CGabiSy4wE3nn1pdZa8U_LEImFQ=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68973934/k65rgbminilede.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Corsair&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mj6MdJ"&gt;Corsair is the latest company to introduce a 60-percent wired mechanical keyboard of its own, lopping off the arrow keys and other functions for a more compact design. The K65 RGB Mini costs $110 and has a design that is about as subtle as Corsair has ever produced. It connects via its included, detachable USB-C-to-USB-A braided cable to your PC, macOS computer, or Xbox One. This keyboard joins the ranks of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21318516/razer-huntsman-mini-60-percent-keyboard-mechanical-clicky-linear-price-release-date"&gt;Razer’s $120 Huntsman Mini&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22203383/hyperx-alloy-origins-60-percent-mechanical-gaming-keyboard-price-release-date"&gt;HyperX’s $100 Alloy Origins 60&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/6/21248389/hyperx-ducky-one-2-mini-limited-edition-colloboration-pricing-release-date"&gt;Ducky’s One 2 Mini&lt;/a&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWzGa4"&gt;Like other 60-percent models, many of the function keys are embedded as secondary functions you can execute by holding the “FN” key. As a result, it lacks about several keys you might be accustomed to seeing on a keyboard. If you primarily use a PC for gaming, or are able to quickly learn a new keyboard layout, the transition to a 60-percent keyboard shouldn’t be too difficult. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Corsair K65 RGB Mini" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CHzF5i8h5wvHQ_Kdu7Jmxj3-3NQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22372325/k65rgbmini3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Corsair&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2RU959"&gt;The K65 RGB Mini that I briefly tested is equipped with Cherry MX Speed linear switches, which have the signature mechanical “thock” sound. Unlike some other switch types, these are very easy to press and have short, smooth travel. You can also choose between Cherry MX Silent or Red switches, depending on your region. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmrlLT"&gt;This keyboard also has per-key RGB backlighting that you can tweak in Corsair’s iCue software (available on Windows 10 and macOS Catalina and later). The keys are removable, and there’s a key removal tool included in the box, along with a different space key. The bottom row is the standard layout, so you can equip it with custom key caps if you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zNsUr0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Everything you need to know about building your own mechanical keyboard","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/21/18683728/mechanical-keyboard-diy-building-guide-how-to-75-percent-pcb-case-zealio-keyswitches-zealpc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="81U34k"&gt;The K65 RGB Mini supports up to an 8,000Hz polling rate through its iCue software. In other words, it can report new presses up to 8,000 times per second, or once every 0.125 milliseconds (on macOS and Xbox One, it tops out at 1,000Hz). No one can type that fast and it might not bear any impact on your gaming, but it ensures this model is far more responsive to fast key presses than other keyboards. Other notable features include full N-key rollover and support for up to 50 custom mapping profiles saved to its onboard storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DhoMsh"&gt;As I mentioned earlier, the design of this keyboard is subtle, clean, and subdued. Aside from its RGB backlighting, it’s light on logos and other details, which makes sense. Corsair knows it needs to appeal to gamers who prefer a minimalist design, since that’s the whole appeal of opting for a 60-percent keyboard anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AMD Ryzen Pro 5000 series mobile chips put eight cores in light business laptops</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sZ0GKz0zCiI6nY2lSlprUrrFSjM=/296x0:1916x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68973920/Chip_Shot_AMD_Ryzen_PRO_Mobile_Processor_v3_In_Situ.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;AMD&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z6j3FZ"&gt;AMD has announced its new Ryzen Pro 5000 series mobile processors, its competitor to Intel’s vPro platform. The company claims the chips, based on the same Zen 3 architecture as most of its consumer-focused &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225474/amd-ryzen-5000-series-mobile-processors-ces-2021"&gt;Ryzen 5000 series&lt;/a&gt;, will provide “uncompromised performance and battery life” for thin-and-light business laptops. They’ll appear in a slate of business notebooks including Elitebooks, ProBooks, ThinkPads, and ThinkBooks throughout this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrxqdL"&gt;On paper, the chips look pretty similar to their Ryzen 5000 counterparts. The headliner is the Ryzen 7 Pro 5850U, with eight cores, 16 threads, 20MB cache, and base frequency of 1.9 GHz with boost up to 4.4 GHz. AMD’s Ryzen line currently contains the only processors for thin-and-light laptops that use “eight high-performing cores.” Intel’s Tiger Lake vPro line is &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/16378/intel-launches-11th-gen-vpro-for-tiger-lake-mobile-cpus-adds-cet-security-tech"&gt;all quad-core&lt;/a&gt; at the moment (though its H-series has an eight-core chip &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225370/intel-11th-gen-h-series-chips-ultraportable-gaming-laptop-ces-2021"&gt;on the way&lt;/a&gt;, and that line does appear in ultraportables from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310002/vaio-z-2021-laptop-review"&gt;time to time&lt;/a&gt;) and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225514/intel-12th-gen-hybrid-alder-lake-chips-2h-ces-2021"&gt;Apple’s M1 chip&lt;/a&gt; uses a combination of high-power and high-efficiency cores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYADMa"&gt;The line also includes the Ryzen 5 Pro 5650U (six cores, 12 threads) and the Ryzen 3 Pro 5450U (four cores, eight threads). The three chips are identical in specs to the Ryzen 7 5800U, Ryzen 5 5600U, and the Ryzen 3 5400U, respectively; all have 15W TDP. We’ll be testing a 5800U system shortly and will have a better sense of how these chips will perform  after that. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zh7g7ntl-eqkZ6YrkGowwlg3bZM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22373207/Chip_Shot_AMD_Ryzen_PRO_Mobile_Processor_v1_In_Situ.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: AMD&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SzpcnK"&gt;What the new chips have to offer businesses specifically are some new security features. They include a new Shadow Stack (&lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-kernel-internals/understanding-hardware-enforced-stack-protection/ba-p/1247815"&gt;here’s an explainer&lt;/a&gt; if you’re curious) designed to protect against malware attacks. AMD says the chips also include “deep integration with Microsoft and OEMs” for better security, and that PCs will have FIPS encryption certification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYik0K"&gt;The chips also include AMD’s Pro Manageability platform, which is AMD’s competitor to Intel’s Active Management Technology, and include “full spectrum manageability features.” As the Ryzen Pro 4000 series did, the 5000 line supports Microsoft’s Endpoint Manager, a platform for IT workers to manage PCs, servers, and other devices in their organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VsTZ0D"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kRHu0i"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9ZF5us"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dropbox will have a free password manager in April — if you’ve got 50 or fewer passwords</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dropbox" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6LRtRXwExxD4eXEqWJdCN_NYI1g=/0x0:3463x2309/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68973927/1211180751.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rZ3prT"&gt;Dropbox is adding a new feature on top of its usual offerings of storage and file sharing for free Basic accounts. &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/features/security/passwords"&gt;Dropbox Passwords&lt;/a&gt;, the password management feature the company introduced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/12/21363360/dropbox-password-manager-computer-backup-vault-branded-links-available-today"&gt;for paying customers in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, will be free for Dropbox Basic accounts in April — with a new, arbitrary limit of 50 passwords that makes it seem suspiciously like a way to upsell you on a paid Dropbox account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lyJz3I"&gt;Now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285531/lastpass-free-tier-mobile-computer-device-premium-family"&gt;LastPass is putting a device limit on its free plans&lt;/a&gt;, many are looking for a free alternative, and Dropbox Passwords will indeed allow you to sync your passwords across three devices for free. Like other password managers, it exists as a web browser extension, a mobile app on iOS and Android, and desktop applications on MacOS, Windows, and Linux. But other free password managers, like Bitwarden, offer unlimited passwords for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2BK2cQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Why fifty&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Aqizc1"&gt;The 50-password limit might only make sense if you don’t have a lot of online accounts (grandparents come to mind). I think it would be very hard to find someone who both uses Dropbox and doesn’t have a stack of passwords numbering in the hundreds, and it’s not like it costs Dropbox more money to store double, triple or quadruple the number of passwords. We’re talking about text, not multi-gigabyte videos. If you’re already using a free Dropbox account for other files, you’re probably storing things that are already far larger than all the passwords you’ll ever use in your lifetime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xw9Rjq"&gt;Still, it might be a worthy introduction to better password security for existing Dropbox users, and if you’re already paying Dropbox $11.99 per month for a Plus account or $19.99 per month for a Professional account, though, here’s a good reminder that Dropbox Passwords exists and you can easily give it a try. Dropbox plans to allow users to securely share passwords to other accounts at some point in the future, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nqyW0l"&gt;When asked about the choice of 50 passwords, Dropbox said “We’re confident that 50 passwords will suit most users on our Dropbox Basic plan. For those who need more, we have a number of other plan options to suit various needs and individual, family or professional situations.”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISwYeB"&gt;Dropbox Passwords is available on free Basic accounts in April, but you should &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;read &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s list&lt;/a&gt; for some equally free, more fully-featured alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gH5KVq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How a bruising Microsoft lawsuit fueled the fight for fair pay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dzyT9dK7gUyXP6H8UNcOWtya2KI=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68973946/VRG_ILLO_4474_001_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo courtesy of Katie Moussouris | Photo illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;After a bruising lawsuit with Microsoft, Katie Moussouris is fighting for fair pay&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="yjDx2G"&gt;When she thinks of pay equity these days, Katie Moussouris thinks of her mother Anuncia. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="x6hrFO"&gt;“The fact that she was never, ever paid what she was worth impacted every single aspect of our life,” Moussouris says. “She died before she could even retire, 10 years ago in June.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QelzdZ"&gt;An indigenous Chamorro woman from an island just north of Guam, Anuncia worked as an infertility specialist, researching in vitro fertilization and stem cell techniques. Part of her work meant training other doctors, many of whom went on to far more lucrative practices on their own. Anuncia was left to make ends meet on far lower wages as a single mother.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f16SOW"&gt;“Pay inequity hurts families,” Moussouris says, “And in my case, I really do feel like my mom should have been able to retire and take it a lot easier earlier in her life, and she might still be with us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="MpI2T8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are trying to achieve pay equity across all genders and races in the world in our lifetime.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4HvzlA"&gt;Moussouris has carved a better path for herself, climbing the ranks at Symantec, Microsoft, and HackerOne to establish herself as a pioneer of the bug bounty model. But while she’s risen in the cybersecurity world, she’s never forgotten her mother’s experience — and she’s now using her hard-won power to do something about it. After a bruising five-year lawsuit against Microsoft, Moussouris is now taking on the pay equity problem, starting with &lt;a href="https://www.payequitynowfoundation.org/"&gt;a nonprofit foundation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.manglonalab.org/"&gt;a new center at Penn State Law&lt;/a&gt;. The goal of the foundation is to urge companies into conducting audits and taking action on their own. If they don’t, the law center will push for new laws and legal precedents that will make it easier for employees to hold them accountable in court.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CcjPfX"&gt;“We are trying to achieve pay equity across all genders and races in the world in our lifetime,” she says. “As in right now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZoV7G"&gt;The problem is much bigger than a single woman or a single job. &lt;a href="https://www.epi.org/publication/what-is-the-gender-pay-gap-and-is-it-real/"&gt;An Economic Policy Institute study from 2016&lt;/a&gt; estimated that women are paid 83 cents for every dollar men make, comparing over hours worked. For Black women, the number falls to &lt;a href="https://www.aauw.org/resources/article/black-women-and-the-pay-gap/"&gt;63 cents on the dollar&lt;/a&gt;. The disparity gets worse for older workers and more skilled jobs, deepening over time. As pay equity activists see it, the change is gradual, beginning with a slightly lower salary on hiring, a slightly tougher path to promotion, until it’s broad enough to make a visible dent in the way a society’s wealth is distributed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcsvkf"&gt;That pay gap has been a growing source of tension in tech companies. Women continue to be hugely outnumbered on engineering teams and face &lt;a href="https://fortune.com/2017/01/22/techs-gender-pay-gap-young-women/"&gt;a particularly steep pay gap early in their careers&lt;/a&gt;, even as executives tout commitments to diversity. In some instances, the disparity has cohered into specific legal claims. In 2018, Uber &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-lawsuit/uber-agrees-to-settle-california-discrimination-lawsuit-for-10-million-idUSKBN1H40A7"&gt;agreed to pay $10 million&lt;/a&gt; to women and people of color working for the company after a state-level pay equity suit. Google is &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/02/google-protests-gender-pay-gap-harassment-kelly-ellis"&gt;currently litigating a similar case&lt;/a&gt;, filed in the wake of the Google walkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="T5sRJj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One study found women are paid 83 cents for every dollar men make&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="FvIoAU"&gt;Moussouris’ lawsuit against Microsoft was filed years before those cases, and while it failed, she sees it as a kind of test case for pay equity claims in the industry. Not everyone sees it that way: reached for comment, a Microsoft representative said the lawsuit was groundless, while emphasizing the company’s commitment to pay equity. “Ms. Moussouris chose to drop her case, which we have always believed to be without merit, after the trial court and the Ninth Circuit rejected her attempts to frame it as a class action,” the representative said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQ9qwU"&gt;Free of any nondisclosure agreement, Moussouris is unusually candid about her experiences at Microsoft, which she sees as a kind of test case for how big employers can keep women’s salaries low. She arrived at the height of Steve Ballmer’s tenure as CEO, before Satya Nadella pushed the company toward a more humane workplace culture. For Moussouris, the issues began even before she took the job. Her hiring manager asked her previous salary during the interview, a practice that has since been outlawed in Washington state for perpetuating pay disparities. More damaging, he convinced her to take a lower job title; she had been a principal at Symantec, but her entry title at Microsoft would be “security strategist,” a significantly lower rank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gDvYFF"&gt;“Their justification at the time was, ‘Microsoft is different, our bar is so much higher, we don’t want you to get a mediocre review out of the gate,’” Moussouris says. “It didn’t occur to me that it was going to be several years before I could even approach principal again.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxaUia"&gt;Moussouris did well at Microsoft, pioneering the company’s bug bounty program and building a reputation as a leading voice in corporate cybersecurity. She got good scores on her performance reviews and was promoted twice over her seven years at the company — but she found it a difficult place for women to work. She remembers a senior director in her division, who had a habit of acting inappropriately with female co-workers, giving unwanted back massages or sending emails about his tantric number. In one incident, she remembers him announcing to her team’s open office that it was “steak-and-a-blow-job day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MUdXRi"&gt;“I think he got the memo that he’d better not try anything like that with me,” she says, “but he was doing it to my staff.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="L7STf3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Plaintiff was chastised at Microsoft for being too pushy, direct, ‘prickly,’ harsh, or aggressive”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nr6wPx"&gt;She put in for a transfer and confronted him about his behavior in a formal interview as she left. Later, the company’s HR team got involved, although it’s unclear how the investigation resolved. As she recalls it, the investigation didn’t slow him down. Moussouris kept scoring high on her performance reviews, but in the next round of annual bonuses, her award was less than she expected. She began to think the senior director might have lowered it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="61JvtA"&gt;The events of that last year at Microsoft have been chewed over endlessly in the lawsuit, and many of the allegations were later filtered through the language of the courts. “Plaintiff observed that her performance evaluation scores suffered due to the stack ranking process due to her gender,” one declaration from Moussouris’ side reads. “Plaintiff was chastised at Microsoft for being too pushy, direct, ‘prickly,’ harsh, or aggressive.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VYyNmS"&gt;For its part, Microsoft maintains that Moussouris was well compensated for her work, saying that in two of her last three years at the company, she was paid more than the men in her group, including one year in which she was paid more than her male manager. Without more details, it’s hard to say if that was a result of an unusually big paycheck or an unusually low job title, and it doesn’t speak to the broader concerns about the work environment. Regardless, Moussouris began to feel she had no future at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="pForPa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The data at Microsoft spoke for itself.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MEga8q"&gt;In the years that followed, she worked hard to establish her cybersecurity career. She moved to a lead role at the pioneering bug bounty firm HackerOne, eventually starting her own shop called Luta Security and finding more success there than she ever had at Microsoft. She returns to these details now because she finds them typical of the compounding issues that keep women from rising at tech companies. As Moussouris sees it, women are steered away from engineering roles in dozens of different ways. The women that break through come into the industry underpaid and stay that way, thanks to institutional sexism and favoritism among managers. Those who rise run into harassment, retaliation, or outright assault. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="etNfEp"&gt;Remembering her mother’s experience, she decided to do something. Having already raised the alarm internally at Microsoft, she filed a complaint with the Equal Opportunity Employment Commission — and when that process stalled, she went looking for a lawyer. By now, she’d heard from other women at the company who had run into similar problems, so she knew where to look for co-plaintiffs. Together, they decided on a plan — a class action seeking to represent all the female engineering employees at Microsoft, arguing they were being systematically underpaid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lA2ADj"&gt;To bring that case, she joined with Anne Shaver, a Bay Area lawyer who specializes in pay equity class actions. “Our theory of the case was simple — that Microsoft has a promotion practice that applies to all employees and results in pay disparities,” says Shaver. “The data at Microsoft spoke for itself.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oz34nR"&gt;Then the 31st largest company in the world, Microsoft was still &lt;a href="https://graphics.wsj.com/diversity-in-tech-companies/reports/MICROSOFT_2015_EEO-1.pdf"&gt;60 percent white and 75 percent male&lt;/a&gt;. Those numbers got worse when you focused on “professional” employees, a legal category including the engineering team and most other technical workers. The company’s diversity report from 2015 showed just 22 percent of those workers identified as female. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19uw2L"&gt;Still, Microsoft was well-prepared for such a lawsuit, having prepared a range of personnel reports showing it was already closing the gender gap, no matter what the hiring numbers might suggest. Years earlier, the company’s diversity and inclusion team had produced a report showing women made more than 95 cents for every dollar earned by men. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdiversity%2Finside-microsoft%2Fdefault.aspx" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A more recent report on Microsoft’s website&lt;/a&gt; raises that number to $1; by its own measure, Microsoft has closed the gender pay gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdgoSu"&gt;But Shaver argues that, like many corporate pay equity studies, that analysis doesn’t address the way bias really works in these pay structures. Microsoft’s studies focus on pay within levels — essentially finding that women and men at the same place in Microsoft’s pay-band system are being paid roughly the same amount. But the study doesn’t address how they got placed in that pay level to begin with and whether women are being systematically placed at lower pay levels. Moussouris’ complaints were all about under-leveling, from the initial hire that she believes placed her at a pay disadvantage to the corporate culture that she says made it too easy for senior men to keep difficult women from getting raises.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9M5KB"&gt;This bait-and-switch is much larger than Microsoft. While advocates focus on the gap in wages-per-hour, &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/evangerstmann/2019/06/06/dispelling-myths-about-the-gender-pay-gap/?sh=385059ba46fa"&gt;skeptics&lt;/a&gt; can point to the “controlled pay gap,” which levels for seniority and finds almost no difference between the men and women at the same rank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VKI2fe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The judge wasn’t moved by the volume of complaints&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tlpQ4N"&gt;In the Microsoft case, litigating that difference meant years of work, with much of the court time spent pinning down exactly how much information Microsoft would release. Microsoft’s lawyers were able to confine the discovery to female engineering employees — but the discovery still unearthed 201 complaints over just the few years covered by the lawsuit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1md7IU"&gt;Some were alarming in their detail: &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-14/microsoft-intern-s-rape-claim-highlights-struggle-to-combat-sex-discrimination#skip-to-main-content?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;in one case&lt;/a&gt;, a Microsoft intern reported being raped by a young man in her program, filing a police report and receiving a medical exam before contacting Microsoft HR. She was told that a restraining order would result in her reassignment, so she didn’t press the issue. At the end of the term, both she and the alleged rapist were hired by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tomzxt"&gt;In the end, the judge in Moussouris’s case wasn’t moved by the volume of complaints. As the court saw it, there was no basis for concluding that the 201 reports were particularly high for a company of Microsoft’s size or otherwise indicative of a hostile environment for female employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2e2YKS"&gt;“That was really shocking, because it’s so divorced from any sort of understanding of what it means for a woman to come forward and complain,” Shaver says. “They risked their careers to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dCN03J"&gt;While the case dragged on, a bigger shift was happening outside the courtroom. By the time discovery finished in Moussouris’ lawsuit, charges had been brought against Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein and a new awareness of high-profile predators was sweeping across every industry. In February 2017, Susan Fowler, a site reliability engineer at Uber, came forward with &lt;a href="https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber"&gt;her experiences of sexual harassment and discrimination&lt;/a&gt;  — provoking a reckoning for the company that ultimately resulted in the ousting of the CEO. The next year, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html"&gt;a&lt;em&gt; New York Times &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; revealed that Android founder Andy Rubin had left Google in response to a sexual harassment claim — but still received a generous $90 million exit package. A few days after the news broke, 20,000 Google employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/1/18051756/google-walkout-sexual-harassment-policy-reform-new-york-protest"&gt;walked out of work in protest&lt;/a&gt;, the largest mass labor action the industry has ever seen. The Google and Uber stories were taken as harassment problems, but they were just as much about equity — showing how bad behavior is rewarded while retaliation keeps marginalized workers underpaid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nj7yVT"&gt;In the end, what sank Moussouris’ case was a 2011 Supreme Court ruling in a case called &lt;em&gt;Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes&lt;/em&gt;, which is cited in both the district court ruling and the appeals court’s decision to let it stand. A landmark victory for conservative jurists, the Dukes case was another gender pay gap lawsuit, hoping to represent more than 1.6 million women who had worked for Walmart. But the Supreme Court ultimately found it didn’t matter if there was evidence that women were being paid less across the company. &lt;a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-277.pdf"&gt;Writing the majority opinion&lt;/a&gt;, Justice Antonin Scalia denied that systematic sexism could be assumed to be the motive force behind a pay gap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="PKs8pe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Pay imbalances are connected to harassment, just as harassment is connected to sexual assault&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="E3evwJ"&gt;“Left to their own devices most managers in any corporation,” Scalia wrote, “would select sex-neutral performance-based criteria for hiring and promotion that produce no actionable disparity at all. Others may choose to reward various attributes that produce disparate impact… still others may be guilty of intentional discrimination.” But crucially, “demonstrating the invalidity of one manager’s discretion will do nothing to demonstrate the invalidity of another’s.” As long as each manager was inflicting independent harms, there was no basis for class action status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzdVoo"&gt;It’s a baffling ruling for lawyers like Shaver, who take the structural nature of sexism as a tangible and unavoidable fact. Pay imbalances are connected to harassment, just as harassment is connected to sexual assault. They’re bound together like links in a chain, with each offense dragging the others behind it. But for federal courts, the Dukes ruling broke that chain, recasting the thousand single incidents of discrimination as isolated points that could only be addressed one at a time. In practice, it meant they could barely be addressed in federal courts at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7DseXu"&gt;“This is what the conservative agenda has done to this area of jurisprudence,” Shaver says. “They are trying to decouple the two, and say what they call anecdotal evidence of harassment is irrelevant to pay equity.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KBDRvB"&gt;Faced with the Dukes ruling, pay equity lawsuits have mostly moved to the state level, where more specific state laws can give workers a way around the federal precedent. The &lt;a href="https://googlegendercase.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/google_mpa_2020.pdf"&gt;Ellis lawsuit against Google&lt;/a&gt; (also brought by Shaver’s firm) alleges that Google violated the &lt;a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/california_equal_pay_act.htm"&gt;California Equal Pay Act&lt;/a&gt;, which mandates equal pay for employees who perform “substantially similar work.” The law doesn’t require further evidence of systematic discrimination, which was Scalia’s sticking point in the Dukes ruling. It also lets workers sidestep corporate studies showing equity within pay bands. As long as women in different pay bands or ladders are performing the same work, the company can be forced to pay up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLx8kt"&gt;Still, not every state has an equal pay act, and lawsuits alone haven’t been enough to make a dent in the bigger problem. After 50 years of slow progress, recent studies have found the pay gap holding steady or &lt;a href="https://www.shrm.org/resourcesandtools/hr-topics/compensation/pages/americas-pay-gap-is-widening.aspx"&gt;even getting wider&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mr4eoQ"&gt;“I will not live to see pay equity at the current trajectory,” Moussouris says, “and I found that to be unacceptable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFN93t"&gt;So she decided to do something. Moussouris’ first step is &lt;a href="https://www.payequitynowfoundation.org"&gt;the Pay Equity Now Foundation&lt;/a&gt;, a nonprofit dedicated to raising awareness and pressuring companies to take action. The foundation’s central focus is &lt;a href="https://www.payequitynowfoundation.org/pledge"&gt;the Pay Equity Now pledge&lt;/a&gt;, a three-part commitment to acknowledge pervasive bias, audit for it, and take action to correct it. Moussouris hoped that Microsoft would sign the pledge as a way of healing the rift left by the lawsuit. So far, the company has declined. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PgMj1t"&gt;In February, Moussouris donated $1 million to establish a new center for pay equity policy at Penn State Law, the largest donation in the law school’s history. The money will go to fund active litigation, both bringing specific cases against specific companies and pressing appeals to chip away at the precedent set by Dukes. It’s an activist litigation project in the model of the American Civil Liberties Union — the slow, careful work of peeling back bad law. The hope is that when the next generation of plaintiffs tries to take on their employers, 10 or 20 years from now, the lab can make sure they face a friendlier legal system than the one that doomed the Microsoft case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ciz7D7"&gt;That work isn’t cheap, and none of it is likely to benefit Moussouris personally — but unlike the internal complaints of the lawsuits, it feels ambitious enough to change the odds that she and other women are facing. In a personal touch, Moussouris named the center after her mother, the Anuncia Donecia Songsong Manglona Lab for Gender and Economic Equity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="4Pqfgy"&gt;“I’m hoping that anyone who works for a major tech company in California gets the memo that all you need is the data that they’re underpaying, and you’ve got a class action case in California,” Moussouris says. “I’m hoping many, many lawsuits bring these companies to justice. Unfortunately, mine could not.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Archivists are trying to chronicle Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ unforgettable first year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YYqo6k_xzlJCX05uAyENNx1qmew=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68973836/Switch_ACNH_2020_DecUpdate_SCRN_12_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The challenge of documenting a virtual world&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qxeAKE"&gt;“The serendipity of the time [&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;] came out is ridiculous,” says Lex Roberts, curator of the UK National Videogame Museum’s &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; Diaries. &lt;a href="https://thenvm.org/the-animal-crossing-diaries/"&gt;The project&lt;/a&gt; aims to capture “the cultural phenomenon that followed the release &lt;em&gt;of Animal Crossing &lt;/em&gt;… in March 2020, just as the world was transformed by the pandemic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aTxIBR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; has been inextricably associated with COVID-19, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21179238/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-nintendo-switch-features"&gt;early&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/3/16/21178911/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-nintendo-switch"&gt; reviews&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/mar/16/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-nintendo-switch"&gt; making&lt;/a&gt; mention of how much we all needed an escape as lockdowns and quarantines suddenly became our lives. As it became apparent that social distancing would be around for a long time, the game became the location of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/04/02/animal-crossing-wedding-coronavirus/"&gt;weddings&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/7/1/21309893/animal-crossing-new-horizons-memorials-nintendo-grief"&gt; memorials&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.usgamer.net/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-fast-becoming-a-new-way-for-hong-kong-protesters-to-fight-for-democracy"&gt; protests&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21409727/biden-harris-animal-crossing-campaign-new-horizons-yard-signs-election"&gt;political campaigning&lt;/a&gt;, to name just a few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0rHgL"&gt;But it’s not possible to experience the same &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; as the one everyone was playing in the spring of 2020. “You can’t play the game and understand how people used it and what the experience of playing it in the [early days of the] pandemic was,” says Roberts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FoHTmv"&gt;Kelsey Lewin, co-director of the Video Game History Foundation, notes that the social experience has changed as people have moved on. “[Early on], a co-worker from six years ago just kind of randomly wandered into my town, because everyone was playing and my gates were open,” she says. “If you were to just randomly show up unannounced to someone’s island [now], it’s not going to be taken in the same way.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WpOF3F"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“What’s important for the future is making sure that we have some kind of record.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5nXmmx"&gt;“What’s important for the future is making sure that we have some kind of record of what the game was like in these moments of time,” she says. That’s what the National Videogame Museum is aiming for, and that requires more than just being able to access a Nintendo Switch and a game cartridge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ml6OAd"&gt;“It’s something that we’ve wanted to do at the Museum for a little while,” says its marketing and communications lead Conor Clarke. “A lot of video game history and preservation looks at the technological advancement of games and doesn’t really cast too much of an eye at the cultural history around games.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="dCpl4D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ first year: a timeline","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22327659/animal-crossing-new-horizons-first-year-timeline-events-holidays"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xa_izrbSL6pclindWc87_YY4WBg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22356313/Switch_ACNH_OctUpdate_screenshot__1_.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9pJzS"&gt;The serendipity of &lt;em&gt;New Horizons’&lt;/em&gt; release date was their opportunity to try something new. The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation, a grant-making charity, asked for cultural heritage organizations to “collect the history as it’s happening,” says Clarke, and the museum’s application to use the game for that purpose was successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0o0SVl"&gt;“Playing a game is not necessarily the best way of understanding a game,” says Roberts. Instead, the open call asks for whatever kind of data volunteers might want to offer up. “We’ve had … audio recordings, we’ve had video recordings of people speaking to camera, we’ve had people writing diary entries of their experience, photo diaries of ‘this is the progression of my island over the last year.’ We’ve had some really interesting essays of people really reflecting on their experience and things that have happened.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0hdbcc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Playing a game is not necessarily the best way of understanding a game.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WkkMY8"&gt;Lewin and Roberts both emphasize the value of paying attention to the ordinary within the turbulence of 2020. “It’s really important that we were able to capture the protests and all of the huge pandemic-related events … that have been expressed in &lt;em&gt;AC&lt;/em&gt;, but also the everyday. We’re really keen to not miss out on those everyday experiences like the date nights and hanging out with friends,” says Roberts. They give an example of an entry where the person’s Joy-Con had broken, meaning they started playing on the television while in lockdown with their family. “It meant that their family started to see what they were doing … and the parents got really into it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TTdMJ4"&gt;“There’s so much more than what gets reported on happening that is still very meaningful,” says Lewin. “What’s going to be important is that we’ve documented what it was like to play … what was going on at the time, what was the context, what was the community interested in and talking about, and what were the social dynamics that were going on.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3u2jN"&gt;This is something that in some ways is easier today than it used to be. “Because people weren’t interviewing children on playgrounds back then, if you’re talking about a game from the ‘80s or something, [magazines] are really all we have,” says Lewin. “But Twitter is the new playground discussion, right?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uOtV8J"&gt;This is, at least in part, what digital humanities aims to explore, though scholars Quinn Dombrowski and Liz Grumbach say a complete definition is evasive. “If we put it in our own words then as many people will disagree as agree,” laughs Dombrowski, who works in the department of literatures, cultures, and languages at Stanford.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qjgClq"&gt;Grumbach, who leads the Digital Humanities Initiative at Arizona State University, obligingly gives it her best shot. “What I usually say is that it is either using digital tools to explore something that humanists would research or it is using humanities methodologies to explore the digital… or it is both at the same time. And when it’s both at the same time is when it’s really, really cool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/63V54szpWiqXqHvYjBCGxlFpMes=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22356316/Switch_ACNH_SummerUpdate_02_2020_screen_06_copy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eGGcjH"&gt;The two have been running &lt;a href="https://digitalhumanities.stanford.edu/acndh"&gt;a series of lightning talks&lt;/a&gt; where other scholars in the digital humanities have been invited to speak from within Dombrowski’s &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; island. Attendees can either visit in the game or watch &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/acndighum"&gt;on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. Though the talks typically aren’t about &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing &lt;/em&gt;itself, they have some insight into why it might have become so popular especially during the early months of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e93xny"&gt;“I think what &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; does so well is that it captures the feeling of travel in a time where we cannot travel to see the people that we care about,” says Grumbach. She and Dombrowski are old friends, and they discovered that playing &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing &lt;/em&gt;“feels like we’re hanging out,” in a way that’s more personable than a voice or video call, or even other virtual spaces that try to simulate physical ones, like &lt;a href="https://gather.town/"&gt;Gather&lt;/a&gt;. The island setting helps; Grumbach calls it a “really joyful environment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kdgZUQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Video games are a really difficult topic to exhibit!”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Zza2O"&gt;“One of the things that I like about &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; compared to some of those other platforms is the fact that it’s personal,” adds Dombrowski. “When you go to someone’s island, this is something that they’ve spent a lot of time putting together just the way they like it … and you can water their plants for them, and their physical digital presence is something where they’ve customized the way they look.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1JW7ry"&gt;The idea of putting together a COVID archive was a popular one in the digital humanities last March. Though Grumbach and Dombrowski do caution that there are potential ethical considerations around asking people to process these events while simultaneously sharing them for analysis and consumption, the former highlighted Arizona State’s &lt;a href="https://covid-19archive.org/s/archive/page/welcome"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Journal of the Plague Year&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and the latter has also written some of &lt;a href="https://epoiesen.library.carleton.ca/2020/10/30/classicist-in-disguise-response2/"&gt;their own thoughts&lt;/a&gt; about playing &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; during the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZanOCv"&gt;Coming up on the anniversary, museum researchers are beginning to think about what kind of exhibition they’ll put together with the data they’ve  gathered. “We tried really, really hard when we opened this project up not to make assumptions about what people would submit, so we haven’t planned the exhibition,” says Roberts. “So that’s a really exciting next stage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x5ny9icFiTCrxCtrB3p8f_plaHU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22356321/Switch_ACNH_SummerUpdate_screen_15_copy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NWcehH"&gt;They’ve been considering themes as submissions roll in, mentioning examples like &lt;a href="https://thenvm.org/the-animal-crossing-diaries/"&gt;a recent collection&lt;/a&gt; on love they put together for Valentine’s Day, people expressing creativity through filmmaking and comics, as well as how people have formed relationships with the non-playable villagers in the game. And, echoing Dombrowski and Grumbach, they note that many submissions appear to view &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; as a specific place in a way that other social games, like &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt;, wouldn’t be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7uS3DV"&gt;The museum hopes that this will be a springboard for more cultural history projects in the future. “We’re constantly looking at … different ways of exhibiting games history,” says Clarke. “We’re constantly trying to innovate and try new things there because it’s a really interesting topic. Video games are a really difficult topic to exhibit!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S0evdr"&gt;“You just have to think about: what is going to be important to know about this game in 100 years? What is it that we want to keep? And not an easy question to answer,” Lewin says. “But if we want to do a good job of actually preserving video game history, those are the questions we need to be asking.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="UGOJMu"&gt;“I think it’s imperative to be gathering and collecting all of this stuff now before we’re trying to scramble and find it and pick up the pieces later.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram will no longer let adults message teens who don’t follow them</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yJ7fRIGlhlH0WLsp9vBZZW9PdXc=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68973775/Adult_Minor_Restrictions_in_DM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adults are now unable to message teenage users that don’t follow them. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Instagram&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XFFOMq"&gt;Instagram is introducing &lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/continuing-to-make-instagram-safer-for-the-youngest-members-of-our-community"&gt;new policies&lt;/a&gt; limiting interactions between teenagers and adults to make its platform safer for young users. The app has banned adults from direct messaging teenagers who don’t follow them and is introducing “safety prompts” that will be shown to teens when they DM adults who have been “exhibiting potentially suspicious behavior.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uLhMMJ"&gt;Safety prompts will give teenage users the option to report or block adults who are messaging them. The prompts will remind young users not to feel pressured to respond to messages and to “be careful sharing photos, videos, or information with someone you don’t know.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zOyX4k"&gt;Notices will appear when Instagram’s moderation systems spot suspicious behavior from adult users. The company is not sharing detail on how these systems operate but says such suspicious behavior could include sending “a large amount of friend or message requests to people under 18.” The Facebook-owned Instagram says this feature will be available in some countries this month (it did not specify which) and available globally “soon.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New safety prompts will appear when teens DM adults who have exhibited “suspicious behavior.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yC4xLU"&gt;Instagram also says it’s developing new “artificial intelligence and machine learning technology” to try and detect someone’s age when they sign up for an account. Officially, the app requires that users are aged 13 and above, but it’s easy to lie about one’s age. The company said it wants to do “more to stop this from happening” but did not go into any detail about how new machine learning systems might help with this problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CJEOFp"&gt;New teenage users who sign up to Instagram will also now be encouraged to make their profile private. If they choose to create a public account anyway, Instagram will send them a notification later “highlighting the benefits of a private account and reminding them to check their settings.” &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Kensington StudioDock turns your iPad into a tiny iMac</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;“What’s a computer?”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ghkmHd"&gt;There are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/7/18656227/apple-ipad-pro-11-12-9-keyboard-test-review-logitech-brydge-zagg-price-specs-features"&gt;a lot of iPad keyboard cases&lt;/a&gt; out there that aim to turn Apple’s tablet into a laptop, but the Kensington StudioDock is something altogether different: it turns your iPad Pro into the world’s tiniest iMac.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAAebO"&gt;This is a serious accessory for people who are serious about iPad productivity. (Yes, they exist.) It’s a dock that lets you use your USB-C-equipped iPad Pro or Air in portrait or landscape orientation while giving it a whole lot more connectivity. Basically, if you ever sit down and work at your desk with an iPad Pro, the StudioDock could be for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHOLt9"&gt;Well, if you’re happy to spend $399, anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AHI3wd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10394868"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="eECvZe"&gt;The StudioDock is mostly made from aluminum and is sturdy enough that you can adjust the iPad’s position without it moving on your desk, making it easy to switch between portrait and landscape modes or tilt the vertical viewing angle. (An iPad Pro in a StudioDock in portrait mode is a great Zoom device, for example.) The build quality of the stand itself is solid, though the plastic back panel does feel a little low rent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4A7BDm"&gt;On one side of the dock you’ll find a USB-C port and a power button, while the other has an SD card slot and a headphone jack. Around back there’s a barrel connector for power, three USB-A ports, an HDMI port, and a Gigabit Ethernet port. There are also two 7.5W Qi wireless chargers integrated into the stand’s base, and (of course) two Kensington security locks. The iPad Pro connects over USB-C and slots onto a magnetic plastic panel that helps support the jack; the dock is available for 11-inch and 12.9-inch iPads, though the size of the magnetic panel is the only thing that’s different between the two versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l90EFQ"&gt;Once your iPad is connected with a keyboard and trackpad or mouse hooked up, it’s like having a little desktop computer with a touchscreen — and way more ports than most Mac laptops these days. It’s really quite adorable, if you find things like the idea of wired internet connectivity on a tablet adorable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/87CwfWp9cCdOiHKqtXsAOJ8YXpY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374202/DSCF7585.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="IE7OZS"&gt;Even if you aren’t using a bunch of accessories, the StudioDock is more comfortable to use at a desk than a laptop simply because it raises the display to a better angle. I’m reminded of a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Fculture%2Fcover-story%2Fcover-story-2020-12-07&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22333551%2Fkensington-studiodock-review-ipad-desktop-dock-accessory" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recent &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; cover&lt;/a&gt; showing a woman at home with her laptop precariously perched on a pile of books. Laptop stands exist, obviously, but not everyone wants to use them, and I like that the StudioDock means you’re not stuck with a redundant keyboard and trackpad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j8BXIQ"&gt;A crucial element of this product is that it’s easy enough to move the iPad to and from the dock. It’s still slightly fiddly and in a perfect world I’d want the StudioDock to use the Smart Connector, but since no-one other than Apple and Logitech has ever released products that actually do use it, I assume Kensington had its reasons — bandwidth no doubt among them. One benefit of this design is that it charges the iPad very quickly at 37.5W, so I haven’t had to think about charging it any other way at home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9r4I7l"&gt;Kensington also sent an Apple Watch charger that attaches to the USB-C passthrough port. It’ll be sold separately after the StudioDock is released. I found it a little plasticky, like the dock’s back panel, but it worked fine. I &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22265910/belkin-magsafe-3-in-1-wireless-charger-hands-on-iphone-12-watch"&gt;already make use of an Apple Watch desktop charger&lt;/a&gt; every day so I didn’t see much need for this, but if you don’t yet have one then this would be a convenient add-on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QFBgmNRbM6vffKbJp5K7g7YuuRs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374205/DSCF7586.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="NmSN6a"&gt;The wireless chargers, meanwhile, are also a nice addition. You won’t get the fastest speeds out of them, but the ability to charge a phone and AirPods throughout the day is useful and saves space on your desk compared to separate pads. I did notice a slight coil whine noise when devices were fully charged — this isn’t all that uncommon with wireless chargers, but not all of them do it, so it’s worth noting that this one does.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rA7rle"&gt;The StudioDock’s HDMI port supports 4K monitors at 60Hz and should be ideal for iPad dual-display setups, but the software isn’t really there yet on Apple’s part. Only a few apps let you show different content on each monitor — the rest of the time you’re dealing with a pillarboxed mirror of your iPad’s 4:3 screen. (One clever way to get around this is an app called &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/shiftscreen/id1498683180?itsct=apps_box&amp;amp;itscg=30200&amp;amp;at=1001l7uV&amp;amp;ct=TheVerge&amp;amp;ls=1"&gt;Shiftscreen&lt;/a&gt;, which is basically a browser that lets you run up to four web apps across two displays — useful for things like multitasking in Slack and Asana.) I’d personally need iPadOS to get much better external monitor support before I went all-in on an iPad desktop setup, but if you’re used to using a laptop by itself, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro should be big enough for most tasks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RSp4Yn"&gt;That’s how I used the StudioDock most of the time, and it was generally a great experience. I really like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features"&gt;trackpad support&lt;/a&gt; that was added to iPadOS last year, and it’s great to be able to combine that with a wired mechanical keyboard and still have a ton of connectivity options. I will just say that I would generally rather use the StudioDock than a laptop balanced on a pile of books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mnf80AHI0WGnv6HvUWzdjaaAKAM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22374204/DSCF7588.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="IxUsrk"&gt;The StudioDock is plainly a niche product, and it does have its quirks. But for the most part, Kensington’s attempt to morph the iPad into a desktop computer actually works. You’d have to be really into the iPad-as-work-machine lifestyle for this to make sense for you, but the StudioDock and iPad Pro combination is a fast, fun computer that does most of what I want it to. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fvMfxK"&gt;My biggest hangup is the price. It &lt;a href="https://store.kensington.com/products/studiodock%E2%84%A2-ipad-docking-station?utm_source=ktg&amp;amp;utm_medium=landing_page_CTA&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ktg_to_store"&gt;costs&lt;/a&gt; $399.99 for the 12.9-inch iPad Pro version, or $379.99 for a model that fits the 11-inch iPad Pro and the 10.9-inch iPad Air. That’s clearly a lot of money to invest into a third-party peripheral — it’s more than some iPads cost alone. And I’d worry about whether it’d work with any future iPad Pro designs, considering the current Pros haven’t had a significant update since their introduction in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="QBqSRH"&gt;Those are some pretty big caveats, but if you can get over them, the StudioDock is a great way to work on an iPad. It turns the tablet into a more comfortable, capable, and flexible computer, and I just hope Apple’s software evolves to make this kind of use case even better.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia confirms it accidentally unlocked RTX 3060 Ethereum mining</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HKLoOG"&gt;Nvidia made a big deal about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289154/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-mining-drivers-limit-cryptocurrency"&gt;reducing the hash rate of Ethereum mining&lt;/a&gt; on its new RTX 3060 graphics card last month. A special system was supposed to make the RTX 3060 undesirable for cryptominers, but Nvidia has now confirmed that it has accidentally unlocked those restrictions with a new driver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UuV5dd"&gt;“A developer driver inadvertently included code used for internal development which removes the hash rate limiter on RTX 3060 in some configurations,” says an Nvidia spokesperson in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The driver has been removed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="adeddj"&gt;While Nvidia has now removed the driver, the genie is out of the bottle. Nvidia’s latest 470.05 beta driver &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331537/nvidia-rtx-3060-ethereum-cryptocurrency-mining"&gt;automatically unlocks performance for most RTX 3060 cards&lt;/a&gt;, boosting hashing rates for Ethereum mining. Mirrors of the driver can easily be found online, and Nvidia won’t be able to prevent RTX 3060 owners from continuing to use this driver in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="depzAx"&gt;Nvidia originally restricted RTX 3060 mining performance in an attempt to steer cryptominers away from purchasing the cards. The GPU maker seemed confident that its restrictions couldn’t be defeated, even claiming it wasn’t just a driver holding back performance. “It’s not just a driver thing,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bdelrizzo/status/1362619264423747590"&gt;said Bryan Del Rizzo&lt;/a&gt;, Nvidia’s head of communications, last month. “There is a secure handshake between the driver, the RTX 3060 silicon, and the BIOS (firmware) that prevents removal of the hash rate limiter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UyEI7R"&gt;Nvidia clearly wasn’t expecting to release a driver that would accidentally unlock its own restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2e0zF8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
