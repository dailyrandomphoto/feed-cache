    <title>A cheap tablet is a great entertainment device</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Tab A7 is a good cheap tablet&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="waI69m"&gt;I’m here to tell you that cheap tablets are good. I’m not here to tell you that they are the future of computing or will replace your laptop for getting work done. But I will tell you they are great entertainment devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9KSiUT"&gt;The best way to experience a cheap tablet is to just install the apps you use for entertainment and relaxation: Kindle, Hulu, Prime Video, HBO Max, Pocket, whatever your vice of choice is. Don’t install or set up things like Twitter, Slack, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; app, email, or anything that’s going to take away from leisure time and suck you into work or the dreaded doomscroll. This is a tablet you buy to watch video and read things, not to try to replace your laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j8Bfuq"&gt;I’ve been testing Samsung’s Galaxy Tab A7 for the past few months and found that it is an excellent example of a cheap tablet. At $229.99 (and often available for less), it’s much more affordable than an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451699/apple-ipad-2020-review-eighth-generation-bionic-processor-zoom"&gt;entry-level iPad&lt;/a&gt;, but it works just as well for watching video and reading books and articles. I’m not one to go around recommending Android tablets — an iPad is objectively better in almost every scenario — but the Tab A7 is surprisingly competent and priced right for its tertiary device status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="67kiX4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10201334"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q1TIc8"&gt;The bar for a tablet that is destined to be just a personal entertainment device is actually quite low. It needs an engaging screen with enough resolution so you won’t see individual pixels at a comfortable distance, speakers that aren’t muffled or crackly sounding, and battery life that will let you get through a few movies between charges since you likely won’t be plugging this thing in after every time you use it. It should also be thin and relatively light so you can hold it for long periods without getting tired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="amU6qb"&gt;The Tab A7 exceeds all of those metrics. The 10.4-inch 1080p screen is vibrant and colorful, the battery easily goes for 10 hours or more of video, and the quad-speaker system sounds tremendous. It’s surprisingly thin, with a metal chassis that feels stiffer and nicer than the plastic-clad Amazon Fire tablets. There’s just enough bezel around the screen so I can comfortably handle it without worrying about errant touches, and it’s light enough so I can even hold it in one hand for reading. It even has a 3.5mm headphone jack for when you don’t want to disturb anyone else while watching the seventh episode of &lt;em&gt;The Boys&lt;/em&gt; in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ptFyJqGKeM-kK1VSFj_lYQ31YnE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22024669/dseifert_201107_4280_0007.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tab A7’s display is great for watching movies and TV shows, and the four speakers put out surprisingly excellent sound.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BNn3Bd"&gt;Where the Tab A7 comes short won’t be a surprise, but none of its faults stop it from being a good entertainment device. Its low-midrange Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 processor and 3GB of RAM make it far from the fastest or snappiest device around — but that doesn’t matter when you’re using the video or ebook app of your choice. Its cameras suck, but on the other hand, if you do use it for a Zoom call, it’s way less awkward than an iPad, thanks to the correct placement of the front camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKRJTC"&gt;Android doesn’t have nearly the breadth or depth of apps as the iPad, but it has all of the major streaming video services (save for Apple TV Plus) and all of the book-reading apps you could want. There’s only 32GB of storage in the base model, but it supports microSD card expansion, so it’s easy to add more. Finally, Tab A7 lacks any sort of fingerprint scanner or biometrics login, but since I just use it at home and don’t have any sensitive or work data on it, I’m comfortable disabling the secure screen lock to make it easier to get to binge-watching.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cvo3MXHmbZ37LvpUtH_M3I69A-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22024672/dseifert_201107_4280_0004.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tab A7’s metal chassis is thin and stiff and nicer than the plastic you usually find at this price point.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2PO3SDZoTq1cVcmRbiHGSUcDEMQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22024670/dseifert_201107_4280_0006.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yay for USB-C charging and quad speakers. (There are two on the other side.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r84yNt"&gt;Samsung isn’t pushing any productivity features here: it doesn’t come with a stylus, there’s no keyboard case available for it, and it doesn’t have Samsung’s DeX desktop software mode. It doesn’t even have Samsung’s dumber-than-average Bixby voice assistant. (The Google Assistant is available and works just like on any other device.) Instead of spending time and resources developing features most people won’t use, Samsung focused on what matters here: putting the best speakers and perhaps the best display you can get in a tablet at this price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SkS4JD"&gt;And really, that’s all you could want from a tablet like this. It needs to look good, it needs to sound good, and it needs to have the apps with the content you want. The Tab A7 checks all of those boxes and no more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hgziOR"&gt;It’s the best anti-doomscrolling gadget you can get this year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The US government will let TikTok run out the clock and ‘overlook’ its own deadline</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZW8L8BkMGjO0i-9LYWeiBZCOEAA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68461504/acastro_200803_1777_tikTok_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="okQe7F"&gt;The Trump administration won’t enforce its own deadline for ByteDance to sell or spin out video-sharing platform TikTok’s business in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-05/tiktok-sale-deadline-is-put-on-hold-as-talks-with-u-s-continue"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8YXWtx"&gt;The latest deadline for that move, given by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/28/21723883/bytedance-extension-us-government-tiktok-sale-oracle-trump"&gt;on November 28th&lt;/a&gt;, was today, December 4th. An extension isn’t expected, though the current deadline will “be overlooked while the discussions continue” between the Trump administration and TikTok, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QkZCx"&gt;CNN tech reporter Brian Fung is corroborating that the US won’t enforce its own deadline, with his sources amusingly suggesting that the &lt;em&gt;lack&lt;/em&gt; of a deadline is proof that the US is “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/b_fung/status/1335024625298919425"&gt;highly motivated&lt;/a&gt;” to complete talks about the sale. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FhrJI8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;US officials are “highly motivated” to complete the talks, the person said, and added that the lack of a new, specific deadline is indicative of that.&lt;/p&gt;— Brian Fung (@b_fung) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/b_fung/status/1335024625298919425?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 5, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kueYVg"&gt;The Trump administration has repeatedly argued that TikTok and ByteDance are a national security risk, and the US Commerce Department issued an order to block downloads of TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445060/trump-tiktok-wechat-ban-us-apple-app-store-google-play-commerce-department"&gt;in September&lt;/a&gt;. But Trump then said that he approved of a bid by Oracle and Walmart “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/19/21437850/president-trump-approves-oracle-tiktok-partnership-bytedance-china-ban"&gt;in concept&lt;/a&gt;” to create a new US-based entity called TikTok Global, though it’s not clear how that would address concerns of security risks. That deal also requires final approval from China, which hasn’t come yet, either. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Fi is offering $100 to upgrade your 3G phone before it stops working</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-NdljImFs0d0G5zgAlypHSwcftE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68461500/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="60j1FS"&gt;Google Fi will stop activating non-VoLTE phones in January, and encourage customers with older phones to upgrade with a $100 credit provided they purchase a new phone from the Fi store and activate it before December 31st, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/04/google-fi-volte/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfR1r4"&gt;Google’s hand is forced in the matter. Customers subscribe to Fi, but as an MVNO, Fi actually piggybacks on T-Mobile and US Cellular’s networks to provide coverage. Since T-Mobile has already announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21336397/t-mobile-require-support-volte-2021-5g-lte"&gt;its own plans to phase out support for non-VoLTE phones&lt;/a&gt; starting in January 2021, Fi has to as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TzjZ75"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Requiring VoLTE all but assures 3G’s days are numbered&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NN5wBe"&gt;VoLTE stands for “Voice over LTE”, which is the handling of phone calls over LTE data rather than older 3G tech. VoLTE calls are typically clearer, with fewer drops in connection, though they’re completely unavailable to older phones that only use 3G radios and even some early LTE models as well. Google stopped activating 2G and 3G phones August 4th of this year &lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/faq/"&gt;according to the Fi FAQs&lt;/a&gt;, but requiring VoLTE all but assures 3G’s days are numbered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oOBEHY"&gt;There’s no hard date for the end of 3G service at Fi, but it is coming, and until Google makes an official announcement, your best bet is to look for when T-Mobile ends its coverage. T-Mobile gained a lot of sway over what Fi can offer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202726/tmobile-sprint-acquisition-ceo-finished-john-legere-steps-down"&gt;when it purchased Sprint&lt;/a&gt;, giving it control over both of the biggest networks Fi relied on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fxo3Gf"&gt;There’s actually a couple cheap options on the Fi store that could serve as a quick fix. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21420196/best-budget-smartphone-cheap"&gt;We like Google’s Pixel 4a&lt;/a&gt;, which normally sells for $349, but there’s also options that you could get &lt;a href="https://fi.google.com/about/phones/moto-g-power"&gt;for less than $100&lt;/a&gt; with Google’s current holiday promotion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CB5irS"&gt;Upgrading to better cell service is a long term good for the usability of phones, but it is an inconvenience to customers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/7/17/17582370/verizon-stops-3g-activations-smartphone-network-shutdown"&gt;Verizon already made its change&lt;/a&gt; a while back, phasing out elements of 3G services in favor of LTE and 5G over time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21334221/att-customer-upgrade-email-3g-shutdown-2022"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21336397/t-mobile-require-support-volte-2021-5g-lte"&gt;T-Mobile’s&lt;/a&gt; plans are a bit more abrupt. There’s an intense focus on upgrading to 5G that seems to be motivating all of this, which is especially inconvenient because around 30 million Americans &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/3g-use-america-1067961/"&gt;still used 3G exclusively as of 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Unless customers are able to upgrade, they could be left behind.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hope you weren’t planning to watch Wonder Woman 1984 with an HBO Max free trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bv2vBOzjqyLkPn2CFbQGE0mKhJU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68461413/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9y7hGh"&gt;It may be time to pour one out for the streaming service trial. &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/hbo-max-kills-one-week-free-trial-before-wonder-woman-1984-hits-dec-25/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNET &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that HBO Max is no longer offering users a free week of watching its content, following both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/19/21296717/disney-plus-no-free-trial-streaming-hamilton-release-monthly-subscription"&gt;Disney Plus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514661/netflix-free-trial-us-cancel-content-sampling-streaming"&gt;Netflix’s examples&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the year. This change, probably not coincidentally, comes just weeks before December 25th, when &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt; is set to launch on the service (as well as in theaters, but you should probably stay home). While it can’t compete with free, the $14.99 you’ll now have to pay to see the movie still compares favorably to the price of a theater ticket (and it’s a month of entertainment as opposed to two-ish hours).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6KnkmX"&gt;It’s not the first streaming service to nix a free trial before a big release: Disney Plus did it just a few weeks &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/19/21296717/disney-plus-no-free-trial-streaming-hamilton-release-monthly-subscription"&gt;before it started streaming &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The logic is sound, if annoying: people want to watch the Big New Thing, and if you offered a free trial, they might just watch it and bounce. If they have to pay for it for a month, a lot will, and they might get hooked on something else while they’re looking around for other content to justify their month-long subscription. Or, if you’re HBO Max, they might see the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;absolute deluge of movies&lt;/a&gt; coming to the service next year and decide it’s worth keeping around.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A promotional picture of Wonder Woman 1984" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ePKGrOkaB8tivzdSNnbsVOMze8g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19821876/wonder_woman.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Free trials don’t recoup a $200 million production budget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D6wmG7"&gt;So, if you were hoping to use the free trial to watch &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;, it’s not an option anymore. Is it worth paying for a month of HBO Max? You’ll have to decide, though whether or not you’re willing to pay will probably be determined by how many of the other streaming services you pay for, because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/streaming-wars"&gt;there sure are a lot of them&lt;/a&gt;. As for me, I’m just sad I have to cancel my plans of having an incredible week of free movie watching at the end of next year.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will replace your iPhone 11’s display for free if it has the glitchy touchscreen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D8PT62YDNXml7OSbonHaanfBhiA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68460383/akrales_190913_3628_0277.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="L3xLK2"&gt;If your iPhone 11 isn’t responding to touches, it might be eligible for a free fix from Apple. The company has launched a replacement program for iPhone 11 displays that stop responding to touches “due to an issue with the display module.” Apple says that “a small percentage of iPhone 11 displays” are affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DeMZH4"&gt;Devices affected by the issue were manufactured between November 2019 and May 2020, Apple said, meaning not every phone is affected. If you’re seeing the issue on your iPhone 11, you can check to see if your phone is eligible for the program by plugging its serial number into a box on &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/iphone-11-display-module-replacement-program"&gt;Apple’s website for the replacement program&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPTNR6"&gt;If your phone is eligible for replacement, you can find one of Apple’s authorized service providers to help, make an appointment at an Apple retail store, or contact Apple support to arrange for a mail in. And Apple says that affected phones are covered for two years from the day you bought it, so if the issue comes up for you sometime in that two-year window, you’re still eligible for a free replacement.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple developers can now let you share free copies of your in-app purchases with your family  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mrPbwH8TGYX2Qt3aYbPktzsIRXU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68460226/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJhO3f"&gt;If you’ve ever wished you could share an in-app purchase with your family, you may be in luck. Today, &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/news/?id=4zbvn7u9"&gt;Apple announced&lt;/a&gt; that subscriptions and one-time in-app purchases can now be shared among families. If you buy a consumable item, like coins in a game, you’ll still be the only one who can use them, but if you &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/suppliesapp/status/1334955683658280962?s=20"&gt;unlock an ad-free or pro version&lt;/a&gt; of an app it could be eligible for the new Family Sharing program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNZyX6"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2020%2F06%2Fapple-introduces-macos-big-sur-with-a-beautiful-new-design%2F%23mn_p&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F4%2F22154178%2Fapple-family-sharing-allows-subscriptions-in-app-purchases#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced this change back in June&lt;/a&gt; with Big Sur, but it’s finally letting developers flip the switch to allow subscriptions and purchases to be shared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TGvyeg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;App developer PSA: it is now possible to enable Family Sharing for IAPs and subscriptions, but you have to turn that on in App Store Connect. For subscriptions, it's under the duration… &lt;a href="https://t.co/Hj3NBRN3L0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Hj3NBRN3L0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve Harris (@steveharris) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/steveharris/status/1334615046090076162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HXhaqh"&gt;Developers will need to flip that switch, though, as allowing Family Sharing of a subscription or purchase &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/steveharris/status/1334615046090076162"&gt;is a manual opt-in&lt;/a&gt;. At the moment, only one of my subscriptions, the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/food_noms/status/1334683219405508614?s=20"&gt;calorie-tracking app FoodNoms&lt;/a&gt;, allows sharing its subscription, but other big names such as &lt;a href="https://blog.ulysses.app/family-sharing/"&gt;writing app Ulysses&lt;/a&gt; have also announced support for the feature. However, it does seem like the functionality is rolling out slowly. I asked my sister if she could access a subscription I had shared, and she couldn’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="crBTtQ"&gt;If you’re the person who buys the subscriptions in the family, It’s easy to check which of them have the option to share by going to &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt;, then clicking on your name. From there, tap &lt;strong&gt;Subscriptions&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot showing the Share New Subscriptions toggle" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FPjn4y0ldlk5BlutxoIWF5G5VYg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22146161/Share_new_subscriptions_toggle.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ovBrVb"&gt;At the top of the screen, you’ll see a switch labeled Share New Subscriptions. Setting it to on will automatically give your family members access to any eligible in-app subscriptions that you sign up for. If you’re planning on signing up for any embarrassing subscriptions that you think might get shared with mom and dad, you may want to turn this off for the time being. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftboW0"&gt;Beneath that, you’ll see the list of your current subscriptions. Tapping on one will bring you to the Edit Subscription screen, where you’ll see a Share with Family switch if the developer has decided to allow it. Turning it on will give your family access to the subscription just as if they had bought it themselves!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Screenshot showing an Edit Subscription page on iPhone, with the new Share with Family toggle" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_i_VpA4YgzRGr4T7PkSX8Lbxb7E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22146180/Share_with_family_subscription_toggle.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Share with Family toggle will show up on apps that support sharing. For me, it was off by default.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="887Sl4"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/12/04/family-sharing-subscriptions-in-app-purchases/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; has reported&lt;/a&gt; that the process is different for sharing one-time in-app purchases. For example, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WorkingCopyApp/status/1334871247440769024?s=20"&gt;Working Copy’&lt;/a&gt;s Pro version unlock is done through an in-app payment. For a family member to be able to access it, they’ll have to go to the App Store, click on their account button in the upper right corner, go to &lt;strong&gt;Purchased&lt;/strong&gt;, and then select the family member that purchased the unlock. They’ll then have to download the app from that screen. Depending on how the app is set up, they may then need to click the Restore Purchases button. This process is way more involved, so I’d love to see some tweaks to it down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwcujz"&gt;If your favorite app doesn’t support subscription sharing yet, it may be worth checking back in on the Subscription screen from time to time. There are reports of users &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/viticci/status/1334611244083507210"&gt;getting notifications&lt;/a&gt; when one of their subscriptions becomes eligible for Family Sharing, but I haven’t gotten any yet. Given that I’m currently not able to share my budgeting app subscription with my wife, I’ll certainly be checking the Subscription screen every once in a while to see if my favorite apps are adopting the model. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube and Peacock are now streaming 22 James Bond films for free</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Goldfinger" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JwGsKkDGB9VI1JB2YYtbLRyG9-k=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68459806/gfcomputer-goldfinger-lyrics-balloons-media-hdcaptures-red-106111.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Om8vWw"&gt;Maybe you’re feeling nostalgic for a classic James Bond film following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/31/21543223/sean-connery-james-bond-dies"&gt;Sean Connery’s death in late October&lt;/a&gt;. Or perhaps you’re simply feeling a gap given that the next film, &lt;em&gt;No Time to Die&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21499362/james-bond-no-time-to-die-delay-april-2021"&gt;got pushed back to April 2021 or beyond&lt;/a&gt;. Either way, you can now binge a sizable selection of the James Bond collection completely for free (with ads) &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwwhtOnMyjuyEeWvv6UX11aw3jFLFAxU1"&gt;from YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.peacocktv.com/watch/home/Free-Bond-Binge"&gt;Peacock&lt;/a&gt; (with a free account), and &lt;a href="https://pluto.tv/on-demand"&gt;PlutoTV&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBSYEA"&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Disclosure: Comcast, which owns Peacock parent NBCUniversal, is also an investor in Vox Media, &lt;/em&gt;The Verge&lt;em&gt;’s parent company.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pq0pop"&gt;Not every provider has every film, and a few aren’t on streaming services at all: you’ll need to rent &lt;em&gt;Skyfall&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Spectre&lt;/em&gt; if you care to watch those again. It’s also not clear how long these films will be free to stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQOv81"&gt;But every Sean Connery, Roger Moore, Timothy Dalton, Pierce Brosnan, and George Lazenby Bond film is represented here for now, and the first couple of Daniel Craig flicks as well. I’ve bolded the ones you can find on YouTube that you can’t find on Peacock and vice versa. &lt;a href="https://pluto.tv/on-demand"&gt;PlutoTV has all of the below&lt;/a&gt;, save &lt;em&gt;Quantum of Solace&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUtPoA"&gt;You can also find most of the films on Hulu and Amazon Prime this month, though you’d have to pay for those subscriptions, and Netflix has &lt;em&gt;Casino Royale&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Quantum of Solace&lt;/em&gt;, and three Pierce Brosnan flicks including &lt;em&gt;GoldenEye &lt;/em&gt;— newly relevant &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150330/arecibo-observatory-collapse-drone-footage-video"&gt;now that the famed Arecibo Observatory, which gets destroyed in the film, has also collapsed in real life&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="c1Uyva"&gt;YouTube, 20 films&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="YDFDzP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dr. No&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li id="9yAag2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thunderball&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PpPufd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;You Only Live Twice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="RHencQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On Her Majesty’s Secret Service&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="plGCrp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diamonds Are Forever&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9aioc6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Never Say Never Again&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="GTSPV9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Live and Let Die&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ezNO4e"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Man with the Golden Gun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0YqTLQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Spy who Loved Me&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dUQvht"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Moonraker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ke47oK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;For Your Eyes Only&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="f8fY4N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Octopussy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LNrqTF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A View to a Kill&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Pve7yA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Living Daylights&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4yXsAM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Licence to Kill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="u5GE3d"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GoldenEye&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ygRbvP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tomorrow Never Dies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yNvR7z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The World is Not Enough&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="VsSNEQ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLwwhtOnMyjuyEeWvv6UX11aw3jFLFAxU1" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ltTbUC"&gt;Peacock: 12 films&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="cZbQjh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;From Russia with Love&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hTC2OK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Goldfinger&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4Frzvu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;You Only Live Twice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="7KDgt3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Diamonds Are Forever&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="UIYaaP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Man with the Golden Gun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="07njer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Octopussy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sEamQJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Licence to Kill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CvEEUn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GoldenEye&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9KyS7q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tomorrow Never Dies&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="N1CgwG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The World is Not Enough&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oDflz5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Casino Royale&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="p0U7IF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quantum of Solace&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="kR2Ywi"&gt;I highly recommend &lt;em&gt;The Living Daylights&lt;/em&gt; with Timothy Dalton. It’s underrated, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c14-nM8XXXA"&gt;its car chase scene&lt;/a&gt; has yet to be beat. Did I mention I got to see &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/my-afternoon-with-james-bonds-amazing-spy-vehicles-1729067561"&gt;a lot of the real Bond cars and took photos of them&lt;/a&gt; back in 2015?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u2NcmG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c14-nM8XXXA?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Nissan follows GM in ditching Trump’s effort to overturn California’s pollution rules</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Trump Participates In Thanksgiving Video Teleconference With Military Members" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SA-rSyno4kpBvL0o-e40YdJYGtY=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68459560/1287973486.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Erin Schaff - Pool/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lJa2Xy"&gt;President Donald Trump’s effort to overturn California’s ability to set fuel efficiency rules just lost another automaker. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/autos-emissions-trump/nissan-joins-gm-in-exiting-auto-group-backing-trump-idUSL1N2IK2E3"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;Nissan said it was joining General Motors in abandoning the group of car companies that were previously supporting Trump’s fight with California. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2udgXj"&gt;On November 23rd, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21611607/gm-trump-california-car-emission-pollution-biden-fuel-efficiency-standards"&gt;GM announced it would leave the group&lt;/a&gt; of automakers that included Nissan, Fiat Chrysler, and several others, that were supporting Trump’s legal efforts to overturn pollution-fighting powers. Under the Clean Air Act, the state has historically been allowed to set its own emissions standards. And as the largest auto market in the US and one of the biggest in the world, California has a lot of influence over the auto industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HvBa8b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;California has a lot of influence over the auto industry&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5FDgRX"&gt;Nissan, which along with its coalition partners Renault and Mitsubishi, is one of the largest automakers in the world. Notably, neither Nissan nor GM have said whether they would join an opposing group of automakers that includes Ford, BMW, Honda, and Volkswagen, which have agreed to abide by California’s fuel efficiency standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wVfHdA"&gt;The pro-California group of car companies, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20727261/trump-emissions-rollback-ford-volkswagon-honda-bmw-california-deal"&gt;which first announced their intentions in July 2019&lt;/a&gt;, struck a deal with the state that roughly matches the cleaner car plan put in place by the Obama-era Environmental Protection Agency — a plan that the Trump administration has been working feverishly to undo since the president took office in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBbdyl"&gt;President-elect Joe Biden has stated his support for the Obama-era rules (and by extension, California’s standards) and has vowed to push for the rapid adoption of zero-emission vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Warner Bros. had to move its 2021 films to HBO Max</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lpgAoCfoCI0dhcriLTe8-x69k1I=/182x0:3394x2141/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68459418/dune_image.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JCehZF"&gt;WarnerMedia is making a clear bet for 2021: its slate of movies won’t generate the revenue its studio division needs, but it can help boost HBO Max’s long-term success. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usALiO"&gt;The company announced yesterday that every one of its 2021 movies will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;debut on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; in the United States at the same time they play in theaters. They’ll be available for one month, at no extra charge, and available to stream in 4K HDR. It feels like an inevitable shift; COVID-19 cases &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/12/02/world/covid-19-coronavirus"&gt;are surging&lt;/a&gt; around the world again, new content on streaming services is drying up, and WarnerMedia needs to figure out a way to keep revenue coming in. Looking at a year where cinemas might not open beyond 25 percent capacity in the United States and where people may not want to sit in a room full of strangers until a vaccine is released, it makes a lot of sense that Warner Bros. is using the opportunity to see how a simultaneous release could benefit HBO Max. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHrto7"&gt;It’s still not a great answer for anyone involved. It’s a loss for Warner Bros., it’s a loss for AT&amp;amp;T (which owns WarnerMedia), and it’s a loss for theaters. Warner Bros. is not going to make the revenue per-film it may have through theatrical release in a pre-COVID era. AT&amp;amp;T may lose $1.2 billion, according to analytical firm MoffettNathanson, at a time when the company is saddled with &lt;a href="https://www.slashgear.com/atts-price-increases-the-result-of-billion-dollar-merger-debt-03564479/"&gt;$160 billion of debt&lt;/a&gt; that it’s trying to quickly reduce and its pay-TV business &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/pay-tv-fears-bigger-subscriber-losses-virus-crisis-1288159"&gt;is crumbling&lt;/a&gt;. Theater chains need big blockbuster and tentpole &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514822/amc-theaters-cash-movies-delays-closing-pandemic-debt-regal"&gt;films to bring people in&lt;/a&gt;, but now many of those movies are available for people at home — where’s the incentive to go out when a virus is raging? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WrDqkF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s still not a great answer for anyone involved&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HCBTKd"&gt;But the shift to HBO Max is a bet on long-term growth in streaming offsetting the immediate loss from theatrical and other revenue streams. It’s part of a long-term play at making streaming a primary business for WarnerMedia that’s been accelerated by the effects of the pandemic. This does come with some downfalls that are impossible to ignore: In 2019, Warner Bros. was the top earner for WarnerMedia, bringing in $14.4 billion — just under 50 percent of all revenues within the division. Some of it was from the box office, but a lot of it came from home video purchases and syndication. Since HBO Max is paying Warner Bros. for the rights to the films, it’s not additional revenue but shifting catalogs between one WarnerMedia property to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GwrBPa"&gt;WarnerMedia has been having problems growing its streaming service as fast as competitors like Disney. Part of that is that HBO Max is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324139/peacock-roku-amazon-fire-tv-hbo-max-streaming-warnermedia-nbcuniversal-disney-apple"&gt;not available on Roku&lt;/a&gt; (something the team is working on), but part of it is a lack of event-type films to bring people in. By moving titles to HBO Max at the same time they’re in theaters, WarnerMedia gives current subscribers a reason to stay, and it’s hoping large swaths of new customers will sign up and keep paying $15 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lc8APG"&gt;“We’re going to have some really good content here that’s spoiling and can be used for other purposes,” AT&amp;amp;T CEO John Stankey said in an interview &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/12/att-john-stankey-warner-bros-hbo-max-streaming-windows-1234650649/"&gt;with &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPJWNe"&gt;Disney saw similar success with &lt;em&gt;Hamilton&lt;/em&gt;, a movie that brought in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21318731/disney-hamilton-streaming-numbers-parks-world-reopening-bob-chapek-meeting"&gt;large number of Disney Plus subscribers&lt;/a&gt;, and the number of people canceling their subscriptions remained relatively low even months after. If WarnerMedia can recreate that success — signing up millions of people every month with a big title, without seeing them later unsubscribe — could the long-term recurring revenue offset initial losses and put HBO Max in a truly competitive spot with other streaming platforms? That seems to be part of the bet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ToTBfg"&gt;2021 is going to be a rough year for studios regardless of the pandemic. There are currently 55 major features scheduled to open in 2021. Between May 28th and July 16th — a period of seven weeks that features big releases from every major studio — there are several blockbusters competing for people’s attention and money. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="731mse"&gt;Warner Bros.’ &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong &lt;/em&gt;will take on Disney’s &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;in early May, and then there’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21176895/fast-and-furious-f9-delay-universal-coronavirus-vin-diesel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F9&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; In the Heights&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Venom: Let There be Carnage&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; Top Gun: Maverick&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21437889/black-widow-delayed-release-date-marvel-cinematic-universe-disney-streaming-mulan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528606/tom-holland-nathan-drake-first-photo-uncharted-movie-sony"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to name a few more. Warner Bros. has 17 movies in 2021 — not all of those were going to be $800 million to $1 billion successes. Some may have actually lost money. This helps build a streaming business, even if it means sacrificing a few that may have done very well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lMgx1y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;2021 is going to be a rough year for studios regardless of the pandemic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HRKxPt"&gt;As 2021 currently stands, most movies are going to lose out because the competition is too big in a tight space. Plus, theaters may still be operating at far less capacity (&lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/movie-theater-chains-limiting-salescoronavirus-1203534095/"&gt;as recommended by the CDC&lt;/a&gt;) in COVID-19 times, locations could remain closed in prime markets like New York City and Los Angeles, and people still might not feel comfortable returning to theaters. Add in that attendance was dwindling before the pandemic: in 2019, movie theater attendance per capita was at a century low, the number of young people going to theaters throughout the year is declining (despite this being the bracket that consumes the most content), and more than half of “frequent” moviegoers have stopped going as much, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ballmatthew/status/1334906762030444544"&gt;analyst Matthew Ball&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZoB6Ld"&gt;WarnerMedia and AT&amp;amp;T were likely planning for losses regardless of skipping theaters, but it seems like they’re trying to reposition some of that loss into potential impactful growth for HBO Max. Christopher Nolan’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/20/21330990/christopher-nolan-tenet-warner-bros-online-release-streaming-theaters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tenet&lt;/em&gt; showed&lt;/a&gt; that there’s room for studios to take different approaches internationally and in the US. Internationally, where more theaters were open and coronavirus cases weren’t as large, the movie performed well, &lt;a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1442940417/weekend/"&gt;generating $300.4 million&lt;/a&gt;, but in the United States the film only amassed $57 million. Growing HBO Max in the United States and exploring more traditional revenue options internationally is a combination executives seem willing to take a bet on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJ9zwd"&gt;No one really knows if this is going to work. Shareholders don’t, executives don’t, industry insiders don’t — but people know &lt;em&gt;something &lt;/em&gt;has to happen. WarnerMedia isn’t in a position to hope for the best with its movies while also trying to figure out how to grow HBO Max. The simplest thing to do — not the easiest, and not necessarily the most immediately beneficial — is to take a year of likely losses theatrically and use it to scale HBO Max as quickly as possible in 12 months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31Q5P3"&gt;Don’t be surprised when Disney announces it’s doing something similar next week. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Chrome OS 87 adds tab search and Bluetooth device battery levels</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XSyh4Gp5-A_DOZHumUroFm37Hg0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68459084/acastro_180416_1777_chrome_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kFp7dl"&gt;Chrome OS 87 is &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chromebook/thread/86837545?hl=en"&gt;rolling out now&lt;/a&gt;, and it adds a few nice features to help you while browsing the web and when using Bluetooth accessories (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/04/chrome-os-87/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrW2LZ"&gt;One new addition in Chrome OS 87 is tab search. I typically have dozens of tabs open at any given time, so I could see how tab search might be a really handy way to find something I’ve lost in the process. Google is also adding tab search to the desktop version of Chrome, though the company said &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/chrome/faster-chrome/"&gt;in mid-November&lt;/a&gt; that the feature would be coming first to Chromebooks and to other desktop platforms “soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/owkKL_SidDuZmsFxcVkCuw47EFM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22145633/USE_Chrome_TabSearch_Still.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what tab search looks like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="B1gFrF"&gt;Chrome OS 87 can also now show you the battery levels of Bluetooth devices that you have connected to your computer (such as wireless headphones) in the Settings and Quick Settings menus. I often use a similar feature on my Mac to know when I might need to charge up my AirPods, so I think this could be really useful on Chrome OS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7mJqF4"&gt;Google has also added 36 new wallpapers from four different artists to Chrome OS 87.&lt;/p&gt;
