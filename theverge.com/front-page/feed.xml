    <title>Amazon’s capable Halo fitness tracker is 25 percent off</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AXNs0i7n1pAFf1oTzOR0DwPkGbY=/0x0:3750x2500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68627583/Halo_App_and_Halo_Band.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Olo46s"&gt;If you’re feeling swept up in New Year’s resolutions for getting fit and want a device that’s going to hold you accountable to meet your goals, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PMT4T11?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon’s Halo tracker is $25 off its usual $100 price&lt;/a&gt;. All sizes and colors are the same price. The Halo was actually about $10 cheaper when it first launched, but this is the next-best deal. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;In case you don’t know much about this product&lt;/a&gt;, it’s a tracker that can monitor more granular metrics than most fitness devices, like the tone of your voice and a general approximation of how much overall body fat you have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ka0uwT"&gt;To get all of the features Halo offers, you’ll need a subscription. You’ll get six months for free with purchase. After that, it’s $3.99 per month if you want to continue. If not, then the Halo will just track sleep, heart rate, and step tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Aukey 10W wireless charger" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f7AlSCulBXx2x9Y-SUCGSAaG_90=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217270/aukeywirelesscharger.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8RuHeR"&gt;Aukey is offering a limited time deal on one of its wireless charging stands that has multiple coils, simultaneously supporting a phone (oriented vertically or horizontally) and, say, a set of wireless earbuds like AirPods or Galaxy Buds Live resting around the back of it. By clipping the on-page coupon that knocks 5 percent off the cost and applying the 35 percent of extra savings (click the “1 Applicable Promotion” drop-down to redeem), &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08NCDVG59?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this charger drops down in price to just over $16 before tax&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGeC47"&gt;A few things worth noting are that this wireless charger doesn’t include a power brick, so you’ll have to supply your own. Also, it tops out at 10W of charging speed for most Android phones, while iPhones (aside from the iPhone 12 mini since its coil doesn’t align properly, says Aukey) that support Qi charging will charge at 7.5W, and Pixel phones and AirPods max out at 5W. Basically, get this to keep your devices topped up throughout the day, not to quickly recharge things before leaving the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JSXyeC"&gt;This deal lasts until January 12th at 2:59AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="sn4vn2"&gt;The OnePlus Nord N10 5G is an affordable 5G-ready phone with a 90Hz refresh rate display that, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22214280/oneplus-nord-n10-5g-review"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Allison Johnson&lt;/a&gt;, could be worth the money for you. It’s available starting on Friday in the US, and on launch day, you’ll be able to get the OnePlus Buds Z wireless earbuds for free with purchase. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oneplus.com%2Foneplus-n10-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F1%2F6%2F22216753%2Famazon-halo-fitness-tracker-aukey-wireless-qi-charger-oneplus-nord-n10-5g-deal-sale#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;That’s a lot of tech for $300&lt;/a&gt; before tax.

    <title>Georgia’s runoff may have saved net neutrality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vFQv0Mx2gLmySD4_vlr1l2GZm00=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68627573/acastro_170711_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Throttling could be much harder under a Democratic Senate&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PwMfbP"&gt;Tuesday night was a good night for Democrats. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="p-large-text" id="pQLwxK"&gt;Votes are still being tallied and no one has conceded, but it seems &lt;a href="https://results.decisiondeskhq.com/"&gt;all but certain&lt;/a&gt; that Democratic candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff have won election to the US Senate, putting the chamber under 50-50 Democratic control. It’s a huge shift in what’s possible for Democrats and policymakers are already discussing policies that seemed impossible on Monday, like $2,000 direct stimulus payments or a new voting rights act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jjiSkw"&gt;But while the wins will have impacts across the Democratic platform, they may have particularly strong effects on net neutrality. Before Georgia, net neutrality advocates were &lt;a href="https://www.brookings.edu/blog/techtank/2020/12/03/what-to-expect-from-a-biden-fcc-on-section-230-net-neutrality-and-5g/"&gt;facing a gridlock in Congress&lt;/a&gt; and the frightening possibility that the incoming president wouldn’t be able to appoint his own FCC commissioners. But as the Senate falls back under Democratic control, the possibilities for net neutrality have expanded dramatically. Now, Democrats can push for more progressive FCC nominees that will reinstate the net neutrality rules from 2015, or even push for legislation that would write net neutrality into law. Flipping these two Senate seats could make the difference between keeping net neutrality in a permanent legal limbo and making it the law of the land.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HF173b"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The FCC shouldn’t wait for Congress”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oAVkr6"&gt;Already, net neutrality advocates are barely containing their excitement. Reached for comment, Fight for the Future’s Evan Greer laid out a laundry list of progressive goals that can now be pursued, from overturning FCC Chairman Ajit Pai’s order to implementing more aggressive privacy and connectivity policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjTTwk"&gt;“If Democrats take the Senate they should move quickly to confirm an FCC chair who will make it their first order of business to restore the Title II open Internet protections,” Greer said in a statement. “But they should also do more than that. The FCC can and should take steps to protect people’s privacy, and to ensure that everyone can afford Internet access during a time when many are working from home and sending their kids to school online.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HWHwQY"&gt;In a similar vein, Public Knowledge CEO Chris Lewis focused on getting a fair hearing for bills like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18304522/net-neutrality-save-the-internet-act-house-of-representatives-approval"&gt;the Save the Internet Act&lt;/a&gt;, which have largely been blocked by the Republican Senate. “The Senate has made noise about enshrining rules into law for the past two years without any action — not even a public hearing,” said Lewis. “The FCC shouldn’t wait for Congress to grow the political will to act to restore strong net neutrality rules. There is broad support for this in the country across partisan divides.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="imx5II"&gt;The net neutrality fight has mostly been in a stalemate since 2017, when Pai &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/11/17439456/net-neutrality-dead-ajit-pai-fcc-internet"&gt;passed the Restoring Internet Freedom Order&lt;/a&gt;, repealing the 2015 Open Internet Order on a straight party-line vote. There were significant legal challenges to Pai’s order — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20898779/fcc-net-neutrality-court-of-appeals-decision-ruling"&gt;most notably from Mozilla&lt;/a&gt; — but the basic facts of the order remained in place. Under Pai’s rule, the FCC doesn’t have much authority to regulate practices like throttling, zero-rating, and data caps. As long as that order is in place, fighting carrier misbehavior will fall to the FTC and the states, both of which are stretched too thin to put up much of a fight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="owWeDv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;new legislation could write Title II rules permanently into law&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="46mhqQ"&gt;In a normal congress, a Democratic president would spell trouble for Pai’s order. When he takes office, Biden will have control over FCC appointments, which typically means Democrats would control the commission’s majority (determining the chairperson and three of the five seats on the commission). Restoring the Open Internet Order would be as simple as appointing progressive commissioners and holding a vote. But Republicans were &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/trump-fcc-pick-fight-senate-c53a6099-7684-4994-9b5b-a83a8d22b180.html"&gt;preparing to block FCC appointments&lt;/a&gt; in exchange for concessions, effectively giving them veto power over the agency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJrNjU"&gt;The result was a tough choice for the Biden administration: either nominate moderate Democrats who wouldn’t repeal the Pai order or resign themselves to a gridlocked FCC without the vote to do anything at all. It was a grim choice for net neutrality advocates; either option would leave the Pai order in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVdwTl"&gt;But this morning, the state of play looks very different. With Warnock and Ossoff in the Senate, the chamber will be split 50-50, with VP-elect Kamala Harris passing the deciding vote. That will give Democrats control of crucial oversight committees and make it far easier to shepherd Democratic nominees through confirmation hearings. In short, Biden can nominate who he wants, and Senate Democrats can make sure they’re legally appointed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="OBWpBi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;How much will Biden care about net neutrality?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RWcQW2"&gt;Progressive ambitions don’t stop at the FCC. A new FCC order would put net neutrality rules in place, but it could still be overturned by the next Republican president, and flipping back and forth with each administration isn’t anyone’s ideal telecom policy. The real win would be new legislation that would write Title II rules permanently into law, something that couldn’t be overturned by the next Republican FCC. House Democrats have passed bills to do just that, although they crashed as soon they hit the Republican Senate. It’s hard to say whether moderate Democrats like Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) or Joe Manchin (D-WV) would go along with such a move, and a compromise bill might end up with something much milder than full Title II protection. But for the first time, that kind of lasting legislative victory is possible, and it will be a major focus for advocates over the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2iSaUI"&gt;There are still some important caveats to this victory. Democratic control of the Senate isn’t a done deal: neither Republican candidate has conceded, and it’s not settled what kind of power-sharing arrangement will emerge from the 50-50 Senate. There is still room for all kinds of obstruction, and Senate Democrats shouldn’t count chickens before they’re hatched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="2ZEKdw"&gt;Most importantly, we don’t know how much the Biden administration will care about net neutrality. It was a non-issue in the campaign, crowded out by the chaos of Trump, and the president-elect hasn’t made any clear statements about where he stands on it. As soon as the election was over, right-wing analysts were &lt;a href="https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/3-reasons-why-biden-will-kill-off-net-neutrality/"&gt;predicting that Biden would abandon the fight entirely&lt;/a&gt;, finding it not worth the political costs. Progressives will keep fighting, some from inside the White House, but it is too early to know if they’ll win. Georgia has given Biden the chance to save net neutrality; now the question is whether he will take it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon will spend $2 billion to try to fix affordable housing crises in three major employment hubs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w7eTCRGUpMRbuT592TZZFE-vI8U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68627424/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YtFsXU"&gt;Amazon has pledged to &lt;a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-launches-2-billion-housing-equity-fund-make-over-20000"&gt;spend more than $2 billion&lt;/a&gt; over the next five years to build tens of thousands of affordable housing units in three of the e-commerce giant’s major employment hubs, underscoring the ongoing housing crises affecting parts of the US where large, high-paying tech employers reside. Amazon’s pledge, announced on Wednesday, follows similar commitments from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948085/apple-ca-housing-crisis-pledge-2-5-billion-silicon-valley"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/22/20927060/facebook-billion-dollar-pledge-affordable-housing-crisis-california-bay-area"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18683827/google-silicon-valley-housing-crisis-1-billion-investment-sf-bay-area"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;, all of which previously promised between $1 billion and $2.5 billion each to tackle similar issues plaguing the San Francisco Bay Area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DtVDt3"&gt;The parts of the US Amazon plans to invest in include Washington state’s Puget Sound region that encompasses Seattle, as well as Arlington, Virginia and Nashville, Tennessee where Amazon has opened fast-growing offices. The company employs more than 75,000 people in the Puget Sound region alone thanks to its headquarters in the state, and it has around 1,000 employees each in Virginia and Tennessee with plans to expand those workforces to more than 5,000 employees in each sector. (These numbers do not include Amazon’s much larger warehouse, seasonal, and contract workforce that push its employment figures over 1 million people &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/29/amazon-hiring-pandemic-holidays/"&gt;as of October of last year&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VsB87I"&gt;Amazon’s announcement may once have included planned investment for New York City, after lawmakers cut a deal with the company in early 2019 to bring jobs to Long Island City, Queens as part of a highly publicized competition of sorts the company held to attract bids from municipalities around the country. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/15/18225560/amazon-hq2-new-york-city-queens-long-island-city"&gt;fierce backlash from local residents and criticism from politicians&lt;/a&gt;, including US Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18224993/amazon-hq-2-queens-new-york-backlash-pulls-drops"&gt;led Amazon to scrap its controversial NYC plans&lt;/a&gt; and instead focus on expansions of its Arlington and Nashville offices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RvqppM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon’s pledge follows similar ones from Apple, Facebook, and Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="poJli2"&gt;“Amazon has a long-standing commitment to helping people in need, including the Mary’s Place family shelter we built inside our Puget Sound headquarters. The shelter now supports over 200 women and children experiencing homelessness every night,” Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement. “This new $2 billion Housing Equity Fund will create or preserve 20,000 affordable homes in all three of our headquarters regions—Arlington, Puget Sound, and Nashville. It will also help local families achieve long-term stability while building strong, inclusive communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9VHmT"&gt;Amazon is spending its money mostly in the form of low-cost loans, starting with nearly $382 million to the Washington Housing Conservancy to “preserve and create up to 1,300 affordable homes on the Crystal House property in Arlington” and $185.5 million to King County Housing Authority for an additional 1,000 affordable homes in the state of Washington. Amazon plans to announce additional investments in both regions, as well as Nashville, in the coming months and years. The pledge also includes $125 million in cash grants to small businesses, nonprofits, and minority-led organizations, with the goal of helping them “build a more inclusive solution to the affordable housing crisis.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYLOxV"&gt;The unspoken reality of these large housing pledges is that tech companies often play a major role in gentrification and displacement of local communities. That’s often through a complex interplay of factors related to disproportionately high wages and unmatched benefits that allow employees to live in and around city centers despite sometimes working in more rural or suburban settings, where housing is cheaper and in less demand. And as part of its long-term strategy to help attract and retain talent, a company like Amazon has an incentive to make the urban centers and regions it turns into major employment hubs more affordable places to live. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uA4wQU"&gt;One major goal is to avoid driving away employees who can’t afford to live somewhere like Seattle or, in the case of companies like Facebook and Google, in San Francisco or Silicon Valley. Another goal is to help alleviate the pressure from politicians and activists who often criticize tech companies and their workforces for doing little to give back to the communities within which they build their companies. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>More than half of Americans turned to video games during lockdown</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Animal Crossing: New Horizons" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QYMgG3dKAhc7NfJnfgBot5dr21w=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68627064/Switch_ACNH_0220_Direct_OnlinePlay_SCRN_02_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X9nH4Y"&gt;With 2020 consumed almost entirely by the COVID-19 pandemic, more than half of US residents turned to video games to fill the time. According to Nielsen company SuperData’s 2020 year in review, 55 percent of people picked up video games — out of boredom, to escape the real world, to socialize — during the first phase of lockdowns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Lj9m8"&gt;The shift points to a larger one in entertainment. Movie theaters, sports, plays, and more have been largely inaccessible, if not outright dangerous to public health. Just as streaming, both of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21257227/coronavirus-streamelements-arsenalgg-twitch-youtube-livestream-numbers"&gt;Twitch&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21195358/streaming-netflix-disney-hbo-now-youtube-twitch-amazon-prime-video-coronavirus-broadband-network"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt; variety, became a huge source of entertainment, so did games — especially for adults. According to SuperData, 66 percent of consumers from 18 to 24 played more console games, while 60 percent played more mobile titles. Unsurprisingly, buyers also tended toward digital purchases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4Bgqg"&gt;SuperData reports that 27 percent of people — about 1 in 4 — played games to stay in touch with each other. In 2020, games like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21179238/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-nintendo-switch-features"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; became cultural touchstones. &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21185608/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-coronavirus-escape-interview"&gt;&lt;em&gt;the&lt;/em&gt; hit&lt;/a&gt; of the early pandemic, while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21453499/among-us-2-sequel-popular-canceled-developers-innersloth"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;had nearly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22196330/among-us-half-billion-players-november"&gt;half a billion&lt;/a&gt; players in November alone. Politicians like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/16/21519505/joe-biden-animal-crossing-new-horizons-biden-hq-campaign-election"&gt;Joe Biden&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21526164/aoc-among-us-twitch-debut-top-concurrent-viewers"&gt;Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez&lt;/a&gt; capitalized on their popularity to raise awareness for the year’s presidential election. Even &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; managed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/19/22189424/pokemon-go-covid-2020-safety"&gt;adapt to the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; and grow 39 percent year over year, thanks to Niantic’s updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zVJmNY"&gt;As physical spaces disappeared, video games became one of the few places for people to spend time together — whether that was to enjoy virtual concerts in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, learn &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/26/21534483/minecraft-voting-rock-the-vote-election-2020"&gt;how to vote&lt;/a&gt;, or just hang out. SuperData estimates that digital games alone garnered $126.6 billion over the course of the year. The numbers may not spike this year as much as they did in 2020, but SuperData predicts “the long-term habits formed during lockdown are here to stay.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook ordered to pay $4.7M to Italian developer over copycat feature </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0CGYtUPzwPuuZxajZxc_nrr6YX4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68626815/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M8UyN3"&gt;Facebook has been ordered to pay €3.83 million (around $4.72 million) in damages to an Italian developer over the social network’s “Nearby” feature. &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-italy-facebook-court-idUSKBN29A1YW?taid=5ff4e4fa5b2aa00001d6a018&amp;amp;utm_campaign=trueAnthem:+Trending+Content&amp;amp;utm_medium=trueAnthem&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that the Milan-based appeals court upheld a 2019 ruling saying Facebook had copied the feature from developer Business Competence’s Faround app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNbqXG"&gt;The case dates back to 2012. That year, Business Competence launched Faround which was designed to help users find Facebook friends near their location. The app quickly gained ground in the Italian market, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-lawsuit-italy-idUSKBN16D2AI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters &lt;/em&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt;. However, just months later, Facebook launched its own Nearby feature, which also competed with the likes of Foursquare and Yelp, and downloads of Faround reportedly plummeted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YVcMCM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The original complaint was filed in 2013&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KIYflg"&gt;The Italian software developer responded by filing a lawsuit in 2013, and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-lawsuit-italy-idUSKBN16D2AI"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that the court issued a preliminary ruling in its favor in 2016, which was made public in 2017. Facebook agreed to discontinue the feature in Italy while it appealed the ruling, but subsequent courts have sided with Business Competence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D641rN"&gt;Responding to the decision, a Facebook spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; that the company had “received the court’s decision” and is “examining it carefully.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Edge history and tab sync features finally start rolling out</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5KcrqrceDqYr2gGDLWy_22y1Ogw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68626711/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pW4tVu"&gt;Microsoft is finally starting to roll out history and tab sync for its Edge browser. After nearly a year since its initial release, some Microsoft Edge users now see the full web history and tab sync features available in their browsers. The roll out is gradual, but you can check to see if it’s available in your country by navigating to settings &amp;gt; profiles &amp;gt; sync and enabling “history” and “open tabs” in the options. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E98nQw"&gt;Not every country has access to the additional sync features just yet, but we understand the UK is one of the first markets that will see history and tab sync initially. These new features will let Edge users sync all web pages they’ve visited to additional Windows 10 or macOS devices, or even to the mobile versions of Edge for iOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/va_8QLd2392l97B3QEX_3Qr010U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217119/y6GLYpJ.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OGOYA5"&gt;You will need to head into the settings section on all devices you use Edge with to manually enable the history and open tabs features, though. This includes the mobile versions, where you’ll have to toggle open tabs and history, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dp2uov"&gt;Microsoft initially launched Edge on January 15th, 2020 without many important sync options enabled. Extensions sync arrived in May, and Microsoft originally promised history and tab sync would start rolling out in the summer. The web history and tab sync eventually started rolling out to &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/improvements-to-history-in-microsoft-edge/m-p/1896552"&gt;beta and dev channels&lt;/a&gt; of the browser in late November, and are now appearing in the stable channel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXtvWQ"&gt;Microsoft continues to improve Edge on a regular basis, recently adding a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507374/microsoft-edge-price-comparisons-screenshot-tool-features"&gt;really useful screenshot tool&lt;/a&gt; and a price comparisons feature. Edge will also soon be updated with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199819/microsoft-edge-vertical-tabs-feature-chromium"&gt;vertical tabs&lt;/a&gt; and new &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/use-password-monitor-to-help-protect-your-passwords-online/m-p/1487025"&gt;password breach&lt;/a&gt; notifications.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon reportedly developing radar-equipped sleep apnea tracker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/09iOEfgiStTH11yFcxQaNrDzNbU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68626667/acastro_180510_1777_alexa_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4I6JgE"&gt;Amazon is developing a new Alexa-powered device that can track and monitor for signs of sleep apnea using radar, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-plans-a-new-sleep-apnea-device-powered-by-alexa-2021-1?international=true&amp;amp;amp;r=US&amp;amp;amp;IR=T"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The palm-sized device is reportedly designed to sit on a bedside table and use millimeter-wave radar to sense your breathing, keeping an eye out for interruptions associated with the apnea sleeping disorder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ki5cPx"&gt;The idea of using radar to monitor sleep &lt;a href="https://www.idigitalhealth.com/news/radar-monitors-sleep-accuracy-comparable-current-standards/"&gt;isn’t new&lt;/a&gt;, and at least one other high profile company has attempted to commercialize the technology. Way back in 2014 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/29/7130229/nintendo-qol-sleep-tracking-device"&gt;Nintendo announced&lt;/a&gt; a “non-wearable” device that could track sleep via radio waves. However, less than two years later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/4/10920582/nintendo-sleep-tracker-qol-possibly-canceled"&gt;Nintendo said&lt;/a&gt; it wasn’t confident the device could become a viable product, and it was never released. Last month we also saw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22189219/oneplus-8t-concept-color-changing-back-motion-sensing-radar"&gt;OnePlus announce a new concept phone&lt;/a&gt; that used mmWave radar to monitor breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8OVjLj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Developed under the code name “Brahms”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hyjLUx"&gt;Amazon’s project is apparently being developed under the code name “Brahms” after the German composer of &lt;em&gt;Lullaby&lt;/em&gt;, and is the work of an internal Amazon team built up over the past year. In its current form, the device reportedly resembles a “standing hexagonal pad connected to a metal wire base,” &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt; notes. Along with sleep apnea, Amazon reportedly plans to use its machine-learning and cloud technology to understand other sleeping disorders beyond sleep apnea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F7Hmrs"&gt;Amazon declined to comment on the existence of the project to &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;, and a spokesperson was not immediately available to respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rKlyBZ"&gt;If accurate, Brahms represents Amazon’s latest push into health tech. Last year the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174145/amazon-halo-fitness-tracker-voice-buy"&gt;released its Halo fitness tracker&lt;/a&gt;, a $99.99 wearable device that scans the wearer’s body and voice and is designed to help you improve your health. Amazon stresses that Halo is “not a medical device.” The company has also launched a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571091/amazon-pharmacy-store-launch-home-delivery-prescription-medication"&gt;Pharmacy service&lt;/a&gt; for delivering prescription medication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8yiRZ3"&gt;At this point it’s almost easier to list objects that Amazon hasn’t tried to build its voice assistant into. Over the past few years Alexa has appeared in everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;speakers&lt;/a&gt; (obviously) to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22197463/amazon-echo-frames-review-alexa"&gt;glasses&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/25/20884044/amazon-echo-loop-smart-ring-hands-on-photos-alexa"&gt;rings&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/20/17882140/amazon-basics-microwave-alexa-2018-smart-features-price-release-date"&gt;microwaves&lt;/a&gt;. Soon, we might be able to add a sleep-tracker to that list.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LG’s newest cordless vac automatically empties itself</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Otaqg60OcKhDy_N7C9G5E_ZG0bM=/0x257:1805x1460/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68626532/2021_LG_CordZero_and_Charging_Station_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The charging stand can also store its accessories.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: LG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hvHXMq"&gt;LG’s new vacuum cleaner, the ridiculously named &lt;a href="http://www.lgnewsroom.com/2021/01/newest-lg-cordzerothinq-vac-with-new-charging-station-delivers-hassle-free-cleaning-experience/"&gt;LG CordZeroThinQ A9 Kompressor Plus&lt;/a&gt;, should be a little easier to empty than most cordless vacuums. Its charging station is equipped with a “fully-automated dust removal system,” which sucks the contents of the vac’s dustbin into a dust bag as the device charges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6tBYB"&gt;We’ve seen similar auto-emptying features in robot vacuum cleaners like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/6/17817220/irobot-roomba-i7-robot-vacuum-empties-itself-maps-house"&gt;iRobot Roomba i7 Plus&lt;/a&gt; before, but LG’s solution is more unique in the world of cordless stick vacuums. Samsung sells a &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/au/home-appliance-accessories/clean-station-white-vca-sae90b-sa/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Clean Station&lt;/a&gt; to work with its upright vacuum cleaner, but using it involves first detaching the vacuum’s dustbin, rather than it happening automatically during charging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YNq3Fn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Honey, did you charge the LG CordZeroThinQ A9 Kompressor Plus?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kxQgIe"&gt;As someone who frequently has to reach up into the dustbin of his Dyson V10 vacuum to get all the crud out, I can see the appeal of automating the process. But for bigger jobs, like vacuuming a whole house or apartment, you’re probably going to have to empty the LG CordZeroThinQ A9 Kompressor Plus mid-clean rather than waiting to automatically empty it when it charges. Hopefully the charging station’s dust bags are big enough (and cheap enough) that it doesn’t need to be emptied too often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hMJvzH"&gt;As well as emptying its dustbin, LG says the touchscreen-equipped charging stand can also house the vacuum’s six accessories and nozzles, like existing stick vacuum chargers from Dyson and Xiaomi. LG’s attachments include a 2-in-1 combination tool, a crevice tool, a pet nozzle, a power carpet nozzle, and a power mop. Included with the vacuum are two battery packs and removable washable filters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M83G0M"&gt;LG’s press release doesn’t say how much all of this is going to cost or when it’ll be available. However, it promises the LG CordZeroThinQ A9 Kompressor Plus will be on display at its virtual booth at this year’s virtual CES, so stay virtually tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google confirms plans for new Nest Cam lineup this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rV0wepCu7uN9aQWUZ1pXdlAGQ2o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68626373/vpavic_180605_2644_0027.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VWS1VN"&gt;The Nest Cam IQ Outdoor is no longer available to buy, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/05/new-google-nest-cam/"&gt;Google has confirmed to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, after the site &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/01/05/nest-cam-iq-outdoor-stock/"&gt;noticed&lt;/a&gt; that the camera was out of stock in most countries around the world. The company says, however, that “Nest will keep investing in new innovations” including a “new lineup of security cameras for 2021.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ZKjsF"&gt;For now, Google still sells the $129 &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_cam_specs?hl=en-US"&gt;Nest Cam Indoor&lt;/a&gt;, the $299 &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_cam_iq_specs?hl=en-US"&gt;Next Cam IQ Indoor&lt;/a&gt;, and the $199 &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_cam_outdoor?hl=en-US"&gt;Nest Cam Outdoor&lt;/a&gt;. The IQ models have upgraded video quality and AI-based features like face and pet recognition. Google says it will continue to support its existing Nest cameras with new features and security updates. None of the current hardware is newer than 2017, though, so an upgrade is probably overdue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="fBQvaN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best indoor home security camera you can buy","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/8/17431074/best-home-security-camera-amazon-nest-price-features-buy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="C4T4B1"&gt;Google didn’t provide any details on what the new Nest Cam lineup will actually include, nor when it will arrive, but it’s not necessarily surprising to see the company get ahead of the announcement. The Pixel 4A 5G and Pixel 5 were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/3/21352032/google-pixel-5-4a-5g-price-release-date-specs"&gt;revealed&lt;/a&gt; months ahead of their actual shipping date, while Google tweeted out an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/12/18663172/google-pixel-4-camera-sensor-design-official-photo"&gt;early picture&lt;/a&gt; of the Pixel 4 the year before in an attempt to pre-empt inevitable leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="60Yvlr"&gt;Google also appears to be working on a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22213539/google-nest-hub-update-fcc-filing-soli-motion-sense-gestures"&gt;new Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt; with Soli radar gesture support, as indicated by a recent FCC filing.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="RvsrUa"&gt;Gabe Teninbaum, a professor at Suffolk University Law School, is calling on ExamSoft to fix a serious bug with its test-taking software: failure to recognize faces. It’s a problem that can delay test takers — or bar them from starting their exams altogether — and per reports, it disproportionately impacts people with dark skin tones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9SeHOw"&gt;ExamSoft’s software records students while they complete remote exams and monitors for signs of academic dishonesty. &lt;a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=700081022092073114122122074086103089010076064020040013104092094123090083126113106025026057038062020002124108070084113123127122006010088060018030080006030068088069072040022094102026102116027021091116083106118019098029105028121030081105087087099117098&amp;amp;EXT=pdf&amp;amp;INDEX=TRUE"&gt;Teninbaum’s report&lt;/a&gt; addresses an ExamSoft feature called ExamID, which aims to verify that test-takers are who they say they are. The first time a student logs into their exam portal, they upload a photo of themselves (their “baseline image”); they’re then prompted to take another selfie before beginning future exams, which the software checks against their original photo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTCm5U"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/best-algorithms-struggle-recognize-black-faces-equally/"&gt;Research&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/26/17615634/amazon-rekognition-aclu-mug-shot-congress-facial-recognition"&gt;has found&lt;/a&gt; that facial-recognition algorithms consistently make more errors in identifying Black faces than they do white ones. And while those studies didn’t focus on ExamSoft specifically, it doesn’t appear to be an exception. Back in September, multiple non-white exam-takers told the &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/style/testing-schools-proctorio.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the software couldn’t identify them due to “poor lighting” — a problem that Teninbaum, who has light skin, wasn’t able to replicate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ExamSoft?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ExamSoft&lt;/a&gt; software can't "recognize" me due to "poor lighting" even though I'm sitting in a well lit room. Starting to think it has nothing to do with lighting. Pretty sure we all predicted their facial recognition software wouldn't work for people of color. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DiplomaPriv4All?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@DiplomaPriv4All&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Alivardi Khan (@uhreeb) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/uhreeb/status/1303139738065481728?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 8, 2020&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ExamSoft?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ExamSoft&lt;/a&gt;  I FINALLY figured out ON MY OWN 4 hours later ( still on hold for an EXAM SOFT chat rep) HOW TO GET TO MY MOCK EXAM... ONLY TO BE TOLD THE SYSTEM CANT RECOGNIZE ME. I AM IN A BOARD ROOM WITH ALL OF THE LIGHTS TURNED ON AND THE SUN WAS STILL UP. MAKE IT MAKE SENSE. &lt;a href="https://t.co/7K3yKT1y4n"&gt;pic.twitter.com/7K3yKT1y4n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Futureesq1990 (@futureesq1990) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/futureesq1990/status/1306393725099278336?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wjlQwj"&gt;Early this fall, Teninbaum set out to find a fix. He believes such errors add undue stress to an already stressful time period. “These are students who are about to take a high-stakes exam with a lot on the line, and that is very unwelcome,” Teninbaum said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4amm7Z"&gt;“Any time you go into an exam you just want to focus on the exam,” he added. “You don’t want to feel like you have these added challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYgJvT"&gt;Teninbaum also believes that optics matter; schools owe it to marginalized students not to rely on a category of software that’s known to be discriminatory. “Students deserve to feel that their institution is doing what it can to protect their rights, interests, and dignity,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJonjk"&gt;In his &lt;a href="https://poseidon01.ssrn.com/delivery.php?ID=700081022092073114122122074086103089010076064020040013104092094123090083126113106025026057038062020002124108070084113123127122006010088060018030080006030068088069072040022094102026102116027021091116083106118019098029105028121030081105087087099117098&amp;amp;EXT=pdf&amp;amp;INDEX=TRUE"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt;, which is forthcoming in &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Law&lt;/em&gt;, Teninbaum outlines the workaround he found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V41vtS"&gt;He suggests that schools assign every student an identical generic, baseline image. Then, he proposes, they should ask ExamSoft to enable “deferred identification,” a feature built into the software that allows students to proceed with exams even if identification fails. This feature is basically hidden — it’s not mentioned anywhere on ExamSoft’s website (at least, not that I could find). Only ExamSoft can turn it on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WkDTq4"&gt;In tandem, these tweaks will cause ExamSoft to misidentify every test-taker. But they’ll still be able to proceed with their exams — ExamSoft will send the selfies to the school afterwards, and instructors can manually verify everyone. “We know who our students are,” Teninbaum says. “We can make sure the students are who they say they are and avoid subjecting students to these sorts of challenges.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="upekb2"&gt;He also suggests that ExamSoft make the “deferred identification” feature accessible to customers. “The reporter urges ExamSoft to build this into a feature by which institutions can simply toggle on/off, thereby bypassing ExamID until such time that the technology matures into one that does not discriminate,” his report reads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63D7Sm"&gt;Teninbaum hopes those changes will last beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, and can help students feel more comfortable taking remote classes. “It’s going to be a growing problem as people get more and more online for their education,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KKFrR3"&gt;Even so, he’s only fixed part of the problem. Students have experienced a &lt;a href="https://www.law.com/2020/09/23/cheating-frozen-computers-typing-lags-bar-examinees-raise-red-flags-over-looming-online-test/?slreturn=20210005190302"&gt;range of hiccups&lt;/a&gt; with ExamSoft’s proctoring software. &lt;a href="https://www.abajournal.com/web/article/thousands-of-california-bar-exam-takers-have-video-files-flagged-for-review"&gt;Over 3,000&lt;/a&gt; people who used the platform to take California’s bar exam in October had their videos flagged for potential rule violations — nearly 36 percent of applicants who took the online exam. Users reported audio issues, and other technical glitches as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFGP0s"&gt;A group of six US senators — including Richard Blumenthal, Elizabeth Warren, and Corey Booker — wrote an open letter to&lt;a href="https://www.blumenthal.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/2020.12.3%20Letter%20to%20Ed%20Testing%20Software%20Companies%20ExamSoft.pdf"&gt; ExamSoft &lt;/a&gt;in December, highlighting potential harms to students of color and students with disabilities, among numerous other concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXnhCA"&gt;ExamSoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1v4GUL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
