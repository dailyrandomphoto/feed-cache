    <title>Peloton plans to launch an in-app video game where you pedal to control a rolling wheel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m3Jb2npjPRuV2gey-Td11xtcKX8=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69600097/Lanebreak___Gameplay___2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Peloton&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3S5OLB"&gt;Peloton is entering the video game business. Today the company announced its latest idea to get people to exercise: an in-app video game tentatively called Lanebreak. The game, which will only be available for Peloton bike owners and subscribers, involves riders changing their cadence and resistance to meet various goals and control an on-screen rolling wheel. Players can choose a difficulty level, the type of music they want to hear, and the duration of the track before starting. The game isn’t available yet, but a members-only beta will open later this year. Peloton hasn’t share details around how people will be able to sign up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2brPO"&gt;The game’s vibe and interface reminds me of the Rainbow Road in &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt;, with a track trailing off into the universe. It’s more or less the same on Lanebreak, except instead of controlling Mario, you’re pedaling to keep your tire moving and meet specific goals. There are three types of challenges and ways to earn points: Pickups, which means that so long as you’re in the lane that the game commands, you’ll earn points; Streams, which reward you based on your cadence; and Breakers, which reward you based on energy output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsJdq6"&gt;I only had a chance to test the game once on my bike, and personally, I found it boring and confusing to follow, especially compared to instructor-led classes. (I did a 10-minute class and was counting down the seconds until it was over.) However, this feedback also comes from someone who doesn’t play video games and prefers Peloton because of the various instructors’ personalities and music choices. But regardless of the game itself, the idea of a game for workouts is interesting and suggests Peloton is open to new types of content. It’s also especially interesting considering Netflix is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577868/netflix-video-games-confirmed-mike-verdu-ea-oculus-facebook"&gt;also building&lt;/a&gt; in-app video games. It seems both companies see that they need various content offerings to keep people in their apps longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DpjC82"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How Boosted went bust</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hoCXiCZZY0LvV9jyD6K0AOQqzYI=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69599836/VRG_4668_The_End_of_Boosted_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;An inside look at how the beloved electric skateboard startup fell apart&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="V2RgUj"&gt;Kanye wanted a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbP15Y"&gt;That was basically all a small group of employees at Boosted knew in early 2019 after they heard the rapper-mogul had &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Kanye/comments/b03nvf/kanye_brought_his_own_boosted_board_to_the/"&gt;taken an interest&lt;/a&gt; in the company’s electric skateboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5PqLzb"&gt;A partnership, an investment, an endorsement — whatever he was considering, a meeting with Kanye West seemed absurd. But then again, Boosted was also working on a secret project with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/1/21244818/boosted-boards-bikes-bullet-p2-scoot-little-ultimate-tony-hawk-birdhouse"&gt;skateboard legend Tony Hawk&lt;/a&gt; at the time. Was it really a stretch to think the startup could work with Yeezy?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5o6zNm"&gt;Apparently. Kanye spent the meeting — two, in fact, over the course of 2019 — focused more on his &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/09/11/entertainment/kanye-west-domes-trnd"&gt;ultimately doomed vision&lt;/a&gt; for sustainable cities than he did discussing a tangible deal with Boosted, two former employees tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. (Kanye could not be reached for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qq7vna"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Boosted’s carcass is still drawing buzzards&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WRVVWj"&gt;At the time of the Kanye meetings, Boosted had outgrown its Kickstarter roots, and had defined the market for electric longboards — which had emerged as part of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d42G01gZNwI"&gt;a rideables craze&lt;/a&gt; in the mid-2010s. The brand was potent, but the startup was losing focus. It wasn’t just Kanye’s off-topic meetings, though some employees felt they were symbolic. Boosted was just spread too thin. It had launched half a dozen models — each with different configurations — in just six years, on a shoestring budget. Then it was hit hard by the Trump administration’s tariffs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21036805/boosted-board-electric-skateboard-finances-money-cash-trouble-customer-service"&gt;on goods made in China&lt;/a&gt;, and a delayed electric scooter, and eventually ran out of money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gCKwMIfwQFTdw2qeQvZGoRb_FmQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22720509/Screen_Shot_2021_07_15_at_3.50.28_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Kim Kardashian / Instagram&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N3JN9Y"&gt;But while Boosted is dead, the beloved electric skateboard startup’s carcass is still drawing buzzards. Its biggest investor, the eponymous venture firm founded by &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/martins-beach-vinod-khosla-california-silicon-valley-tech-lawsuit-2020-1"&gt;surfer-fighting billionaire&lt;/a&gt; Vinod Khosla, has spent the last year waging a pair of lawsuits against Lime in an attempt to reverse the scooter-sharing giant’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21224164/lime-buys-boosted-electric-skateboard-scooter-acquistion-bankrupt"&gt;purchase of Boosted’s intellectual property&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RLLwRl"&gt;Khosla Ventures’ lawyers say Lime sabotaged a potential bailout of Boosted from Yamaha in late 2019 and conspired with Boosted’s biggest debt lender to rig the sale of the startup’s remains a few months later. Lime’s team has argued the powerhouse firm is simply raw about a “failed business negotiation” that ultimately couldn’t save a “dying business.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqZrJG"&gt;The fight likely won’t end for months. (A trial is tentatively scheduled for May 2022.) But interviews with six former Boosted employees, as well as an examination of the lawsuits, help reveal in the greatest detail yet just how the category-defining electric skateboard startup fell apart, and why seemingly nothing — not a partnership with Tony Hawk, the constant support of one of YouTube’s biggest stars, or even Kanye West — could save it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="YlxgTn"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="rR2ChE"&gt;Things weren’t always so dire at Boosted. The startup was one of Kickstarter’s &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/170315130/boosted-boards-the-worlds-lightest-electric-vehicl"&gt;earliest success stories&lt;/a&gt; after it transitioned out of a Stanford incubator in 2012. A few years later, Boosted’s electric longboard became the go-to vehicle for YouTube star Casey Neistat. It seemed like in every vlog he posted, there was Boosted’s board: hanging behind him on the wall of his studio, or under his feet as he carved through Manhattan traffic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GHBoRM"&gt;Neistat made Boosted so popular that it was hard for the startup to keep up with the orders that were pouring in. And co-founder Sanjay Dastoor attained cult status among the startup’s customers — not just because of the quality and popularity of the product, but because he was so hands-on that in 2016 he &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/we-talked-to-the-guy-whose-boosted-board-blew-up-1788560954"&gt;flew across the country to a board owner’s house&lt;/a&gt; to diagnose a battery failure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="tbHBXF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Boosted was a Kickstarter success, but it really blew up, thanks to Casey Neistat&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6532mA"&gt;But Dastoor handed over the company to Jeff Russakow in 2017, a fellow Stanford grad. With that changing of the guard came new, much bigger goals. “The company is just doing splendiferously well, and we’re looking forward to an exciting roadmap of many new form factors of light vehicles and other cool stuff,” he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/28/16212472/boosted-board-jeff-russakow-new-ceo-pivot"&gt;said at the time&lt;/a&gt;. Russakow told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; he wanted to “be able to move faster on innovation,” and do “two major product releases of some cool exciting announcement” per year — “an Apple-like cadence,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pQtZ8oBxdO2tBj6HyeapBF26SvI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22720386/GettyImages_1321702636.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iI6Bl3"&gt;Boosted rode this momentum for a while, and in early 2018 launched a second-generation board, along with a mini board and a high-performance variant called “Stealth” that eventually became its biggest hit. The startup then raised nearly $80 million by the end of 2018 from Khosla Ventures and others. In 2019 Russakow described that funding round &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18624220/boosted-rev-electric-scooter-specs-price-interview"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as being full of “really supportive investors” who are “absolutely committed to the vision of the company.” He used the money to take Boosted global, expanding the brand into more than 30 countries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LUWWDw"&gt;Boosted even started working with Birdhouse, the company run by perhaps the most famous skateboarder on the planet, Tony Hawk. The startup also discussed making a board for kids and tapped another pro skater, Andy Macdonald, to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRinPQfQZkw"&gt;work on the project&lt;/a&gt;. Boosted’s electric longboards had never really been a natural fit with skateboard culture, so validation from two of the sport’s icons felt, to some of the employees, like recognition of what they (and customers) already knew: that Boosted’s boards kicked ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zncfYv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;New CEO Jeff Russakow took Boosted global — but that required more money&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W5kVHq"&gt;By 2019, Russakow’s efforts to grow the company appeared to be working, too. It even drew interest from premium bike company Specialized, two of the former employees tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bKc4ao"&gt;But Boosted needed more money. The growth was eating up a lot of the revenue the company was generating in those new markets, and even cut into the money it had raised. Making matters worse, the company took a hit when then-President Donald Trump started a trade war with China. Boosted had outsourced manufacturing to China starting in 2016, and while Russakow &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18624220/boosted-rev-electric-scooter-specs-price-interview"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in May 2019&lt;/a&gt; that the startup had “the financial ability” to “eat” the tariff on the skateboards, it turns out that was easier said than done. (Boosted eventually applied for, and was granted, exclusions from the tariffs, but refunds for them were still outstanding when the startup went under.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tvTwjb"&gt;The pressure of maintaining this pace of growth — which was coming from Russakow but also from Khosla Ventures, the former employees say — had Boosted running ragged. What especially tripped things up, though, was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/15/18624220/boosted-rev-electric-scooter-specs-price-interview"&gt;Boosted Rev&lt;/a&gt;: the startup’s super-rugged, $1,600 electric scooter that debuted in early 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CTiGhg"&gt;Boosted announced the scooter just as its bank accounts started suffering, and almost immediately had to delay the rollout (in part because of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20699803/boosted-rev-electric-scooter-injury-broken-finger"&gt;an issue with the latch meant to keep it folded&lt;/a&gt;, but also because scaling up production was tricky). Khosla Ventures and Boosted’s other backers had just put money into the company — they didn’t want to add even more. So in May 2019, Boosted quietly turned to a “venture debt” firm called Structural Capital for what it hoped would be short-term help. The deal’s terms weren’t exactly favorable to Boosted: it had to use all its assets as collateral for an $18.5 million loan. Plus, if Boosted missed certain payments, Structural Capital could take control of parts of the business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iw4uO3"&gt;Boosted spent most of that loan in just a few months. So Boosted’s executives found themselves once again looking for money, just as the summer, their strongest sales period, was ending. In the meantime, Boosted started to delay payments to some vendors and began considering layoffs as early as September. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7dpz64"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A desperate deal with a “venture debt” firm in 2019 proved poisonous&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ee1dXv"&gt;Khosla Ventures and another investor, Activate Capital Partners, made a small loan in October to help keep the lights on while Boosted looked for a way out, court documents show. But it wasn’t enough to stop Structural Capital from taking control of the company’s purse strings. Now every expense had to be run by the venture debt firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hNIAJn"&gt;Employees quickly started to wonder how much longer Boosted had. The company no longer had access to its inventory, it stopped spending on advertising, and it certainly had no money to make any new products. Two former employees said they went on Thanksgiving break not knowing if there would be a company to go back to. That feeling of dread didn’t lift when they returned, though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kgUPPs"&gt;“We got stuck in this weird limbo land,” one former employee says. Some employees banded together to figure out what other sacrifices could be made to save money, like getting rid of free snacks and lunches (which Boosted eventually did) or giving up their company-subsidized Caltrain passes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="llU2K7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We got stuck in this weird limbo land.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KR4iKG"&gt;“The people at Boosted were great,” this person says. “Everyone felt very loyal to John [Ulmen, Dastoor’s co-founder, who remained with Boosted until the end] and wanted to stick it out. There was a lot of untapped potential with the brand. Everyone hung on longer than you’d expect because of that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hm0Ovq"&gt;At one point in mid December, one team inside Boosted was incorrectly told by their manager that everyone would be laid off the following morning. “Everyone panics. Rumors start flying. People are making sure they have their stuff backed up,” says the former employee. But when Russakow called the company together that following day, he swatted the idea down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VY6ELX"&gt;By that point, word had gotten around that something was going on with Lime, but most employees didn’t know what. The confusion ramped up when employees started taking jobs at Lime.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bs8T6T"&gt;“We would expect to get let go every Friday,” the former employee said. “Then paychecks would come through and people would be surprised.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="JFdzrJ"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sETnzn"&gt;In the days before Christmas 2019, Boosted’s executives hunkered at their office trying to engineer a way out of a small mountain of debt — who to fire and what to salvage to keep the company alive. Suddenly, Russakow and his team received news that seemed like a Christmas miracle: Japanese giant Yamaha was interested in buying them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b82OBV"&gt;Those executives had already spent most of December hammering out a deal with Lime that would allow the scooter-sharing giant to hire away a small group of core Boosted employees and license some of the intellectual property around their new scooter in exchange for $30 million worth of stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0Ow01G"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A Yamaha acquisition would have been transformational&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vp0LX5"&gt;That deal wouldn’t save the entire company, though, and it wasn’t done. A Yamaha acquisition, on the other hand, would have been transformational. It could have buttressed Russakow’s efforts to grow the startup and expand into new markets — moves supported by Khosla Ventures, which was looking for big returns on its investment, the former employees told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wl6vi2"&gt;A Yamaha deal could have helped Boosted diversify into new categories while shipping products it had waiting in the wings, like an electric bike and new versions of its electric skateboards. But Yamaha ultimately got cold feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cynpTx"&gt;The failed Yamaha deal is at the center of Khosla Ventures’ lawsuits, one of which was &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/khoslas-lawsuit-against-lime-shows-ugly-side-of-aborted-acqui-hires"&gt;previously reported by &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. (The Japanese conglomerate is never named in the lawsuits, instead referred to as the “Manufacturer.”) Khosla Ventures unequivocally blames Lime for Yamaha backing out in the lawsuits, which were recently consolidated into one case in San Francisco Superior Court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yr5qJK"&gt;Lawyers for the venture firm have argued that Lime poached Boosted employees while negotiations with Yamaha were ongoing — including the Boosted VP who was coordinating interviews with the people Lime might hire as part of that deal. Khosla’s lawyers also claim Lime coordinated with Structural Capital to freeze the startup’s bank accounts and force it into dissolution — effectively preventing the Yamaha deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gyVO9w"&gt;Lime “acted with malice by intending to cause injury to Boosted’s economic relationship with [Yamaha],” lawyers for Khosla Ventures &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717699/07411502.pdf"&gt;argued at one point&lt;/a&gt;. “Defendants engaged in wrongful, intentional acts designed to disrupt [Khosla Ventures] and Boosted from consummating an alternative transaction.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="yQ3CS8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Khosla Ventures accused Lime of sabotaging the Yamaha deal&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rEAut7"&gt;This all amounted to “sabotage,” Khosla Ventures &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717701/07229626.pdf"&gt;claimed in court&lt;/a&gt;. Boosted was losing crucial team members and access to cash, killing the Yamaha deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TzgHMp"&gt;Khosla Ventures claims there was another twist of the knife, too. Just before this all allegedly played out in January 2020, Lime had come back to Boosted with a revised offer: $15 million in company stock and more Boosted employees in exchange for the scooter IP. Khosla’s team said in court that this was more evidence Lime was up to no good: it struck up negotiations with Boosted under false pretenses in order to steal employees and other nonpublic information from a startup on the rocks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bTlRZ0"&gt;Khosla Ventures and Structural Capital did not respond to requests for comment. A Lime spokesperson declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dn1xKY"&gt;Khosla Ventures kept Boosted afloat through February with $2.4 million in bridge loans, but ultimately “decided not to fund Boosted any further” by the end of the month, according to one of the filings. The startup &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21165336/boosted-layoffs-money-funding-problems"&gt;laid off most employees shortly after&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEjr2H"&gt;In March 2020, Structural Capital moved to foreclose on what was left of Boosted. The venture debt firm wound up in control of all of Boosted’s assets since the startup had used them as collateral. Structural also had the right to liquidate those assets if Boosted violated any terms of the loan — something Khosla Ventures agreed to when that deal happened, according to court documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pjDZbM"&gt;Structural set up an auction for March 17th. It sent out a notice earlier in the month, which Khosla Ventures received. But one day before the sale happened, the San Francisco area  received a shelter-in-place order, as an attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19. Khosla says it didn’t attend the sale in order to comply with the public health order. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VVUfwu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Lime says there are “zero factual allegations” in Khosla Ventures’ lawsuit&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qgaVek"&gt;The auction went ahead anyway. There, Structural bought the rights to the tariff refund Boosted was waiting on from the government — a value in excess of $5 million — for just $400,000. Lime walked away with all of Boosted’s IP and remaining assets in exchange for 62 million shares of its stock. Khosla Ventures, Structural, and Lime were supposed to split the proceeds of any sale. But Khosla Ventures says Structural set up a new LLC that bought some of the assets — a move designed to dodge this contractually obligated proceed split.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9lv1J"&gt;Lime fought back hard against most of Khosla’s claims. During a hearing in the San Francisco lawsuit, one of Lime’s lawyers argued there was no agreement that Lime wouldn’t solicit or hire employees. He also said there were “zero factual allegations” in Khosla’s complaint to support the claim that Yamaha backed out because of Lime’s actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w5tuY9"&gt;“Your Honor, I — this is, I think, a truly kind of… kind of a mind-bending, in some ways, complaint, because… [Khosla Ventures’] alleges that Boosted was gonna fire these employees; that Boosted was under financial distress; that it, you know, was defaulting under the loan security agreement; that there was gonna be this massive bloodletting,” Lime’s lawyer said, according to &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717703/07537736.pdf"&gt;a transcript of the hearing&lt;/a&gt;. And yet, he continued, Khosla was trying to claim these employees were still valuable and that it held the right to take legal action against Lime for hiring them away. “It just simply doesn’t make any sense,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W8w7Qt"&gt;“It is odd, I’ll give you that,” judge Ethan P. Schulman responded. But, he said, “odd things happen in the world and give rise to lawsuit[s].”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="UvLKR8"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="YbhWkZ"&gt;Before the sale, the other shoe had finally dropped for employees in early March, when the building manager at Boosted’s San Francisco office was served an eviction notice. The company’s leadership told everyone to work from home, but just a few days after that, they laid everyone off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQgvr1"&gt;“We understand this news will come as a surprise to many of you, but unfortunately, developing, manufacturing, and maintaining electric vehicles is highly capital-intensive, and over the last year-and-a-half our business has faced an additional unplanned challenge with the high expense of the US-China tariff war,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21165336/boosted-layoffs-money-funding-problems"&gt;Russakow and Ulmen wrote&lt;/a&gt; on the company’s blog. (Russakow and Ulmen did not respond to requests to be interviewed for this story.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xZbRQf"&gt;Most of the employees who spoke to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; said they didn’t believe Boosted made obvious critical errors. Even the scooter, some said, could have been successful — especially if Boosted had survived through the first few months of the pandemic, after which the sales of bikes and scooters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/14/21258412/city-bike-lanes-open-streets-ebike-sales-bicyclist-pedestrian"&gt;skyrocketed&lt;/a&gt;. Lasting until the Paycheck Protection Program launched in April of 2020 could have, at the very least, bought a little more time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFCS79"&gt;Instead, many of them simply blame Khosla Ventures and acknowledge that Russakow’s aggressive product goals were a reflection of the returns the big firm wanted on its investment. It was in pursuit of those goals that Boosted overextended itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xrk3dO"&gt;In the days and weeks after Boosted’s downfall, some of the startup’s most loyal fans still held out hope that it could be resurrected. Every few days they would tweet at Casey Neistat, or Elon Musk, and beg for some sort of intervention — as if the right face with the right money would be able to untangle the legal knot tied around the remains of Boosted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="gHinqw"&gt;It’s hard to blame them; after all, throughout its early years, Boosted defied expectations. It was a successful Kickstarter project that turned into a bona fide company, and basically helped create an entirely new category of vehicle along the way. But at its end, Boosted had evolved into something far more common: yet another Silicon Valley startup that struggled to meet ambitious goals set by the people who wound up running the show. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US and allies accuse Chinese government of masterminding Microsoft Exchange cyberattack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KV0kOHm3ZvGOMBMtnWQsKPunmag=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69599821/acastro_180608_1777_net_neutrality_0004.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GhABMG"&gt;The United States and key allies have &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/19/the-united-states-joined-by-allies-and-partners-attributes-malicious-cyber-activity-and-irresponsible-state-behavior-to-the-peoples-republic-of-china/"&gt;accused the Chinese government&lt;/a&gt; for the first time of hiring gangs of hackers to carry out cyberattacks in the West. Attacks attributed to China include the recent Microsoft Exchange hack, a significant and widespread breach that gave attackers access to the email servers of an estimated 30,000 organizations in the US alone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2GAMp7"&gt;The Microsoft Exchange attack was initially blamed on Hafnium, a hacking group sponsored by the Chinese state. A senior official in the White House told reporters in a briefing at the weekend that the US government had “high confidence” that the Exchange hackers were being paid by the Chinese government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="o5vCVE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;China is accused of hiring gangs of hackers to carry out cyberattacks&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1yhLGN"&gt;“[China’s] MSS — Ministry of State Security — uses criminal contract hackers to conduct unsanctioned cyber operations globally, including for their own personal profit,” said the official. “Their operations include criminal activities, such as cyber-enabled extortion, crypto-jacking and theft from victims around the world for financial gain.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzVE4x"&gt;The accusation against China was made by the US, EU, UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, and NATO, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-19/eu-denounces-china-over-cyberattacks-that-hit-microsoft-server"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEebN5"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2021/07/19/declaration-by-the-high-representative-on-behalf-of-the-eu-urging-china-to-take-action-against-malicious-cyber-activities-undertaken-from-its-territory/pdf"&gt;press statement&lt;/a&gt;, the European Union said these and other attacks were linked to hacking groups known as Advanced Persistent Threat 40 and Advanced Persistent Threat 31 (these labels are used by cybersecurity professionals to track the activity of known organizations). The UK’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) &lt;a href="https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/uk-allies-hold-chinese-state-responsible-for-pervasive-pattern-of-hacking"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; that the APT40 group had targeted “maritime industries and naval defence contractors in the US and Europe” while APT30 had attacked “government entities, including the Finnish parliament in 2020.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLPZzS"&gt;“The attack on Microsoft Exchange servers is another serious example of a malicious act by Chinese state-backed actors in cyberspace,” said NCSC Director of Operations Paul Chichester in a press statement. “This kind of behaviour is completely unacceptable, and alongside our partners we will not hesitate to call it out when we see it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ukWjBs"&gt;Cyberattacks and ransomware incidents have been on the rise in recent years, with gangs of hackers apparently targeting larger organizations. This year alone, hackers have targeted America’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463621/jbs-cyberattack-russia-largest-meat-supplier"&gt;largest meat supplier&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/13/22434381/colonial-pipeline-darkside-hacker-ransomware-ransom-oil"&gt;a key oil pipeline&lt;/a&gt;, though in both cases the groups responsible are thought to be based in Eastern Europe, and most likely Russia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2A3IH"&gt;Russia was also blamed for 2020’s SolarWinds hack, which breached a number of US federal government entities, and to which the US responded with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385371/russia-sanctions-solarwinds-biden-white-house-putin-hack"&gt;new economic sanctions&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwlCXX"&gt;However, today’s announcement includes no similar sanctions against China for its role in the Microsoft Exchange attack (though these could follow). “The US and our allies and partners are not ruling out further actions to hold the PRC accountable,” said a senior White House official during a briefing. The US Department of Justice did, though, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/four-chinese-nationals-working-ministry-state-security-charged-global-computer-intrusion"&gt;announce&lt;/a&gt; criminal charges against four hackers sponsored by China’s MSS for “a multiyear campaign targeting foreign governments and entities in key sectors, including maritime, aviation, defense, education, and healthcare in a least a dozen countries.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0XEKwT"&gt;The most notable aspect of today’s accusation is instead the broad coalition of countries that are publicly condemning China. It also the first time the military alliance NATO has formally accused the country of organizing cyberattacks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Successor to Bose’s wildly popular QC35 headphones leaks early</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NmcCSFAxx27T58aX9v9Cw71D_m0=/0x1:1772x1182/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69599803/msedge_aSMXAeu0yk.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Images show a very similar pair of headphones to Bose’s existing QC35s.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://fccid.io/A94437310" target="_blank"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OMBN7e"&gt;Bose appears to be on the cusp of releasing a successor to its much loved &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/22/12003094/bose-quietcomfort-35-headphones-review-bluetooth-wireless-noise-canceling"&gt;QuietComfort 35 noise-cancelling wireless headphones&lt;/a&gt;, judging by the appearance of an &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/A94437310"&gt;FCC filing&lt;/a&gt; for a QuietComfort 45 model, &lt;a href="https://winfuture.de/news,124100.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x5cDgT"&gt;It’ll be a significant release for Bose, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/6/5/11861356/bose-quietcomfort-35-quietcontrol-30-soundsport-announced-pricing"&gt;launched the QC35s five years ago in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, and since then have only released a minor update with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/14/16308160/bose-qc-35-ii-headphones-google-assistant-leak"&gt;addition of a Google Assistant button&lt;/a&gt; the following year. It’s been so long that the QC35s still ship with a micro USB port rather than USB-C, which &lt;em&gt;WinFuture &lt;/em&gt;notes looks set to change with the new headphones. In the intervening years, Bose has released the more expensive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;Noise Cancelling Headphones 700&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s kept the QC35s around as a more affordable alternative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zCjwqf"&gt;Otherwise, the pictures included with the FCC filing suggest Bose has stuck pretty close to its existing design for the upcoming headphones. That’s fine by us — the feathery light and comfortable, if slightly conservative, design of the QC35s doesn’t need fixing — since it’s the internals of Bose’s headphones that could use a refresh. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="221DOG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNO91i"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s P50 flagship will launch on July 29th  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Huawei P50" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eP926GkIn4de4_9Pg1xUMqK_oWY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69599671/huaweip50.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huawei has previously teased the design of the flagship’s rear cameras.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Huawei&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5ggIou"&gt;Huawei’s next flagship phone, the P50, is set for launch on July 29th, &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/1839167003/KpqpgD10d"&gt;the company has announced&lt;/a&gt;. Writing on his own Weibo page, Huawei consumer group CEO &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/1100856704/KpqvOEtsk?from=page_1003061100856704_profile&amp;amp;wvr=6&amp;amp;mod=weibotime&amp;amp;type=comment"&gt;Richard Yu&lt;/a&gt; said (via Google translate) that the phone would mark the beginning of “a new era of mobile imaging,” suggesting that Huawei may once again make cameras the focus of its upcoming flagship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4awyiP"&gt;The launch comes a little over a year since Huawei &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21194248/huawei-p40-pro-plus-release-date-specs-price-features-camera-google"&gt;announced its P40 series&lt;/a&gt;, but the launch  of the P50 has been far from certain. US sanctions placed on the company over national security concerns have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/9/21360598/huawei-chips-us-sanctions-trump-china-privacy-smartphone"&gt;seriously impacted&lt;/a&gt; Huawei’s ability to produce its own Kirin chipsets, creating doubts about its ability to release new flagship devices. “For reasons you are all aware of, a launch date has not been set,” Yu said when he teased the design of the P50 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464776/huawei-p50-phone-camera-periscope-telephoto-leica-harmonyos"&gt;during a launch event last month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FML29"&gt;These chip challenges, combined with sanctions that mean Huawei can no longer preinstall Google’s apps and services on its devices, have eroded Huawei’s market share. Globally it failed to rank in the top five smartphone vendors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22579771/worldwide-smartphone-market-share-ranking-q2-2022-canalys-xiaomi-apple-samsung"&gt;in the second quarter of this year&lt;/a&gt; (after being the biggest in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/30/21347685/worlds-biggest-smartphone-company-huawei-overtakes-samsung-canalys"&gt;same quarter the previous year&lt;/a&gt;), and even domestically in China &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22318941/china-smartphone-market-share-oppo-huawei-vivo-apple-xiaomi-january-2021"&gt;Oppo overtook it&lt;/a&gt; to become the country’s most popular smartphone brand in January.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s colossal 1,000-inch MicroLED display has improved colors and a thinner design</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cuAYsCh8HPPdC3UT5shBdV1vFBo=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69599594/The_Wall_R5_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall as a massive in-store display.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="05dFAz"&gt;Samsung is releasing &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsungs-2021-the-wall-is-now-available-worldwide"&gt;a new version of The Wall&lt;/a&gt;, its massive modular MicroLED display. Measuring in at over 1,000 inches in size, the new “IWA Series” display is aimed at businesses and commercial applications rather than homes, and Samsung’s promotional images showcase it being used as a huge display in a retail environment. The display is available in “select markets” from today, but Samsung’s press release doesn’t publicly list a price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQ80Xu"&gt;Improvements for this year’s display include LEDs that are up to 40 percent smaller than last year, which Samsung says should lead to higher contrast and better color uniformity. The purity of The Wall’s colors has also been improved over the 2020 model, and Samsung boasts that it’s got a new AI processor that further improves picture quality and contrast, and removes noise. Docking connections have an improved, wireless design, and the display’s depth has been cut in half.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zBH5vU7R-nvMxH9R7619vHeL2IM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22725701/The_Wall_R5_1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall, now with smaller pixel and a thinner design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ClbxlG"&gt;The display has an 8K resolution with a 120Hz refresh rate, and because it’s made up of modular panels, it can be arranged in a number of different configurations, including an ultrawide 15,360 x 2,160 16K resolution. Samsung says the new 2021 model can be arranged to be concave, convex, or installed in other positions like being hung, mounted to a ceiling, or installed in the shape of an “L.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="94xZV7"&gt;The new IWA Series of The Wall is Samsung’s latest display to use its MicroLED technology, which relies an array of self-emissive LEDs to create its image, rather than an LCD layer like most traditional TVs. It means that the panels can create better black levels by turning off pixels entirely, similar to the effect you’ll see from an OLED TV but without OLED’s traditional limitations like the risk of burn-in and lower peak brightness than LCD panels. Samsung says its latest version of The Wall has a peak brightness of 1,600 nits, while the best of LG’s OLEDs still peak at under 1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpYBsz"&gt;While The Wall is an attempt to sell massive MicroLED displays to commercial customers, Samsung has also started including the technology in traditionally-sized TVs for the rest of us. At this year’s CES it announced a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166062/samsung-110-inch-microled-4k-tv-announced-features"&gt;110-inch MicroLED TV&lt;/a&gt;, and it later expanded this range &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/samsung-micro-led-tv-first-look"&gt;to include 76 to 99-inch models&lt;/a&gt;. These are still massive TVs, to be sure, but at least they should fit on a wall in your house, unlike Samsung’s colossal 1000-inch monster.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ccCh6s"&gt;Tencent has announced plans to buy British video game company Sumo Group for $1.27 billion. The Chinese tech giant already has an 8.75-percent stake in the developer, as &lt;a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-07-19-tencent-to-buy-crackdown-and-sackboy-developer-sumo-in-usd1-3bn-deal"&gt;Gamesindustry.biz reports&lt;/a&gt;, and the offer represents a 43-percent premium on Sumo’s current valuation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dkUogs"&gt;Based in Sheffield, England, Sumo’s well-regarded core studio Sumo Digital has carried out contract work for many of the biggest names in gaming. It developed Sony’s PlayStation 5 launch title &lt;em&gt;Sackboy: A Big Adventure&lt;/em&gt; and was the primary studio behind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18224550/crackdown-3-review-xbox-one-pc"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;em&gt;Crackdown 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for Xbox consoles and PC. In 2017 Sumo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/13/15283820/snake-pass-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;released &lt;em&gt;Snake Pass&lt;/em&gt; for multiple platforms&lt;/a&gt;, its first foray into original IP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="AuiyWc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Crackdown 3 review: the Netflix Original of games","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/14/18224550/crackdown-3-review-xbox-one-pc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="sqbVAV"&gt;“The three founders of Sumo, who work in the business, Paul Porter, Darren Mills and I are passionate about what we do and are fully committed to continuing in our roles,” says Sumo CEO Carl Cavers in a statement. “The opportunity to work with Tencent is one we just couldn’t miss. It would bring another dimension to Sumo, presenting opportunities for us to truly stamp our mark on this amazing industry, in ways which have previously been out-of-reach.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esP0b3"&gt;Cavers says Tencent has “demonstrated its commitment to backing” Sumo’s client work, as well as its own original IP, so things are unlikely to change too quickly. The buyout does, however, give Tencent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/7/21358252/tencent-wechat-ban-trump-executive-order-consequences"&gt;yet another foothold&lt;/a&gt; in the international gaming industry, following prominent investments in companies like Epic, Riot, Activision, and Ubisoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4uTWBD"&gt;“Tencent intends to bring its expertise and resources to accelerate the growth of Sumo both in the UK and abroad, supporting Sumo in the market for top-notch creative talent, and the UK as a hub for game innovation,” says Tencent’s chief strategy officer James Mitchell. “We believe the proposed transaction benefits all stakeholders, delivers compelling value for Sumo shareholders, while enhancing the Sumo business for the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GY4Mbr"&gt;This would be the second billion-dollar deal involving a British game developer this year — EA completed its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173732/ea-codemasters-buyout-agreed-price-need-for-speed-dirt"&gt;acquisition of racing game specialists Codemasters&lt;/a&gt; for a similar price in February.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo denies report that OLED Switch will have higher profit margin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5njCRdzwYqRyblwZn_taRJpaOUE=/0x0:2160x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69599370/switch_oled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t67PNS"&gt;Nintendo has issued an unusual statement denying a report that said the upcoming OLED version of the Switch would have higher profit margins than the regular model. The report in question was published &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-14/nintendo-switch-s-big-price-hike-takes-gamers-into-new-territory"&gt;by Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt; last week and speculated that the higher-end components in the OLED Switch could total around an extra $10 per unit, based on analyst estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iQ9Ocl"&gt;“A news report on July 15, 2021(JST) claimed that the profit margin of the Nintendo Switch (OLED Model) would increase compared to the Nintendo Switch,” Nintendo’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1416986986464776196"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; reads. “To ensure correct understanding among our investors and customers, we want to make clear that the claim is incorrect.” Nintendo didn’t provide any information about the profit margins of either Switch console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vgkPkr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo’s OLED Switch: all of the news about the console upgrade","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565307/nintendo-oled-switch-screen-news-updates"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="TD3N2r"&gt;The OLED Switch costs $349.99, $50 more than the standard model. Aside from the 7-inch 720p OLED screen, it also doubles the internal storage to 64GB, adds an ethernet port to the dock, and includes a more flexible kickstand. If the estimates cited by Bloomberg were accurate, it’d mean that Nintendo could be making up to $40 more on each model sold, but the company now says this isn’t the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y7lyLN"&gt;Nintendo also said in its statement that it has “no plans for launching any other model at this time.” Bloomberg had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346041/oled-nintendo-switch-dlss-nvidia-chip-report"&gt;previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that a new version of the Switch would come not only with an OLED screen, but more powerful internals and the ability to output 4K resolution by making use of Nvidia’s DLSS technology.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Trailers: Sweet Girl, Reservation Dogs, Flee, What We Do in the Shadows, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8hPXq1tTLlxktjatTyXBgTzNGgM=/128x0:1126x665/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69598601/jason_momoa1.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Jason Momoa stars in Sweet Girl | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiFuJV2GLkY&amp;amp;ab_channel=Netflix" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sUneiG"&gt;Season one of &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; is a wrap and while I know not everyone loved the finale, the show is my favorite of the Marvel/Disney streaming series so far. That’s due mostly to Tom Hiddleston’s fascinating performance as the title character, once a villain who’s evolved into... someone else, not quite sure who yet. Plenty of storylines to pick up in &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt; season two (yay). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jjw27a"&gt;And a reminder it’s &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; week; season two arrives on Apple TV Plus July 23rd. In the media buzz leading up to the new season, there has been some evidence that Ted and creator Jason Sudeikis are kinda the same person: At the show’s world premiere, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/brfootball/status/1415887128588869633"&gt;Sudeikis wore a shirt&lt;/a&gt; with the names of three England footballers who were subjected to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22574082/black-players-england-italy-football-soccer-racist-instagram-twitter-telegram"&gt;racist vitriol on social media&lt;/a&gt;, to show his support. And &lt;em&gt;Uproxx &lt;/em&gt;entertainment writer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mikeryan/status/1415730436798619655"&gt;Mike Ryan shared a story about Sudeikis&lt;/a&gt; from a few years ago that gives further credence to the Ted/Sudeikis theory.  Love it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Jfw9l"&gt;This week’s trailers include a couple of comedies, and a Jason Momoa Netflix movie filmed in Pittsburgh whose title confuses me somewhat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IjRS8m"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NiFuJV2GLkY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="EOFtlI"&gt;Sweet Girl &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="vdrUG3"&gt;Jason Momoa stars as Ray Cooper, whose cancer-stricken wife dies after she’s unable to get a drug she needs. Why? Because the pharmaceutical company took it off the market to drive up its price. Ray’s out for revenge/justice, and his daughter Rachel (played by Isabel Merced, presumably the sweet girl of the title), is along for the quest. &lt;em&gt;Sweet Girl’&lt;/em&gt;s trailer makes excellent use of Pittsburgh’s Golden Triangle area, many bridges, and even our light rail line as dramatic backdrops for punching, stabbing, and throwing bad guys through windows. &lt;em&gt;Sweet Girl&lt;/em&gt; comes to Netflix August 20th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WumlU9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RoHewFAkrWU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="VPv9RS"&gt;Reservation Dogs &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="m8VlRN"&gt;This new half-hour comedy series from Taika Waititi and Sterlin Harjo is about a gang of Indigenous teenagers in Oklahoma whose criminal activities (they steal a chip delivery truck in the trailer), are part of their larger plan to raise money to get to California. &lt;em&gt;Reservation Dogs &lt;/em&gt;has strong Indigenous representation at every level of production and if the trailer is any indication, it’s a wickedly funny show that pokes holes in stereotypes of Indigenous people. D’Pharaoh Woon-A-Tai, Devery Jacobs, Paulina Alexis, and Lane Factor star in &lt;em&gt;Reservation Dogs&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to FX on Hulu August 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FVMO1t"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LjKiM-Hz4Qs?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TU0z9I"&gt;What We Do in the Shadows&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="On6664"&gt;Season three of this ridiculously funny show about goofy vampires is finally almost here, and we have this teaser that shows Nandor walking around ... in the sunlight!? He’s not going to burst into flames, don’t worry; he’s just wearing a VR headset. This is a good binge show and everyone has been telling you how funny it is, so try to find time to catch up before season three hits FX on September 2nd (and Hulu a day later). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4WGMs0"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ttU1iKSpdA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="QlUePc"&gt;TItans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zKrrpn"&gt;We got a short teaser for season three of &lt;em&gt;Titans&lt;/em&gt; last month, but we get a lot more in this first official trailer, including a look at Red Hood, Vincent Kartheiser’s Scarecrow, and Gotham, the setting for this season. &lt;em&gt;Titans&lt;/em&gt; comes to HBO Max for its third season August 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pVtKvv"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2aRfHsMgfdg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="M9tW50"&gt;Flee&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1QsqKY"&gt;This animated documentary film doesn’t have a release date, but won the Sundance Jury Prize and is already generating Oscar buzz, says Zack Sharf &lt;a href="https://www.indiewire.com/2021/07/flee-trailer-animated-doc-best-films-2021-1234651173/"&gt;at &lt;em&gt;Indiewire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;It tells the story of a man, Amin Nawabi, who was a child refugee from Afghanistan, and fled to Moscow with his family. The trailer is just fascinating, using pieces of an audio interview with Nawabi as the voiceover. Riz Ahmed and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau are executive producers on&lt;em&gt; Flee&lt;/em&gt;, directed by Jonas Poher Rasmussen. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Steam Deck reservations now showing ‘expected order availability’ in Q2 and Q3 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_u78r5KshOHYYbkxAsIQ7sTXiCI=/0x116:3684x2572/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69598360/Steam_Deck_case.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Steam Deck will start shipping in December 2021 | Image: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qSCCqs"&gt;If you’re looking to reserve a Steam Deck and haven’t managed to secure a reservation yet, it looks like you’ll be waiting a while to actually get your device. According to Steam’s store site on Sunday, the $399 64GB Steam Deck and the $529 256GB version both have “expected order availability” dates of of Q2 2022, meaning sometime next spring. The 512GB $649 model is even later; it’s showing expected availability in Q3 of next year, which is sometime between July and September 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="igPMbC"&gt;According to Steam’s website, it plans to &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck"&gt;send order invitations&lt;/a&gt; by December of this year. Steam will then convert reservations to orders. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BtVdRbSINDGXBsplHcufyMnF4y4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22724907/choose_your_steam_deck.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;As of July 18th, the wait time for the top-of-the-line Steam Deck is Q3 of 2022. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8mYqZN"&gt;Steam’s official Twitter account &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Steam/status/1416811315985666051?s=20"&gt;posted Sunday&lt;/a&gt; that reservations for Steam Deck were open to new Steam accounts as well as existing accounts. Valve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;only revealed&lt;/a&gt; its handheld PC gaming device on Thursday, but when it opened up to reservations on Friday afternoon, many people got repeated error messages. &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/07/html-holes-provide-a-glimpse-of-steam-decks-initial-preorder-numbers/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Valve got more than 110,000 reservations for the 256GB and 512GB devices in the first 90 minutes after orders opened. &lt;/p&gt;
