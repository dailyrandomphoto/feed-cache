    <title>Ring Video Doorbell Pro 2 leaks out with ‘3D motion detection’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iPAwm4_p9z6eVGOoAHDQ9G08JCA=/4x0:784x520/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68812594/ring_video_doorbell_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gngwcs"&gt;Amazon’s Ring has so many different video doorbells in the market it’s getting hard to keep track, but one of them is apparently about to get a big bump with some brand-new features: The Ring Wi-Fi Video Doorbell Pro 2 has just leaked &lt;a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:_ynSlpvK_2EJ:https://www.bestbuy.ca/en-ca/product/ring-wi-fi-video-doorbell-pro-2-satin-nickel/15299144+&amp;amp;cd=1&amp;amp;hl=en&amp;amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;gl=us"&gt;in a listing at Best Buy Canada&lt;/a&gt;, as spotted by &lt;a href="https://zatznotfunny.com/2021-02/ring-pro-2/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ZatzNotFunny&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUvoQa"&gt;It appears to be a direct successor to the high-end Ring Video Doorbell Pro at the same CA$325 (roughly $250 US dollars), but also the first Ring to stream video resolution at higher than 1080p, with a 1536p “expanded Head to Toe view” that “allows you to clearly see who is at your door.” That means Amazon’s catching up to the field-of-view and resolution &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/17/20918750/arlo-video-doorbell-price-date"&gt;that Arlo’s Video Doorbell introduced in late 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wF1YwI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10340730"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yEQuWU"&gt;As a Ring Video Doorbell Pro owner myself, that would have been a desirable feature: I had to angle my doorbell down with two different add-on brackets so I could actually see packages being delivered to my front porch. But I’m more intrigued by the mention of “3D motion detection,” which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22227528/arlo-touchless-video-doorbell"&gt;sounds like something a touchless doorbell&lt;/a&gt; could use to tell when someone’s standing right in front of it — and maybe cut down on false positives buzzing my phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAhk7z"&gt;Here’s the rest of Best Buy’s product description:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MtTHCs7PjLveAeIgw6MQUXg4hqw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22301142/ring_video_doorbell_pro_2_3.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jodl99"&gt;You’ll also notice it comes with Alexa greetings — something Ring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22279020/alexa-ring-doorbell-greeting-quick-replies"&gt;brought to the original Video Doorbell Pro just the other day&lt;/a&gt;. Note that unlike most other Ring doorbells, the Pro models typically don’t have swappable batteries as an option; you have to wire them up to a powerful doorbell transformer, which you may or may not already have in your home. In January, Ring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22252181/ring-video-doorbell-new-wired-size-features-price"&gt;also added a $60 wired model&lt;/a&gt;, its least expensive yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kz39U3"&gt;The Best Buy page suggests it might be available March 31st, though you should always take release dates on early product pages with a grain of salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWvNgD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>If Whoopi Goldberg tells you to wear a mask on the subway, you wear it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-HEALTH-VIRUS-COMMUTERS" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jnk3v9yKEf_E2LcGeNus7SRMcjM=/54x0:3969x2610/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68812486/1229473130.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Daniel Slim / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cpk9YC"&gt;You might not have to ride public transit to work right now, but if you’re one of the many workers who still commutes in New York City (or if you’re someone like me who fantasizes about their old commute), you’ll now have some new celebrity voice talent to keep you company on your bus or subway ride, &lt;a href="https://www.mta.info/press-release/nyc-transit/mta-teams-newyorknico-bring-iconic-new-york-voices-subway-and-bus"&gt;the Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) announced&lt;/a&gt; Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W59Z7w"&gt;Normal transit announcements can easily fade in the back of riders’ minds. They’re either too garbled to be understood or you’ve heard them so many times that they don’t even register. But that might be different if, say, Whoopi Goldberg was the one reminding you to wear a mask on the bus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aXHyhJ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KqH3ck4gDlw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v9kQUl"&gt;At least that’s a theoretical benefit of the MTA’s new announcements rolling out today, created in partnership with director and Instagram star Nicolas Heller (&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/newyorknico/?hl=en"&gt;@newyorknico&lt;/a&gt;). There are 25 “iconic New Yorkers” set to speak over the intercom on New York City transit, so if Whoopi isn’t your speed, Jerry Seinfeld is reading some announcements, too, as are Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson from &lt;em&gt;Broad City&lt;/em&gt;, Edie Falco from &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos, &lt;/em&gt;rappers Cam’ron and Jadakiss, and someone who’s been having a bit of a moment lately, Fran Lebowitz.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CEyhKW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Starting today, you will be hearing over 25 new voices representing the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MTA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@mta&lt;/a&gt; on subway platforms and buses all over NYC. &lt;a href="https://t.co/UfxuBkkpXL"&gt;pic.twitter.com/UfxuBkkpXL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nicolas Heller (@NuevaYorkNico) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NuevaYorkNico/status/1360272219641946118?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qz78dg"&gt;Getting celebrities to read reminders to wear masks and social distance may not be the best use of the MTA’s resources or time, but according to what &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/02/09/jerry-seinfeld-and-more-celebs-to-voice-nyc-subway-psas/"&gt;Heller told the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;“there was no budget for this.” So whether it’s a charming commute distraction or yet another reason to put in your headphones, at least Awkwafina reminding you to wear a mask didn’t cost taxpayers anything. In fact, the project produced some real gems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="A4GV9L"&gt;Ey yo check it out it’s Harlem’s own Killa Cam. Look—I don’t care if you from uptown, downtown, Harlem, Switzerland, wherever. I don’t care if you a chicken or a duck. And you know what? Covid don’t care either. Are you wearin’ a mask? Ya, well is it covering your mouth and nose? Then good, you’re doing great. Remember not only wearin’ a mask is the law—it’s the right thing to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="agig1c"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZACeaC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="irCrNO"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3rJ9EV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bAi3R"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fucpnj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Komodo dragon has been crowned Twitch’s permanent PogChamp replacement</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KOu9AYUbcN1UpWOIPn3V_gm6lkE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68812478/Screen_Shot_2021_02_12_at_1.50.13_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WHQUNR"&gt;On January 6th, the day a riot of pro-Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22218088/twitch-bans-pogchamp-poggers-capitol-trump-violence-gootecks"&gt;Twitch removed&lt;/a&gt; the iconic PogChamp emote because the person it depicted made statements calling for further violence. Two days later, the company committed to rotating in a new version of PogChamp &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22220874/twitch-pogchamp-face-change-ryan-gootecks-gutierrez"&gt;every 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;, meaning many streamers briefly became the new face of the emote — but they were sometimes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229209/criticalbard-pogchamp-gootecks-hasanabi-twitch-emote-harassment"&gt;subjected to harassment&lt;/a&gt; following their new site-wide prominence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hh0i50"&gt;On Friday, the Twitch community voted to crown a new face for PogChamp — and the winner isn’t the face of a streamer. It’s a Komodo dragon. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1360340937302552582"&gt;Here’s what the emote looks like&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TceMd6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The community has spoken! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let's fire up the PogChamp Machine and activate the new face of Pog. &lt;a href="https://t.co/idQ2cNtMiH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/idQ2cNtMiH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitch (@Twitch) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1360340937302552582?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sy23at"&gt;If you’ve hung out in Twitch chats, you may actually recognize this emote: it’s the beloved &lt;a href="https://twitchemotes.com/emotes/81273"&gt;KomodoHype&lt;/a&gt;. And I can see why it won the community vote. While the &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pogchamp"&gt;original PogChamp&lt;/a&gt; was Twitch’s hype emote, I think this Komodo dragon’s face is &lt;em&gt;even better&lt;/em&gt; at expressing hype, especially with its shockingly huge maw that somehow seems to be smiling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wkz43D"&gt;KomodoHype was selected over another excellent PogChamp done by &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/uminokaiju"&gt;streamer UmiNoKaiju&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to watch the full stream about the vote, you can &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/911396128?t=00h15m54s"&gt;check it out on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jCK7xl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=v911396128&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>The best laptop you can buy in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13, Dell XPS 15, HP Elite Dragonfly, Surface Laptop 3, MacBook Pro, and Lenovo Yoga C740. " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C554ZjlwY7R1hgqzx9H7bhxKvWA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66770456/VRG_4013_Best_Laptop_Grid.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: William Joel/The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best laptop for you, from ultraportables to high-powered editing machines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="x1Etox"&gt;The best laptops to buy in 2021 come with a variety of brands, prices, and features. Our current pick for the best laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. Here, we’ve got the rest of the top laptops, business notebooks, gaming rigs, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1 convertibles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNThzL"&gt;We live in a world where smartphones are ubiquitous, tablets are commonplace, and even smartwatches are a thing that people talk about on the regular. But throughout all of these advances, the humble laptop has persevered — and for good reason. When it comes time to work, whether that's editing photos, writing a lot of emails, composing documents, or staying in touch with colleagues and family, we’re here with our top picks to help you find the best laptop for the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31HnuI"&gt;It's getting harder to buy a bad laptop, but what separates the best laptops of 2021 from good laptops is how they balance power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. The top laptop should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad — after all, those are the two biggest reasons you'd choose a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. Its display should be easy on the eyes, bright, and sharp enough that you aren't distracted by jagged edges and visible pixels. It should be powerful enough for most anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. It should be easy to carry around from place to place, and it should be able to last all day without needing to be plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMjpsX"&gt;That’s why the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt; is the best laptop in 2021. It’s a device that does just about everything right. While it’s certainly not a perfect device, there are no major flaws. It’s a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even light gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hnoYs"&gt;In our view, the best laptop for budget shoppers is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;. For a sub-$1,000 price, it delivers performance on par with much more expensive laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ABV8A"&gt;Our other picks for the best laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1s of 2021 include the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, the MacBook Pro 16, and the HP Elite Dragonfly. Check out the full list of best laptop picks below. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple MacBook Air is the best laptop of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best laptop of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qIDMjX"&gt;The late-2020 MacBook Air, powered by Apple’s M1 processor, is the best laptop you can buy. The base model, which includes 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage, starts at $999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYCzY0"&gt;Appearance-wise, this laptop has a lot in common with the Intel-powered MacBook Air that Apple released earlier this year, including the same 2560 x 1600 screen, Touch ID, 720p webcam, fingerprint sensor, and scissor-switch keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDDWFN"&gt;But the new processor is the star of the show here; it’s fast. In our testing, it handled intense photo- and video-editing workloads better than almost any Intel-powered laptop we’ve tried this year. It was also able to run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at close-to-playable frame rates, which is quite a feat for integrated graphics. At launch, these apps hadn’t yet been optimized for the M1 processor and were running through Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer — but they still worked fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACwNY3"&gt;And the processing power didn’t even weigh down the battery life: we got between eight and 10 hours of sustained work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XZkaRR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10220133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8eGPnz"&gt;Another benefit of the M1 processor is that it enables the MacBook Air to run iPhone and iPad apps natively on macOS. As of this writing, there still isn’t a huge selection of mobile apps available, and some that have been released aren’t quite optimized for the laptop screen. Still, it’s a benefit we can look forward to as time goes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjPO8F"&gt;Overall, there’s no reason that a general-use customer shouldn’t consider the MacBook Air. It’s a reliable device with excellent performance, as well as the excellence in build quality for which Apple is known. Power users who need a MacBook Pro probably know who they are; the Air should be fine for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="L8pJhA"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Best Laptop 2021: HP Spectre x360 14" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VXu0jcRLvUdGZwwpjg3vvbG1mn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22279295/mchin_190429_4395_0002.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Spectre x360 14 is one of the best convertible laptops you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O7mXrt"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Spectre x360 14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best Windows laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwIVn"&gt;It’s hard to come up with a single complaint about the Spectre x360 14. It’s a drop-dead gorgeous machine with a sturdy build and a premium look and feel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xL3xF1"&gt;But the Spectre x360 14 isn’t just pretty to look at: it’s also a pleasure to use as a daily work driver. Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors and Iris Xe integrated graphics deliver snappy performance with no slowdown or freezes that we observed. And we got an average of 10 hours of battery life out of the device — one of the best results we’ve ever seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfMa1S"&gt;On the outside, the Spectre includes a roomy 3:2 display, and if FHD resolution doesn’t suit your fancy, there are OLED and 1,000-nit options available. There’s even a packaged stylus, which attaches magnetically to the side of the Spectre — handy if you’re using the device as a tablet. Pretty much every other aspect of this laptop, from its comfortable keyboard and smooth touchpad to its bass-heavy audio and practical port selection, rivals or exceeds the best convertibles on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxTNW9"&gt;Such an exceptional package of features doesn’t come cheap, and many customers will find everything they need in a less expensive product. But the Spectre x360 14 is the new gold standard of Windows convertibles. Overall, it’s the best Windows laptop you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Envy x360 is the best laptop you can buy for under $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SoHxJX"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best budget laptop you can buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="f0RP9c"&gt;You don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a laptop that looks and feels premium. The HP Envy x360 2020 is the best budget laptop you can buy, thanks to its sturdy and compact build, chic convertible design, and excellent performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TwdF5"&gt;Part of what makes the Envy so great is that HP has ported over a number of elements from its excellent 2019 flagship, the Spectre x360, including the thin-and-light chassis and nearly bezel-free display with an 88 percent screen-to-body ratio. The touchscreen (which supports HP’s MPP2.0 pen) is bright and looks great. (You can choose a 300-nit, 400-nit, or 1,000-nit panel). And HP has added a row of convenient hotkeys to the keyboard, including kill switches for the microphone and webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRbztF"&gt;But the most exciting feature is inside: the new Envy x360 is powered by AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series. The Ryzen 5-4500U in my model did an outstanding job with a fairly heavy load of multitasking. And AMD’s integrated Radeon graphics delivered good gaming performance comparable to what you’d expect from a lower-powered discrete GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best MacBook Pro for everyday users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yUbRrT"&gt;If you’re looking to buy an M1 MacBook for heavier workloads, you’ll want to look at the late-2020 MacBook Pro. It starts at $1,299, which is $300 more than the late-2020 MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNImzP"&gt;The MacBook Pro has a slightly different design and look than the Air, as well as a few additional features like the Touch Bar. But the two have the same processor. The main difference is that the Pro includes a fan (the Air is fanless), which means it can sustain heavy workloads for a longer period of time without needing to throttle its performance. But you won’t notice much of a performance difference between the two MacBooks unless you’re routinely pushing heavy tasks for long periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USngRn"&gt;If that’s you, though, go for the Pro. We were able to run a number of hefty Premiere Pro exports and didn’t see a dip in times. The Pro also achieved a significantly higher score than the Air in a 30-minute loop of Cinebench R23; the scores were closer together after a single run. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is the best convertible you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NKt5f4"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;A great 2-in-1 laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iLNMXR"&gt;If you’re looking for a convertible laptop that does just about everything right, we recommend Dell’s latest XPS 13 2-in-1. It features a sturdy and well-made chassis, a nearly bezel-free 16:10 touch display, and Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dghfZI"&gt;The base model, for $1,099, includes a Core i3-1154G4, 8GB of RAM, a 1920 x 1200 display, and a 256GB SSD. You can spec that up to a 3840 x 2400 display, a Core i7-1165G7, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. There are various add-ons as well: you can pay $50 extra for a white model and $60 to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. Basically, there’s something for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEAGgI"&gt;Dell has made a few minor tweaks to the 2-in-1 since last year’s model. The webcam now supports Windows Hello, and the RAM and microSD reader have been upgraded. But the exciting news is the new chip and, in particular, Intel’s new integrated graphics. The XPS 13 2-in-1 did a better job than any 10th Gen laptop with an iGPU on our Adobe Premiere Pro export test. And you can even play some games on this thing: it broke 60fps on &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and even managed 36fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at its lowest settings. That’s an improvement over the results we saw from 10th Gen systems, and it also beats some 11th Gen systems (including the clamshell Dell XPS 13). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izx3w7"&gt;Of course, it’s not perfect. The port selection is limited (as is customary for modern XPS models) and the keyboard is a bit flat for my taste. But overall, the 2-in-1 excels on the fundamentals: build quality, display, performance, and battery life. What more could you want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best Windows clamshell you can buy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6xPrkB"&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is a compact and reliable laptop. Its beautiful chassis, excellent 16:10 display, and great performance make it an excellent choice for general-purpose users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik0URk"&gt;This late-2020 model comes with Intel’s new Tiger Lake processors, from a Core i3-1154G4 up to a Core i7-1165G7. It starts at $999, so it’s a bit cheaper than the 2-in-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZCO5H"&gt;My review unit (an i7 model) blew through the work tasks I needed it to do without any slowdown or heat. It did quite well, and handily beat its 10th Gen predecessor in both gaming and media work. It didn’t do as well as the XPS 13 2-in-1, which is why that model is ranked higher on this list. But if you like the look and feel of the XPS 13 and would prefer a clamshell model (or need a bouncier keyboard), this XPS is still a great option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;An excellent gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="kJ5hNb"&gt;The Zephyrus G14 is an astonishingly powerful gaming laptop for a low price (relative to other notebooks with comparable hardware). It pairs AMD’s new Ryzen 9 4900HS with an Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q GPU and a 120HZ display, and it can run demanding games at their highest settings without a problem. It’s also quite light for such a powerful laptop, weighing just over 3.5 pounds. Its battery life is also impressive for a gaming rig; we got almost nine hours of multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWOpxK"&gt;But you don’t need to be a gamer to appreciate the Zephyrus G14. It’s also a great notebook for business and everyday multitasking with a unique retro design. Plus, the keyboard and touchpad are exceptional and quiet enough not to bother officemates. On the flip side, if you need to use your laptop for videoconferences, the G14 would not be a great choice, as it lacks a webcam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2WSPjS"&gt;A great choice for Mac power users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TfAFYg"&gt;The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the best Apple laptop for power users. Apple dealt with the biggest complaints that people have historically had about MacBook Pros, and if you can stomach the price, there’s not a lot else to complain about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIH5ZZ"&gt;Most importantly, the keyboard is good again. The keys have a full millimeter of travel, and while the typing experience isn’t exceptional, it’s a world away from the maligned butterfly keyboard of MacBooks past. It’s fairly quiet, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjExSY"&gt;This MacBook also features the best sound you’ll find on a laptop. Apple has crammed three speakers into each side, including two woofers. The result is balanced audio with audible bass and great stereo separation. For those who need a laptop that can crank through editing video, working with multiple audio tracks, or processing large batches of photos, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is the king of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="t0EL7n"&gt;A business laptop with solid security&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MrOD1p"&gt;If you’re a business professional and money is no object for you or your company, you can’t do better than the HP Elite Dragonfly. The 2020 model is the first Dragonfly that features HP’s super-secure SureView Reflect technology, which tints the screen so that snoops can’t see what you’re doing while you’re working in public. When it’s not tinted, the display gets quite bright (over 700 nits) and has great viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzVcoU"&gt;The new Dragonfly is also the first laptop to include a built-in Tile tracker. That means if you lose the device, you can use the Tile smartphone app to set off an alarm (if it’s in Bluetooth range) or locate it anywhere in the world using Tile’s crowd-finding network. The tracker can work for a limited time even when the laptop is off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXS6n7"&gt;Almost everything else about the Dragonfly is good; it has some of the best battery life of any laptop on the market (we got over 11 hours), a sleek and stunning 2-in-1 design, and an exceptional keyboard. Plus, it incorporates sustainable material, including ocean-bound plastics and recycled DVDs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEHKpz"&gt;The Dragonfly is pricey, and there are cheaper business laptops that will suit the needs of most professionals just fine. But if you’re looking for the best of the best, it’s the unambiguous winner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="WpIKDR"&gt;A great budget laptop for kids&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5khaPj"&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is a great convertible laptop for kids, or anyone who wants a reliable secondary driver for browsing and games. It’s a nice-looking, well-made 10-inch device that comes with a detachable keyboard and kickstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV5DZN"&gt;The Duet is tailor-made to be used around the house and on the go, weighing just 2.03 pounds and delivering over 11 hours of battery life. Its MediaTek processor isn’t designed to shoulder heavy loads, but it’s just fine for browsing in a couple tabs, watching Netflix, or playing Android games — it even handles photo editing pretty well. The Duet also features a new “tablet mode” for Chrome OS, which supports an Android-inspired gesture navigation system and a unique Chrome layout optimized for tablet use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiBrWO"&gt;The Chromebook Duet is an absolute steal for its low price, and is the Chromebook to buy if you’re on a tight budget. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade Pro 17 is a powerful gaming laptop with few compromises.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sky6IZ"&gt;The best portable gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="S5SM7Z"&gt;Usually, if you want a 17-inch laptop that can pull playable frame rates out of today’s most demanding games, you’d expect some compromises on portability and design. Notebooks of this size often weigh north of seven pounds and require multiple power bricks to charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whz2V3"&gt;But while the Blade Pro 17 doesn’t have quite the gaming chops of some bulky desktop replacements, it makes up for that by sporting the compact and attractive design that’s a trademark of the Razer Blade line. At just over six pounds, it’s not too difficult to move around (as 17-inch workstations go). You get an RTX GPU (up to Nvidia’s 2080 Super Max-Q) an eight-core CPU (Intel’s Core i7-10875H) and either a 300Hz screen or a 120Hz touchscreen. There’s even an RGB keyboard with color effects tailored to the game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="D6FnVC"&gt;The best Chromebook of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="me0TJU"&gt;For high school and college students, or anyone else who needs an affordable, portable machine, a Chromebook can be a great option. Though it’s not the cheapest model available, Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 offers top-notch performance at a lower price than many competing Chromebooks (and other laptops). It can be equipped with a Core i3, Core i5, or Core i7 — the i5 model we tested handled a heavy multitasking load without any slowdown, heat, or noise. Add all-day battery life, an excellent keyboard, and a generous port selection that includes a full-size HDMI, and there’s very little not to like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dip68g"&gt;But where the 713 really shines is its display. The 3:2 gives you extra space for comfortable multitasking, and the sharp panel delivers a really excellent picture — I actually preferred it to my MacBook Pro’s screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0Lk4Q"&gt;Between its standout performance, peripherals, and portability, this is really the Chromebook to beat. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lyHJR1"&gt;A great laptop for creative work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4221H3"&gt;The Gigabyte Aero 15 is a colorful, powerful laptop for creative professionals. This 15.6-inch workstation pairs a bright OLED screen with an eight-core i7-10875H processor and Nvidia’s cutting-edge GeForce RTX 2070 Super Max-Q GPU. It also comes with a laundry list of ports, including a full SD-card slot, so you’ll be able to plug in all kinds of projectors, monitors, and other equipment without a problem. We also found that it was able to run demanding games on their highest settings at acceptable frame rates, and export 4K video as fast as any other laptop we’ve tested. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dh2pBE"&gt;This is an expensive machine, and if you just want to play games, it’s probably not worth spending so much money on an OLED screen. But if you need the combination of the high resolution and the high-powered specs, the Aero 15 is for you. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 15 is one of the best laptops for video editing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="telaZa"&gt;14. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21296277/dell-xps-15-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 15 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gDadWS"&gt;A great laptop for video editing&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uBbGA0"&gt;You can configure the XPS 15 with up to an eight-core Core i7 processor, Nvidia’s GTX 1650 Ti graphics, and a 3840 x 2400 touchscreen. Those specs are overkill for most people, but they’re ideal for anyone who needs to edit video or do other heavy creative work with Adobe Premiere. We recommend that anyone who’s just browsing and streaming go for the 1920 x 1200 screen and a Core i5, which will save you significant money. (We also experienced some heat management issues and disappointing battery life with the i7 unit.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lMPwHh"&gt;The XPS 15 isn’t a serious gaming rig, but the GTX 1650 Ti can help out with creative tasks. Our model was able to export a five-minute, 33-second video in Adobe Premiere Pro in just four and a half minutes — which is faster than we got with the 16-inch MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7VtZD"&gt;If you’re looking for a large, attractive Windows laptop that packs decent power, this is the one for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bETnOf"&gt;The best affordable gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HVIMz4"&gt;AMD rewrote the rules of gaming laptops with its debut in the Zephyrus G14, but it’s made a splash in the budget gaming range as well with the G5 15 SE. This laptop ran every popular title we threw at it at very playable frame rates — and the games looked great on our model’s 144Hz FreeSync screen. (You can choose a 60Hz panel as well). The Radeon RX 5600M GPU gets a boost from AMD’s SmartShift feature, which pushes power between the CPU and GPU depending on where it’s needed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rpPFDl"&gt;For times when you’re not gaming, the G5 also makes a good daily driver. It does a great job with graphically intensive work as well as general multitasking, and the fans stayed quiet throughout our testing. And there’s a better port selection than we’d generally expect to see at this price point, including an SD card reader, an audio jack, two USB 2.0 Type-A, a Mini DisplayPort, HDMi 2.0, a USB 3.2 Gen 1, an Ethernet, and a USB-C with DisplayPort. Ultimately, the G5 15 SE delivers outstanding performance for its price, and is the budget gaming rig to beat.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Thanks, I love NOAA’s satellite-themed Valentine’s Day cards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i_sfsrbZLY_AzMldtis0lRQoMeY=/0x176:1050x876/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68812229/Vday_cards_INOAA.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: NOAA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kAYJnD"&gt;Let’s be honest, when most people think of places to get good Valentine’s Day cards, the US government’s National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Twitter account is probably not high up on the list. And yet, it’s posted some cards &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NOAASatellites/status/1228344198744535040"&gt;on the NOAA Satellites account&lt;/a&gt;, and I think they’re absolutely fantastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1nfPOZ"&gt;Finding a Valentine’s Day card that comes across as sincere is always challenging. Most of the cards on store shelves just come across as clichéd. The ones from NOAA, however, are adorable. And despite their kind of meme-y aesthetic, it really seems like someone sat down and put some effort into them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="00a5at"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; ️ ♥️ Love is in the air! ♥️  ️&lt;br&gt;With &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ValentinesDay?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ValentinesDay&lt;/a&gt; coming up on Sunday, here are some printable satellite-themed valentines you can send to show your loved ones they are out of this world!&lt;a href="https://t.co/cMBHrldgfe"&gt;https://t.co/cMBHrldgfe&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Fna5CQRWDB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Fna5CQRWDB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NOAA Satellites (@NOAASatellites) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NOAASatellites/status/1360309535785820166?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TcyQPG"&gt;That’s not to say they’re not corny — the levels of corniness would probably make the US Department of Agriculture blush — but they’re just so delightfully nerdy in a way I think someone who was really into satellite tech would appreciate (though that may be a pretty small audience). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgjfDT"&gt;If you want more, NOAA apparently made some last year, too. That batch may contain my favorite of the bunch, which reads:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ojvBqr"&gt;Violets are blue&lt;br&gt;And roses are red&lt;br&gt;NOAA’s satellites watch&lt;br&gt;Earth’s weather overhead&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div id="4hisEB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Wishing you a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/HappyValentinesDay?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#HappyValentinesDay&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NOAA?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NOAA&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Satellite?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Satellite&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; Information Service!&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GOESR?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GOESR&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SuomiNPP?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#SuomiNPP&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NOAA20?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NOAA20&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JPSSProgram?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@JPSSProgram&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/oubkohYaQe"&gt;pic.twitter.com/oubkohYaQe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NOAA Satellites (@NOAASatellites) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NOAASatellites/status/1228344198744535040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 14, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LHCpzj"&gt;They sure do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lpmw8W"&gt;This discovery did lead to one disappointment, though: I couldn’t find many other government agencies making their own themed Valentine’s Day cards. (I’m especially bummed that my personal favorite, the National Park Service, hasn’t made anything.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRKtKa"&gt;However, there is one other agency spreading the love: the US Consumer Product Safety Commission. We’ve written before about how it has a... uh, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18029280/consumer-product-safety-commission-twitter-memes-social-media-barks-mcwoofins-injuries"&gt;unique Twitter presence&lt;/a&gt;. And while I can’t say its V-Day posts tugged at my heartstrings like NOAA’s did, they’re definitely On Brand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xR6ogl"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="und" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/valentinesday2021?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#valentinesday2021&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/9nW9JJsFrO"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9nW9JJsFrO&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— US Consumer Product Safety Commission (@USCPSC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/USCPSC/status/1360275098985521153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="JRVeuw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Report unsafe products together - &lt;a href="https://t.co/qFWdMF6Xk0"&gt;https://t.co/qFWdMF6Xk0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ValentinesDay?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ValentinesDay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/ysL5hjrh22"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ysL5hjrh22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— US Consumer Product Safety Commission (@USCPSC) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/USCPSC/status/1360044007393476611?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qCKGqN"&gt;I’m very thankful to the US government for bailing me out here because I didn’t remember to buy a Valentine’s Day card until I saw these. It’s also very cold outside (I know this thanks to NOAA’s weather satellites), so now I don’t even have to leave the house to get one. And appropriately grateful conversation heart candy will be in the mail.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is secretly building a smartwatch and planning to sell it next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WbriZtUs24OslXeenlmvwaQzJS0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68812001/jbareham_180405_1777_facebook_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PnVUrK"&gt;Facebook is building a smartwatch as part of its ongoing hardware efforts, according to a new &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/facebook-plans-smartwatch-with-focus-on-messaging-health?utm_source=ti_app"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The device is said to be an Android-based smartwatch, though the report does not say whether Facebook intends for the device to run Google’s Wear OS. It also says Facebook is working on building its own operating system for hardware devices and that future iterations of the wearable may run that software instead. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNzUm6"&gt;The smartwatch would have messaging, health, and fitness features, the report says, and would join Facebook’s Oculus virtual reality headsets and Portal video chat devices as part of the social network’s growing hardware ecosystem. Facebook is also working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439929/facebook-ar-smart-glasses-ray-ban-announcement"&gt;branded Ray-Ban smart glasses&lt;/a&gt; to come out later this year as part of its ongoing Project Aria initiative, an augmented reality project the company has been working on for some time now. Facebook declined to comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y6O3hp"&gt;The social networking giant’s hardware ambitions are no secret. The company has more than 6,000 employees working on various augmented and virtual reality projects and as part of existing hardware divisions like Oculus and Portal, as well as experimental initiatives under its Facebook Reality Labs division, &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-06/facebook-smart-glasses-coming-sooner-than-later-without-ar?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;reported last month&lt;/a&gt;. And although Facebook has not expressed a strong interest in health and fitness devices in the past, the company does have a track record in wearables with its Oculus headsets and forthcoming smart glasses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KUrLI"&gt;Facebook also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20881032/facebook-ctrl-labs-acquisition-neural-interface-armband-ar-vr-deal"&gt;acquired the neural interface startup CTRL-Labs&lt;/a&gt; in 2019. CTRL-Labs specialized in building wireless input mechanisms, including devices that could transmit electrical signals from the brain to computing devices without the need for traditional touchscreen or physical button inputs. The startup’s intellectual property and ongoing research may factor into whatever wearables Facebook builds in the future — including a smartwatch, smart glasses, or future Oculus headsets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NGC1oK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update February 12th, 6:22PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Noted that Facebook declined to comment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Jon Porter?</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uH1JQEHPiR5CdIdiAeow4cz8DDA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68512316/jporter_201208_4323_0017.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Jon Porter / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Fitting a lot of tech into a small space&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="gBdQ3J"&gt;Working from home has its advantages, but one of the problems that many people have to face is trying to find enough space in a crowded environment. Jon Porter, who is the London-based news reporter for &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, has had to be especially resourceful in putting together a place where he could report, write, and review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s1FcUQ"&gt;We talked to Jon to find out how he’s managed to do such great reporting out of a small space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g2qSlJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about yourself. What do you do at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdG2ny"&gt;I’m &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s UK-based news reporter. I’ve lived in London basically my entire life, and I’ve been with the site for a little over two years now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BwWlGG"&gt;Day-to-day, I’m responsible for covering any tech news that breaks during UK hours before the US wakes up. But once the East Coast is awake, I can get down to business &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36QUbG5nPDk&amp;amp;t=97s"&gt;reviewing phones&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0c8UdKX6GBA"&gt;building keyboards&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522980/apple-iphone-12-pro-usb-c-lightning-environment-charger-box-electronic-waste"&gt;complaining about the iPhone’s lack of USB-C&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nFXAFp"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It looks like you really had to get a lot of workspace into a relatively small area. How did you manage it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hEmUES"&gt;That’s putting it lightly. I share my flat in London with three other people, so a corner of my bedroom is about as much space as I can spare for a home office. I honestly don’t think I’d manage it if I hadn’t lucked out and found this desk being given away for free on the weekend I moved in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E_vvFBYtuLs0xpj0G4wkSU1Vfq4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158036/jporter_201208_4323_0019.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kwYkh6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you manage that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gMPZ9y"&gt;When we moved in, the flat was completely unfurnished, and we spent the first few months frantically scouring through services like &lt;a href="https://www.freecycle.org"&gt;Freecycle&lt;/a&gt; for any furniture people were giving away. Long story short, we met some people who were leaving the country and had a flat full of stuff to get rid of, so we rented a van and carted it all home. The van broke down en-route (don’t ask), but most of the furniture has served us well ever since.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I9UwEu"&gt;All of which is to say that I have absolutely no idea where the desk is from, who made it, or how much it would cost to buy new. But it’s very good at packing in a lot of stuff. There’s a little shelf under the monitor where I have a &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-4%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-4-pro-black-1tb%2F10134659.html&amp;amp;u1=vergewhatsonyourdeskjonporterFeb2021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 4 Pro&lt;/a&gt; and an Arcam irDAC stashed, and the keyboard tray lets me keep the desk surface itself clear-ish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ShiGy"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that a wrist rest you have in front of your keyboard?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RM3U28"&gt;Absolutely! I love mechanical keyboards, but their keys are so tall compared to laptop-style keys that I find I need a rest to keep my wrists at a comfortable angle. I know you’re technically supposed to keep your hands raised while you type, but honestly that’s just so exhausting on my arms that I’ve never been able to stick with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDuWdk"&gt;The keyboard itself is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Filco-Majestouch-2-Tenkeyless-FKBN87M-EB2/dp/B004WOF7QM/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=b7e79c45caf9815118023c76fc3a2e2a&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Filco Majestouch 2 Tenkeyless with Cherry MX Brown&lt;/a&gt; switches. I firmly believe that Filco makes the keyboards that feel the best to type on, and they’re what I’d recommend to anyone looking for a keyboard. The only problem is that the lettering on their keycaps can wear out a little quickly, so I swapped out the stock caps for a set manufactured by GMK. Oh, and I also installed a programmable keyboard controller in there so I could add some keyboard shortcuts for turning the volume up and down and whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jxHK7zIUKVyNvUU7G3O5F3-PyUU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158042/jporter_201208_4323_0010.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wArvXR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Looks like you’ve got a classy desk chair.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0J1M5"&gt;This Herman Miller Aeron was the main investment I made this year after I’d been working from home full time for a few months. I bought it after I got tired of having to sit with a pillow supporting my lower back to stop it from hurting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BCFDdM"&gt;In normal times I probably would have actually gone into a store and tried out a bunch of chairs in person, but unfortunately that wasn’t really possible. Instead I played it safe, and bought the chair that always seems to come up whenever people online talk about the best office chairs. I got my Aeron secondhand off eBay from a company that was clearly selling leftovers from office clearouts, but it’s treated me well so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PjMlQa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226965"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y0WqRz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, now it’s time to talk about your tech. Let’s start with your computer. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0jWYqV"&gt;Alrighty! It’s a bit of a work-in-progress at the moment while I wait for AMD’s new CPUs and Nvidia’s new graphics cards to come down in price, but for the time being I’m running an &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-5-3600"&gt;AMD Ryzen 5 3600 CPU&lt;/a&gt; paired with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/19/17877968/nvidia-geforce-rtx-2080-review-benchmarks-performance-features"&gt;Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 graphics card&lt;/a&gt; and 16GB of RAM. That’s all packed into a &lt;a href="https://www.silverstonetek.com/product.php?pid=522&amp;amp;area=en"&gt;Silverstone FT05 case&lt;/a&gt; which, much like my keyboard, I like because it’s incredibly understated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iATjCQ"&gt;One day I want to upgrade that GPU to an &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1726553874957965631" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt;, slap a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/AMD-Ryzen-5600X-12-Thread-Processor/dp/B08166SLDF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ryzen 5600X&lt;/a&gt; in there, and downsize the whole machine into a small form-factor case, but who knows when that’ll happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd c-image-grid__odd-first-wide"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XVhCx9sSAagAn8noTcUN1wDNul8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158038/jporter_201208_4323_0016.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZaMdR4s9AbPw39CWImLx9mU14Aw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158040/jporter_201208_4323_0012.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hefi-igiQlWja18O51fvV1JPIXU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158035/jporter_201208_4323_0021.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3HrpsS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve got an interesting arrangement of displays. You’ve got one hanging off the wall, and the other is, well, impressively big. How did you come up with this arrangement?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdqI7r"&gt;I have to confess this isn’t how I’d have things set up if I had the choice. My main monitor is an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/AOC-AG352UCG6-Monitor-3440x1440-DisplayPort/dp/B07BMVNJZP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AOC AG352UCG 1440p ultrawide&lt;/a&gt; which would normally be out of my price range, but I got a deal on it because it’s a little… well… broken. Its DisplayPort works perfectly, and it supports G-Sync to keep games running smoothly, but unfortunately the HDMI port seems to be busted, so I can’t use it with the PS4 Pro I’ve got sitting underneath it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiFoZu"&gt;That’s why I have the second monitor sitting in landscape orientation to the left of it, for the PlayStation. Otherwise I’d have it in portrait and use it to read Twitter or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAlm3V"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about your other tech (headphones, speakers, etc.)?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yN25ln"&gt;From left to right there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blue-Snowball-Microphone-Textured-White/dp/B000EOPQ7E/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=polygon05-20&amp;amp;linkId=7d9858b9243b3e5ec844044ebc69beb4&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Blue Snowball microphone&lt;/a&gt;, which does exactly what I need it to and means I can get away with wearing normal headphones on calls. Then we’ve got my &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1726554111787728059" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech Z200 speakers&lt;/a&gt;, which were just the cheapest I could find. They’re fine, but whenever I’m listening to something that matters I’m using headphones or streaming to an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fsymfonisk-table-lamp-with-wifi-speaker-black-00464617%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22165831%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-jon-porter-nvidia-ps4-tech#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ikea Symfonisk Sonos speaker lamp&lt;/a&gt; I have on the other side of the room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F6y9Df"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10227163"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LzfHjp"&gt;There’s an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07DBXNV58/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=polygon05-20&amp;amp;linkId=fa544d7577613f1571bfde2ea745914c&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Anker wireless charging&lt;/a&gt; stand on my desk for when my phone needs extra juice during the day, which rarely happens now that I’m at home all the time but it’s nice to know it’s there. The PS4 Pro sitting to the right of it needs no introduction. That little bar sitting on top of it is a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mayflash-W010-Wireless-Sensor-DolphinBar/dp/B00HZWEB74/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=75a36df2d93c99d0fded1ce39e3c96ff&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mayflash W010 USB sensor bar&lt;/a&gt;, like the Nintendo Wii console used to have. I bought one for my PC so I could use it to emulate Wii games, and hopefully get around to completing &lt;em&gt;Metroid Prime 3&lt;/em&gt; one of these days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EoybT3"&gt;Next up is the Arcam irDAC which handles audio for both the PS4 and my PC, and those accessories on top of it are an Anker SD card reader and a pair of Samsung’s Galaxy Beans, ahem sorry, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt;. There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Widescreen-Calling-Recording-Desktop/dp/B006JH8T3S?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Logitech C920 webcam&lt;/a&gt; on top of my monitor with a privacy shutter, and I have a bunch of USB cables hanging off of what’s supposed to be a headphone hook to the right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F9v8i2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503020"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oyxbRJ"&gt;Phew, that sounds like a lot! But remember that I live in a flatshare, so I basically have one room that all my tech lives in. One day all this stuff will spread out when I have the space for it, but for now it’s all here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mZv_Aun3vNC1Ea3nH3824TetVSY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158041/jporter_201208_4323_0011.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q5iSzhzRpOtl2LBQUs14HHwUM60=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22158033/jporter_201208_4323_0024.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yR7QFz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You have a relatively clean desk — is that how you like to work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jp037d"&gt;In my ideal world, this would be how tidy I keep it all of the time. But the reality is that when review season hits and the devices start rolling in, I quickly end up with piles of phones, headphones, coffee cups, and whatever else on my desk. Thankfully we’re in a bit of a quieter period at the moment so I can keep things a little more manageable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSeQdT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see there’s a notebook front and center.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfgPGD"&gt;It’s the only way I can stay organized. I know there are lots of good to-do list apps out there, but for me nothing beats keeping track of work using a physical notepad. Every day I force myself to write out what needs to be done, and the manual process helps me to remember each task. I also just find it much more convenient to quickly note down something on a physical pad while I’m on the phone, rather than trying to do everything from the same device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vSr9zz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is that a pint glass I see?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBwJ7H"&gt;Gotta keep hydrated!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXi6DJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell us about your guitar. Do you keep it nearby for occasional breaks, or is that just a handy place to store it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YULd6c"&gt;Oh, it’s totally just a musical fidget spinner. Whenever I’m stuck, I pick up the guitar, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fender-Player-Stratocaster-Electric-Guitar/dp/B07CTYNK7C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;linkId=ccf904b38de122cfc30f90e8f67d7bbf&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mexican-made Fender Stratocaster&lt;/a&gt;, and play a couple of chords while I think. I also used to play a lot while I waited for things to load, but SSDs put an end to that. I must have had it for 15 years or so, and although I rarely get around to playing seriously anymore, I could never bring myself to part with it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon delivery app Mentor tracks drivers’ locations and measures their performance </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_12qiyCy9UP7DzeV3CFhWLByZY0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68811572/mdoying_180411_2466_0050stills.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6pz0yk"&gt;Amazon built its own in-house mobile app called Mentor that it uses to track the location and rate the performance of third-party delivery drivers, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/amazon-mentor-app-tracks-and-disciplines-delivery-drivers.html"&gt;new report from CNBC&lt;/a&gt;. The app tracks a driver’s location at all times and also generates a daily score that factors into performance evaluations, with low scores potentially harming a third-party delivery company’s relationship with Amazon for future contracts, the report states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kQo9fB"&gt;Amazon bills the app as a tool for improving safety, but both drivers and privacy proponents cited by CNBC worry the Mentor software is also a tool for surveillance of drivers and as another form of pressure applied on the workers to ensure they’re delivering packages as fast as possible. Earlier this month, an Amazon promotional video posted online &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22265031/amazon-netradyne-driveri-survelliance-cameras-delivery-monitor-packages"&gt;revealed a new initiative&lt;/a&gt; involving always-on security cameras from a firm called Netradyne that are similarly used to monitor and measure a driver’s performance, causing alarm among privacy advocates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CzUrvQ"&gt;“Safety is Amazon’s top priority. Whether it’s state-of-the art telemetrics and advanced safety technology in last-mile vans, driver-safety training programs, or continuous improvements within our mapping and routing technology, we have invested tens of millions of dollars in safety mechanisms across our network, and regularly communicate safety best practices to drivers,” an Amazon spokesperson told CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5VtXw0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Amazon says its monitoring measures are designed to improve safety&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xXQjYB"&gt;As its operations have expanded, Amazon has increasingly built out its own delivery infrastructure, part of which is the delivery service program (DPS). This program contracts third-party companies to help with the last-mile delivery that, until a few years ago, was mostly handled by companies like FedEx and UPS. Amazon uses its own drivers to help with cost-cutting measures and to increase the speed and efficiency of deliveries, as part of its broader effort to own and operate more of its logistics chain with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215279/amazon-buys-boeing-jets-planes-delta-westjet"&gt;purchases and leases of cargo freighters and airplanes&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LWM1gx"&gt;There have, however, been issues regarding driver and pedestrian safety. Amazon has, in some cases, skirted direct accountability for crashes, injuries, and even deaths at the hands of drivers delivering its packages to customers’ homes because of the contract nature of the work, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/us/amazon-delivery-drivers-accidents.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Still, the company has come under fire for using software and other tools to prioritize the speed of deliveries over potential safety concerns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmzL6J"&gt;As a result, Amazon has reportedly begun exercising increasing control over its drivers by managing their routes and monitoring their behavior at all times with the goal of improving safety. The Monitor app and always-on surveillance cameras are part of those measures, though some drivers are concerned about how invasive these methods are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NEe9pY"&gt;CNBC says drivers congregate online and discuss ways to try to game the system. For instance, drivers have tried wrapping their phones in sweaters and storing them in the glove box of delivery vans because of how unfairly they’re dinged for standard procedures on the job that the Monitor app mistakes for reckless driving, like marking a delivery as completed by picking the phone up. “If your device moves at all, it’s going to count against you,” one driver told CNBC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1pFUrw"&gt;There are also concerns about the location sharing permissions. Drivers are asked to download the app on their personal devices and to enable “always allow” location sharing, which has some drivers concerned Amazon is overstepping its boundary with regard to driver privacy, CNBC reported. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What’s on your desk, Taylor Lyles? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQXNtIAn-pH83zaecuXCC5kB97k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67851875/tlyles_201113_4294_0017.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;An enthusiastic gamer creates her workspace&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="uJLbW5"&gt;Moving to a home office sometimes means making the most of a little space. Taylor Lyles, a writer at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, is one of those who has used imagination and tech know-how to create a great working area out of a small part of her room. Here’s how she did it. (And if you’re curious, a list of her tech is at the end of this article.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xvUDW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;First, tell us a little about yourself. What is your background, and what do you do at &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Verge&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l9mT50"&gt;I’m from Maryland, born and raised. I live outside of Annapolis, which is the capital of the state. I joined &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year as a news writer and my one-year anniversary is coming up in February.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CejAAW"&gt;I am currently listed as a writer. “News” was dropped from my title, which primarily means that I place a lot more emphasis on service journalism. Basically, I find a lot of good deals for our readers so they can best spend the money that’s burning a hole in their pockets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfaTko"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It looks like you really had to get a lot of workspace into a relatively small area. How did you manage it?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qb4Jca"&gt;Yeah! My desk is in the same room as my bed, and it is close to my two-door closet. I previously had two other smaller desks instead of the one I currently have, but when it came to finding a new desk, I wanted something that was spacious yet also fit in the parameters I designated. A measuring tape was my best friend for sure! Funnily enough, I now have a 45-inch desk, but I could put a larger one in the space, and it wouldn’t feel cramped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AlNgyqS9wvGUYCXjWGv8D01PshE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22054931/tlyles_201111_4294_0003.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nyPcxU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a little about the desk itself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qkUXHH"&gt;It’s a gaming desk by this company called Mr. Ironstone. In case it’s not obvious, I am a huge gamer, and I’ve always wanted to have a desk that was considered a “gaming desk.” I spent a few weeks researching a few different types of gaming desks, and eventually, I went with the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mr-IRONSTONE-Computer-Headphone-Workstation/dp/B07HYTWJ6Y/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=12&amp;amp;imprToken=f2bbc3cd-6179-dec4-42c&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;amp=&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=3ddff728b756455213eb9564624e2d93&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ascsubtag=203%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mr. Ironstone Gaming Desk&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TbgoyO"&gt;A few people have said it’s minimal, but I am a very simple woman, and to be quite honest, a minimalist desk is the best because it provides you with more freedom and a ton of real estate to allow you to decorate your desk how you like. Shockingly, this is one of the cheapest desks I have used; it cost only $126 when I ordered it on Amazon. Ultimately, I decided to buy this desk because it came with a few neat things on the side (a cupholder and a headset hook). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="fDLJBG"&gt;
&lt;div id="g6i8oF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10334240" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="PFVwWH"&gt;
&lt;p id="3QMl94"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I love the cupholder. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsmjIm"&gt;The cupholder is one of my favorite parts of this desk! I did have a coaster and a headset mount on my old desk, but I did not like how they took up space on what was already a small desk to begin with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l3LZKb"&gt;The best part is that you can choose which side you put your headset hook and cupholder on. I chose to put the cupholder to my left because I am a lefty and my headset hook on the right because it is closer to my computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AzS4tkUmNAaVLG0LxITuPhoAXh8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22054937/tlyles_201111_4294_0006.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BmLrJD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a really great-looking chair. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91lqvl"&gt;It’s a Techni Sport TS-5000, and although it looks comfy, it’s actually very uncomfortable. I had to purchase a seat cushion because sitting on the chair for more than two hours made my butt hurt. I also have a weak back so, thankfully, I have cushions that provide extra comfort for my back and my butt, allowing me to work (or game) comfortably at my desk. I am planning to get a &lt;a href="https://secretlab.co/collections/titan-series"&gt;Secretlab Titan gaming chair&lt;/a&gt; soon. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="EX3iY6"&gt;
&lt;p id="WSzKt3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Okay, now it’s time to talk about your tech. Let’s start with your computer. That’s quite a system you have there.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjDPHQ"&gt;This is my gaming PC! Someone I knew gave me the case, and I bought and built the PC myself. I am currently in the process of upgrading my rig, but I want to point out a few things: the GPU I am using is an Asus RTX 3070, and my processor is an Intel Core i7-7700K. But within the next few months, I plan to switch my CPU and motherboard to AMD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FfFCzz"&gt;The biggest focus I had for my gaming PC was I wanted to make sure I could play the newest titles without having to sacrifice performance or graphics. I also try to plan 10 steps ahead in future-proofing my PC, especially with the new generation of gaming underway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0BciK0VTCzVIEd7OF3Si9SJBugU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22054904/tlyles_201113_4294_0027.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qf0oAH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about your displays? How did you decide on two, and how do you use them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SyWgRV"&gt;The gamer in me always wanted two displays. It also makes multitasking easier. Both monitors are 24 inches. The one on the right is an &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FASUS-MG248QR-24-Full-HD-1ms-144Hz-DP-HDMI-FreeSync-Adaptive-Sync-Eye-Care-eSports-Gaming-Monitor%2F284736115%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_0X7xzm1dZxyOWU6wUx0Mo38XUkEWe6V5W3bDTg0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3D0X7xzm1dZxyOWU6wUx0Mo38XUkEWe6V5W3bDTg0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;sharedid=vergewhatsonyourdesktaylorlyle02122021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus MG248QR&lt;/a&gt;, the original one for my gaming PC, and the one on the left is newer, the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1545194-REG%2Fasus_vg258qr_24_5_wide_16_9_tn.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21572162%2Fremote-work-desk-home-set-up-writer-gamer-logitech-asus#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Asus VG258QR&lt;/a&gt;. Eventually, I will upgrade to 4K monitors, but for now, these get the job done just fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7yZw48"&gt;My left monitor is the one I work on the most. The second one is what I use to keep my Slack app open. I split reading material on the right between two windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="fvAKjj"&gt;
&lt;div id="pUynqv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9585116" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="g79X0e"&gt;
&lt;p id="PP4mIJ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve admired your microphone setup ever since the first time I saw it. Tell us about it.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="neY5Jy"&gt;Thank you! The microphone I am using is called the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/HyperX-QuadCast-Condenser-Microphone-Anti-Vibration/dp/B07NZZZ746?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=14&amp;amp;imprToken=0abbcb95-2748-6974-964&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21336203%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;HyperX QuadCast&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s amazing! Previously, I had a few other mics, including a Blue Yeti. I chose the HyperX QuadCast as my new mic because I heard great things about the sound quality, and the design was also really intriguing to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1YoAWa"&gt;The QuadCast has a lot of bang for the buck, and I like how it comes with a stand for your mic and a shock mount in case you decide to place it on a boom arm, which is what I did. And it comes with a nice long cable, so you have more leverage for where to place it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="yWVlT0"&gt;
&lt;div id="bob765"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10306468" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="NJOvOA"&gt;
&lt;p id="6No8CQ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microphone-TONOR-Adjustable-Suspension-T20/dp/B082W4B7SX?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=15&amp;amp;imprToken=0abbcb95-2748-6974-964&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21336203%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;boom arm I am using is from TONOR&lt;/a&gt;, and it is an adjustable suspension boom scissor mic stand that costs about $30. What’s great about this boom arm is that it includes a durable clamp, so if you have a heavier mic like, say, a Blue Yeti, it will be compatible with the boom arm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a1OEhl"&gt;You’ll also notice I have a pop filter on my mic. The QuadCast does have a built-in bright red pop filter, but unfortunately, it is not very good at stopping plosive speech sound. I didn’t want to use the “normal” pop filter, which came with the boom arm I bought, so I bought this &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/PEMOTech-Microphone-Windscreen-Recording-Streaming/dp/B01J5OTVTC/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=16&amp;amp;imprToken=0abbcb95-2748-6974-964&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=7bb6a56a87881b7dcbad0f42f71b18fa&amp;amp;language=en_US&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21336203%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PEMOTech tri-layered pop filter&lt;/a&gt;. I bought it for $8, and aside from looking cool, it does help with the plosives. It gives off such a very professional look in my opinion that it makes me want to have a podcast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sNMmW-O6etQiEFpY9wxcWi5raf4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22054922/tlyles_201113_4294_0014.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EjdXWm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How about your other tech?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r28hpT"&gt;Most of the tech I use for my computer is from Logitech.

&lt;p id="mIcFjV"&gt;The speakers you see hiding in the back are the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Nommo-Chroma-Rear-Facing-Automatic/dp/B078H1T9YD?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=20&amp;amp;imprToken=0abbcb95-2748-6974-964&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21336203%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer Nommo Chroma&lt;/a&gt;, and I use those for listening to music or podcasts in the background while I work.

The two controllers are for gaming: the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Razer-Wolverine-Ultimate-Multi-Function-Intrchangeable-Thumbsticker/dp/B074RNL1RX?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=22&amp;amp;imprToken=0abbcb95-2748-6974-964&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21336203%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Razer Wolverine&lt;/a&gt; is for fighting games mostly, while I use the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1732115940834051224" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Patrol Tech Special Edition Xbox One wireless controller&lt;/a&gt; for certain PC games (mostly platformers). Most of my PC gaming is done on my keyboard, but hey — never hurts to have some options, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="KwUmg2"&gt;
&lt;p id="y126zh"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Talk a little about your toys. Which are your favorites, and are there any interesting stories you’d like to share about any of them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yg3RLz"&gt;I received the Rubik’s Cube as a gift from a friend a few years ago for my birthday. I know how to solve it, but I simply have not had the time. The fidget spinner is neat, too. Usually when I need a screen break, I just play with the fidget spinner a bit to relax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8eXfR1"&gt;I purchased the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/elago-AirPods-Compatible-Keychain-Registered/dp/B083LXTFXS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elago AW4 AirPods case&lt;/a&gt; because I was afraid I would misplace my pair of earbuds. Most of my family have these same earbuds, so I wanted to make sure that I could tell my case from the rest. It also looks really cute. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fUSFf6"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That’s a wonderful banner you have hung up behind your desk! &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nHB9Bb"&gt;Aw, shucks. This was the thing I was really excited to share with you. I love collecting flags. I have about nine or 10 right now, but only four of them are hanging up at the moment. The one you see above my desk is the Maryland flag (aka the best state flag &lt;em&gt;ever&lt;/em&gt;). In case it’s not clear, I have a lot of state pride. I actually asked my mom to give me a Maryland flag as a high school graduation gift back in 2013, and it’s one of the handful of things that I consider my most prized possessions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fOt6L5"&gt;I am sure you can see the American flag above my bed, too. I bought that one a year later when I was looking to redesign my room. I know some people will have their critiques of America as a whole, but I love being American, and I think our country has an incredible flag. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft, Google, and Qualcomm are reportedly nervous about Nvidia acquiring Arm</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="nvidia, nvidiastock" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/95lKGTM1NsAMMuSY_WW5UmI8LgU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68811401/DSC00697.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kZVmi9"&gt;Microsoft, Google, and Qualcomm have been raising concerns to regulators about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/13/21435507/nvidia-acquiring-arm-40-billion-chips-ai-deal"&gt;Nvidia’s Arm acquisition&lt;/a&gt;, according to reports by &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/12/qualcomm-objects-to-nvidias-40-billion-arm-acquisition.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-12/google-microsoft-qualcomm-protest-nvidia-s-arm-acquisition-kl2laz51?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The companies have approached regulators in the US, EU, UK, and China, reportedly with concerns that Nvidia could change how Arm licenses out its chipmaking technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qQhLk"&gt;Nvidia has pledged that it won’t use its control over the company to change how it interacts with other businesses. &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a3adccc9-678e-44ef-bdb5-e847ecb7de8c"&gt;Writing to the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said he could “unequivocally state that Nvidia will maintain Arm’s open licensing model. We have no intention to ‘throttle’ or ‘deny’ Arm’s supply to any customer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lJiFld"&gt;Nvidia’s rivals argue, however, that keeping Arm neutral and not using its tech to Nvidia’s own gains isn’t what the company would be incentivized to do — especially not after paying $40 billion for it. Restrictions on licensing, however, would hurt the companies that benefit from having the ability to license Arm’s technology. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/14/21221062/google-processor-pixels-chromebooks-whitechapel-samsung-qualcomm"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22189450/microsoft-arm-processors-chips-servers-surface-report"&gt;Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; are reportedly working on their own Arm-based chips, and Qualcomm’s processors are based on the architecture. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RgnJuX"&gt;For its part, Nvidia has argued that the acquisition is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21435890/nvidia-arm-acquisition-40-billion-ai-cloud-edge-why"&gt;about driving AI forward&lt;/a&gt;, which is an area Nvidia has focused on heavily, from its machine learning-powered upscaling on its graphics cards &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/23/21300614/mercedes-benz-nvidia-computer-orin-self-driving-adas-ota"&gt;to its work in self-driving cars&lt;/a&gt;. Arm’s low-power technology could help Nvidia spread AI into more places, but the company will also have to figure out what to do with everything else Arm does — mainly, powering almost every cellphone in existence as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21526702/microsoft-surface-pro-x-2020-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;holding the key to computer companies moving away from Intel&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gwKARN"&gt;Regulators are also apparently looking closely at the deal to determine whether it would give Nvidia too much power in the chipmaking business: according to CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;the Federal Trade Commission has asked Nvidia and Arm to give it more information, and it could be talking to “other companies who may have relevant information.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D6IT6z"&gt;Meanwhile, UK and EU officials &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/a3adccc9-678e-44ef-bdb5-e847ecb7de8c"&gt;have promised to “thoroughly investigate”&lt;/a&gt; the deal. It’s very likely that they will hear many objections, not just from Google, Microsoft, and Qualcomm, but from others in the chipmaking industry who are concerned about their open-licensing agreement with Arm being affected by the merger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xLffgW"&gt;These companies have experience with regulators and anti-competitive behavior. Qualcomm has had to pay several fines in the hundreds of millions and sometimes billions of dollars to authorities in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/2/9/8009589/qualcomm-fined-975-million-by-chinese-anti-monopoly-regulators"&gt;China&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-qualcomm-antitrust/south-korea-fines-qualcomm-854-million-for-violating-competition-laws-idUSKBN14H062"&gt;South Korea&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16927042/qualcomm-apple-antitrust-chip-deal-eu-fine"&gt;the EU&lt;/a&gt; for anti-competitive licensing policies. Microsoft, of course, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/6/17827042/antitrust-1990s-microsoft-google-aol-monopoly-lawsuits-history"&gt;had its big monopoly case in the ‘90s&lt;/a&gt;, where it went up against the US government, and Google has recently been the focus of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21506682/google-apple-amazon-facebook-antitrust-report-house-judiciary"&gt;growing antitrust sentiment in the US&lt;/a&gt; and EU.&lt;/p&gt;
