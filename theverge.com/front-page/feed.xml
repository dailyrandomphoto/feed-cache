    <title>Apple Stores across NYC are only open if you’re picking up an online order</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bax011"&gt;As initially reported by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1475577591268446214"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s&lt;/em&gt; Mark Gurman&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-27/apple-closes-new-york-city-stores-to-shoppers-after-covid-spike"&gt;all of New York City’s Apple Stores&lt;/a&gt; have joined the list of locations closing their doors to most customers amid a spike in the number of COVID-19 infections. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DQ5AT4"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/22/22850946/apple-store-covid-two-hour-free-shipping-option"&gt;Apple closed seven stores in North America&lt;/a&gt; in a single day as positive tests among employees rose, and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/12/27/20-apple-stores-closed-in-us-today/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out that even before this announcement, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/retail/storelist/"&gt;the Apple website listed&lt;/a&gt; more than 20 locations that were closed today due to the effects of the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nu30nI"&gt;For people in New York City, the stores are still accessible if you have an appointment to pick up an online order. All other services, like its Genius Bar tech support or shopping by appointment, are currently listed as unavailable. There’s no word on how long the current situation will last, but Apple is no longer offering the free two-hour delivery option it pushed ahead of last week’s holiday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Messy NFT drop angers infosec pioneers with unauthorized portraits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zyZq5g-eplnmB1P3ZAMNXj7WtXA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70321294/acastro_210319_1777_nft_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NrAAQa"&gt;An unauthorized NFT drop celebrating infosec pioneers has collapsed into a mess of conflicting takedowns and piracy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brOs38"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IBCDAO/status/1474725664741756931"&gt;Released on Christmas Day&lt;/a&gt; by a group called “ItsBlockchain,” the “Cipher Punks” NFT package included portraits of 46 distinct figures, with ten copies of each token. Taken at their opening price, the full value of the drop was roughly $4,000. But almost immediately, the infosec community began to raise objections — including some from the portrait subjects themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="vaGhnt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O99BKc"&gt;The portrait images misspelled several names — including EFF speech activist Jillian York and OpenPGP creator Jon Callas — and based at least one drawing on a copyright-protected photograph. More controversially, the list included some figures who have been ostracized for harmful personal behavior, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/21/16807116/infosec-community-sexual-predators-weinstein-assault"&gt;Jacob Appelbaum&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://selamjie.medium.com/remove-richard-stallman-appendix-a-a7e41e784f88"&gt;Richard Stallman&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnWcLz"&gt;Responding on Twitter, York tweeted a link to her own portrait and said simply, “I don’t approve of this whatsoever and would like it removed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxn3gO"&gt;Removing the NFTs has been more complicated than it might seem. The ItsBlockchain team apologized on Twitter for not obtaining likeness rights in advance and said it has removed 28 NFTs from the group and burned two others. But there’s no clear procedure for removing tokens that have already been sold, and ItsBlockchain is mostly counting on the central OpenSea platform to remove the tokens and resolve the issue. ItsBlockchain has appealed to the platform for guidance, but so far it has received little guidance. (OpenSea did not respond to a request for comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9NavJ"&gt;“We have been trying to resolve this issue ... we want to take it down,” the group said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “OpenSea involvement would make the job easy at this stage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RsA1TQ"&gt;The incident is a reminder of the potentially thorny legal issues around NFTs, where &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22809090/nft-create-opensea-rarible-cryptocurrency-ethereum-collectibles-how-to"&gt;norms of permissionless innovation&lt;/a&gt; often clash with likeness rights and intellectual property law. Typically, US laws around publicity rights hold that a person’s name and identity can’t be used for promotion without their consent — although it’s unclear how such a lawsuit would work in practice when applied to NFTs.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Batman’s latest trailer introduces the Riddler as a FaceTime troll</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Vc3BlHrId9W7dr04djpfzd66B40=/0x16:1300x883/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70321283/enigma_coffiee.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image by Warner Bros. Pictures&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TX7OmT"&gt;A new trailer for &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt; gives us a glimpse at Catwoman’s “thing” for stray cats and the Riddler’s affinity for FaceTime. What’s promised as an even grittier take on &lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;/em&gt; stars Robert Pattinson as Batman, Zoë Kravitz as Catwoman, and Paul Dano as the Riddler.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5RaTA"&gt;The two-and-a-half-minute teaser, appropriately titled “The Bat and the Cat,” highlights the relationship between Bruce Wayne and Selina Kyle, who don’t always appear to get along. In one scene, Batman is commenting on the — apparently concerning — number of cats Catwoman has in her home, and in the next, the duo is sparring in a low-lit office. The pair comes together by the end of the trailer, with both battling the same bad guys.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4Kegmeni7GGP3a9pyW9Pg7qqSi8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23128475/batman_trailer_facetime.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Warner Bros. Pictures&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Batman answers the Riddler’s video call.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xrNKA8"&gt;Not to mention that the trickiest villain in the &lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;/em&gt; universe, the Riddler, seems to be a FaceTime aficionado — well, at least for trying to scare his enemies. After Batman accepts a call from an unknown contact, a chalky question mark symbol appears on his screen, with a figure that’s presumably the Riddler quickly entering the frame. A separate scene shows the Riddler gazing into his phone’s camera with a single goggle-covered eyeball.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XULdkk"&gt;The action-packed trailer gives us a taste of everything to come in &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt; — action-packed car chases in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164886/batmobile-batman-matt-reeves-robert-pattinson-motorcycle-suit"&gt;the Batmobile&lt;/a&gt;, a possible romance between Batman and Catwoman, and the Riddler’s bizarre FaceTime calls. &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt; was originally slated for release this year, but delays caused by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21503618/the-batman-matrix-4-release-dates-warner-bros"&gt;pandemic pushed it back until March 4th, 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Motorola will try foldable phones again with a third-generation Razr</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Razr’s Quick View display is convenient" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PhCz_aJGzCQ-mAa_V9F0tn229UM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70320913/dbohn_201023_4260_0008.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not pictured: a beloved phone.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Dieter Bohn / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qgFVqx"&gt;Motorola is working on a new version of its Razr foldable smartphones, according to a Weibo post &lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/motorola-razr-3-3079713/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/5517268716/L7wJbmcFk"&gt;The post&lt;/a&gt; is from Chen Jin, the general manager of the Lenovo Mobile Business Group in China (Lenovo is currently in charge of Motorola’s smartphone business), and describes how the company has been quietly working on a new addition to its lineup of foldable phones. It doesn’t have big shoes to fill — Motorola’s first two modern foldables were mediocre phones with hefty price tags.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j7hOxN"&gt;We ran Jin’s post through a few translation sites, and while some parts didn’t make the jump to English, there are consistent details that show up in all the translations. The post mentions that the phone will have a better processor, better interface, and a tweaked appearance. At this early stage, though, it’s hard to say how different the third-gen device will be from the last one — the second-gen Razr was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536546/motorola-razr-2020-review-5g-folding-flip"&gt;more of a spec bump that added 5G&lt;/a&gt;, rather than a marked improvement from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;original Razr foldable&lt;/a&gt; announced in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k3wjvnG52T1oiKg_NhAI7LThbdY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23128380/Screen_Shot_2021_12_27_at_12.11.59.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s translation of Jin’s Weibo post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VwPyMK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Will the third time be the charm?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9iTVZO"&gt;Perhaps the third attempt at a foldable will be a charm — its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;previous two attempts&lt;/a&gt; have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21536546/motorola-razr-2020-review-5g-folding-flip"&gt;hard to recommend&lt;/a&gt;, even before Samsung released &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22631125/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-review"&gt;the exceptional Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt; for $1,000. Today’s news, though, plus the fact that it’s still providing Android updates for them (albeit at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623902/motorola-razr-foldable-android-11-software-update-in-2021"&gt;a pretty slow pace&lt;/a&gt;), makes it seem like Motorola hasn’t given up on Razr revival. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OnCMET"&gt;&lt;a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=auto&amp;amp;tl=en&amp;amp;text=%E6%97%B6%E5%85%89%E5%9B%9E%E5%88%B02019%E5%B9%B411%E6%9C%8814%E5%8F%B7%EF%BC%8C%0Amotorola%20%E6%96%B0razr%20%E4%B8%8A%E5%B8%82%EF%BC%8C%E4%BD%9C%E4%B8%BA%E4%B8%9A%E5%86%85%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E6%AC%BE%E7%AB%96%E5%90%91%E6%8A%98%E5%8F%A0%E5%B1%8F%E6%99%BA%E8%83%BD%E6%89%8B%E6%9C%BA%EF%BC%8C%E5%86%8D%E4%B8%80%E6%AC%A1%E5%BC%95%E9%A2%86%E4%BA%86%E8%A1%8C%E4%B8%9A%E5%88%9B%E6%96%B0%E3%80%82%0A%E8%81%94%E6%83%B3%E7%A0%94%E7%A9%B6%E9%99%A2%E7%8B%AC%E7%AB%8B%E7%A0%94%E5%8F%91%E7%9A%84%E6%98%9F%E8%BD%A8%E8%BD%AC%E8%BD%B4%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%EF%BC%8C%E6%98%AF%E5%BD%93%E6%97%B6%E5%85%A8%E7%90%83%E5%94%AF%E4%B8%80%E6%8A%95%E5%85%A5%E9%87%8F%E4%BA%A7%E7%9A%84%E6%97%A0%E7%BC%9D%E6%97%A0%E6%8A%98%E7%97%95%E9%93%B0%E9%93%BE%E6%8A%80%E6%9C%AF%E3%80%82%0A%E6%88%91%E8%AE%A4%E4%B8%BA%E5%88%9B%E6%96%B0%E6%B0%B8%E8%BF%9C%E6%98%AF%E8%A1%8C%E4%B8%9A%E7%9A%84%E9%A9%B1%E5%8A%A8%E5%8A%9B%E3%80%82%0A%E6%88%91%E5%B8%8C%E6%9C%9B%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E4%B8%8D%E6%98%AF%E5%8F%A3%E6%B0%B4%EF%BC%8C%E8%80%8C%E6%98%AF%E8%A1%8C%E5%8A%A8%E6%9B%B4%E5%A4%9A%E4%B8%80%E4%BA%9B%EF%BC%8C%E5%8C%85%E6%8B%AC%E9%BB%98%E9%BB%98%E7%94%A8%E5%BF%83%E5%9C%B0%E5%87%86%E5%A4%87%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%89%E4%BB%A3razr%20%E6%8A%98%E5%8F%A0%E5%B1%8F%E6%89%8B%E6%9C%BA%3A%E6%9B%B4%E5%85%88%E8%BF%9B%E7%9A%84%E8%8A%AF%E7%89%87%E7%AE%97%E5%8A%9B%EF%BC%8C%E6%9B%B4%E4%BC%98%E7%A7%80%E7%9A%84%E4%BA%BA%0A%E6%9C%BA%E7%95%8C%E9%9D%A2%EF%BC%8C%E5%BD%93%E7%84%B6%EF%BC%8C%E8%BF%98%E6%9C%89%E6%9B%B4%E5%A4%A7%E6%B0%94%E7%9A%84%E5%A4%96%E8%A7%82%E3%80%82%0A%E8%BF%99%E6%AC%BE%E4%BA%A7%E5%93%81%EF%BC%8C%E6%88%91%E4%BB%AC%E5%BD%93%E4%BB%81%E4%B8%8D%E8%AE%A9%E4%BC%9A%E5%9C%A8%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%B8%82%E5%9C%BA%E7%AC%AC%E4%B8%80%E4%B8%AA%E4%B8%8A%E5%B8%82%EF%BC%81&amp;amp;op=translate"&gt;One translation&lt;/a&gt; of Jin’s post indicates that it could release in China first, which is backed up by the announcement appearing on Weibo. We’ll be keeping our eyes out for more details or an announcement of this phone to see if it’s truly a notable upgrade or just another iteration of a forgettable foldable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KcUQZd"&gt;Manuella Foz, a Motorola spokesperson, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company “cannot comment on future devices” in response to an emailed request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bVt53W"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction December 27th:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; The original version of this article incorrectly stated that &lt;/em&gt;Android Police&lt;em&gt; spotted Jin’s Weibo post. The post was actually found by &lt;/em&gt;Android Authority&lt;em&gt;. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>California is suing Walmart over alleged improper disposal of e-waste and other hazardous materials</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Walmart store" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vYHQ2OMUWcWXm073Q-hC2zkykTI=/0x43:1000x710/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70320602/Walmart_Store.1419979890.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Walmart store&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zF1xKr"&gt;Last week, the California attorney general and 12 state officials &lt;a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-bonta-announces-statewide-lawsuit-against-walmart-illegal"&gt;filed a lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; against Walmart, saying it allegedly illegally disposed of electronic and hazardous waste, compromising local landfills.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjdYJ6"&gt;California Attorney General Rob Bonta alleges in a statement the company violated state environmental laws with their practices, and the waste included materials like lithium and alkaline batteries, insect killer sprays, aerosol cans, LED lightbulbs, and more.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FX8Y3Q"&gt;State investigators conducted 58 inspections across 13 counties from 2015 to 2021 and said they found classified hazardous and medical waste in each store’s trash compactors, as well as customer information that should have been rendered indecipherable. The California DOJ estimates that Walmart’s unlawfully disposed waste totals 159,600 pounds or more than 1 million items each year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLvL4M"&gt;“We have met with the state numerous times to walk them through our industry-leading hazardous waste compliance programs in an effort to avoid litigation, but instead, they filed this unjustified lawsuit,” Walmart spokesperson Randy Hargrove said in a statement. “The state is demanding a level of compliance regarding waste disposal from our stores of common house-hold products and other items that goes beyond what is required by law. We intend to defend this company.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sf9kuH"&gt;Hargrove said that the compactor waste audits “conducted or overseen by the California attorney general have shown that the compactor waste contain at most 0.4% of items of potential concern,” comparing it to the 3 percent statewide average. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVa9sv"&gt;This is not the first time Walmart has tangled with the state over its alleged waste practices. In 2010, Walmart reached a $25 million settlement with the California attorney general’s office for illegally disposing of hazardous waste. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXnLod"&gt;Hargrove says the court was “prepared to relieve Walmart of its obligations” from its 2010 settlement, but “the attorney general’s office launched a new investigation with new rules in hope that Walmart would enter another settlement requiring another substantial financial payment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gB1XpA"&gt;The company also paid $1.25 million to Missouri in 2012 for a similar incident and &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/wal-mart-pleads-guilty-federal-environmental-crimes-admits-civil-violations-and-will-pay-more"&gt;pleaded guilty in 2013&lt;/a&gt; for negligently discharging a pollutant into drains in 16 counties in California, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/business-lawsuits-california-sacramento-hazardous-waste-6ac265da9f2cb150e8a73c7a5cc7e01b"&gt;the&lt;em&gt; Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-walmart-lawsuit-llegal-hazardous-waste-landfills/"&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S7Miks"&gt;“Despite repeated enforcements against Walmart over the past two decades, it consistently - and knowingly - fails to comply with California’s environmental protection laws,” director Meredith Williams of the Department of Toxic Substances Control in California said in the press release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPybRu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction December 27th,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4:25PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;: &lt;em&gt;An earlier version of this story stated that Walmart had to pay a fine of $125 million in 2012. They only had to pay $1.25 million. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom’s latest acquisition connects professional broadcast tools for large-scale events</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hQFwcaqbCvPl4qO8LLTG934k3y4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70320493/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="B3hUXA"&gt;Zoom has acquired the Zoom-based broadcast tools created by the startup Liminal, along with two of the company's co-founders, the videoconferencing platform announced in &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/zoom-future-of-events-expanded-offerings-acquisition-of-liminal-assets/"&gt;a post on its blog&lt;/a&gt;. Liminal’s add-ons, &lt;a href="https://www.liminalet.com/zoomosc"&gt;ZoomOSC&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.liminalet.com/zoomiso"&gt;ZoomISO&lt;/a&gt;, are built for creating professional virtual events, which Zoom will likely natively integrate into its software as part of the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2NoM1B"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The acquisition will help “bridge” the gap between “emerging” and “traditional” forms of event control tools&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u2Z9QB"&gt;As noted on Liminal’s site, ZoomOSC is designed to enhance professional meetings and events using the Open Sound Control (OSC) protocol, enabling you to integrate Zoom with third-party software, hardware controllers, and media servers. Meanwhile, ZoomISO allows you to export each participants’ video feed as a separate output to professional production hardware, five of which you can choose to output in HD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gtbp3p"&gt;By acquiring these assets from Liminal, Zoom says it will help the platform “bridge” the gap between “emerging” and “traditional” forms of event control tools, which should come in handy for broadcast studios, theaters, and other organizations that want to create professional streams. The platform took the dive into large-scale virtual events when it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22442919/zoom-live-events-paid-tickets-conferences-chat"&gt;first announced its Events feature&lt;/a&gt; in May and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22585980/zoom-apps-events-launch-onzoom"&gt;officially rolled it out in July&lt;/a&gt;. With &lt;a href="https://events.zoom.us/"&gt;Events&lt;/a&gt;, organizers can create event hubs, sell tickets, and create multiple livestream sessions throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJqMHv"&gt;Zoom spokesperson Candace Dean told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that Liminal’s existing tools will remain available through Liminal’s site, however, as Zoom expands on those tools and builds something similar into the platform, there will no longer be a need for them as separate add-ons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="toEQ7W"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 27th, 3:45PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added a statement from a Zoom spokesperson.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Final Fantasy XVI’s next big reveal won’t come until spring 2022 after six months of COVID-19 delays</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GMOkcdq8HOzu8uvRpMM5TMmdeOY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70320383/Ele1vVZXEAEatX8.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MJTpCq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21438708/final-fantasy-xvi-trailer-ps5-playstation-5-sony"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XVI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is the latest game to be hit by COVID-related development delays, with the game’s producer Naoki Yoshida announcing in a letter posted to Twitter that work on the upcoming PlayStation 5 RPG has been set back by about six months. Furthermore, Yoshida announced that the next major reveal for the upcoming title — originally promised for sometime in 2021 — is now being pushed out to sometime in spring 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nom9Zj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="pt" dir="ltr"&gt;A message from Final Fantasy XVI producer Naoki Yoshida. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FF16?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#FF16&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FFXVI?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#FFXVI&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/qtfJUUp6LA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qtfJUUp6LA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FINAL FANTASY XVI (@finalfantasyxvi) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/finalfantasyxvi/status/1475335618905669635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lMXQnJ"&gt;It’s not too surprising that &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XVI&lt;/em&gt; has been hit by delays. As the first flagship &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; game for a next-generation console, the development process is a massive effort spanning development teams around the world. “In an effort to offset the effects of COVID-19, we’ve had to decentralize that workforce by permitting staff to tackle their assignments from home,” Yoshida’s letter explains. “This has unfortunately hampered communication from the Tokyo office, which, in turn, has led to delays in — or in extreme cases, cancellations of — asset deliveries from our outsource partners.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vjcf9j"&gt;Still, the delay means that what’s already been a long wait for &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; fans eager to see more of the upcoming title will be stretching even longer, especially considering that &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XVI&lt;/em&gt; was first revealed in September 2020, before the PlayStation 5 had even launched. Since that initial reveal, there still hasn’t been a new trailer, any more information on the game, or even an estimated release window. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vIESql"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2tBnBAkHv9M?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JO6DvV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XV &lt;/em&gt;— the last numbered release in the main series of the franchise — was released over five years ago in November 2016. Square Enix has kept players busy in the interim, though, with more recent releases like &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; and the ongoing expansions for its online MMO, &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; — whose most recently expansion, &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt;, is in such high demand that Square Enix had to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22839415/final-fantasy-14-sales-suspended-servers-over-capacity-digital-physical"&gt;suspend sales of the games to try to mitigate server queues&lt;/a&gt;. (Yoshida is also the producer and director for &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt;, in addition to his work on &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XVI&lt;/em&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvLGMn"&gt;Still, there is hope on the horizon for &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; fans: Yoshida’s letter notes that the team has spent most of 2021 addressing its COVID-related delays and plans to “better focus” on things like improving the game’s graphics, combat mechanics, cutscenes, and more going forward, ahead of its “next big reveal” in spring 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>XPG imagines a gaming mouse that can also store 1TB of games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N6uX6Wt9WSefd-OlDCuX_VUjht8=/0x3:1500x1003/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70320363/xpg_peripheral.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;“The Vault” is an appropriate name.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: XPG&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2Pqy4f"&gt;XPG &lt;a href="https://www.xpg.com/us/news/960"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; the XPG Vault, a “concept” mouse that has a built-in SSD to let you carry around your mouse and storage in one package (&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/xpg-mouse-with-ssd-inside-210055310.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). While lots of gaming mice have some built-in storage to let you easily carry macros and preferences from computer to computer, and the concept of a mouse doubling as a flash drive has &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/usb-storage-mouse-does-double-duty/"&gt;been around for over a decade&lt;/a&gt;, XPG is aiming a little higher. It’s promising “to make your gaming libraries conveniently portable,” right from your mouse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fW0tVV"&gt;There aren’t many details for the Vault in XPG’s press release, but XPG says the “current prototype can integrate up to 1TB of Solid State memory running at 985MB/s” and connects with USB-C. Given that it’s a wired mouse, that performance seems possible — and it’d imply that you could actually play games stored on the Vault. There’s certainly enough room for a few titles, as long as one of them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22302057/call-of-duty-warzone-black-ops-modern-warfare-500gb-size"&gt;isn’t &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="oL4DtG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The press release is light on details, but it’s still intriguing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8zcaJA"&gt;However, it’s unclear what other levels of storage are available and if it’ll be upgradable (that seems hard to imagine, but it’s easy to wish for). There’s also no data about the SSD, though it’d probably be a safe bet that it’s made by ADATA, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22851422/samsung-adata-pcie-5-0-ssd-ces-speed-date"&gt;the memory and SSD company&lt;/a&gt; that owns XPG. The press release also doesn’t include any specs that people serious about mousing will care about, like the Vault’s DPI or sensor. The company’s post does, however, also announce the XPG Alpha mouse, which looks a lot like the Vault. That one will use Pixart’s PAW3335 sensor and will have wireless capabilities at the cost of not having built-in storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jv9P6w"&gt;XPG says that visitors to its CES booth will get a “peek” at the Vault, so it’s always possible we’ll hear more details about it soon — it’d be interesting to know how heavy it is, whether you can actually play games off it, if there’s any difference in responsiveness when you’re using the SSD versus when you’re not, etc. Since &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; won’t be doing CES in person this year (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22849223/ces-2022-t-mobile-bailed-keynote-meta-pinterest-twitter-iheart"&gt;along with many other companies&lt;/a&gt;), we reached out to XPG to see if we could get any more information and will update if we hear back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnkvF7"&gt;Given that this is being billed as a “concept” and “prototype,” it’s possible this is the most we’ll ever hear about this mouse — that’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22225459/best-tech-ces-2020-where-are-they-now-what-happened-next"&gt;not exactly uncommon for things announced at CES&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s an interesting idea that doesn’t seem completely improbable; even if XPG doesn’t end up making this exact product, it’s possible we could have a future where you walk up to the LAN party with just your mouse, and that gives you access to all your games. You know, when LAN parties are safe to have again.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spyware scandal rocks Polish government</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Polish Politics" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/krNidajv99SY_bnWrQwm3nZREWc=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70320191/1127310221.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Polish opposition leader Krzysztof Brejza | Photo by Mateusz Wlodarczyk/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qbJbsw"&gt;Several members of political opposition groups in Poland have produced evidence that they were hacked by Pegasus spyware, raising alarming questions about the Polish government’s use of the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcHthG"&gt;The most alarming case involved the leader of Poland’s Civic Platform party, Senator Krzysztof Brejza, whose phone was compromised a total of 33 times in the six months leading up to the 2019 election, as reported by &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-middle-east-elections-europe-c16b2b811e482db8fbc0bbc37c00c5ab"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. During the campaign, Polish state media published damaging text messages obtained from Brejza’s phone, leading to concerns that spyware had been used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="okQB4p"&gt;&lt;q&gt;a threat to “the rules-based international order”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eZawPy"&gt;The compromises were discovered by Citizen Lab, a spyware research group based at the University of Toronto, which has done extensive work on Pegasus. Citizen Lab previously found evidence linking the Pegasus spyware to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/21/22848485/pegasus-spyware-jamal-khashoggi-murder-nso-hanan-elatr-new-analysis"&gt;the killing of Jamal Khashoggi&lt;/a&gt; and a separate campaign &lt;a href="https://citizenlab.ca/2021/10/new-york-times-i-was-hacked-the-spyware-used-against-me-makes-us-all-vulnerable/"&gt;against a &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt; journalist&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuupgV"&gt;In the Polish case, Citizen Lab &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/technology-business-poland-hacking-warsaw-8b52e16d1af60f9c324cf9f5099b687e"&gt;also found evidence&lt;/a&gt; of spyware compromises targeting a lawyer representing Polish opposition groups and a prosecutor involved in a case against the ruling Law and Justice party. In both cases, traces of Pegasus spyware were found on the targets’ devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ygdCZC"&gt;Despite the evidence, the Polish government has steadfastly denied any use of spyware, either for intelligence gathering or domestic surveillance. “The Pegasus system is not used by the Polish services,” the Deputy Defense minister said recently, &lt;a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-opposition-politician-accuses-government-phone-hack-krzysztof-brejza/"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;Politico Europe&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “It is not used to follow or investigate anyone in our country.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cXqYg3"&gt;Still, the scandal is likely to have significant consequences for Poland’s standing in the European Union and build the case for further technical protections against Pegasus. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22798917/apple-nso-group-spyware-pegasus-cybersecurity-research"&gt;In November&lt;/a&gt;, Apple filed a federal lawsuit against NSO Group (which develops and sells Pegasus), seeking a permanent injunction against the company’s use of Apple products and services. Amazon Web Services has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583523/amazon-web-services-bans-nso-group-pegasus-spyware-infrastructure"&gt;blocked all accounts linked with NSO Group&lt;/a&gt;, and the US Treasury Department has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761565/nso-group-pegasus-spyware-entity-list-us-government-human-rights"&gt;moved to block exports or other transactions with the company&lt;/a&gt;, calling it a threat to “the rules-based international order.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gNjXUu"&gt;During the Christmas holiday, it was easy to pick up on the theme on Twitter that &lt;em&gt;many &lt;/em&gt;of you either bought or received an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21437674/oculus-quest-2-review-features-photos"&gt;Oculus Quest 2 virtual reality headset&lt;/a&gt;. Well, in perfect timing, Oculus has discounted many of its official accessories for the Quest 2, which can help to protect your headset, as well as make it more comfortable to wear. We’ve seen promotions that discount these add-ons when you purchase a headset, but never by themselves, so that’s why they’re prominently featured today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnLZic"&gt;Best Buy has the best deal on the Elite Strap that replaces the fabric strap that comes with your Quest 2. It distributes the weight of the headset more evenly on your head, with adjusters on the top and rear of the Elite Strap. Normally $49, it’s just $39 at Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="my6nUQ"&gt;I recently bought one, and I’m about to buy another — not because I love them &lt;em&gt;that &lt;/em&gt;much, mind you. Based on my experience, they tend to last about a year under normal wear-and-tear, with the plastic side arms eventually breaking. Thankfully, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22176820/oculus-quest-2-elite-strap-extended-warranty-quality-problems"&gt;Oculus now offers a two-year warranty on this product&lt;/a&gt;, and the company can replace broken straps free of charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8EKSeH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10298202"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5nghmP"&gt;I also recommend the Oculus Quest 2 zip-up case, which provides a safe place for your headset and controllers to reside when they aren’t in use. We’re also seeing this product discounted for the first time, from $49 down to $39.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="D05JMy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10949359"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cp04YA"&gt;Micro Center retail stores aren’t too common to find in the US, but if you have one near you, you can get the best price on Apple’s new AirPods Pro that offer MagSafe charging. These launched at $249.99, &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/643985/apple-airpods-pro-active-noise-cancelling-true-wireless-bluetooth-earbuds-with-magsafe-white"&gt;but they’re all the way down to $159.99&lt;/a&gt;. You can reserve a set online at the store closest to you, but you’ll need to actually make the trek to a Micro Center store to pick them up. That might be worth it to some, but don’t fret if it’s a no-go with you. We’re likely to see this deal at other retailers in the coming weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Fn5wft"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10934767"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UcMN6Y"&gt;The Microsoft 365 Family plan (one-year, auto-renewing, up to six people) — which gives you access to apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, as well as 1TB of OneDrive cloud storage for each person, and more — is selling for its normal $99.99 cost, but it comes with a complimentary $50 gift card. You’ll receive a digital code for Microsoft 365 Family, but the $50 Amazon gift card will be delivered by mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LBWIAP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10949368"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7NPcy6"&gt;In the latest round of “deals I should have had the patience to wait a few more weeks for,” &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei V&lt;/em&gt; for the Nintendo Switch is down to $34.99 from its normal $59.99 price. This game is often compared to &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s not an unfounded comparison, given that the franchise was spun out of &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="niJ5Uj"&gt;You’ll find some similarities, primarily in the turn-based combat, the foes you’re up against, and the fact that they’re both long-lasting RPG adventures. Though, &lt;em&gt;Shin Megami Tensei&lt;/em&gt; has a reputation for being more difficult and brooding than &lt;em&gt;Persona&lt;/em&gt;. They’re each great in their own ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="h3UEPU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10949375"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This model comes with a wired charging case.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lgJHsK"&gt;We saw the bronze-colored Ember Smart Mug 2 selling at a discount before the holidays, but &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgiidQHszZJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the white-colored mug is discounted&lt;/a&gt; at Best Buy right now, costing $99.99. This is $30 off the usual cost.&lt;/li&gt;
