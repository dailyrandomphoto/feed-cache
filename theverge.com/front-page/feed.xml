    <title>The 12.9 Max Plus is Brydge’s best iPad keyboard yet</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The biggest trackpad you can get, if not necessarily the best&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="6xcL1r"&gt;Brydge has been making iPad keyboards for nearly a decade now, and while the iPad itself has changed a lot over that time, the company has largely followed the same formula: design a keyboard that makes the iPad look like a MacBook Pro. The key design element has been the company’s trademark rubberized hinges, which the iPad slots into to form the other half of a laptop-style device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NBjK6"&gt;Now, Brydge is trying something slightly new. The 12.9 Max Plus, which starts shipping this week, is a keyboard case for the iPad Pro that does away with the hinge clamps and instead makes use of magnets for a sleeker and more convenient experience. The product also leans hard into Apple’s recent addition of cursor support to iPadOS, with a huge trackpad that’s comparable in size to what you’d find on a MacBook Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EtPHtr"&gt;At $249.99, this is a premium product aimed at heavy iPad Pro users, and it’s only available for the biggest iPad size. Apple’s own Magic Keyboard is clearly formidable competition. But Brydge is able to undercut Apple by $100, and in some important ways, I prefer the Max Plus to the Magic Keyboard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Eyi6iS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10627296"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="riplm7"&gt;The most obvious difference between the Max Plus and other Brydge keyboards is the magnetic plate in which you rest the iPad. This offers protection for the back of the iPad without having to attach the snap-on magnetic cover that Brydge included on prior models, and more importantly, it’s far less fiddly to attach and detach the iPad than it was to squeeze it into the old-style hinge clamps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oOMG5x"&gt;The tradeoff, of course, is that you’re adding a few millimeters of thickness behind the iPad, especially if (like me) you never bothered with the magnetic protective back covers supplied with previous Brydge keyboards. With 17mm of thickness and an extra 970g of weight, the resulting 12.9-inch “laptop” you get with the Max Plus is quite a bit thicker and heavier than a 13-inch MacBook Pro. The heft does help stabilize the combination, however, and it supports a wider range of viewing angles than the Magic Keyboard while feeling much more premium. As a tall person, the Magic Keyboard doesn’t always tilt back far enough to be comfortable for me, but I don’t have a problem with this Brydge. It’s also easier to use on your lap than a kickstand-based solution, as found in many of Logitech’s iPad keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4TfDO"&gt;While the magnet mechanism is convenient, the Max Plus unfortunately doesn’t use Apple’s Smart Connector for power and connectivity. This is still a Bluetooth device that you have to charge over USB-C, though the battery should last weeks or months on a charge depending on your usage (specifically how much you use the backlight). The Smart Connector would have been preferable, but it’s only ever appeared on Apple’s own products and Logitech devices that have been designed with Apple’s cooperation; it hasn’t shown up in any Brydge products or other devices from similarly smaller companies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TFASzfownXGUwv-IYVmQ4rbDR4c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22685746/IMG_20210628_151930_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I’ve been testing the white version of the Max Plus, which creates an unusual sandwich effect with my space gray iPad Pro. Silver and gray options are also available.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mj753N"&gt;Brydge has at least improved the Bluetooth experience in one notable way compared to most of its older products. The Max Plus has a feature called Instant-On that makes use of Bluetooth 5.0 to stay in a low-power state for up to four hours, meaning that if you step away from the iPad and come back it’ll instantly wake with a button press with no need for reconnection. That goes some way to making the combination feel more like a coherent product, because in practice you aren’t likely to find yourself running into laggy reconnection issues during a typical work day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8xTdfx"&gt;The keyboard itself is good. It feels a touch more responsive than previous Brydge products, but you’re not getting mechanical-level tactility here, of course — it’s just an above-average laptop keyboard. What really sets it apart when compared to Apple’s Magic Keyboard is the extra function row, which is very useful in iPadOS for things like brightness and volume control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W6EipB"&gt;The trackpad is a key selling point for the Max Plus. It can’t quite match the Magic Keyboard on pure responsiveness, which is no surprise given Apple’s low-level system access, but it does a good job nonetheless, and Brydge has been making continuous improvements to the firmware. It’s a huge trackpad by any standard, which makes using it for things like photo browsing and text editing a lot more enjoyable. Even though it has a diving board-style mechanism that doesn’t let you click everywhere (particularly in the upper left and right corners), there’s more than enough space and I had no problem using it just like I would a MacBook Pro’s.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BUqIRlpRPwD7GiezfnjCWXV-_4A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22685745/IMG_20210628_151714_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Brydge Max Plus has a huge trackpad.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RE52s4"&gt;The Brydge Max Plus isn’t for everyone, but then neither are iPad keyboards in general. Even though Apple came out with a good option last year, it’s very expensive and not without its quirks. What you get with the Max Plus is a less expensive — but still quite pricey — option that, more so than any Brydge keyboard to date, gives the iPad a laptop’s form factor and functionality. It’s not as slick or as inventive as the Magic Keyboard, but it’s more useful for my workflow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2qqMw"&gt;Brydge is really competing with itself here as much as Apple. Its previous highest end model, the 12.9 Pro Plus, just got a significant price cut to $169.99 and offers essentially the same functionality, just with a smaller trackpad and the old hinge design. I prefer the Max Plus, but the Pro Plus is a good option if you want to save some weight and cash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hd8LsO"&gt;There are still clear limitations to iPadOS, but cursor support really transformed the experience of working on an iPad, and no accessory embodies that better than the Brydge Max Plus. It’s not perfect, but right now it’s what I’d choose to get work done on the go.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch Samsung’s Galaxy MWC 2021 virtual event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L0yK9yhvUblKVEv9BDYwKEe_8oQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69513053/acastro_190503_1777_samsung_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cXAYcC"&gt;Samsung is hosting a virtual event for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287802/mwc-event-barcelona-testing-masks-vaccines"&gt;Mobile World Congress 2021&lt;/a&gt; on Monday, June 28th, where it promises to share how it’s “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/21/22544257/samsung-google-wear-os-smartwatch-mwc-2021-announcement-preview"&gt;reimagining smartwatches&lt;/a&gt;.” Along with wearables, the company is also supposed to share news on the latest additions to the Galaxy ecosystem and the work it's doing to enhance mobile security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0C0GI"&gt;At &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjfkIL2lrHxAhWFNX0KHVi_BYsQFnoECAYQAw&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22432922%2Fgoogle-io-2021-rumors-news-announcements&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw27o53hsjV_iPz1xRvsOq89"&gt;I/O 2021&lt;/a&gt;, Google announced that Samsung’s Tizen operating system &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22440483/samsung-smartwatch-google-wearos-tizen-watch"&gt;would be merging with Wear OS&lt;/a&gt; to serve as the future software powering smartwatches for Android phones (tentatively called “Wear”). There are no rumors to suggest Samsung will offer an in-depth look at those efforts, but recent leaks show that the company does have &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjJj52Wl7HxAhUiIDQIHQBqBU0QFnoECAQQAw&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F23%2F22546997%2Fsamsung-galaxy-watch-active-4-renders-leak-tizen-wear-os-smartwatch&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw2xU6T9qVmgE9WrJJYzUSoR"&gt;a new Galaxy Active Smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; in the works it might announce. There’s also a chance Samsung will show off the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549038/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-leak-image-foldable"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZjqhH"&gt;The event is set to run for exactly one hour, according to &lt;a href="https://www.mwcbarcelona.com/agenda/session/galaxy-ecosystem-new-watch-experience-mobile-security"&gt;Samsung’s MWC event page&lt;/a&gt;, which should hopefully give the company plenty of time to get into all of the details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="UFySNo"&gt;When does Samsung’s MWC 2021 virtual event start?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="HlZgDu"&gt;It starts at 10:15AM PT / 1:15PM ET / 7:15PM CET on Monday, June 28th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Zs0EhM"&gt;How do I watch Samsung’s MWC 2021 virtual event?&lt;/h1&gt;

    <title>TCL’s 20 Pro 5G will offer a big screen and wireless charging for $499</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dR9vu_vbJ0aXrin7M11RmOEtP0M=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69512897/TCL_20_Pro_5G_design_14.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;TCL’s 20 Pro 5G is priced to compete with established midrangers like the Galaxy A52 5G.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: TCL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1E7YSI"&gt;TCL is bringing three of its 20-series phones to the US today, with the $499 20 Pro 5G leading the way. It’s joined by the $249 TCL 20S with a trimmed-down feature set and the $189 TCL 20 SE equipped with a massive display and 5,000mAh battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWd228"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22382312/tcl-20-series-pro-5g-20l-plus-price-specs-features"&gt;First announced in April&lt;/a&gt;, the 20 Pro 5G is positioned to take on midrange devices like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514296/google-pixel-4a-5g-review-camera-speed-video"&gt;Google Pixel 4A 5G&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy A52 5G&lt;/a&gt;. It features a large curved 6.67-inch 1080p OLED screen, a 48-megapixel main camera with OIS, wireless charging, and sub-6GHz 5G connectivity. The device comes standard with 256GB of built-in storage and 6GB of RAM coupled with a Snapdragon 750G processor. There’s even a headphone jack.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TpQoVsWJ2NLsO5i0_gwDsyPBx5E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22677990/TCL_20_Pro_5G_Moondust_Gray_Front.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: TCL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 20 Pro 5G’s screen is slightly curved for a higher-end look.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UHbn82"&gt;Qi wireless charging at up to 15W is supported, and the 20 Pro 5G is equipped with a 4,500mAh battery. It ships with Android 11, and TCL says it will get at least two OS platform updates. At launch, it will work on T-Mobile’s 4G and 5G networks and AT&amp;amp;T’s 4G, and will gain compatibility with Verizon’s 4G and low-band 5G networks “in the coming weeks.” Spec-for-spec, it looks like a worthy midrange competitor. Wireless charging is still somewhat scarce in the $500-and-below class, and the 20 Pro offers more built-in storage than the A52 5G or the Pixel 4A 5G for the same price. Throw in a big, 1080p OLED screen, and it’s an intriguing proposition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="M10LIX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10621344"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gxOUES"&gt;A step down on the price scale, the 20S and 20 SE are equipped to compete with the Moto G and lower-tier Samsung Galaxy A-series devices of the world, with bigger-than-average screens and more generous built-in storage than is typical. The TCL 20S offers a 6.67-inch 1080p screen without the curve on the 20 Pro 5G — and misses out on a few of the higher-tier model’s features like wireless charging and an optically stabilized main camera. It uses a Snapdragon 665 processor with 4GB of RAM and 128GB of storage and offers a bigger 5,000mAh battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RquAs3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22219101/tcl-20-5g-20-se-android-phone-price-specs"&gt;The 20 SE&lt;/a&gt;, as the least expensive of the three, gets a huge 6.82-inch 720p display, Snapdragon 460 processor with 4GB of RAM, 128GB of storage, and a 5,000mAh battery. It also looks the part of a budget device, with a more prominent chin compared to the 20S and its slimmer bezels as well as a notch for the front-facing camera. Both will work on AT&amp;amp;T and T-Mobile; the 20 SE won’t be compatible with Verizon, while the 20S will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dLnjw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix users on Android can now stream partially downloaded content</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pjC_T9ciGAKY7AvMTeoxSARLKJs=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69512895/NETFLI_PLAYPARTIAL_KEYIMAGE_34.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Netflix’s partial downloads feature displayed on a mobile device.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g9zdZf"&gt;Netflix is launching a new feature for Android users that allows them to view partially downloaded titles — which will hopefully make exasperated attempts to quickly download content minutes before a flight a slightly less distressing experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hv4Pm1"&gt;Beginning today, Android users on mobile and tablets (versions 7.64 and higher) will be able to stream Netflix shows and movies before their download is completed. Previously, a title needed to be completely finished downloading to a device before it could be viewed — which, depending on your wifi connection or data plan could make streaming a title a headache, particularly in the aforementioned airport scenario. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w44gaB"&gt;Partial downloading will be limited to Android mobile and tablet devices for now, but Netflix said it “will be testing on iOS in the coming months.” Additionally, the company said that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295236/netflix-downloads-for-you-recomendations-streaming"&gt;Downloads for You&lt;/a&gt; feature, which auto-downloads recommended titles based on watch history and rolled out to Android users in February, would be getting a test on iOS “soon.” iOS users can access Smart Downloads, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18215134/netflix-smart-downloads-ios-automatic-download-wi-fi-deletion"&gt;launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt; and downloads the next episode of a series a user is viewing, in their settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MrIMdx"&gt;Android users will be able to find the setting in the Continue Watching section of the service or from the Download menu on Android.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft keeps hinting at an October release for Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6qyvx19WFNGbZdgSXqBx9P8lrw4=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69512527/Hero_Bloom_Logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TUm7XS"&gt;Microsoft keeps hinting at an October release date for Windows 11. The software giant teased an October date several times during its Windows event last week, including one instance where a Microsoft Teams message says “excited to turn it up to 11... can’t wait for October!” Microsoft has only officially said “holiday” for Windows 11 availability, but the company’s official marketing material strongly hints at an October 20th date. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2E7fEl"&gt;The Microsoft Teams message is from Stevie Bathiche, a key engineer on Surface devices, to Panos Panay, Microsoft’s head of Windows and devices. Bathiche is either hinting at a Windows 11 release date, new Surface hardware, or the possibility of both Windows 11 and new Surface devices in October.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XUl1x_6SWalBOAozbkNpGWul9q4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22685777/6kRo4Y4.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s first October hint.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YkL0z9"&gt;Officially, Microsoft has only said Windows 11 is arriving “this holiday,” and the company hasn’t committed to a date or even a month. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company is aiming to release Windows 11 in October, ready for new devices from OEMs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pV6f7n"&gt;Microsoft’s hints seem to focus on October 20th as a possible launch date for Windows 11. Most of Microsoft’s press images for Windows 11 include the October 20th date in the taskbar, alongside the time set to 11:11AM. Another marketing image also includes an October 6th date, so all eyes are certainly on October over at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gILS38rPE2qRwZI6nR4pgv_XKsI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22685778/Wondows_11_Start.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;October 20th in Microsoft’s marketing images.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Another hint at October 20th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9r9RRS"&gt;Alongside Microsoft’s own hints, Walmart is also promising a “free Upgrade to Windows October 2021 when available” on &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLenovo-Legion-5-15-FHD-Intel-Core-i7-10750H-NVIDIA-GeForce-GTX-1650-8GB-RAM-512GB-SSD-Phantom-Black-Windows-10-82AU00BTUS%2F288379401&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;several laptops&lt;/a&gt; it’s currently selling. Microsoft has promised to deliver Windows 11 as “a free upgrade for eligible Windows 10 PCs and on new PCs beginning this holiday,” so Walmart is already promoting a likely October date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C1zusA"&gt;Microsoft still needs to clarify which machines will be eligible for the Windows 11 upgrade, though. The company released minimum specifications last week that appear to suggest &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22549725/microsoft-windows-11-cpu-support-tpm-hardware-requirements"&gt;only 8th Gen and newer devices&lt;/a&gt; will be able to upgrade. Microsoft has promised a blog post that will fully detail the upgrade situation for Windows 11, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"&gt;TPM requirements&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 Plus ups the CPU and AI performance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GKYET1A-HGn2YHS5UAlyHS5yQhs=/0x4:5300x3537/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69512467/Snapdragon_888_Plus_QRD___AI.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty Images/iStockphoto&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nCWu9Y"&gt;Qualcomm’s best mobile processor, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/2/21672519/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-cpu-gpu-details-performance-ai-isp-photography-specs-release-date"&gt;the Snapdragon 888&lt;/a&gt;, is getting even more powerful at MWC 2021 with the announcement of the Snapdragon 888 Plus. The upgraded model boasts a boosted clock speed, bumping the Kryo 680 CPU from 2.84GHz up to 2.995GHz (which Qualcomm is optimistically rounding up to 3GHz in its marketing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KV5XWs"&gt;Also getting upgraded is Qualcomm’s sixth-gen AI Engine. Where the base Snapdragon 888 could perform 26 trillion operations per second (TOPS) for AI tasks, the 888 Plus is approximately 20 percent more powerful, capable of 32 TOPS. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c4q637sBl_x4VGCGdK5BRRajoJw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22682096/Snapdragon_888_Plus_Logo.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UyGo46"&gt;Midyear refreshes for its top chips are nothing new for Qualcomm, which took similar approaches with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/15/20694498/qualcomm-855-plus-processor-announced-features-specs"&gt;Snapdragon 855 Plus&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/7/8/21312035/qualcomm-new-snapdragon-865-plus-gaming-performance-faster-cpu-gpu-wifi"&gt;865 Plus&lt;/a&gt;, each serving as more powerful mid-cycle updates for the standard 855 and 865 models. The company also did an additional refresh on the 865 at the beginning of 2021 with the launch of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22233584/qualcomm-snapdragon-870-865-plus-refresh-processor-smartphones-2021"&gt;Snapdragon 870&lt;/a&gt;, a sort of Snapdragon 865 Plus-plus that offered additional improvements and a higher clock speed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="04r6AE"&gt;It likely won’t be long before the Snapdragon 888 Plus starts to show up, either. Qualcomm says that the first phones with the chip should be announced in Q3 2021. Honor has already said that it’ll be using the new chip in its upcoming Magic 3 flagship, with Motorola, Vivo, Xiaomi, and Asus also planning devices featuring the Snapdragon 888 Plus.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Honda’s first electric SUV in the US will be called ‘Prologue’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZlEXzua2wRsfvq5766ok8RwThFM=/0x161:2581x1882/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69512416/187513_Honda_e_and_Frankfurt_International_Motor_Show_2019.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WpdWAf"&gt;Honda revealed the name of the first of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/14/22330086/honda-plans-electric-suv-2024-hybrid-toyota-emissions"&gt;two electric SUVs it plans to sell in North America&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s one that many have already guessed, thanks to a recent trademark application. The vehicle will be called the Honda Prologue, and it will go on sale in the US and Canada starting in 2024, Honda of America sales chief Dave Gardner confirmed to reporters last week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="36R7oX"&gt;As a name, Prologue makes sense considering it’s meant to be the introduction to Honda’s efforts to completely electrify its lineup by 2040. It’s also, notably, a synonym for “Prelude,” the name of &lt;a href="https://www.automobilemag.com/news/honda-prelude-history-generations-models-specifications/"&gt;Honda’s iconic sports coupe&lt;/a&gt; from the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8YswlQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s meant to be the introduction to Honda’s efforts to completely electrify its lineup by 2040&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nwfV3C"&gt;The Prologue will be the first of two vehicles that Honda is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21206074/gm-honda-ev-electric-vehicle-deal-battery-year-release"&gt;co-developing with General Motors&lt;/a&gt;, using the US automaker’s Ultium battery packs. The other vehicle will carry the Acura nameplate and will also be developed jointly with GM, but the company didn’t reveal any new information about it at this time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o8NhgT"&gt;“With the Prologue, our goal is to provide a highly competitive product with the functionality to meet the diverse needs of our customers,” Gardner said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rhsBy8"&gt;Previously, Honda has said that it will design the exteriors and interiors of the new EVs, while the drivetrain will be engineered by GM to support Honda’s specifications. These vehicles will be manufactured at GM’s North American plants, with sales expected to begin in the 2024 model year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEx7qO"&gt;Honda’s interest in the name Prologue was already reported back in April &lt;a href="https://carbuzz.com/news/honda-prologue-could-arrive-as-new-electric-sports-car"&gt;when &lt;em&gt;Car Buzz &lt;/em&gt;noticed&lt;/a&gt; that the automaker filed a trademark application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office for the name. According to the filing, Honda said it would use the name to cover “land vehicles, namely, automobiles, battery electric vehicles, and structural parts for the foregoing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jK6ZYf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Honda is staying mum on any other details&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WtNCgg"&gt;Honda is staying mum on any other details or specs about the Prologue at this time, although Gardner did say that the automaker was targeting an annual sale volume “roughly” between the Honda Passenger and Honda Pilot SUVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YvFXkr"&gt;But Honda doesn’t plan on stopping with just the two EVs it is developing with GM. Gardner said that in the second half of the decade, Honda will release a series of EVs built on the automaker’s own “Honda e-Architecture.” These vehicles will help Honda reach its goal of 40 percent of sales comprised of battery-electric and fuel-cell vehicles by 2030, 80 percent by 2035, and 100 percent by 2040. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o0X5gX"&gt;“In short, our zero emission focus has begun,” Gardner said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhlUrx"&gt;Honda’s electric lineup is extremely limited as compared to other automakers. The company recently &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2020/03/09/honda-clarity-electric-vehicle-killed-honda-discontinues-ev/5001659002/"&gt;discontinued its Clarity EV&lt;/a&gt;, though it will continue to sell hydrogen and plug-in hybrid versions of the vehicle. And its Honda E city car, which went &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20858725/honda-e-price-launch-date-battery-range"&gt;on sale last summer&lt;/a&gt;, is only available in Japan and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="910wee"&gt;Gardner acknowledged that Honda has a lot of catching up to do with electric vehicles, both to its competitors as well as with the numerous regulations that have been put in place to curb the sale of gas-powered vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFQu0j"&gt;“While we haven’t been perceived as leaders in recent years, we’re not neophytes in the electrified space,” he said, citing the hybrid Honda Insight, as well as the defunct &lt;a href="https://www.topgear.com/car-news/electric/forgotten-electric-cars-honda-ev-plus"&gt;EV Plus&lt;/a&gt; and the discontinued &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/13/15257576/hydrogen-fuel-cell-honda-clarity-self-driving-ny-auto-show-2017"&gt;Clarity&lt;/a&gt;, as examples of the foundation on which Honda plans to build. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Security researcher sounds alarm over ATM NFC reader vulnerabilities</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UTUQPdVKTgl3EHQn98lOJC2gQ0w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69512386/acastro_170629_1777_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rIArHT"&gt;IOActive security researcher Josep Rodriquez has warned that the NFC readers used in many modern ATMs and point-of-sale systems are leaving them vulnerable to attacks, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/atm-hack-nfc-bugs-point-of-sale/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The flaws make them vulnerable to a range of problems, including being crashed  by a nearby NFC device, locked down as part of a ransomware attack, or even hacked to extract certain credit card data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LBNWvd"&gt;Rodriquez even warns that the vulnerabilities could be used as part of a so-called “jackpotting” attack to trick a machine into spitting out cash. However, such an attack is only possible when paired with exploits of additional bugs, and &lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;says it was not able to view a video of such an attack because of IOActive’s confidentiality agreement with the affected ATM vendor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IPOQJP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;One video showed him crashing an ATM out in the wild&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="igcNLO"&gt;By relying on vulnerabilities in the machines’ NFC readers, Rodriquez’s hacks are relatively easy to execute. While some previous attacks have relied on using devices like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/29/16947832/jackpotting-atm-machine-hack-cash-malware"&gt;medical endoscopes to probe machines&lt;/a&gt;, Rodriquez’ can simply wave an Android phone running his software in front of a machine’s NFC reader to exploit any vulnerabilities it might have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0doJR4"&gt;In one video shared with &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;, Rodriquez causes an ATM in Madrid to display an error message, simply by waving his smartphone over its NFC reader. The machine then became unresponsive to real credit cards held up to the reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xJtHMa"&gt;The research highlights a couple of big problems with the systems. The first is that many of the NFC readers are vulnerable to relatively simple attacks, &lt;em&gt;Wired &lt;/em&gt;reports. For example, in some cases the readers aren’t verifying how much data they’re receiving, which means Rodriquez was able to overwhelm the system with too much data and corrupt its memory as part of a “buffer overflow” attack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mlSSrV"&gt;The second problem is that even once an issue is identified, companies can be slow to apply a patch to the hundreds of thousands of machines in use around the world. Often a machine needs to be physically visited to apply an update, and many don’t receive regular security patches. One company said the problem Rodriquez has highlighted was patched in 2018, for example, but the researcher says he was able to verify that the attack worked in a restaurant in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XIWN54"&gt;Rodriguez plans to present his findings as part of a webinar in the coming weeks to highlight what he says are the poor security measures of embedded devices.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Veloretti’s first electric bikes are automatic and gorgeous</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xmMAv6VXPUm0osvx2oTvUYSOhXM=/47x0:554x338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69512225/Veloretti_ebikes_all.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;GIF: Veloretti&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Vintage cool and high tech as hell&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="F1DcUH"&gt;It’s not very often that a notable new electric bike brand emerges from Amsterdam, the bicycling capital of the world. The last time was when VanMoof launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/13/11420128/VanMoof-electrified-S-test-ride"&gt;Electrified S back in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. So it’s with particular interest that I’ve been following the launch of the &lt;a href="https://electric.veloretti.com/products/ivy?variant=ivy+pebble+grey"&gt;Veloretti Ivy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://electric.veloretti.com/products/ace?variant=ace+graphite"&gt;Ace&lt;/a&gt; e-bikes that begin mass production today. And I’m not alone in my anticipation as their first electrics begin shipping to customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="au8rfl"&gt;“We’re quite overwhelmed with interest in the e-bikes. It’s crazy,” says Veloretti founder Ferry Zonder, who brought me a prototype Ace to test last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fhc3mj"&gt;While it may not sound it, Veloretti is wholly Dutch, only with an Italian flare for retro chic. I mean, just look at that Ivy step-through model above with whitewall tires and leather-look grips and saddle. Yet despite their vintage appearance, Veloretti’s e-bikes are as cutting edge as can be. Both are fitted with a maintenance-free Carbon belt drive, stepless Enviolo automatic shifter, silent mid-drive Bafang motor (250W), hydraulic brakes, integrated front and rear lighting, a small display for turn-by-turn navigation, and a removable 510Wh battery that simplifies charging after depleting its 60 to 120KM range. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yE88FC"&gt;They also come slathered in sensors for torque, speed, and cadence, as well as Bluetooth, GPS, and 3G and 4G radios. All this tech enables a slew of advanced features like over-the-air updates, remote issue diagnosis, crash detection, and live tracking in case of theft. Hell, it’s also certified for Apple Find My tracking just like Amsterdam rivals VanMoof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bwV8sKUaPM7kRoxvIDnRddps_To=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22683321/verge_DSC_5190_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Veloretti founder Ferry Zonder and an Ace e-bike prototype in Amsterdam. He’s very, very tall.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jsSF3qJELI5OHm0AxGN3cQji6bQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22683327/verge_DSC_5229_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ferry zipping around a corner on the new Ace.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bb0DL0QaiFAEQ8_QPQ7o_beSG-w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22683328/verge_DSC_5278_2040pxl.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Famously, there are more bikes than people in Amsterdam.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W9Jv7s"&gt;Zonder, a fan of old Italian Velocifero mopeds (thus the company name), produced his first city bike in 2013. Since then he’s attracted an enthusiastic fanbase of young urbanites drawn to Veloretti’s mix of style, quality, and service for bikes that cost less than €400 (which is quite cheap for a brand new Dutch city bike). Veloretti’s direct-to-consumer sales model has enabled the company to grow quickly. The company jumped from 15 to 38 employees after deciding to enter e-bikes, and now ships &lt;a href="https://www.veloretti.com/products/caferacer-men"&gt;its city bikes&lt;/a&gt; to 27 countries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QmIlb"&gt;My full review of the Veloretti e-bikes will have to wait until I recover from a recent mountain bike injury. Which is fine, actually, because that way I can test a true production bike. Veloretti also took in-house control of its e-bike app recently which will let the company take better advantage of all that technology packed inside the Ivy and Ace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/twq9LAM5qOUNEtOxakbFqZU0v8M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22683285/Veloretti_ebikes_all.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Veloretti&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;All the Veloretti color options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ok6Msb"&gt;What I can tell you upon initial inspection and second-hand knowledge (my wife rode the prototype, and she shadow-tests &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; my e-bikes) is that the prototype Ace looks great with solid build quality, although I’d prefer fewer exposed cables and more precise welds from the Portuguese factory where it’s built. And while the Bafang motor is truly silent, the Enviolo automatic shifter on the prototype can be a little noisy. It also takes some practice to prevent freewheeling at startup as my wife wasn’t producing enough torque to force it into a higher gear at first. Zonder tells me that the Enviolo firmware is being tweaked and the app updated to give riders more control over torque thresholds and other minutia. Something I’ll test later in the review.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwkqJs"&gt;The electric Ivy and Ace will only be available in the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany this year in order to maintain strict quality control. “We don’t want to create risks in our supply chain and these markets we know really well so we can give them good service,” says Zonder. “We don’t want to ruin our reputation and customer satisfaction.” Zonder claims a failure rate of about 0.8 percent on its city bikes currently, well below the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21437704/vanmoof-interview-s3-electric-bike-issues-delays-mobile-service-network"&gt;10 percent rate that VanMoof saw&lt;/a&gt; with the launch of the X3 and S3 last year. Veloretti will expand e-bike sales to the Nordics and the UK next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Fwa8F6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;No room for mistakes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6dFDkn"&gt;In a rapidly maturing e-bike market Veloretti doesn’t have room to make mistakes, not with its e-bikes currently listing for €2,399, already €100 more than the preorder price of €2,299, and €400 more than a comparably specced VanMoof. But even this new higher price is likely to go up, Zonder tells me. That’s due to the limited availability of parts, especially the microchips that both e-bike and EV makers are desperately bidding on to secure. The current tax-inclusive price translates to about $2,850 if Veloretti’s e-bikes were sold in the US, but that’s not likely to happen until 2023 at the earliest, says Zonder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w45aFK"&gt;Zonder says the company is targeting sales of about 8,000 e-bikes this year, before ramping up to 25,000 in 2022. That’s a big jump for a company that’s never taken on outside funding and is fueling its expansion into electric bikes solely through company profits (sales grew 300 percent last year). Although Zonder tells me he enjoys the autonomy that comes with being self-funded, without external investment it’ll be hard to compete with Dutch bicycle powerhouses like Stella, Gazelle, and Accell Group, and startups like Cowboy, VanMoof, and RadPower who have been taking on heaps of capital to ride the surge in e-bike interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="bCxbQt"&gt;But let’s not get ahead of ourselves. I’ll be back with a full review of a production Veloretti as soon as I’m able. But if you just can’t wait, know that respected Dutch e-bike reviewer David Lemereis &lt;a href="https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/tech/bright-stuff/artikel/5234586/veloretti-electric-ace-e-bike-ivy-elektrische-fiets"&gt;says the prototype Ace&lt;/a&gt; is one of the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ERVbT6bHL0"&gt;top three electric city bikes&lt;/a&gt; he’s ever ridden, which is high praise indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="USGxSy"&gt;When it comes to true wireless earbuds, there are a ton of brands and products to choose from. Whether you enjoy the unconventional design of Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Live or prefer Jabra’s compact Elite 75t, there’s a pair of wireless earbuds for just about everyone. Fortunately, many of the best wireless earbuds go on sale on a regular occurrence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsWVXq"&gt;Regardless of which brand you prefer, we have compiled some of the best deals on wireless earbuds available right now. Of course, if you want to do more research before making a buying decision, we also encourage you to read our guide to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which can help you determine which pair of earbuds are best for you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="c27rNd"&gt;Apple AirPods deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2vr3VH"&gt;If you own an iPhone or multiple Apple products, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; are likely the best true wireless earbuds on the market for you. Unlike the base AirPods, the Pro variant offer better sound quality and feature active noise cancellation, not to mention seamless integration with iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftMREv"&gt;Apple’s flagship Pro wireless earbuds tend to go on sale frequently, and we often see them drop as low as $200. Right now, for instance, you can get a new pair for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro%2F520468661&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$197 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro%2F-%2FA-54191101%3Fref%3Dtgt_adv_XS000000%26AFID%3Dgoogle_pla_df_free_local%26CPNG%3DElectronics%26adgroup%3D57-10%26clkid%3D7b1bfd5dNc95f11eb971842010a246ff0%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 at Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kPY6Vk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9766m"&gt;Alternatively, you can buy a pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;second-generation AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, which include either a wired or wireless charging case. Although they normally retail for $160, you can get the version with the wired charging case for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/994132/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3F&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$119 at Walmart&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1003525/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPods030121&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191097"&gt;$130 at Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DcXNMK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eJgls2"&gt;If you prefer a little more convenience, you can also get a new pair of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods with a wireless charging case&lt;/a&gt; for a few dollars more. At their regular price of $200, they aren’t as good of a value, but you’ll rarely find yourself paying the usual price. At the moment, you can get them for $160 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Wireless-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F482532021&amp;amp;subid1=VergeAirPodsDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Wireless-Charging-Latest/dp/B07PYLT6DN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-with-wireless-charging-case%2F-%2FA-54191099%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals02262021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Live.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HGCqrw"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Buds Deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="v5RLzc"&gt;Samsung has a few different wireless earbuds to choose from, including its latest flagship wireless earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review"&gt;Galaxy Buds Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds include active noise cancellation and the best sound quality yet for Samsung earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pyxi2K"&gt;There are a couple of deals going on right now at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B08MWZHHKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds-pro-earbuds-black%2F-%2FA-82026965&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeTrueWirelessHeadphones042921"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740939849926817180" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, all of which are offering the Galaxy Buds Pro for $30 off, bringing the price down to $170.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WZ42v1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10401237"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="4pY4R1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21302051/best-apple-airpods-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on 4K TVs ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="aZthMF"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21147654/samsung-galaxy-buds-plus-review-wireless-earbuds-sound-quality-battery-life" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Plus&lt;/a&gt; were our top pick last year for the best wireless earbuds overall. A successor to the original Galaxy Buds, the Plus model extends the battery life by up to 11 hours and, unlike AirPods, comes in an assortment of colors. Right now, you can buy the Galaxy Buds Plus for $100 at places such as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KVM9VW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744671489647358892#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/3Pk6Pr" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, which is the lowest price we’ve seen in the last several months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="c8pRgb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10368022"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mPBmzD"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21356260/samsung-galaxy-buds-live-review-wireless-earbuds-beans-design-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Buds Live&lt;/a&gt; are some of the more unconventional wireless earbuds on the market right now, but don’t let their bean-shaped design fool you. The Buds Live are a good option if you want earbuds that produce powerful sound and showcase marathon battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="52C6bu"&gt;Right now, you can purchase a pair of the Galaxy Buds Live for &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/products/samsung-galaxy-buds-live/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$130 at Verizon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1577733-REG%2Fsamsung_sm_r180nznaxar_galaxy_buds_live_noise_canceling.html%3Fap%3Dy%26smp%3Dy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22307388%2Fwireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Wireless-Cancelling-Charging-Included/dp/B089B658NP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$150 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, more than 10 percent off the initial MSRP. If you prefer a different retailer, they’re also discounted to $150 at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744671875847416917#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="i2Ah0B"&gt;Sony WF-1000XM3 deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HggHzb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; are the true wireless headphones to beat, but they haven’t been discounted yet given how recently they launched. Their predecessor, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;WF-1000XM3&lt;/a&gt;, however, remain an excellent pair of headphones that do routinely go on sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="haWqZJ"&gt;Like the most recent model, the WF-1000XM3 feature phenomenal sound quality and considerable battery life, a small feat for a pair of true wireless earbuds. They also manage to deliver noise cancellation in a sleek, copper-adorned package, one that’s both attractive and professional. Typically $230, Sony’s last-gen WF-1000XM3 are currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-WF-1000XM3-Industry-Canceling-Wireless/dp/B07T81554H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $198, a notable uptick from their Prime Day pricing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8F3h1H"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563643"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="9wJvFX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 35,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="1TXXf4"&gt;Other true wireless earbuds deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="58GOfq"&gt;Compared to the competition, Jabra’s wireless earbuds have a rare feature that has yet to become standard in the true wireless earbud market: the ability to connect to two devices concurrently. Ideally, this is great for users who switch between two devices often (like, say, a phone and a laptop). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vJ5wIC"&gt;Last year, Jabra released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549587/jabra-elite-85t-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 85t wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt;, which are the highest-tier model in Jabra’s lineup. They have more advanced noise cancellation than the 75t, however, they also feature less bass and an inferior fit. If you can live with those compromises, however, you can buy the Jabra Elite 85t for $230—the standard list price—at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Wireless-Bluetooth-Earbuds-Titanium/dp/B08HR78C46?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1740940140202691153" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.jabra.com/bluetooth-headsets/jabra-elite-85t?utm_medium=affiliate&amp;amp;utm_source=cj&amp;amp;utm_campaign=100084481&amp;amp;cjevent=d1b5f6f7b81f11eb80a000a90a1c0e0c#/donotlink#100-99190700-98" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Jabra&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LacpUE"&gt;If the standard retail price on the Elite 85t is intimidating but you want a pair of Jabra earbuds, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21066947/jabra-elite-75t-review-wireless-earbuds-airpods-alternative" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Elite 75t&lt;/a&gt; are also a good option, and they see regular price cuts. We consider the Jabra 75t— currently on sale in gold for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-75t-Earbuds-Comfortable/dp/B082Y256ZV/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$135 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744674062317456142#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;—the best true wireless earbuds for multitaskers, and they remain a solid alternative if you don’t want to buy AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OvElfP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10386608"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mqq7gj"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22532970/beats-studio-buds-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Studio Buds&lt;/a&gt; may have just launched, but if you’re currently in the market for a reliable pair of wireless earbuds for your workouts, you can’t go wrong with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/10/18563329/apple-powerbeats-pro-review-wireless-fitness-headphones-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Beats Powerbeats Pro&lt;/a&gt;. These earbuds have an over-ear hook that keeps them in place during intense exercises. They’re also IPX4 sweat- and water-resistant, so you don’t have to worry about ruining them should your workout get intense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aryAiB"&gt;There are a few different discounts available right now for the Powerbeats Pro. The lowest we currently see is at &lt;a href="http://goto.target.com/WDYoMP" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, where you can pick up most models for $200. They’re also available at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744674259269836975#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $200&lt;/a&gt; — the discount only applies to the black and blue models — and at Amazon for $193, if you don’t mind opting for the red model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0RcdxX"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10058925"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="11vDvx"&gt;The 2021 edition of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt; are a tremendous value at $120, however, if the price remains a factor and you don’t mind opting for their last-gen counterpart, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1512892-REG%2Famazon_b07f6vm1s3_echo_buds.html%3Fap%3Dy%26smp%3Dy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22307388%2Fwireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; is currently offering the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937559/amazon-echo-buds-wireless-earbuds-review-features-bose-noise-reduction-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;first-gen Echo Buds for $100&lt;/a&gt;. They don’t sound as satisfying, nor are they as comfortable, but they still provide effective noise reduction and easy access to Alexa.&lt;/p&gt;
