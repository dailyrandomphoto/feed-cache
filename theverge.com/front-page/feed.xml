    <title>Apple announces all-new iPad Mini with smaller bezels and new colors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQ-Fh3V_HHaNuR5iECA4AxONDP8=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857249/lcimg_7b04f92e_6e3b_4b04_83c7_9381b0d97513.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="atJv07"&gt;Apple has announced its all-new iPad Mini. It features a new enclosure with narrower bezels and rounded corners. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tHmNxr"&gt;The iPad Mini is currently Apple’s smallest tablet, even with the bump in size. Apple was rumored to have been considering a Mini LED display on the new iPad, similar to that of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395449/apple-ipad-pro-2021-liquid-retina-xdr-mini-led-explainer"&gt;largest iPad Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Those appear to have missed the mark; the new Mini sports a regular Liquid Retina display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ILSQY3"&gt;The iPad Mini’s design has remained largely consistent since its 2012 debut. The new model is something of a shake-up to the traditional build, featuring slimmer bezels than the iPad Mini 5 and new color options. The new tablet also features a USB-C port and supports 5G, with download speeds up to 3.5 gigabits per second.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKalAJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22436135"&gt;&lt;em&gt;iPhone 13 and Apple Watch event live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces new entry-level iPad with A13 Bionic chip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/emMeRePA-FWf8weLeznyupOdvsc=/141x0:1640x999/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857219/lcimg_06408afc_ebbc_4bcf_a6a4_db043132841a.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIQyWB"&gt;Apple has just announced the latest version of its most popular tablet: the standard iPad. This new model is the ninth generation of the iPad that first debuted in 2010, and it features a new processor called the A13 Bionic. Additionally, there’s a new 12-megapixel front camera that supports the Center Stage feature that debuted with the iPad Pro last year. The rest of the 9th Gen iPad will look very familiar to anyone that’s seen an iPad in the past few years, complete with the same home button, bezels, and single rear camera we’ve seen before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KeYlTE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valve’s Steam Deck is now real enough to send to developers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ch22_lsJ3X-eOpfNasIolM95vXY=/69x0:1131x708/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857060/f6b29587c2ae8bbc1d66b83d7d0378febd6f6582.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QOcVAH"&gt;Valve’s foray into video game handhelds, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;the Steam Deck&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675180/view/2963920750895461227"&gt;has started shipping out to developers&lt;/a&gt;. The company opened up requests for early versions of the device &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/steam-deck-dev-kits/"&gt;on September 2nd&lt;/a&gt; to developers, and now it seems like those devices are heading out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GTgpkJ"&gt;The Steam Decks shipping out are “engineering verification test builds” according to Valve, and are “functionally identical” to the version of the device that will be shipped to customers. As Valve explains: “the dev-kit program gives us the chance to guide game developers through the process of getting their games on Steam Deck while also continuing to gather their feedback as we prepare for the official launch at the end of the year.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5VTk3CQOurgnwYNZnGjJa3b8VH8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849898/6348ca171b7eace23027e4a513748c9f12900320.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Valve&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steam Decks preparing to ship.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="k3ignX"&gt;Valve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578783/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc"&gt;first introduce the Steam Deck in July&lt;/a&gt; with the promise of an easy transition to the device’s Linux software thanks to &lt;a href="https://www.protondb.com/"&gt;the Proton compatibility layer&lt;/a&gt;. Sending out dev kits allows developers to experiment with that, and also makes the Steam Deck that much more real for anyone who might feel anxious &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/18/22579747/valve-steam-deck-steam-machines-editorial"&gt;about Valve experimenting with hardware again&lt;/a&gt;. Our experience with the Steam Deck &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612886/valve-steam-deck-handheld-gaming-pc-hands-on-preview"&gt;was largely positive during our hands-on&lt;/a&gt;, and now developers will have a chance to try the device for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tonal will offer Peloton-like live classes starting in October</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XO_40FHCRWYX_6S1Tp4-4N96laY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69857012/akrales_190725_3568_0138.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kK0V9L"&gt;Tonal, which offers an at-home connected strength training machine, is adding to its library of on-demand exercise programs by introducing a Peloton-like live classes service called Tonal Live. Classes start streaming on October 20th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x3ZpGB"&gt;During classes, coaches will give you pacing cues, feedback on your workout, and shoutouts, &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210914005303/en/Tonal-Announces-Tonal-Live-A-New-Interactive-Workout-Experience"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt;. The machine’s homescreen and app are also getting a redesign that “allows for the discovery and a schedule of Live workouts, an on-demand library of past Live workouts, and the ability to preview the movements in a workout.” Tonal is also adding a “Social Zone” where users can interact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZOEgk"&gt;The addition of live classes fixes a notable gap in Tonal’s offerings. Former &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; staffer Natt Garun criticized the fact that Tonal didn’t offer live classes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/23/21077238/tonal-review-strength-training-connected-weight-fitness-machine-price"&gt;in her January 2020 review of the machine&lt;/a&gt; and said that the pre-taped sessions could feel overly rehearsed or get stale over time. For Tonal users who might be bored with the currently available classes, live sessions could offer some regular variety to workouts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eSNiyi"&gt;Like a Peloton bike, though, a Tonal machine doesn’t come cheap — it costs $2,995 and has a monthly subscription fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Vc94E3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"I trained with Tonal, the ‘Peloton for weightlifting’ ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/23/21077238/tonal-review-strength-training-connected-weight-fitness-machine-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Apple iPhone 13 and Apple Watch live blog: ‘California Streaming’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Store, San Francisco" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DY10FWtLnPI0keSd-qOy_OISE2A=/0x85:2040x1445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69856958/IMG_3669.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;On such a winter’s day&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="UsbJQM"&gt;The time has come for yet another iPhone announcement — plus whatever else Apple might have up its sleeve. Sleeve’s the right metaphor, actually, as new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22663715/apple-iphone-13-event-rumors-announcements-california-streaming"&gt;Apple Watches&lt;/a&gt; are expected today in addition to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22663715/apple-iphone-13-event-rumors-announcements-california-streaming"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;. The keynote kicks off online at 10AM PT / 1PM ET and we’ll be live blogging the whole thing right here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmzoGT"&gt;For the iPhone 13, we expect we’ll see the usual camera improvements and faster processors. The cameras may have a new astrophotography trick. There are also rumors that the notch in the screen that houses the FaceID sensors will be smaller this year — but still much larger than the hole punches we see on Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ab6gJ"&gt;For the watch, we might get the first big design change ever. Apple may be dropping the rounded, lozenge shape in favor of flatter sides that match the design of the newer iPhones and iPads. Bigger screens and better batteries are also rumored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7uYnZU"&gt;What else? Probably some AirPods. Maybe some iPads. We doubt there will be Macs. But Apple has a lot of product lines that are potential candidates for updates — not to mention new versions of its operating systems to get out the door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HjVCcH"&gt;We’ll be covering it all, right here. Tune in!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="VxJJwt"&gt;iPhone 13 live blog&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="Ujrleu"&gt;&lt;div class="live-center-embed" data-src="https://livecenter.norkon.net/frame/voxmedia/16621/vox"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;(function(n){function c(t,i){n[e](h,function(n){var r,u;if(n&amp;&amp;(r=n[n.message?"message":"data"]+"",r&amp;&amp;r.substr&amp;&amp;r.substr(0,3)==="nc:")&amp;&amp;(u=r.split(":"),u[1]===i))switch(u[2]){case"h":t.style.height=u[3]+"px";return;case"scrolltotop":t.scrollIntoView();return}},!1)}for(var t,u,f,i,s,e=n.addEventListener?"addEventListener":"attachEvent",h=e==="attachEvent"?"onmessage":"message",o=n.document.querySelectorAll(".live-center-embed"),r=0;r&lt;o.length;r++)(t=o[r],t.getAttribute("data-rendered"))||(u=t.getAttribute("data-src"),u&amp;&amp;(t.setAttribute("data-rendered","true"),f=n.ncVizCounter||1e3,n.ncVizCounter=f+1,i=f+"",s="nc-frame-c-"+i,t.innerHTML='&lt;div style="position: relative; height: 300px; border: none;" id="'+s+'"&gt;&lt;iframe src="'+u+"?"+i+'" style="position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;',c(t.firstChild,i)))})(window);&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Razer’s Wolverine V2 Chroma is an elegant, customizable wired controller</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Razer Wolverine V2 Chroma" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9HXUZwvCL8ljeIyBRlnKHty4Fd8=/1x0:5566x3710/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69856798/wolverinev2chroma1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aWNa1N"&gt;A year after the launch of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21571482/razer-wolverine-v2-xbox-series-x-s-controller-pc-wired-elite-trigger-stops-price-features"&gt;Razer’s $100 Wolverine V2 Xbox controller&lt;/a&gt;, today the company has announced a $150 version with more features called the Wolverine V2 Chroma. The new name is a giveaway to one of the additions: a strip of Chroma RGB lighting near each of the two grips that can be programmed to your liking via its accessory companion app on an Xbox or PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zmj7bu"&gt;This controller is actually replacing the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/8/24/16198780/razer-xbox-one-pc-pro-game-controller-price-availability"&gt;Wolverine Ultimate that was released in late 2017&lt;/a&gt;. Like the older controller, the Wolverine V2 Chroma has swappable thumb sticks like those included with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/31/20926499/microsoft-xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Xbox Elite controllers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22627413/scuf-instinct-pro-microsoft-xbox-controller-wireless-series-x-s-one-pc-features-price"&gt;Scuf’s Instinct&lt;/a&gt;, trigger stops to shorten the throw of triggers, and six remappable macro buttons (including four paddles on the back) that can be customized.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Wolverine V2 Chroma" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lXOiW3PZr20AmNdpathy3KFqWlQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840549/wolverinev2chroma3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The analog stick covers are swappable, though the d-pad is not.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LuUkxM"&gt;There are a few improvements over its predecessor. For example, the Wolverine V2 Chroma’s LED implementation definitely looks better, and I prefer its shape and overall design over the older model. It also gets points for using USB-C instead of the Ultimate’s Micro USB port and for having the same offering of buttons as Microsoft’s latest Xbox controller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="DPMxHL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The older Wolverine Ultimate offers a little more customization&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BXgjgb"&gt;But the newer controller isn’t superior in every way. The older Wolverine Ultimate offers a little more customization for a lower price (currently $129.99). Namely, its D-pad can be swapped. Also, the Ultimate doesn’t require software to remap its button, instead letting you do it right from the controller. It’s not a deal-breaker, but you might prefer that solution as opposed to downloading software.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Razer Wolverine V2 Chroma" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uo3bN27M5iiTiiG4-2FGMl-kjr8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22840534/wolverinev2chroma2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wolverine V2 Chroma has six macro buttons in total, which are programmable through Razer’s accessory app for Windows 10 and Xbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SBTojE"&gt;All said, this is a fairly minor upgrade over the Wolverine V2, though there’s enough that’s new and worthwhile here that you might be interested. On the other hand, you might find yourself content with either buying or hanging onto the older Wolverine Ultimate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The investigation into Tesla Autopilot’s emergency vehicle problem is getting bigger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla Motors Inc. Tests Self-Driving Technology" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q_1MBbnUG-EL4t3dk_Ams4hhG2s=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69856289/494411536.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FvbUMx"&gt;The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is requesting advanced driver assist data from 12 automakers as it seeks to expand &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626819/tesla-autopilot-crash-emergency-vehicle-probe-nhtsa"&gt;its investigation into Tesla’s Autopilot&lt;/a&gt;. The government is probing a dozen incidents involving Teslas crashing into emergency vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="juy2nN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.autonews.com/regulation-safety/nhtsa-seeking-driver-assist-data-12-automakers-tesla-autopilot-probe"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Automotive News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the agency’s Office of Defects Investigation sent letters to a dozen major automakers, including Ford, General Motors, Toyota, and Volkswagen, requesting information regarding their Level 2 driver assist systems, in which the vehicle can simultaneously control steering, braking, and acceleration under specific circumstances. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K89fIm"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Automakers are being asked to provide the number of vehicles with Level 2 systems that have been manufactured in the US&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MsmmAi"&gt;Automakers are being asked to provide the number of vehicles with Level 2 systems that have been manufactured in the US, as well as the total number of miles covered with those systems engaged and a recent list of any changes or updates. NHTSA is also requesting customer complaints, field and crash reports, and any lawsuits related to the Level 2 systems. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="27HKxj"&gt;The data request comes less than two weeks after NHTSA sent an order to Tesla to provide data on the operation of its Autopilot system, including details on which of its sold vehicles are equipped with Autopilot as well as the system’s operating parameters. The agency’s investigation into Tesla could have wide-ranging implications for Tesla, which has pushed the boundaries in releasing experimental software to untrained customers in order to advance its vision of autonomous driving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zyzjza"&gt;NHTSA’s investigation covers an estimated 765,000 Tesla vehicles that were released from 2014 through 2021. The agency is looking into 12 crashes in which Tesla owners using the company’s Autopilot features have crashed into stationary emergency vehicles, resulting in 17 injuries and one fatality. Most of these incidents took place after dark, with the software ignoring scene control measures including warning lights, flares, cones, and an illuminated arrow board.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgmYMg"&gt;Tesla has until October 22nd to hand over the data. US-based automakers like Ford, GM, and Stellantis have until November 3rd, and all other car companies, like Toyota, Subaru, Nissan, and Honda, have until November 17th. Automakers that fail to respond could face civil penalties of up to $115 million. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s big PS5 update with M.2 SSD support launches September 15th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ep_kjAwA4GlI2dXHRS6qXe3ImHg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855912/vpavic_4278_20201030_0234.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9bt4FW"&gt;Sony’s first PS5 beta included access to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599593/sony-ps5-m2-ssd-support-beta-features"&gt;long-awaited M.2 SSD slot&lt;/a&gt;, and now the company &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/14/ps5s-september-system-software-update-launches-globally-tomorrow/"&gt;is ready to release the update to everyone&lt;/a&gt;. If you don’t have a PlayStation 5 yet, then you should know that the PS4 is in line for an update, too, which will allow party owners to disband without kicking players out individually, and view trophies from PS5 games, whether it’s on your profile or someone else’s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAg79S"&gt;When the second major system update for the PlayStation 5 is released on Wednesday, everyone who has managed to acquire the system will also experience 3D audio via their TV’s built-in stereo speakers, similar to how it works on compatible headsets. Sadly, there’s no word on support for Dolby Atmos audio beyond Blu-ray disc playback or new 3D audio settings for home theater systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEYROT"&gt;There’s an accompanying update for the PS5’s DualSense controller that lets players use the built-in microphone to help calibrate the audio settings to work for their TV and the room they’re in. If you own Sony’s Pulse 3D headset (it’s a good option for the PS5, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549510/best-gaming-headset-wired-wireless-features-specs-price-sound-microphone-test-buy"&gt;among others we can suggest&lt;/a&gt;), there will be a new equalizer settings panel in the sound controls menu so that you can tweak the audio to your liking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="brDt6u"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to update your PS5 controller ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22539827/ps5-playstation-controller-how-to-update-dualsense"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U9vQbu"&gt;Still, upgrading the next-gen system’s 825GB of built-in storage is the most pressing issue for most gamers, with fall titles starting to roll out and install sizes that are only getting larger. We have all the advice you need on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602046/best-ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-compatible-drives"&gt;which SSDs to buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22608153/ps5-ssd-speed-test-storage-expansion-m2-playstation-5"&gt;how fast they really need to be&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22599710/ps5-playstation-5-m2-ssd-expandable-storage-how-to"&gt;instructions for installing the extra storage&lt;/a&gt; once the update arrives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5IJ7dQ"&gt;You can also customize the layout of the Control Center by moving or hiding certain options, while PS4 and PS5 games are now separated in the Installed tab of your game library. In the system’s Game Base, you can view and write messages to friends or a party chat without going to another screen first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wrJWJ"&gt;The PS5 is also keeping an eye out for any time you set a new “personal best,” while it could already clip achievements that garner trophies, now games can automatically save the time when you set a new fast lap or high score. A new “Trophy Tracker” feature lets players bookmark five awards they’re pursuing to make progress easily viewable from the Control Center.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="PS5 Trophy Tracker" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U8Zpyqf0Vl-HScztw5g-rO22KsI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849717/51468939727_611119bf8b_h.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5 Trophy Tracker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DEnUVz"&gt;Now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556803/sony-ps5-remote-play-ps4-app-streaming-games"&gt;PS Remote Play&lt;/a&gt; will be available when you’re outside of Wi-Fi range for streaming games or simply browsing the console’s menus. Sony recommends speeds of at least 5Mbps to play, with a suggestion of 15Mbps in both directions for the best experience from 5G or 4G LTE connections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3f0ba"&gt;One other major new feature won’t be available until September 23rd, when players can start to stream Share Screens from a friend’s PS5 in the PS App on iOS or Android. Once the feature is available, all they need to do is join your party chat, and then you can let them tune in directly to a broadcast of the game you’re playing like it’s a personal Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQ85E9"&gt;The PS5 accolades feature that has been included but underutilized since the system launched is getting better, too, as players can award the people they meet online by noting them as a “Leader.” That’s in addition to the existing commendations like “good sport,” “welcoming,” and “helpful.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZyJLh"&gt;Accessibility options are improved, with screen reader controls that players can use to pause and resume the reading by pressing the PS button and triangle or have it repeat what it said by pressing PS and R1.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Everyone will be able to clone their voice in the future</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1O0haJ0sVzZThbLO3NSO4m_813Q=/0x0:1020x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855885/acastro_091321_4752_0001.12.gif" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;AI speech synthesis is quick, easy, and uncannily good&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="xt6UZw"&gt;Cloning your voice using artificial intelligence is simultaneously tedious and simple: hallmarks of a technology that’s just about mature and ready to go public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POs2NI"&gt;All you need to do is talk into a microphone for 30 minutes or so, reading a script as carefully as you can (in my case: the voiceover from a David Attenborough documentary). After starting and stopping dozens of times to re-record your flubs and mumbles, you’ll send off the resulting audio files to be processed and, in a few hours’ time, be told that a copy of your voice is ready and waiting. Then, you can type anything you want into a chatbox, and your AI clone will say it back to you, with the resulting audio realistic to fool even friends and family — at least for a few moments. The fact that such a service even exists may be news to many, and I don’t believe we’ve begun to fully consider the impact easy access to this technology will have. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="y7XcVu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Voice clones aren’t perfect, but they’re improving fast&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4WdIl0"&gt;The work of speech synthesis has improved massively in recent years, thanks to advances in machine learning. Previously, the most &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/17/4596374/machine-language-how-siri-found-its-voice"&gt;realistic synthetic voices&lt;/a&gt; were created by recording audio of a human voice actor, cutting up their speech into component sounds, and splicing these back together like letters in a ransom note to form new words. Now, neural networks can be trained on unsorted data of their target voice to generate raw audio of someone speaking from scratch. The end results are faster, easier, and more realistic to boot. The quality is definitely not perfect when rolling straight out the machine (though manual tweaking can improve this), but they’re only going to get better in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="whIR07"&gt;&lt;iframe frameborder="0" height="200" scrolling="no" src="https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP3013427519&amp;amp;light=true" width="100%"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X4Zgdy"&gt;There’s no special sauce to making these clones, which means dozens of startups are already offering similar services. Just Google “AI voice synthesis” or “AI voice deepfakes,” and you’ll see how commonplace the technology is, available from specialist shops that only focus on speech synthesis, like Resemble.AI and Respeecher, and also integrated into companies with larger platforms, like Veritone (where the tech is part of its advertising repertoire) and Descript (which uses it in the software it makes for editing podcasts).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="EQ5LYj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A vocal deepfake of Anthony Bourdain caused controversy&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="818ado"&gt;These voice clones have simply been a novelty in the past, appearing as one-off fakes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18629024/joe-rogan-ai-fake-voice-clone-deepfake-dessa"&gt;like this Joe Rogan fake&lt;/a&gt;, but they’re beginning to be used in serious projects. In July, a documentary about chef Anthony Bourdain stirred controversy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/15/22578707/anthony-bourdain-documentary-deepfake-voice"&gt;when the creators revealed&lt;/a&gt; they’d used AI to create audio of Bourdain “speaking” lines he’d written in a letter. (Notably, few people noticed the deepfake until the creators revealed its existence.) And in August, the startup Sonantic announced it had created an &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OSMue60Gg6s"&gt;AI voice clone of actor Val Kilmer&lt;/a&gt;, whose own voice was damaged in 2014 after he underwent a tracheotomy as part of his treatment for throat cancer. These examples also frame some of the social and ethical dimensions of this technology. The Bourdain use case was decried as exploitative by many (particularly as its use was not disclosed in the film), while the Kilmer work has been generally lauded, with the technology praised for delivering what other solutions could not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjMqwy"&gt;Celebrity applications of voice clones are likely to be the most prominent in the next few years, with companies hoping the famous will want to boost their income with minimal effort by cloning and renting out their voices. One company, Veritone, launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22432180/voice-clone-deepfake-celebrities-influencers-veritone-ai-platform"&gt;just such a service earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, saying it would let influencers, athletes, and actors license their AI voice for things like endorsements and radio idents, without ever having to go into a studio. “We’re really excited about what that means for a host of different industries because the hardest part about someone’s voice and being able to use it and being able to expand upon that is the individual’s time,” Sean King, executive vice president at Veritone One, told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;. “A person becomes the limiting factor in what we’re doing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="LjqLM3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Influencers, actors, and celebrities could rent out their voices with minimal effort&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8OiHI8"&gt;Such applications are not yet widespread (or if they are, they’re not widely talked about), but it seems like an obvious way for celebrities to make money. Bruce Willis, for example, has already licensed his image to be used as a visual deepfake in &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/bruce-willis-licensed-his-deepfake-for-a-series-of-russian-mobile-carrier-ads"&gt;mobile phone ads in Russia&lt;/a&gt;. The deal allows him to make money without ever leaving the house, while the advertising company gets an infinitely malleable actor (and, notably, a much &lt;em&gt;younger&lt;/em&gt; version of Willis, straight out of his &lt;em&gt;Die Hard &lt;/em&gt;days). These sorts of visual and audio clones could accelerate the scales of economy for celebrity work, allowing them to capitalize on their fame — as long as they’re happy renting out a simulacrum of themselves.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FCcOnr"&gt;In the here and now, voice synthesis technology is already being built into tools like the eponymous podcast editing software built by US firm Descript. The company’s “Overdub” feature lets a podcaster create an AI clone of their voice so producers can make quick changes to their audio, supplementing the program’s transcription-based editing. As Descript CEO Andrew Mason told &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;: “You can not only delete words in Descript and have it delete the audio, you can type words and it will generate audio in your voice.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uakpoyUCXWw2QEj3bys4GToB-Mc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19210297/descript_2.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Descript&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Podcast editing software Descript uses AI voice clones to edit speech like a transcript. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HSBeTG"&gt;When I tried Descript’s Overdub feature myself, it was certainly easy enough to use — though, as mentioned above, recording the training data was a bit of a chore. (It was much easier for my colleague and regular &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; podcast host Ashley Carman, who had lots of pre-recorded audio ready to send the AI.) The voice clones made by Overdub are not flawless, certainly. They have an odd warble to their tone and lack the ability to really charge lines with emotion and emphasis, but they’re also unmistakably &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt;. The first time I used my voice clone was a genuinely uncanny moment. I had no idea that this deeply personal thing — my voice — could be copied by technology so quickly and easily. It felt like a meeting with the future but was also strangely familiar. After all, life is already full of digital mirrors — of avatars and social media feeds that are supposed to embody “you” in various forms — so why not add a speaking automaton to the mix? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7a9QOi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cloning my voice felt like a meeting with the future&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qfafn0"&gt;The initial shock of hearing a voice clone of yourself doesn’t mean human voices are redundant, though. Far from it. You can certainly improve on the quality of voice deepfakes with a little manual editing, but in their automated form, they still can’t deliver anywhere near the range of inflection and intonation you get from professionals. As voice artist and narrator Andia Winslow told &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;, while AI voices might be useful for rote voice work — for internal messaging systems, automated public announcements, and the like — they can’t compete with humans in many use cases. “For big stuff, things that need breath and life, it’s not going to go that way because, partly, these brands like working with the celebrities they hire, for example,” said Winslow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="njc2mH"&gt;But what does this technology mean for the general public? For those of us who aren’t famous enough to benefit from the technology and are not professionally threatened by its development? Well, the potential applications are varied. It’s not hard to imagine a video game where the character creation screen includes an option to create a voice clone, so it sounds like the player is speaking all of the dialogue in the game. Or there might be an app for parents that allows them to copy their voice so that they can read bedtime stories to their children even when they’re not around. Such applications could be done with today’s technology, though the middling quality of quick clones would make them a hard sell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbfCyi"&gt;There are also potential dangers. Fraudsters have already used voice clones to trick companies into moving money &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20851248/deepfakes-ai-fake-audio-phone-calls-thieves-trick-companies-stealing-money"&gt;into their accounts&lt;/a&gt;, and other malicious uses are certainly lurking just beyond the horizon. Imagine, for example, a high school student surreptitiously recording a classmate to create a voice clone of them, then faking audio of that person bad-mouthing a teacher to get them in trouble. If the uses of visual deepfakes are anything to go by, where worries about political misinformation have proven &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/5/18251736/deepfake-propaganda-misinformation-troll-video-hoax"&gt;largely misplaced&lt;/a&gt; but the technology has done huge damage creating &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/09/13/1035449/ai-deepfake-app-face-swaps-women-into-porn/"&gt;nonconsensual pornography&lt;/a&gt;, it’s these sorts of incidents that pose the biggest threats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xXi5AL"&gt;One thing’s for sure, though: in the future, anyone will be able to create an AI voice clone of themselves if they want to. But the script this chorus of digital voices will follow has yet to be written. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sonos announces second-gen Beam soundbar with Dolby Atmos</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JPejaPH1U1l97Z9RzMfJTLVKDkY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69855810/beam_hand_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sonos&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T3gR8t"&gt;When Sonos &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/10/22667044/sonos-speaker-price-increases-announce-september-12"&gt;announced price increases&lt;/a&gt; for the majority of its product lineup last week, some people noticed that the entry-level &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17507796/sonos-beam-speaker-soundbar-alexa-review"&gt;Beam soundbar&lt;/a&gt; was absent from the list. And indeed, that’s because the company has been at work on a follow-up. The new &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.sonos.com/en-gb/shop/beam.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-generation Beam&lt;/a&gt; being announced today costs $449 (a $50 increase over the original) but adds Dolby Atmos audio and an improved external design. It’ll be available October 5th in black or white.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ib0wgK"&gt;But there’s something you should know about the Atmos part right off the bat: the new Beam doesn’t actually include any up-firing speakers. In fact, the drivers inside are the exact same as before: there’s a center tweeter, four woofers, and three passive radiators to give bass some extra kick. The outside of the Beam has switched from a fabric cover to Sonos’ signature perforated plastic, but nothing about the internal layout has really changed. Sonos says the second-gen model has a more capable CPU that’s 40 percent faster. This extra horsepower allows the company to pull off more advanced audio virtualization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="71jM6N"&gt;The new Beam has more “arrays,” which is what Sonos calls the software that coordinates all the playback and phase adjustments that produce immersive sound. The original Beam had three arrays, but the new model has five. The two additional arrays are used for steering surround and height audio around the room.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E0XUDGcaVPw0OEB-AnFYBu0qih0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849134/beam_credenza_white.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sonos&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Beam has a wraparound perforated plastic grille.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="7aJY90"&gt;Despite a lack of actual up-firing drivers — Sonos told me it couldn’t squeeze any into the Beam’s compact form factor — the company insists the second-gen Beam will deliver a real sense of verticality when paying Atmos content. This seems like one of those cases where you’ll have to hear it to really believe it, and I haven’t had the chance to demo the new soundbar yet. Sonos claims there’s consistently an improved feeling of spaciousness with the refreshed Beam that applies whether you’re watching Atmos, regular 5.1 surround, or even stereo content. And dialogue clarity also comes through clearer than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1QZPbe"&gt;In most other ways, this Beam doesn’t shake up the formula very much. It’s still got the one HDMI port, which this time has been upgraded to eARC and is thus capable of handling Dolby Atmos, Dolby TrueHD, and multi-channel LPCM. If everything else in your TV chain is also HDMI 2.1, eARC should help eliminate any audio sync issues when gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1vZyaA8jMjjBjGYicNz9Vpl-9_4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22849139/beam_back_white.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sonos&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Same ports on back, same buttons on top.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YEplw7"&gt;Here’s another bit of welcome news: Sonos says it will roll out support for DTS surround later this year for all soundbars that are on its S2 platform. That extends back to products like the Playbar and Playbase, so quite a few devices will be gaining the added functionality. Sonos is also jumping on board with high-resolution audio and Dolby Atmos music streaming. The company says it’ll support both of those features from Amazon Music in the coming months; no word on Apple Music, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1fBeUq"&gt;Aside from its slight design refinements, a faster processor, and the inclusion of Atmos, the second-gen Beam otherwise sticks to what made the first model work well: it’s compact and a nice match for apartment renters or anyone who wants to step up their TV and movie sound quality for much less money than the far larger, more powerful Arc. Of course, you also get a Sonos speaker out of the deal and all the multi-room audio system perks that come with buying in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cCc27E"&gt;The main question that remains is how well Sonos can make Atmos work on a soundbar that lacks height speakers. The new Beam was never going to measure up to the company’s &lt;s&gt;$800&lt;/s&gt; $900 flagship Arc soundbar, but I’m looking forward to seeing whether Sonos can really trick my brain into believing the second-gen Beam is more than meets the eye. &lt;/p&gt;
