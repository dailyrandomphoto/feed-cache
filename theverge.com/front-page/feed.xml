    <title>Elon Musk overtakes Bill Gates to become world’s second richest person behind Jeff Bezos</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9hDn9H"&gt;Elon Musk has passed Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates to become the world’s second richest person, according to the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/"&gt;Bloomberg Billionaires Index&lt;/a&gt;. The Tesla CEO’s net worth now sits at around $128 billion, after increasing by $100 billion this year. There is a sizable gap between Musk and the number one spot, which is currently held by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos who has a reported net worth of around $182 billion. In January, Musk ranked 35th on the list, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-23/musk-overtakes-gates-to-grab-world-s-second-richest-ranking"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bmSLYU"&gt;For an idea of how the wealth of these men compares to the average American household, check out this &lt;a href="https://mkorostoff.github.io/1-pixel-wealth/"&gt;amazing data visualization produced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; in which every pixel represents $1,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tOXgWf"&gt;Musk’s rapid ascent up the list has mainly been driven by Tesla’s share price. The car company currently has a market cap of almost $500 billion, after starting the year at under $100 billion. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/24/elon-musk-bill-gates-tesla-share-price-microsoft"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla has the highest market cap of any car company in the world, despite producing a fraction of the cars of more established automakers. This year it expects to produce 500,000 cars, compared to around 10 million for a company like Toyota. Around three quarters of Musk’s net worth consists of Tesla shares, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8JZUPN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Musk and Gates have publicly sparred this year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2vT1Cj"&gt;Musk’s other major venture, SpaceX, has also seen recent success. Last week the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21565505/spacex-crew-1-dragon-docking-success-iss-space-station"&gt;transported four astronauts to the International Space Station&lt;/a&gt; aboard its Crew Dragon spacecraft. It follows the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/30/21269703/spacex-launch-crew-dragon-nasa-orbit-successful"&gt;first crewed flight to space&lt;/a&gt; in May this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EcEahR"&gt;Bill Gates sat atop the Billionaires Index for years until he was overtaken by Jeff Bezos in 2017. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that Gates would probably have a higher net wealth right now if he hadn’t given so much money to charity, including the over $27 billion he’s donated through the Bill &amp;amp; Melinda Gates Foundation since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HZTu9X"&gt;Gates and Musk have had some high-profile disagreements this year. In September, Musk said Gates had “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1304792315634966529"&gt;no clue&lt;/a&gt;” about the viability of electric trucks, after the Microsoft co-founder said that electric semi-trucks, along with electric cargo ships and passenger jets, will “&lt;a href="https://www.gatesnotes.com/Energy/Moving-around-in-a-zero-carbon-world"&gt;probably never&lt;/a&gt;” be practical. Earlier this year Gates &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/28/bill-gates-lies-spread-faster-than-facts-on-social-media.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that Musk should avoid making big predictions about areas he’s not familiar with, after the Tesla CEO &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21241180/elon-musk-coronavirus-conspiracy-misinformation-tesla"&gt;downplayed the risk of the COVID-19 pandemic&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZuFR0p"&gt;Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/nov/17/elon-musk-tesla-shares-facebook-mark-zuckerberg-s-p500"&gt;overtook Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg last week&lt;/a&gt; when he became the third-richest person on the Billionaires Index. Zuckerberg has since fallen to fifth in the rankings after he was overtaken by French businessman Bernard Arnault. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s Game &amp; Watch can run Doom, barely</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2QNN5CPzoDogJNBv0ppdqpqhM-Y=/85x0:760x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67868283/doom_game_watch.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: stacksmashing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pMLfTo"&gt;Intrepid developers have done the expected &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;necessary: &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; now runs on Nintendo’s recently released Game &amp;amp; Watch portable. The Game &amp;amp; Watch: &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt; was designed to run three games, but successfully porting &lt;em&gt;Doom &lt;/em&gt;shows it can handle others if you have a lot of patience (&lt;a href="https://hackaday.com/2020/11/22/doom-running-on-the-nintendo-game-watch/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Hackaday&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TQSGuB"&gt;This version of &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; is not perfect, of course. In order to get the game to run even at the slower speed shown in the video below, sound had to be disabled and textures had to be simplified to fit the game on the small portable. And getting that far wasn’t easy: programmers &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3S8vxwRfqLBdIhgRlDRVzw"&gt;stacksmashing&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kbeckmann"&gt;Konrad Beckmann&lt;/a&gt; had to trick the Game &amp;amp; Watch to offload its firmware by injecting code into the external storage accessed by the Game &amp;amp; Watch’s tiny microcontroller. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5rQzkC"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sNg_S9UM5ps?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oJqzSR"&gt;Finding a version of &lt;em&gt;Doom &lt;/em&gt;small enough to fit on the Game &amp;amp; Watch’s meager amount of storage was a separate issue. The hackers settled on a package called “Minimal &lt;em&gt;Doom &lt;/em&gt;IWAD” that replaces the game’s original textures with simplified versions, but they still had to make further adjustments like disabling sound to work within the Game &amp;amp; Watch’s 1.1 MB of usable storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CvDZ0N"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21562549/nintendo-game-and-watch-super-mario-bros-next-gen-consoles"&gt;The Game &amp;amp; Watch: &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is designed to evoke Nintendo’s original Game &amp;amp; Watch handhelds, while running a version of Nintendo’s NES classic, &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros.,&lt;/em&gt; as well as &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros. 2 &lt;/em&gt;(known in the West as &lt;em&gt;The Lost Levels&lt;/em&gt;). (It also runs a Mario-themed version of the Game &amp;amp; Watch game &lt;em&gt;Ball).&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt;’s demon-slaying action wasn’t ported to a Nintendo console until the more powerful SNES was released, so showing up on a tiny device designed to run NES games is as unusual as it is impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFExYY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; is an old standby for programmers experimenting with homebrew games. The game has showed up in all sorts of places: from a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514030/microsoft-xcloud-samsung-smart-fridge-doom-enternal-xbox-games-android"&gt;Samsung refrigerator running xCloud&lt;/a&gt;, to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/25/21338092/minecraft-windows-95-pc-doom-vm-computers-mod"&gt;Windows PC built in &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/11/21/13697058/macbook-touchbar-doom-hack-sure-why-not"&gt;the Touch Bar of a MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks to this work, &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; seems right at home on a Game &amp;amp; Watch, and soon, other homebrew games might be, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="nFb2IG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo’s new Game and Watch handheld proves the company goes its own way","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21562549/nintendo-game-and-watch-super-mario-bros-next-gen-consoles"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Twitter to show a warning when you try to like a labeled tweet</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HOE-iws7BRx-YR6xkTHgEc5dg9E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67867885/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4jqRo9"&gt;Ahead of the 2020 election, Twitter began &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21509439/twitter-election-trump-quote-tweet-labels-rules-election"&gt;showing a warning&lt;/a&gt; if you tried to retweet a tweet that had been labeled for potentially including misleading information. Twitter is now planning to expand that warning functionality to when you try to like a labeled tweet, the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1331018136712261632"&gt;announced on Monday&lt;/a&gt;. The functionality is rolling out on the web and iOS globally this week, and it will come to Android in the coming weeks, Twitter tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ajlzbm"&gt;Adding a warning decreased quote tweets of misleading information by 29 percent, the company said. It seems Twitter is hoping this new warning shown before likes of labeled tweets will reduce the amount of likes on labeled content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xRyF0w"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Giving context on why a labeled Tweet is misleading under our election, COVID-19, and synthetic and manipulated media rules is vital.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These prompts helped decrease Quote Tweets of misleading information by 29% so we're expanding them to show when you tap to like a labeled Tweet. &lt;a href="https://t.co/WTK164nMfZ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/WTK164nMfZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSupport/status/1331018136712261632?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 23, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7BP17z"&gt;The warnings ahead of retweets and likes on labeled tweets aren’t the only restrictions Twitter has recently put in place to add some friction to the platform and reduce the spread of misinformation. Currently, when users try to share a retweet, Twitter will open a window to compose a quote tweet instead of immediately sharing that tweet with your followers. You don’t have to write anything, though, and you can still post a standard retweet — just hit the “Retweet” button in the compose window. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21524092/twitter-temporarily-changing-retweet-quote-tweet-election"&gt;Here’s our guide&lt;/a&gt; about how to retweet with the new format.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gicD4k"&gt;Twitter last said the warnings before retweets of labeled tweets and the changes to how you retweet would be in place until “at least” the end of election week in the US. I’m still seeing the restrictions in place, nearly three weeks since Election Day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vho2h2"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 23rd, 7:54PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added rollout information from Twitter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday deals on Apple devices</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g5VU3Q"&gt;It’s rare that Apple slashes the prices on its own products. Fortunately, other retailers are putting a lot of Apple products on sale for Black Friday. A bunch of retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, B&amp;amp;H Photo, Walmart, and Woot are slashing the prices on everything from wearables to its wireless earbuds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIuihu"&gt;Additionally, Apple’s direct website will mark down prices on several products beginning on Friday, November 27th, and running until Monday, November 30th. If you buy an eligible product during Apple’s Black Friday event, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fgifts%2Fshopping-event&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21583192%2Fapple-deals-black-friday-tech-cyber-monday#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the tech giant will give you up to a $150 gift card&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube tests whether you’ll ever get sick of Bad Guy with an endless Billie Eilish mashup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Screenshot of the Infinite Bad Guy site. The “Bad Guy” video is in the middle, in front of a black and green background. Tags like “violin fam” and “instrumental” scroll across the bottom." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3LzfynuFF1itxMb_FY7gVaH-ajk=/121x0:1264x762/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67867262/infinite_bad_guy.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;“Infinite Bad Guy” featuring Billie Eilish’s “Bad Guy” music video. | Google/YouTube&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aCxeYV"&gt;Somehow, perhaps by some cosmic intervention, I haven’t gotten tired of hearing Billie Eilish’s “Bad Guy” on the radio. Apparently, I’m not the only one because tens of thousands of people have gone to the effort of making covers of the song and uploading them to YouTube. In celebration of its music video passing 1 billion views, YouTube and Google Creative Lab have turned all of those covers into an interactive AI experiment. “Infinite Bad Guy,” which YouTube calls “the world’s first infinite music video,” collects thousands of covers and blends them together, using machine learning to align each one within quarter-beats of the original. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PZlBgP"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OqY_IV3gj7E?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IIgorH"&gt;Going to &lt;a href="https://billie.withyoutube.com/"&gt;billie.withyoutube.com&lt;/a&gt; pulls up the original “Bad Guy” music video with cover videos on either side, set against a background of hundreds of tiny video thumbnails floating around a black void. When you click over from one video to another, the second will pick up on the same beat the first left off on. Pausing pulls up stats about how many covers you’ve watched and how many times you’ve played through a full loop of the song. When the song reaches the drop at the bridge, the color of the interface turns from green to red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gof5Pq"&gt;The fun thing is that they’ve also curated different tags that you can browse. There are predictable keywords like guitar, choir, and signing (for sign language covers) as well as some funkier selections like ASMR, cat, and… toy chicken? As I clicked around, I became less interested in the actual song and more in the variety of instruments, genres, and goofs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dECuV6"&gt;It’s a cool premise, though not quite seamless. When I tried it out, there was a bit of a lag as each video loaded, so it doesn’t exactly satisfy the craving for a fluid DJ mix. Differences in quality are particularly evident when covers are played back to back — out of thousands of covers, not all of them are going to be &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; covers. Some of the “covers” are actually just homemade music videos set to the original audio. There also isn’t audio leveling from one video to the next, so you may end up fiddling with your volume as you travel through the playlist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3WaAt1"&gt;Despite some clunkiness, it’s an engaging way to spend a few minutes away from the usual algorithms. I recommend you &lt;a href="https://billie.withyoutube.com/"&gt;experience it yourself&lt;/a&gt; and see how many melodica solos you can get through before you close your browser.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Black Friday deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZW8E5CtbikxomB2PeRzNbACsFmk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67798744/dseifert_201020_4247_0006.0.10.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qSby2y"&gt;The majority of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; deals will launch the day after Thanksgiving (November 26th) in the US as usual, but the pandemic has shaken things up in yet another way. The best deals will be happening online, with fewer in-person sales for the sake of safety. Better yet, some of those great deals are already available, so you can get started on your holiday gift (or personal) shopping. With this post, we’re rounding up the best early Black Friday deals from retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Walmart, Target, Adorama, B&amp;amp;H Photo, Newegg, and anywhere else we find deals you should know about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Kq7sS1"&gt;Smart speaker and audio deals&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MRx7v2iKWDhr2lI1LUX0smT9vN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19208402/dseifert_190915_3647_0001.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sono’s portable Move speaker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3TO80R"&gt;Sonos has slashed the prices on several of its speakers ahead of Black Friday. Three of its popular models are $100 off right now, a savings of up to 25 percent. You can buy the Sonos Move, the company’s first portable speaker, for just $299 right now at Sonos and Amazon or $300 at Best Buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="APQVzv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9575913"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tWOj2e"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07D4734HR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos Beam is $299 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (Usually $400). The deal is also available at &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/move.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos’ direct website&lt;/a&gt;. This is a great entry-level soundbar. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sNyRnl"&gt;You can also buy &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B087CCZH4Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos Sub add-on speaker at a discounted price for $599 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (usually $700). The deal is also available at &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.sonos.com/en-us/shop/sub.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sonos’ direct website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="jIQou8"&gt;If you’re looking for a compact and inexpensive smart speaker, both of the latest Amazon Echo and Echo Dot devices are on sale. The 4th Gen Echo Dot is down to $29, which is the lowest price we’ve seen since its launch this fall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PJS3T7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rkA3Fv"&gt;The Echo Dot’s compact design might not be appealing to everyone, but if you are looking for an Echo Device but want something a bit bigger, you can grab the Amazon Echo’s fourth-generation speaker for $70 right now at a few retailers, including Amazon and Target. Like this year’s Echo Dot, the Amazon Echo has an updated design that makes it more spherical in shape. It also has much improved audio quality and the ability to connect Zigbee smart home devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s8yyuQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K1n5zT"&gt;Over at Adorama and Best Buy, you can buy a Google Nest Audio two-pack for $169 right now. A two-pack for this smart speaker would normally set you back $199.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="U1SnqO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503894"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

This is the lowest we’ve seen yet on Apple’s flagship earbuds. Compared to the standard AirPods, the Pro model features better sound quality and noise cancellation, plus support for Apple’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;spatial audio feature&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="AhnjK1"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Buds Plus wireless earbuds are down to just $110 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B083KVM9VW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724117005601449431" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. This is the best price we’ve seen for this model, which usually costs $150 outside of any discounts. Compared to the standard Galaxy Buds, this upgraded model that launched alongside the Galaxy S20 series of phones has improved sound quality, microphones, and battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5zWQ0"&gt;If you are looking to buy two pairs of Galaxy Buds Plus, Best Buy has a few bundles, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724213386876980609" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;allowing you to buy sets for only $200&lt;/a&gt;. You can mix and match which color you want for both pairs and are available in blue, black, light blue, red, and white. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ArxGby"&gt;Alongside the Plus wireless earbuds, Samsung’s Galaxy Buds are discounted at Amazon and Best Buy. Normally, these earbuds would cost $130, but you can get them for $70 at either retailer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ttnzGj"&gt;Unfortunately, the color options are limited at both retailers, so you can only buy these earbuds in either black or silver. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="LmyLtf"&gt;If you are looking to pick up an iPad Pro this Black Friday, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPad-11-inch-Wi-Fi-256GB/dp/B08637NV8M/ref=as_li_ss_tl?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=Apple+iPad+11+inch+Pro&amp;amp;qid=1606161912&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=5f05426660dc58d28ae324183dffef5c&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724578293673083745" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have Apple’s high-end iPad Pro for $730. This model includes an 11-inch display and a 128GB storage configuration. If 128GB is not enough storage space for you, both retailers are taking $100 off the 256GB configuration, bringing the price down to $800, which is what you would normally pay if you bought the entry-level 11-inch iPad Pro with the lowest storage configuration. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch SE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SyzhPO"&gt;If you like Fitbit’s wearables and prefer to have a smartwatch by the company, you can get the Fitbit Sense smartwatch for $280 at &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Fitbit’s website&lt;/a&gt; or at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724580973739712242" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1590667-REG%2Ffitbit_fb512bkbk_sense_gps_smartwatch_carbon.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. Normally this model costs $330 and allows you to track your stress levels and measure your blood oxygen levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AAW1Mh"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603483"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DlkbsX"&gt;The Apple Watch SE was already the most affordable Watch that Apple made at $279, but it’s even cheaper at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724578867741826427" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. You can score the 40mm GPS version for $259 or the larger 44mm Watch for $289 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-Watch-SE-44mm/dp/B08J5XTRZD/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=e39bfa3f763e4fa56204c59a62303c7a&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724578918898824263" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. Each size looks similar to the more expensive Series 6 but lacks the always-on display and a few other features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Widfy"&gt;The Apple Watch SE aligns more with the Series 5 in terms of specs, but at $259, it’s a fantastic value. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438413/apple-watch-series-6-se-5-3-comparison-smartwatch-models-versus"&gt;Here’s an in-depth post&lt;/a&gt; on how the SE differs from other recent Apple Watch models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Ffa5rt"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 6 is also cheaper than usual at Amazon and Walmart. Normally $400 for the 40mm GPS model, it’s down to $330 — but there’s a catch. You must buy this model in either red or blue at Amazon and Walmart only has the red model in this size discounted right now. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Nest Wifi.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="65HtKg"&gt;If you have a large home and want to make sure all of the rooms in it have internet and no dead zones, Amazon and Best Buy has discounted the Eero 6 mesh Wi-Fi router. You can get three units for just $479. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Jg0NxI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9599966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="z8kPHL"&gt;Ahead of Black Friday, Google has discounted several of its products, including the Nest Wifi, and you can buy a two-pack for $219. The Nest Wifi system is easy to set up, and with two units, you can cover up to 4,400 square feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RtDGBK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603453"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qwgnwv"&gt;If you need a mesh router system that will cover more square feet in your home, you can buy a three-pack Eero 6 mesh router for $223. The mesh routers also include a built-in Zigbee smart home hub, allowing you to connect and control select devices with Amazon’s voice assistant Alexa. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dACyX2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9603441"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Av0Zih"&gt;If you prefer Netgear products, you can save 22 percent on a two-pack for the company’s Nighthawk mesh router system. It’s designed for homes that have up to 400Mbps of internet speeds. Netgear says its Nighthawk mesh router system provides up to 3,000 square feet in coverage and support for 25 or more devices.&lt;/p&gt;

Normally $290, this kit will only cost you $150. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WM5ndj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591273"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Kp4b3f"&gt;Circling back to Netgear, its $450 flagship mesh router system is also discounted. You can buy the Orbi RBK752 Wi-Fi 6 mesh router system for $280 at Amazon or Best Buy right now. This is a great product if you need something that will have the bandwidth to stream multiple videos in 4K or 8K resolution in your house. &lt;/p&gt;

It features optional password protection with AES 256-bit encryption and Samsung claims the T7 has up to 1,050MB/s transfer speeds. It’s compatible with a variety of operating systems, including Windows 10, macOS, and Android. Unfortunately, it will not work on iPad or iOS devices and it is not compatible as an external SSD for the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Blx9fM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Watch Dogs: Legion&lt;/em&gt;, the latest installment in Ubisoft’s hack-anything, open-world game, &lt;a href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/482924/864200/12050?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubi.com%2Fus%2Fwatch-dogs-legion-standard-edition%2F5cec2d5839798c0870c07698.html%3Flang%3Den_US&amp;amp;sharedid=verge"&gt;is down to $45 at Ubisoft’s official website&lt;/a&gt;, that’s $15 off, while it’s not the lowest we have seen this game go down, this title recently came out and this is still a good discount. What makes this deal even better is that each version will net you an upgrade to the Xbox Series X / S or PS5 copies for free. Even if you don’t have much interest in the game, it’s an affordable way to check out what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/9/21556197/xbox-series-s-ray-tracing-watch-dogs-legion"&gt;impressive ray-tracing graphics&lt;/a&gt; look like on the new console hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ZvFCDQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Last of Us Part II &lt;/em&gt;is one of the most popular PS4 games released this year. If you have yet to experience Naughty Dog’s latest title, you can pick it up for $30 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Last-Us-Part-II-PlayStation-4/dp/B07DJRFSDF/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;linkCode=ll1&amp;amp;tag=vergegooddeals-20&amp;amp;linkId=fc2d003cd4936f885db857399379224b&amp;amp;language=en_US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724302857718714066" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-4%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fthe-last-of-us-part-ii%2F11097389.html%3Fcondition%3DPre-Owned" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;div id="20AIbx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591200"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3mRedx"&gt;Speaking of popular PS4 games that released this year, &lt;em&gt;Ghost of Tsushima&lt;/em&gt; is also on sale at its lowest price ever of $40 at Amazon and Best Buy. Even better? If you purchased a PS5, you can transfer your save data from your PS4 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/6/21553494/sony-playstation-5-ps5-backward-compatibility-ps4-digital-foundry"&gt;experience the game in 60 frames per second&lt;/a&gt;, a feature exclusive to Sony’s next-gen console. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XG8KV1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9591232"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

The list goes on, though one thing that isn’t eligible are first-party Sony games for the PS5, like the &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls &lt;/em&gt;remake, but you can pick up &lt;em&gt;Godfall, &lt;/em&gt;which is available on Sony’s next-gen console (and on PC.) Even &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077,&lt;/em&gt; a game coming out next month is eligible for this promotion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber and Lyft just scored a huge federal transportation contract</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-TRANSPORT-RIDESHARE-DEMONSTRATION" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/miWobgXIce0TbTZoQNDqTAJrJmc=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67867087/1227939563.jpg.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qb0bLb"&gt;The US government awarded a big transportation contract to Uber and Lyft this week, authorizing the ride-hailing companies to provide transportation to up to 4 million federal employees and their families. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ji5dtp"&gt;The General Services Administration, the procurement arm for the federal government, granted the five-year contract to Uber and Lyft, the companies confirmed. The contract is worth up to $810 million, though it’s unclear how much each company will receive. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8bOtwZ"&gt;While individual federal employees have previously been able to use ride-hail services for travel, the new contract allows the companies to formally launch their services within agencies and directly work with officials to promote the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wF6edy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a natural next step for us”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VKtDi6"&gt;The contract was awarded to Uber for Business, the ride-hailing company’s business-to-business division. “The expansion of our customer base to include government is a natural next step for us, and we’re proud to help federal agencies tackle some of the biggest administrative challenges they face,” Ronnie Gurion, global head of Uber for Business, said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EfJlKJ"&gt;Lyft also hailed the contract as a good sign for the growth of its business. “Lyft already works closely with select agencies, but with this award under our belt, we see an opportunity to be the preferred rideshare partner for many other top federal agencies,” a spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayEiFS"&gt;A spokesperson for GSA did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but in a &lt;a href="https://www.gsa.gov/blog/2020/04/10/gsa-makes-travel-easier-and-cheaper-for-feds-when-they-rideshare"&gt;blog post back in April&lt;/a&gt;, the agency said it was able to negotiate a 2–4 percent discount with the companies, compared with large commercial customers. Uber and Lyft also agreed to waive technology fees charged to use back-office vendor data and reporting capabilities, the agency said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="euDCTM"&gt;The contract with Uber and Lyft “modernizes official travel and will make it easier, and cheaper, to use rideshare services for official travel,” Federal Acquisition Service Assistant Commissioner for Travel, Transportation and Logistics Charlotte Phelan wrote. “No new apps to download - and no paper receipts to lose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xluwx5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China launches ambitious mission to bring back samples from the Moon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="China To Launch Chang’e-5 Lunar Probe" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/veLa-7ingsRT1ctZtTePrrM-XdU=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67867011/1287260578.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by VCG / VCG via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wfWY3e"&gt;Today, China successfully launched its most ambitious mission to the Moon to date — this one designed to bring a handful of lunar rocks back to Earth before the end of the year. If successful, it’ll be the first time in nearly half a century that dirt from the Moon has been returned to Earth and the first time that China has retrieved materials from another world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="edEFt2"&gt;The mission, called Chang’e 5, is the latest in a long line of lunar missions that China has been conducting over the last decade. In 2013, the country made its first soft landing on the Moon with Chang’e 3, making China just one of three nations to put a spacecraft on the lunar surface. Then in December 2018, China launched Chang’e 4 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/6/18127180/china-national-space-administration-change-4-mission-lander-rover-far-side"&gt;successfully put a lander and rover on the far side of the Moon&lt;/a&gt; in early 2019 — a feat that no other nation has accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FT0vSZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;So far, only two nations have ever returned materials from the Moon&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iy6tQB"&gt;Now with Chang’e 5, China plans to bring back samples of the Moon. So far, only two nations — the United States and the former Soviet Union — have ever returned materials from the Moon. Chang’e 5 could soon be next, and lessons learned from this mission could put the country on course for even more complex flights to the Moon in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAqqX7"&gt;“This is one thing that the Chinese space program is very good at,” Andrew Jones, a freelance reporter specializing in China’s space program, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “They set incremental targets and goals, and they build on what they’ve achieved and make more ambitious targets.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhMbGt"&gt;But first, a lot of things have to go right, and Chang’e 5 is perhaps the most complicated mission that China has ever launched. For one thing, the mission is fairly heavy, with all of the hardware needed for the roundtrip Moon flight weighing in at about 8.2 metric tons or around 18,000 pounds. To get Chang’e 5 en route to the Moon, China used its most powerful rocket, the Long March 5. The rocket took off from Wenchang Spacecraft Launch Site located in south China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OY3tYU"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vppYWohS67I?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W9BWXy"&gt;The Long March 5 lofted a total of four robotic spacecraft for Chang’e 5, which will work together to bring back between 2 to 4 kilograms of lunar sample back to Earth, according to Jones. The quartet starts off its journey together, traveling to the Moon in a big pack. One of the four includes a service spacecraft that will help provide solar power and propel the group to the Moon. After entering the Moon’s orbit, two of the spacecraft — a lander and a vehicle to take off from the lander — will break away and descend to the surface. The lander will then use instruments to drill into the Moon, passing along the material it collects to the ascent vehicle sitting on top. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPxuWp"&gt;That ascent vehicle will then act as a mini-rocket, taking off from the Moon and meeting up with the hardware still in lunar orbit. Once it docks with the service spacecraft, the lunar sample will pass into the fourth spacecraft — a capsule designed to land back on Earth. The trio will then leave lunar orbit and head back to Earth. Eventually, the return capsule will break away with its precious materials inside. Since it will be coming in so fast from the Moon, the capsule will actually bounce off the Earth’s atmosphere once before diving toward the planet and eventually landing in Inner Mongolia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="1GBKd2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It should be a quick mission, lasting just 23 days or so&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jsCjIE"&gt;All in all, it should be a quick mission, lasting just 23 days or so from launch to landing of the lunar material, Jones says. That’s because Chang’e 5 is not designed to survive the harsh lunar night, a two-week period that occurs every month when part of the Moon’s surface is plunged into darkness and &lt;a href="https://lunar.gsfc.nasa.gov/images/lithos/LROlitho7temperaturevariation27May2014.pdf"&gt;temperatures can drop well below -208 degrees Fahrenheit (-130 degrees Celsius)&lt;/a&gt;. To survive such an extreme environment, the surface spacecraft would need to be equipped with special heating instruments — such as radioisotope generators that radioactively decay over time and generate warmth. Previous Chang’e missions included these generators to survive the lunar night, but such materials are missing on Chang’e 5 since this is designed to be a quick “grab and go” mission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lpTMtC"&gt;That means in less than a month, China could bring back the first samples of the Moon returned to Earth since the Cold War era. US astronauts famously brought back lunar rocks collected during the Apollo missions in the 1960s and ’70s, while the former Soviet Union performed a handful of successful lunar sample return missions in the 1970s. In fact, the last time lunar rocks came back to Earth occurred in 1976 with the Soviet Union’s Luna 24 robotic probe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KTfap8"&gt;Chang’e 5 is targeting a particularly enticing part of the Moon called Oceanus Procellarum. This unexplored area has relatively few craters on its surface compared to other parts of the Moon. One theory is that volcanic activity may have occurred in this area late in the Moon’s life, smoothing away craters that were there before. Getting samples from this region could provide scientists with a better understanding of when this volcanic activity might have occurred, providing a better snapshot of how the Moon formed and evolved over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Yi3dLH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The complexity of Chang’e 5 is also a deliberate choice for China&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rnEI6q"&gt;“It’s a big deal for the science community in China, and also the data will be keenly followed by scientists internationally,” Jones says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eQRcTx"&gt;The complexity of Chang’e 5 is also a deliberate choice for China, according to Jones, as it will allow the country to test out how to rendezvous and dock spacecraft in orbit around the Moon. China could have opted for the ascent vehicle to take the lunar samples all the way back to Earth. But Jones notes that the meetup in lunar orbit is meant to test out capabilities needed on future missions. A mission designed to return samples from Mars could certainly draw from Chang’e 5. But it’s also important to note that this mission is very similar in its flight profile to that of NASA’s Apollo missions, which used similar techniques for putting people on the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vX2o2X"&gt;“This is much more of an Apollo kind of mission profile than it was for the Soviet robotic lunar sample return,” says Jones. “So the idea is that they’re playing out and practicing for future crewed missions to the Moon.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple head of security accused of offering iPads as bribes for concealed gun permits</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPad 5 sonny dickinson" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IgD5ED1mBhH3f-YTSdBRBRl-aqk=/0x0:1100x733/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67866809/ipad5sonny.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HvXHac"&gt;A California grand jury has &lt;a href="https://www.sccgov.org/sites/da/newsroom/newsreleases/Documents/2020NRDocs/CCW%20Indictments%20-%20Sung.pdf"&gt;indicted&lt;/a&gt; Apple’s head of global security on charges that he tried to bribe Santa Clara County officials to procure firearms (CCW) licenses, &lt;a href="https://www.sccgov.org/sites/da/newsroom/newsreleases/Pages/NRA2020/CCW-Undersheriff-Sung-.aspx"&gt;according to a news release&lt;/a&gt;. Santa Clara district attorney Jeff Rosen alleges that Thomas Moyer offered 200 iPads — worth about $70,000 — to Capt. James Jensen and Undersheriff Rick Sung in the Santa Clara County sheriff’s office, in exchange for four concealed firearms licenses for Apple employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWyVgE"&gt;The charges came after a two-year investigation. “In the case of four CCW licenses withheld from Apple employees, Undersheriff Sung and Cpt. Jensen managed to extract from Thomas Moyer a promise that Apple would donate iPads to the Sheriff’s Office,” Rosen said in the news release. The iPads were never delivered, according to Rosen’s office, because Sung and Moyer became aware in 2019 that the district attorney was executing a search warrant for the sheriff department’s CCW records. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRwiKj"&gt;Moyer’s attorney, Ed Swanson, said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that his client is innocent of the charges filed against him, adding he believed Moyer was “collateral damage” in a dispute between the Santa Clara sheriff and district attorneys’ offices. “He did nothing wrong and has acted with the highest integrity throughout his career,” Swanson said. “We have no doubt he will be acquitted at trial.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hdF7Lw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-23/apple-security-chief-accused-of-offering-to-bribe-officials"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Moyer has been at Apple for about 15 years and has been its head of global security since November 2018. He wrote a memo in 2018 &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-13/apple-warns-employees-to-stop-leaking-information-to-media?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;warning Apple employees&lt;/a&gt; about the potential consequences of leaking information to the media, which he wrote “can become part of your personal and professional identity forever.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S2aXB6"&gt;Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM abandons Trump’s war against California’s pollution powers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-POLITICS-TRUMP-AUTO INDUSTRY" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cVZWP9BZTODJTDrInp7xr810Z6g=/0x74:3140x2167/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67866755/632572776.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;US President Donald Trump speaks with General Motors CEO Mary Barra during a meeting with automobile industry leaders in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, DC on January 24th, 2017.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Saul Loeb / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JeeL76"&gt;General Motors announced today that it is abandoning Donald Trump’s effort to take away California’s ability to set fuel efficiency standards. The company, along with Fiat Chrysler and Toyota, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21026865/general-motors-ev-day-trump-emissions-rollback-climate-crisis"&gt;previously backed Trump’s efforts&lt;/a&gt; to roll back fuel efficiency standards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e3U1FS"&gt;Under the Clean Air Act, California has historically been allowed to set its own emissions standards, which are tougher than federal guidelines and typically set the bar for the entire auto industry in the US. California is the largest auto market in the US and the 10th largest in the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="bhwjrd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are immediately withdrawing from the pre-emption litigation.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0XfLWq"&gt;GM is now aligning itself with President-elect Joe Biden’s plans to hasten a transition to electric vehicles in an effort to combat climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXYmds"&gt;“We are confident that the Biden Administration, California, and the U.S. auto industry, which supports 10.3 million jobs, can collaboratively find the pathway that will deliver an all-electric future,” GM CEO Mary Barra wrote in a letter to environmental groups today that was shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “To better foster the necessary dialogue, we are immediately withdrawing from the pre-emption litigation and inviting other automakers to join us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvfDUI"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575153/gm-electric-ev-investment-deadline-cadillac-chevy-hummer"&gt;GM pledged&lt;/a&gt; to boost spending on the development of its electric vehicles. The company said that it would launch 30 new electric vehicles by 2025. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jnaJGq"&gt;In March 2020, Trump &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/31/21201036/trump-epa-obama-fuel-economy-rule-rollback-emissions-consumer-cost"&gt;rolled back&lt;/a&gt; an Obama-era plan to put more fuel-efficient vehicles on the roads. Nearly two dozen states &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/27/21272179/attorneys-general-sue-trump-administration-fuel-efficiency-standard-rollback"&gt;sued&lt;/a&gt; the Trump administration in response. Even other car companies balked at the administration’s attempt to roll back the fuel efficiency mandate. While GM and a few others supported Trump, Ford, Volkswagen, Honda, and BMW all &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20727261/trump-emissions-rollback-ford-volkswagon-honda-bmw-california-deal"&gt;sided with California&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
