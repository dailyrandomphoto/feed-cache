    <title>Coinbase tests subscription service that waives some trading fees</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sy2B4I"&gt;The largest US cryptocurrency exchange, Coinbase, is testing a new subscription service that reduces its trading fees in return for a monthly fee, &lt;a href="https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/123134/coinbase-is-testing-a-subscription-service-with-zero-trading-fees-and-prioritized-support"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Block &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The subscription service, which is reportedly being called Coinbase One, waives the commission fee Coinbase charges for trades, but customers will still have to pay spread fees to buy or sell cryptocurrency. There’s currently no word on the cost of the subscription, which the company plans to offer to a small number of users to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x4Ix7E"&gt;Coinbase confirmed its test of the subscription program in a statement given to &lt;em&gt;The Block&lt;/em&gt;. “Customers in the test group will have the ability to buy, sell, and convert digital currencies on the Coinbase platform without a Coinbase fee for each trade (spread fees still apply),” a spokesperson for the exchange said. “We’re always looking to learn more about how we can best serve our customers in different ways. Right now, we are still in early stages, so everything about the future product experience will be shaped by the feedback we receive from our users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GBFQSC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The future product experience will be shaped by the feedback we receive from our users”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PqCjJw"&gt;As well as waiving some fees, &lt;em&gt;The Block&lt;/em&gt; reports that Coinbase One could also offer other features like priority phone support, as well as an account protection feature that could reimburse users up to $1 million if their accounts are broken into and their funds are stolen. These two additions are notable in light of user complaints that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/24/22348972/coinbase-customer-support-struggles-ipo-cryptocurrency-trading-platform"&gt;surfaced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, where customers reported accounts being locked or hacked, and users struggled to get in contact with customer support at Coinbase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C1pWom"&gt;According &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-03/coinbase-tests-commission-free-trading-subscription-service?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Coinbase’s interest in subscriptions could be an attempt to compete with rapidly growing competitors like Robinhood, which does not charge trading fees and already offers a subscription service of its own called Robinhood Gold. Coinbase One could also serve as a more predictable source of revenue. Ahead of Coinbase’s latest earnings report on November 9th, analysts are reportedly predicting a decline in Coinbase’s revenue thanks to Bitcoin’s second-quarter slump in value. Subscription revenue could help to smooth out slower quarters like these for Coinbase.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google outlines plans for first alternative in-app payments in South Korea</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7vdqEYoYCJQymuPY-gh5wkaWwAA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70092299/acastro_180508_1777_google_IO_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KznApg"&gt;Google has announced changes it will make to its in-app payments options in South Korea — a significant step back for the tech giant as governments around the world seek to curb the control Google and Apple wield over their mobile ecosystems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgBKo0"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://developers-kr.googleblog.com/2021/11/enabling-alternative-billing-in-korea-en.html"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, Google says it will allow third-party payment options for in-app purchases to appear alongside its own Google Play billing system in Android apps. The company will still charge developers a commission if users pay using a third-party system, but this fee will be reduced slightly as compensation for the costs of supporting alternative payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93UEyw"&gt;Says Google: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="WStgSE"&gt;Service fees for distributing apps via Android and Google Play will continue to be based on digital sales on the platform. We recognize, however, that developers will incur costs to support their billing system, so when a user selects alternative billing, we will reduce the developer’s service fee by 4%. For example, for the vast majority of developers who pay 15% for transactions through Google Play’s billing system, their service fee for transactions through the alternate billing system would be 11%. As another example, certain categories of apps participating in our Media Experience Program, such as an eBooks provider, will pay a 10% service fee for transactions made via Google Play’s billing system, but only 6% for transactions on an alternative system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Md7378"&gt;Google says this approach will allow it to comply with South Korean law while still investing in the Google Play ecosystem (the company’s long-standing argument for why it charges developers up to 30 percent commission on in-app purchases in the first place). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_UvLzeePFsu2PmO0m742uqL8C-M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22985218/google_alternative_payments.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An illustration of how Google might allow alternative payment methods to be integrated into Android apps. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IIoxjW"&gt;Google is making these changes in response to specific legislation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;passed in South Korea last August&lt;/a&gt;. The bill, dubbed the “Google power-abuse-prevention law” by some in the South Korean media, is intended to stop the operators of large app stores (aka Google and Apple) from requiring developers to &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; use their own payment systems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SDlXvU"&gt;The bill is the first of its kind to mandate such changes in Android and iOS, though &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620454/apple-google-app-store-senate-play-bill-epic-games-fortnite"&gt;similar legislation&lt;/a&gt; has been considered in the US and Europe. In the US, the issue of Apple and Google collecting commissions on in-app purchases was contentious enough to spark the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;recent lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; between &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; developer Epic and Apple, though Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22667694/epic-v-apple-trial-fortnite-judge-yvonne-gonzalez-rogers-final-ruling-injunction-breakdown"&gt;largely won&lt;/a&gt; that legal tussle. (Epic also has an ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632804/epic-google-lawsuit-unredacted-complaint-antitrust"&gt;lawsuit against Google&lt;/a&gt; regarding the same issue.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vphowk"&gt;Apple itself is not making any changes to its mobile payment structure in South Korea in response to this legislation. &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-allows-alternate-in-app-payment-options-in-south-korea-though-familiar-fees-remain-11636021788?mod=e2tw"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the company has told the South Korean government that its current policies are in line with the law. The &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt; notes that the exact wording of the legislation may allow for some wiggle-room for Apple. The law doesn’t directly regulate commissions but says that apps must not be forced to choose a specific payment method because of “unreasonable fees.” Apple, presumably, will argue that its fees are not unreasonable. If the government agency in charge of implementing this law, the Korea Communications Commission, disagrees, then it can open an investigation into Apple’s practices which may lead to fines for the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fUqX3a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Arlo’s new security camera keeps watch over LTE or Wi-Fi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qAON7ncOdP2pgaFri6wztc9EhWk=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70092271/Go_202_Boat_20Doc.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Arlo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gwbm8P"&gt;If you’re looking to set up a security camera that can keep watch in areas without Wi-Fi, or that’ll still be able to keep an eye on things if your home internet goes out, Arlo’s new LTE-powered camera may be of interest. The $250 Arlo Go 2 LTE / Wi-Fi camera is built to go in somewhat remote places, like on a barn, cabin, or boat dock, and features full HD video recording (though saving that to the cloud will require a subscription, more on that later), weather resistance, and a rechargeable and swappable battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4g751V"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2016/11/15/13636208/netgear-arlo-go-security-camera-lte"&gt;original Arlo Go&lt;/a&gt; was significantly more expensive at around $400, &lt;a href="https://kb.arlo.com/1201822/How-do-I-set-up-my-Arlo-Go-camera"&gt;didn’t support Wi-Fi&lt;/a&gt; (and therefore couldn’t use its cellular connection as a backup to your home internet like the 2 can), and also only recorded in 720p. For the second generation, it’s been bumped up to a more modern 1080p, letting you get a clearer view of what’s going on. Arlo says the camera’s batteries will last up to three months if you’re using cellular, and up to eight if you’re using Wi-Fi, though that’ll obviously depend on how often the camera is activated. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XbMCqYp3U0D_CEA7TknPui8pPjk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22984316/Go_202_Hero.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Arlo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Go 2 is weather resistant, and features a spotlight and rechargeable battery.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fMTVXX"&gt;Arlo has also added GPS to the Go 2 (to help you find it in a large area, or if it’s stolen), added a spotlight to let you see nighttime events in color instead of black and white, and upgraded the audio — you can now have a real-time conversation with someone in front of the camera, rather than the radio-like push-to-talk system from the first generation. Basically, it’s similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504755/arlo-pro-4-wire-free-spotlight-camera-ultra-2"&gt;Arlo’s Pro 4 camera&lt;/a&gt;, but with a focus on being able to put it anywhere there’s cell service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzKhva"&gt;Unfortunately, you’ll have to pay for &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.arlo.com%2Fen-us%2Farlosecure.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F4%2F22760520%2Farlo-security-camera-lte-wi-fi-go-2-subscription-gps" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Arlo’s Secure Subscription&lt;/a&gt; if you want to have easy access to recorded footage or use the camera’s person, animal, and vehicle detection — though the camera does come with a free three month trial. The basic version of the service costs $3 a month for one camera, or $10 a month for unlimited cameras (there’s also a premium $15 option that includes emergency response). While the Go 2 will be able to record to a microSD card if you don’t want to pay for a subscription, you probably won’t want to go pull it out of the camera every time you want to review footage  — part of the Go 2’s appeal is that it can be placed in somewhat remote places. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-UfgtZ9WO7Bxf2UPvHod7dBAGHo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22984476/Screen_Shot_2021_11_03_at_17.14.24.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The features available with and without Arlo’s subscription.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NHXx70"&gt;&lt;q&gt;You can put the Arlo Go 2 anywhere, but making full use of it will require a subscription or two&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kP5ZqV"&gt;While subscriptions are becoming standard across cameras, you’ll definitely want to take note of the monthly cost for the Go 2 — you’ll also need to pay for a cellular plan to take advantage of its LTE capabilities. From Verizon, the only carrier the camera is launching with, that’ll cost anywhere from $5 a month (for adding the camera to a shared data plan) to $20 a month for unlimited data. Arlo does say it’ll make the Go 2 available through more carriers next year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a2xj3Y"&gt;Despite those caveats, the Go 2 doesn’t have a ton of competition from traditional smart home camera companies. And, given its lower price, and the utility of being able to just put a camera wherever, you are getting a lot for your willingness to put up with a subscription.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scammers use Google Ads to siphon off hundreds of thousands of dollars from fake crypto wallets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustrated Dogecoin surrounded by warning signs." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dnpXC-9dkOvbgwOjrJpMuXFLQDs=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70092047/VRG_4614_9_Dogecoin.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Maria Chimishkyan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vTaZ0u"&gt;The crypto world is full of dangers, with scammers lying in wait for newbies and novices. A recent report from security outfit Check Point Research &lt;a href="https://blog.checkpoint.com/2021/11/04/scammers-used-google-ads-to-steal-500k-worth-of-cryptocurrency/"&gt;highlights a potent form of attack&lt;/a&gt;: using Google Ads to direct users to fake crypto wallets. In its report, CPR said it has seen roughly half a million dollars siphoned off through these methods in just the last few days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ipvf1R"&gt;Here’s how the scam works. Attacker buys Google Ads in response to searches for popular crypto wallets (that’s the software used to store cryptocurrency, NFTs, and the like). CPR says it’s noticed scams targeting Phantom and MetaMask wallets, which are the most popular wallets for the Solana and Ethereum ecosystems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qhv66V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The scam is a fairly typical phishing attack&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9ivRXI"&gt;When an unsuspecting user Googles “phantom,” the Google Ad result (which appears above actual search results) directs them to a phishing website that looks like the real thing. Then, one of two things happens: either the user enters their credentials which the attacker keeps. Or, much weirder, if they try to create a new wallet they’re told to use a recovery password which actually logs them into a wallet controlled by the attacker, not their own. “This means if they transfer any funds, the attacker will get that immediately,” says CPR. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jEEUdvem-SP30q2x5AZp69_88D8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22985198/Screen_Shot_2021_11_04_at_10.33.12_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CPR&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The attackers use fake URLs to trick users into thinking they’re logging into their crypto wallets&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rHsgUL2wGU48BRZr-0Yc4wtwKzE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22985199/Screen_Shot_2021_11_04_at_10.37.07_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: CPR&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;As with other phishing scams, the fake sites are designed to look as similar as possible to the real ones. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1SUWOL"&gt;As with phishing scams more generally, the attackers rely on making their fake log-in pages look as much as possible like the real thing. CPR notes that they’ve seen attackers use fake URLs to trick users, directing them to phanton.app or phantonn.app, for example, instead of the correct phantom.app. The group has also seen similar phishing scams used to direct users to fake crypto currency exchanges, including PancakeSwap and UniSwap. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dyo6L0"&gt;CPR’s researchers say they started noticing these scams after seeing crypto users complain about their losses on Reddit and other forums. They estimate that “at least half a million dollars” have been stolen over the past few days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fuQfIq"&gt;“I believe we’re at the advent of a new cyber crime trend, where scammers will use Google Search as a primary attack vector to reach crypto wallets, instead of traditionally phishing through email,” said CPR’s Oded Vanunu in a press statement. “The phishing websites where victims were directed to reflected meticulous copying and imitation of wallet brand messaging. And what’s most alarming is that multiple scammer groups are bidding for keywords on Google Ads, which is likely a signal of the success of these new phishing campaigns that are geared to heist crypto wallets.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwEfA1"&gt;The group offers a few words of wisdom for users hoping to avoid these pitfalls, including never clicking on Google Ads results but instead looking at search results, and always checking the URL of the site you’re visiting. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo cuts Switch sales forecast due to global chip shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ioa64wrRQiSBP30EeJ6xoHk59Ng=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70091636/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0013.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QSi7lN"&gt;Nintendo had a relatively quiet quarter for Switch sales, with 3.83 million units shipped between July and September. That’s a big drop on the same period &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21550621/nintendo-earnings-q2-2020-switch-sales"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;, when the company moved 6.86 million units. Nintendo has now sold 92.87 million Switch consoles to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qyKExH"&gt;Nintendo says “the extended impact of both COVID-19 and the global semiconductor shortage creates a state of continued uncertainty” and is revising its Switch sales forecast for the financial year down by 1.5 million units. The company had previously expected to sell 25.5 million consoles between April 2021 and March 2022, but has now set the figure at 24 million. However, Nintendo isn’t altering its expectations for revenue, and actually expects operating profit to be 4 percent higher than previously predicted. The modified forecast takes into account revisions in exchange rates as well as higher projected software sales.&lt;/p&gt;

The Wii is Nintendo’s most popular home console of all time and sold 101.63 million units in total; Nintendo sold 11.57 million Switch units between October and December last year. If you consider the Switch a handheld, though, it’s still trailing the Game Boy’s 118.69 million units and the 154.02 million racked up by the DS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ji205l"&gt;Nintendo doesn’t have a huge lineup of games for the holiday season, although the already-released &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Mario Party Superstars&lt;/em&gt; will factor into this quarter’s figures. The biggest imminent releases are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22302858/pokemon-diamond-pearl-remake-nintendo-switch"&gt;remakes of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Diamond&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pearl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; along with a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535212/nintendo-the-legend-of-zelda-ii-links-awakening-game-watch-handheld-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Legend of Zelda&lt;/em&gt;-themed Game &amp;amp; Watch handheld&lt;/a&gt;. An &lt;em&gt;Advance Wars&lt;/em&gt; remake has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740195/nintendo-advance-wars-1-2-re-boot-camp-switch-switch-remaster-delay"&gt;delayed&lt;/a&gt; into spring 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Forza Horizon 5 is the perfect portable Xbox game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RjJeDbW3w1jWtIbbpuRIeU0EyEQ=/76x0:3262x2124/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70091598/ForzaHorizon5_Launch_Preview_06_16x9_WM.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QRaYyO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; is an absolutely stunning showcase of the Xbox Series X. Cars look incredible, and I’ve loved taking in the game’s lush and colorful landscapes as I’ve raced through the streets of Mexico blasting classical music. On a console that’s largely lacking in big-name exclusives, it’s one of the rare games that really shows what the latest Xbox is capable of. Turns out it’s &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; a fantastic portable game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O2nHeY"&gt;Hear me out. Yes, the graphics are amazing and are a joy to take in on a big screen. But &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;accessible gameplay and bevy of customizability options means it translates really well to something the size of a smartphone. I’ve been playing the game via console streaming with my iPhone 12 Mini plugged into a Backbone One controller, and I’ve been surprised at just how great a fit it is.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hdc9MLVYIg1TBU9nWCW8XtV0TLo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22983838/ForzaHorizon5_Launch_Preview_03_16x9_WM.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;em&gt; looks amazing on a phone or a TV.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uCh85S"&gt;The most basic activity in &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; is pretty simple: pick a point on the map or jump into a race and follow the big blue driving line to get to where you need to go. Even on the iPhone 12 Mini’s screen, the line is easy to see, and I can usually follow it without issue. The controls are straightforward as well. Most of the time, I’m only worrying about one trigger for gas, one trigger for brake, and navigating with the left control stick. All of that is manageable for me on the Backbone One’s smaller layout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ji7JA4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;’s generous rewind feature also alleviates potential frustrations from playing on a phone screen. While the racing line is helpful, I’ve definitely missed a few turns because I couldn’t see far enough ahead. But if I do end up blowing by a hairpin curve, I can just hit the rewind button to get another opportunity to more smoothly make the turn. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DujGdt"&gt;The game’s core structure lends itself to pick-up-and-play sessions. &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;’s huge map is littered with races and activities (I don’t know if I’ll ever complete them all), but most events don’t take longer than a few minutes to complete. That means it’s easy to accomplish something even if you only have 15 minutes to play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9AeSbq"&gt;Console streaming, for me, has been pretty solid. I’ve only seen a handful of frame rate hiccups, though that might just be because I live in a studio and am rarely a few feet away from my Series X and my Wi-Fi router. That said, the few times I’ve felt choppy performance has hindered my racing, I’ve just tuned down the difficulty a bit in settings to make things a bit more forgiving. I haven’t been able to try &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; on Xbox Cloud Gaming, but if you want to get a feel for what it could feel like, check out &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 4&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which has a tiny but bearable amount of input lag for me. (Your mileage may vary, of course.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="f5eKSW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Playing on a phone might not be ideal if you’re a more competitive racer&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="65DBCz"&gt;Playing &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; on a phone might not be ideal if you’re a more competitive racer. I fully admit that I play the game in a pretty relaxed way; I rarely veer from the driving line, generally play against AI cars on the average difficulty, make liberal use of the rewind feature, and often move on from a race after a couple tries if I can’t get on the podium. I haven’t raced against other players online. If I did that while playing on my phone, I don’t think I’d keep up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aZpmrr"&gt;But as games keep getting bigger, having a portable way to play and achievable goals to accomplish is more useful than ever. Part of the magic of &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; on the Nintendo Switch was how well it worked in both long and short sessions in TV or portable mode, and I’m glad to see games like &lt;em&gt;Forza&lt;/em&gt; offer a similar level of flexibility. So much about the game’s design lends itself well to short bursts of mobile gameplay, and its addictive cycle works no matter what screen I’m playing it on. (And since &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; will also be available on Steam, it could be an excellent showcase for the Steam Deck.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QmxPXL"&gt;Microsoft will probably never actually make a handheld Xbox, but at this point, it doesn’t have to. If you have a phone and a controller that can connect to it, games like &lt;em&gt;Forza&lt;/em&gt; become perfect portable experiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u1WCjL"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; launches November 9th on Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, and PC. If you buy the Premium Edition or Premium Add-Ons Bundle, you can play the game starting November 5th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cPiARe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on 4K TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Frame TV 2018" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Wa_2Uod8BhL5yZpxdXG9OqwpXuc=/0x699:4194x3495/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69151213/2018_2_The_Frame_Lifestyle_Image_Assets_20.10.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Frame, Samsung’s art-like QLED TV, is on sale at Amazon right now for $998.&lt;/em&gt; | Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pYdAAO"&gt;There are a lot of 4K TVs available to choose from, complete with a wide variety of prices and performance. And, with many fall sales currently underway, now might be the best time of the year to get an amazing TV deal. Even if your budget is less than $500, you can get a good 4K TV in a bigger size than you might expect. Whether you want a secondary TV for the bedroom or a high-end OLED that’s built for a cinema-like experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals across four common categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="tf9rXR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#f9MF2Z"&gt;The best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eeM2RN"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#EYhbja"&gt;The best TV deals on a budget&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vzRoT0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#qm44jO"&gt;The best deals on OLED TVs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mlO4U5"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22371561/best-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl#O5Vjam"&gt;4K TVs for the PlayStation and Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="d2lRkA"&gt;Note: We provide regular updates to this post so be sure to check back periodically for the most up-to-date info on the best deals available. Additionally, with &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17Ih9j_mVq66uudw8qbC59JZZUPFy0hUevLFqEUvlyfw/edit#gid=0"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; now just on the horizon, we’ve gathered some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;best early Black Friday deals&lt;/a&gt; you can cash in on, which include a handful of our favorite 4K TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="MLgUIb"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best TV to buy for the PS5 and Xbox Series X","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="f9MF2Z"&gt;The best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mszLRr"&gt;A 55-inch TV is a popular size for good reason. It’s not too big, nor is it too small, making it a safe size if you’re looking to upgrade the TV in a living room or bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3LwO3"&gt;Sony’s 55-inch X80J TV has Google TV software built-in, so you won’t need to purchase any additional streaming boxes, like an Apple TV or Chromecast. The LED panel also supports HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Vision HDR, and has four HDMI ports (one of which is HDMI ARC). It’s a relatively low-frills affair, but it seems like a good deal that’s currently available at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1743620079563082108" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-X80J-Inch-Compatibility-KD55X80J/dp/B08QXFT4M9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for $650, the TV’s best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gEtknI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10610217"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JbaBai"&gt;The TCL 6-Series R635 model is a good option if you are looking to balance price and performance. The R635 model sports a QLED panel, but it goes a step above with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363318/tcl-2020-5-6-series-4k-tvs-qled-mini-led-backlighting-gaming-ps5-xbox-series-x" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mini LED backlighting&lt;/a&gt;, which brings better brightness and contrast. The 55-inch model is currently on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0885F5GMP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon for $700&lt;/a&gt;, though, we’ve seen slightly better discounts on the R635 in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Osz4r"&gt;If you prefer a larger model, Amazon and Best Buy are also selling the 65- and 75-inch variants. Both retailers are offering the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCtSSCCCU" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch for $1,000&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVnwOsusm3" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;75-inch for $1,300&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y8BpYm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10327662"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kuUEp8"&gt;Samsung’s The Frame blends into your home decor, displaying customizable images that look like a piece of decorative art if its motion sensor detects someone in the room. When turned on, however, it transforms into an HDR-compatible QLED TV with Amazon’s Alexa built-in and support for AirPlay 2. The stylish, 4K TV also boasts a 120Hz refresh rate, access to all the popular streaming services, and four HDMI ports. Right now, the 55-inch model is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfLCWIlxESJ" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for around $1,000&lt;/a&gt;, a healthy $500 less than its regular $1,500 price tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="JD5CqS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10711541"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EYhbja"&gt;The best TV deals on a budget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zWYgij"&gt;You don’t have to spend a fortune for a 4K TV; spending $500 or less can still net you a TV with good image quality and features. Insignia’s 4K HDR Fire TV Edition model is the perfect case in point, one that supports HDR10, HDMI ARC, and HDMI eArc, among other notable features. Right now, you can pick up the 55-inch model from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08X7KQQGJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748188127423432886" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy for $370&lt;/a&gt;, a $180 discount on what is its typical $550 price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jIOPJT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10605845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cW4VPC"&gt;Another Fire TV Edition TV deal happening now is on Toshiba’s 50-inch Smart Fire TV Edition 4K LED, which normally retails for $500. As the name might imply, it allows you to stream content from services such as Disney Plus and Netflix, and includes the option to watch live TV. The latest models also tout an Alexa-enabled remote, an easy-to-use interface, and support for both Dolby Vision HDR and HDR10. Right now at Amazon, you can pick up the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Toshiba-55-inch-4K-UHD-Smart-Fire-TV/dp/B0924XSHB2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch model for $370&lt;/a&gt;, nearly matching its best price to date.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="x443tm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="74eOSC"&gt;TCL also has competitively priced televisions, and its 4-Series lineup is one of the more affordable options on the market. The S435 model features a built-in Roku interface, dual-band Wi-Fi, HDR10, and support for all Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri. You can currently get the 55-inch model for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-4K-Smart-LED-43S435/dp/B08GWBBH4R?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$380 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is $221 less than the usual retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HtnMEi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9740197"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="9H3H8m"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="actionbox" data-anthem-component-data='{"title":"Verge Deals on Twitter","description":"Join our 40,000 followers, and keep up with our best daily tech deals with @vergedeals","label":"Follow us!","url":"http://bit.ly/2JzR5Ud"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="qm44jO"&gt;The best deals on OLED TVs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vbJRlM"&gt;OLED televisions offer the best image quality you can get in a mainstream TV. LG’s BX line also supports HDMI 2.1, meaning this TV is perfect for people looking to take advantage of the PS5 or Xbox Series X. You can currently get it in either a 55-, 65-, or 75-inch configuration and save up to $500, depending on the size. The popular 65-inch model is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Ftvs%2Flg-oled65bxpua-oled-4k-tv&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently discounted to $1,800 at LG&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED65BXPUA-Alexa-Built-Ultra/dp/B0829RMHCM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, $500 off the normal retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OMVgrF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MB8PX4"&gt;Despite the high price tag, LG’s Gallery Series GX OLED is a good TV for those looking for a more cinematic experience. It includes support for Google Assistant and Alexa, and for those who want to use their TV for gaming, it features Nvidia G-Sync and HDMI 2.1 support, meaning it can take full advantage of the RTX 30-series cards or Sony’s and Microsoft’s next-gen gaming consoles. Right now, you can get the 55-inch for as low as &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1555065-REG%2Flg_oled55gxpua_gxpua_55_class_hdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,647 at B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, or for a few dollars more at &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744656950369633474" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1555068-REG%2Flg_oled65gxpua_gxpua_65_class_hdr.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22371561%2Fbest-4k-tv-deals-sale-lg-samsung-sony-tcl" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;65-inch model is also available at B&amp;amp;H Photo for $2,197&lt;/a&gt;, or at &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Flg-oled-gx-65%2Fp%2F16C-000P-004G0" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Newegg for $2,296,&lt;/a&gt; a savings of more than $1,200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lpiA85"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10445785"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nGYSCL"&gt;Vizio’s 55-inch OLED is a Best Buy exclusive. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVB68Xg6uj" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;You can currently get it for $1,000&lt;/a&gt; — a price that seems to come around every few months —and it remains one of the more affordable options available if you’re looking for 55-inch OLED. Vizio doesn’t have the same kind of experience in the OLED playing field as LG, sure, but it’s a great deal if you want a high-end viewing experience and HDMI 2.1 ports to display high frame rates from your PS5 or Xbox Series X. The 65-inch model is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVCblSKnxi" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;also available at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, if you prefer a larger size.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q8lGs4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10462603"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O5Vjam"&gt;4K TVs for the Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xr7I2E"&gt;Sony’s PS5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series X can play 4K games with HDR at up to 120 frames per second. So, naturally, if you don’t have a TV that takes full advantage of your console, it might be time to upgrade to one of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399437/best-gaming-tv-playstation5-ps5-xbox-series-x-s" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt;. For the best experience, you’ll want a TV that supports HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Nkhmv"&gt;Deals on those picks are scarce right now, however, there’s one happening on LG’s CX series of TVs, which include support for Nvidia’s G-Sync and AMD’s FreeSync adaptive sync technologies, as well as a low 1ms response time. The big difference between the CX and the cheaper BX model mentioned above is the CX line has slightly better brightness, which is better for HDR content. It’s currently available in three sizes: 55, 65, and 77 inches. Right now, there's a small $75 discount available on the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVowrPgJjE" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and a $300 discount &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfVCmbeDxyh" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available on the 77-inch configuration&lt;/a&gt;, bringing them down to $1,425 and $3,000, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F5GsVe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9534696"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BfJNcm"&gt;If you’re looking for an even more impressive TV, we recommend turning your attention to LG’s C1 line. Like its predecessor, the CX, the 4K C1 touts support for Nvidia G-Sync and AMD Freesync technologies, along with a 120Hz refresh rate and low input lag. The main difference between the two is that the C1 is available in an 83-inch variant and features a better processor. It also utilizes a newer interface that makes good use of a settings pane dubbed “Game Optimizer,” which conveniently brings together a host of game-centric settings — refresh rate, latency, etc. — for quicker access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkH38i"&gt;If you’re interested in all the bells and whistles that come with the C1, the 55-inch model is on sale at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFV7L3N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747318067989758928" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; with six months of HBO Max for around $1,300, one of the lowest prices to date on the excellent OLED. You can also pick up the smaller, 48-inch model for around $1,100 at the same retailers (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WFK81RH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1747323256242351544" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;), as well as the 65-, 77-, and 83-inch variants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="IrDSVn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10618444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bn523S"&gt;For a viable OLED alternative — one that’s currently seeing a rare discount — there’s the Neo QLED QN90A. Unlike the LG models above, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309077/samsung-2021-8k-4k-tvs-now-available-price-specs" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s most recent flagship&lt;/a&gt; uses Mini LED backlighting, a technology that allows for better contrast, less “blooming” around white objects on a dark background, and brightness levels that outperform even the best OLED TVs. Like the C1, the QN90A is also built with gamers in mind. The 2021 model features an HDMI 2.1 port and a “Game Bar” that gives you the ability to quickly adjust your screen’s aspect ratio, monitor input lag, and check to ensure settings such as HDR and VRR are active, all of which make for a better gaming experience overall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TYqOuE"&gt;We don’t often see discounts on the QN90A, however, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748274080574733405" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V3W4YXJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; are both currently offering the 55-inch model for about $1,500, the best price we’ve seen on the stunning QLED. There are also varying discounts available on the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YPBJ2T8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V39W74P/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;75-&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08V3B227H/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;85-inch configurations&lt;/a&gt; at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Kindle deals right now</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_0jG4qDGtvO2-VxvVC5PUlh1ldA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67715739/akrales_181101_3056_0132.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2018 Kindle Paperwhite might not be the newest model, but it’s available for $40 off.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AZCNr8"&gt;When it comes to finding a device to use to read your ebooks, you have a few options to choose from. You can always buy a tablet or use your smartphone, but those devices are multipurpose and can be used for a ton of things, like surfing the web or doom-scrolling on Twitter. If you are looking for something to strictly read books, e-readers, while niche, are designed to store all of your books in a virtual library with limited functionality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pDKHVT"&gt;Amazon, one of the pioneers of the e-reader, has dominated the space for years with its Kindle lineup, which consists of several unique models with their own pros and cons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2UeWxe"&gt;Below, we’ve listed each model currently available for purchase. Sometimes, there isn’t a deal for one, or any, of the products, which is why we’ve mentioned the most recent sale price in those instances. Additionally, while newer models like the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite are currently only available for full price, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21583092/black-friday-guide-cyber-monday-tech-gadgets"&gt;Black Friday and Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt; are right around the corner, a time when Amazon historically discounts its e-reader lineup. The retailer also offers 20 percent off all of its Kindles when you trade in select devices, so there are still other ways to save money when none of the models are available at a discount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hittMf"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Amazon’s older Kindles will start to lose their internet access in December","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598747/kindle-3g-network-shutdown-e-readers-no-internet"},{"title":"The best early Black Friday deals you can get right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="r36wrm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10741941"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jqPttv"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/10/18302177/amazon-kindle-base-model-low-resolution-screen-backlight-review"&gt;Kindle (10th-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="mXAcFi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10363966"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hfprjz"&gt;This is Amazon’s most affordable e-reader, and as such, it usually retails for $90. Released in 2019, the base Kindle includes a front light, 8GB of storage, and comes with or without ad support. Despite including the same 167ppi resolution as its predecessors, the latest base Kindle features a slightly higher contrast than earlier models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pIAlEv"&gt;Right now, you can buy a 10th-gen Kindle with lock screen ads for $50 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VT322X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxG6j9qO2d" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $40 off the original MSRP. If you want one without ads, you can grab it for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085VZV5VB/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$70 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. If you buy either Kindle model at Amazon, you’ll also receive three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XTnhuW"&gt;If you want to save some money on additional accessories for the e-reader, Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Essentials-including-Amazon-Printed-Adapter/dp/B08C6NDPFM?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Essentials Bundle&lt;/a&gt; is $80 ($55 off its usual price) at Amazon; it includes one of three printed covers and a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RkX3DN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552432"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ze80m8"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/10/7/20902588/kindle-kids-edition-amazon-bundle-young-e-reader-case-replacement-program-freetime" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Kids Edition (2019)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JypT34"&gt;The entry-level Kindle and Oasis models were not the only ones that received a refresh in 2019. Amazon also announced and released a Kindle Kids Edition Bundle, which provides age-appropriate content for younger readers who prefer digital books for $110 ($20 more than the base Kindle at standard MSRP). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LlYfl"&gt;The Kindle Kids Edition consists of five items: the device, a case, a two-year extended replacement guarantee (in the event the device breaks), and one year of Amazon Kids Plus service. The latter is the biggest selling point of the device aside from the kid-friendly patterns, as it allows parents to grant their kids access to a digital library of kid-friendly books like &lt;em&gt;Percy Jackson&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit &lt;/em&gt;at no additional cost. Right now it’s available at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07NMY72SC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1746224890339507137" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; for $60.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3DEvBp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552664"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="iYO8oT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best iPad deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21280354/best-ipad-deals-apple"},{"title":"Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21546591/best-amazon-echo-deals"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="t6m9om"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22745670/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2021-review-usb-c-signature-edition-display-e-reader-books" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (2021)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="deHMlR"&gt;Amazon’s latest Kindle Paperwhite is its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22684801/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-features-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;11th-gen model&lt;/a&gt;, which comes with USB-C support, longer battery life, and a larger, 6.8-inch display. Given just how recently the new e-reader launched, however, we haven’t seen any discounts yet. Thankfully, you can still pick up the last-gen model, which is frequently available for far less than the standard retail price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FkwzBt"&gt;The 2021 Kindle Paperwhite comes in three main configurations: an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08KTZ8249/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB model with ads for $140&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N38WQSH/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB without ads for $160&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08B495319/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB Signature Edition for $190&lt;/a&gt;. The latter is identical to the standard Paperwhite, except it also features Qi wireless charging and a sensor that will automatically adjust the backlight when needed. Amazon has also rolled out a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08WPB8PW9/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite Kids Edition for $159&lt;/a&gt;, which comes bundled with a kid-friendly cover, a two-year extended replacement guarantee, and a year of Amazon Kids Plus, much like the aforementioned Kindle Kids Edition. All 2021 models are also similar to the 2018 model in that they feature a waterproof design and Audible audiobook support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XEYFbp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10765216"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="iorwh0"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/7/18065960/amazon-kindle-paperwhite-2018-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Paperwhite (2018)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="UaH6Zy"&gt;While there currently are no price breaks on the 2021 Kindle Paperwhite — save for the 20 percent off you can get with an eligible trade-in — Amazon has drastically lowered the price of the 2018 model. Currently, you can pick up the 8GB Kindle Paperwhite with ad support for $90 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PQ96B6B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxHjGSDlV6" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PTCW9G7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ad-free edition at Amazon for $110&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more space, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PP49ZDW?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfxHnfba6HB#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; are also selling the 32GB Paperwhite with ads for $85. Just like with the base Kindle, Amazon is even running a promotion where you can grab the e-reader and three months of Kindle Unlimited at no additional cost. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Emeowb"&gt;If you don’t mind paying for a leather case and a power adapter, Amazon is also currently discounting its Kindle Paperwhite Essentials Bundle, which includes either an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HL49FCK/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB e-reader for $170&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HKT4M5K/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB reader with ads for $200&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re a fan of Suzanne Collins’ Hunger Games trilogy, Amazon also offers a bundle that includes a Kindle Paperwhite, a power adapter, and a Mockingjay-emblazoned cover. It’s currently available in two ad-supported configurations and colors: an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NMH2F7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB version for $160&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Paperwhite-Bundle-including-Ad-Supported/dp/B087NM77FC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $190&lt;/a&gt;, both of which save you $20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vOUHwk"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552401"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="X5jbTU"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707619/amazon-kindle-oasis-2019-e-reader-review-price-specs-features-display" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kindle Oasis (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IByP4u"&gt;The Kindle Oasis is the most expensive of the lineup, starting at $250. The device comes in two storage configurations, 8GB or 32GB, and like the other models, you can get it with or without ads on the lock screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1AvXZM"&gt;The 2019 Kindle Oasis looks very similar to the previous model. It retains its waterproof, 7-inch, 300ppi E Ink display and supports Audible audiobooks via Bluetooth. However, unlike previous models, it can adjust the color temperature to a yellow-toned display, making it easier to read at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxP7sb"&gt;In the past, we have seen the 32GB Kindle Oasis drop to as low as $200, which is the lowest it has ever been for that configuration to date. While there are currently no deals on just the Oasis itself, configurations start at $250 at Amazon and include three free months of Kindle Unlimited. The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHV8D7P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported Oasis&lt;/a&gt; is $250 and the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VDMJJLG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;one without ads is $270&lt;/a&gt;. If you need more storage, the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VCMJSLB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB version is $280 with ads&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VGTRMFS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$300 without&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XuGlPY"&gt;Amazon is currently offering an Essentials Bundle for $30 off its normal list price, too. You can get either the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RNPKRKW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;8GB, ad-supported configuration for $290&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RW2K1MD/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;32GB variant for $310&lt;/a&gt;, both of which come with a leather cover, a power adapter, and three months of Kindle Unlimited.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="hPPu8s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9552599"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="4mZNi9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Nintendo releases Animal Crossing’s big 2.0 update early</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8l7XandWtxAb8T0yqwTnqLwVwBY=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70089956/20211015_ACNH_Update_scrn_009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3DnJ1X"&gt;The major 2.0 update for &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; is now available to download, which is somewhat surprising because Nintendo previously said it wouldn’t be released until November 5th. That means you’ll be able to dive into all the new features two days earlier than expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="McAWlp"&gt;The free 2.0 update was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727354/animal-crossing-switch-update-date"&gt;announced last month&lt;/a&gt; in a Nintendo Direct presentation. It includes a ton of expanded functionality including new house exterior designs, boat tours to other islands, more item, storage, a “pro” camera mode, the ability to cook food with grown ingredients, and more. Perhaps the most anticipated addition is Brewster’s coffee shop, a notable omission from the base game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZEjGC"&gt;In addition to the free update Nintendo announced a $24.99 expansion called &lt;em&gt;Happy Home Paradise&lt;/em&gt;, but as of writing it’s not yet accessible in-game — though the eShop still lists it for pre-load. Access to the extra paid content will also be included with the Nintendo Switch Online “expansion pack” that features N64 and Sega Genesis games, but it isn’t available to subscribers of that service yet either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rqTgFK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; is the second best-selling game on the Nintendo Switch after &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&lt;/em&gt;. As of June 30th, Nintendo had sold 33.89 million copies.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OdnWVV"&gt;When Sonos purchased a privacy-focused voice assistant Snips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20975607/sonos-buys-snips-ai-voice-assistant-privacy"&gt;in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, it strongly implied that it planned to build an assistant that would “add to our customers’ ease of use and control” instead of going head-to-head with bigger assistants from other big tech companies. Nearly two years later, we might be close to being using the company’s homegrown assistant, as a Reddit user found &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/ql8u3t/sonos_voice_assistant_references_in_the_app/"&gt;code in the Sonos app&lt;/a&gt; that appears to show voice commands for Sonos Voice Control (&lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/sonos-voice-control-assistant-leak"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BwD5kS"&gt;According to the code strings, you’ll be able to do things like play and pause music, adjust the volume, and check your Sonos’ battery. The Reddit user also found what looks to be the logo for Sonos’ assistant and evidence suggesting you’ll be able to have it assistant enabled alongside Amazon’s Alexa but &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; alongside the Google Assistant. You can see the icons in the images below (Sonos’ voice assistant icon looks remarkably similar to the one for Alexa). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b7L8kcvmOi6PEXlsRrMUgQS1tR4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22984247/6llt3anxq7x71.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qEp-_0png-2LyYHfF-rOeinUyhI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22984249/o80z0dpxq7x71.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;And here’s Sonos’ icon next to the Google Assistant icon.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AkcCbF"&gt;This isn’t the first clue that a Sonos-made voice assistant might be imminent: the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623470/sonos-survey-voice-assistant-google-fight"&gt;posted a survey&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year regarding a “potential new product offering” called (you guessed it!) Sonos Voice Control. According to the survey, to activate the assistant, you’d just have to say “Hey Sonos,” and all commands would be processed locally on the device. Sonos Voice Control and Alexa would work on the same speaker, the survey said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EIH5F"&gt;Sonos is also locked in a legal battle with Google, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055048/sonos-google-lawsuit-sues-speakers-assistant-amazon"&gt;suing the search giant in January 2020&lt;/a&gt; for allegedly copying its speaker tech. In addition, Sonos also says that Google is standing in the way of letting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700724/sonos-smart-speakers-concurrency-google"&gt;Alexa and Google Assistant be used side by side&lt;/a&gt; on Sonos speakers. By making its offering its own voice assistant, Sonos might be able to let customers have multiple assistants at once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iWqjjk"&gt;“We don’t comment on rumor or speculation but as we have stated previously, our team is working on ways to improve the voice control experience on Sonos,” a company spokesperson said to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
