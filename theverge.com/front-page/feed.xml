    <title>Netflix is getting a trilogy of Fear Street movies in July</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Fbmk8N"&gt;The ’90s are back in Netflix’s latest horror movies. A trilogy of movies based on R.L. Stine’s classic &lt;em&gt;Fear Street&lt;/em&gt; book series is coming to the streaming service in July. Plan your spooky movie nights accordingly: part one will debut on July 2nd, followed by sequels on the 9th and 16th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Spdn87"&gt;Here’s the basic premise, according to Netflix:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="TAQVDi"&gt;In 1994, a group of teenagers discovers that the terrifying events that have haunted their town for generations ​may all be connected — and that they may be the next targets. Based on  R.L. Stine’s best selling horror series, the trilogy follows the nightmare through Shadyside’s sinister history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DA0BKv"&gt;Each film will cover a different time period. The first will take place in 1994, while the sequels will explore 1978 and — of course — 1666.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3RNkx3"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Fear Street&lt;/em&gt; books originally debuted back in 1989 and served as a more teenage-oriented counterpart to the blockbuster and hugely influential &lt;em&gt;Goosebumps&lt;/em&gt; series, which helped make Stine a household name. Back in 2015, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/14/9519805/goosebumps-rl-stine-interview"&gt;Stine told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that “I never wanted to be scary, either. I only wanted to be funny.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces a slew of accessibility updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A person’s wrist showing an Apple Watch. On the screen of the Watch is an option to end a run, highlighted with a small cursor hovering over it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SWKaurK8b9bqtr9jfqXcQwibWgI=/100x0:880x520/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69312971/Screen_Shot_2021_05_19_at_2.42.32_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch with the Assistive Touch cursor.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/05/apple-previews-powerful-software-updates-designed-for-people-with-disabilities/" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R3hyNc"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F05%2Fapple-previews-powerful-software-updates-designed-for-people-with-disabilities%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F19%2F22444137%2Fapple-accessibility-updates-disabilities-iphone-ipad-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a variety of new and updated features for people with disabilities today. Beginning May 20th, customers can use the new SignTime sign language interpreter service to contact AppleCare and retail customer care through their web browsers. Software updates later this year to iOS, watchOS, and iPadOS will bring improved options for Assistive Touch, VoiceOver, hearing aid support, and background sounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="inBvEa"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We believe everyone should have the tools they need to change the world. Accessibility is a fundamental right, and we’re always pushing the boundaries of innovation so that everyone can learn, create and connect in new ways. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GAAD?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#GAAD&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/oZwQNG7p5x"&gt;https://t.co/oZwQNG7p5x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1395074896791674885?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OzzyD6"&gt;The new SignTime service is launching first in the US, UK, and France, and offers remote interpreter access for American Sign Language, British Sign Language, and French Sign Language. People can also use the service in Apple stores to get interpretation without booking it in advance, potentially preventing the hassle of wrangling an interpreter on short notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GElgH8"&gt;People with limb differences will be able to use Assistive Touch on watchOS, which should enable them to use Apple Watch without touching the screen. (Apple did not verify which Watches this will work for.) Apple says the Apple Watch can detect muscle movement and tendon activity through its built-in sensors, allowing users to control a cursor on the watch screen, answer calls, access notifications, and more by making various movements and gestures. (You can see it in action in the video &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F05%2Fapple-previews-powerful-software-updates-designed-for-people-with-disabilities%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F19%2F22444137%2Fapple-accessibility-updates-disabilities-iphone-ipad-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on this page&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gg8fFG"&gt;iPadOS will support third-party eye-tracking devices, allowing people with low mobility to move a cursor with their gaze and perform actions by holding eye contact, rather than tapping the screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGGMmo"&gt;VoiceOver, Apple’s built-in screen reader, will be updated to include more details in images. According to Apple, it will allow people to navigate images with text and data tables by rows and columns, and describe people and objects in images. People will also be able to add image descriptions with Markup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1OSdE9"&gt;Apple plans to upgrade the Made for iPhone hearing devices program, too, with support for bidirectional hearing aids. Users will also be able to upload their hearing test results to Headphone Accommodations to more easily customize how the feature amplifies sounds and adjusts different frequencies.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Three smiling Memojis, showing one with a cochlear implant on the left, one with nasal oxygen tubes in the center, and one with a soft helmet on the right." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xafYxYSX8o60kVdNupxHnTZbpls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526096/apple_gaad21_new_memoji_05192021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/e1e4026d-01e3-40da-bea5-aee0f1e19a09" target="_blank"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UCeQKs"&gt;For neurodiverse people (or anyone who likes white noise), Apple is introducing Background Sounds that can be incorporated with other audio and system sounds. They include “balanced, bright, or dark noise, as well as ocean, rain, or stream sounds” that can be set to play continuously and mask distracting or overwhelming noises.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="emW7wY"&gt;Other features Apple is planning for later in the year include the ability to use mouth sounds like clicks or pops instead of using physical buttons, the customization of display and text size settings in individual apps, and new Memoji options with cochlear implants, oxygen tubes, and soft helmets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNKugC"&gt;Companies large and small always have room for improvement when it comes to making their products accessible, but Apple has generally been a leader in the space. These updates hopefully signal a continued commitment to designing with disabled people in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IDofnN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qKNPY"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The level of Mac malware is not acceptable, says Apple’s Craig Federighi at Epic trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Key Speakers At The Apple Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NKC7LIxZ9HPRsGn7Ta9ZY_QK5yY=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69312798/967357020.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gjuVel"&gt;The antitrust case between Apple and Epic continued today, and it brought Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, to the stand. Federighi’s mission was pretty clear from the outset: to extol the security benefits that come with iOS’s walled-off ecosystem and warn of the dangers that would come with breaking the App Store model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTIwUX"&gt;But in building that argument, Federighi also made some surprisingly blunt concessions about security on macOS. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8fGp6j"&gt;“If you took Mac security techniques and applied them to the iOS ecosystem, with all those devices, all that value, it would get run over to a degree dramatically worse than is already happening on the Mac,” Federighi said in the testimony. “And as I say, today, we have a level of malware on the Mac that we don’t find acceptable and is much worse than iOS.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2XqAfB"&gt;Federighi made the claim as part of a broader argument for why iOS could not adopt the same software model as macOS, which allows for alternate software sources like the Epic Games Store. But in making the case for iOS security, the software chief ended up painting a bleak picture of security on the desktop platform. The full exchange is presented in context below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0ncbts"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Judge Rogers:&lt;/strong&gt; There are multiple stores on the Mac. So, if that can happen on the Mac, why should we not allow the same stores to exist on the phone?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gO2e1B"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Craig Federighi:&lt;/strong&gt; Yeah, it’s certainly how we’ve done it on the Mac and it’s regularly exploited on the Mac. iOS has established a dramatically higher bar for customer protection. The Mac is not meeting that bar today. And that’s despite the fact that Mac users inherently download less software and are subject to a way less economically motivated attacker base. If you took Mac security techniques and applied them to the iOS ecosystem, with all those devices, all that value, it would get run over to a degree dramatically worse than is already happening on the Mac. And as I say, today, we have a level of malware on the Mac that we don’t find acceptable and is much worse than iOS. Put that same situation in place for iOS and it would be a very bad situation for our customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="g1xvsS"&gt;Federighi also cast the difference between the two platforms in unusual terms, describing the desktop platform as something akin to a car. “If operated correctly, much like that car, if you know how to operate a car and obey the rules of the road and are very cautious, yes,” he said when asked directly whether macOS is safe. “If not, I’ve had a couple of family members who have gotten some malware on their Macs.” macOS allows software to be downloaded and installed from the web, but &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/protect-your-mac-from-malware-mh40596/mac"&gt;Apple advises customers&lt;/a&gt; that restricting this functionality to the App Store is “the most secure setting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UiPm6h"&gt;In contrast, Federighi presented iOS as a child-safe version of the less restricted macOS. “With iOS, we were able to create something where children — heck, even infants — are able to operate an iOS device and be safe in doing so. It’s really a different product,” Federighi said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BriuCU"&gt;Federighi’s testimony comes in the final days of the trial, with much of the remaining time devoted to testimony from Apple executives. CEO Tim Cook is expected to take the stand on Friday, with closing statements from both sides given on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can get a PS5 at GameStop right now (UPDATE: Sold Out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uHIqtjYCigW_LpsI9ak-P1e9_0Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69312642/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bJx4Fx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 19th, 2021 5:03 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;GameStop has sold out of both PS5 bundles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k2vD5L"&gt;GameStop has released some precious stock of the PS5 consoles, both for the $499.99 disc-based version and the disc-less model that costs $100 less. However, it’s offering them in bundles, as GameStop has been wont to do since the console launched late last year. Stock is coming in and out, as usual, so stay on the page if you want to ensure the best chance that you’ll get one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2cj0S3"&gt;You can get the disc-based console with &lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;MLB The Show 21&lt;/em&gt;, an extra DualSense controller, and a $20 GameStop gift card &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5-mlb-the-show-21-and-returnal-system-bundle-with-20-gamestop-gift-card%2FB225170K.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $729.99&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fUp5OE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10425629"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UauFSn"&gt;Alternatively, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fplaystation-5-digital-edition-with-ps-plus-system-bundle-with-20-gamestop-gift-card%2FB225171U.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the disc-less model comes in a $599.99 bundle&lt;/a&gt; that includes a second DualSense controller, a $20 GameStop gift card, a $50 credit for the PlayStation Store, and a one-year subscription to PS Plus for online gaming and complimentary downloads each month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jOKl1L"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10425625"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="N8HQ6j"&gt;If you want some extra games and accessories for your (hopefully) new PS5, check out some suggestions below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Yxm7hx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9562978"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div id="GMMtiU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499071"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Ts4GsD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226091"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Here’s Anker’s apology after 712 Eufy customers had camera feeds exposed to strangers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Qn69jZgQxCRLhfiFXhrwiKd2eKk=/824x0:1814x660/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69312547/191106_165716_9.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Anker/Eufy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wMQrSX"&gt;Eufy has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EufyOfficial/status/1395064482804731907"&gt;put out a statement&lt;/a&gt; apologizing for a glitch that occurred two days ago, allowing some Eufy home security camera users &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440298/eufy-privacy-glitch-server-error-camera-feed-exposed"&gt;to see video from other users’ homes&lt;/a&gt;. The statement explains that it happened during a software update, but the company claims it only affected a small number of users: just 712 people across the US, Canada, Mexico, Cuba, New Zealand, Australia, and Argentina. Eufy says that the issue was fixed with an emergency update less than two hours after it was identified.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yW8k7P"&gt;In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Eufy confirmed that “users were able to access video feeds from other users’ cameras.” However, in its official statement &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EufyOfficial/status/1395064482804731907"&gt;posted to Twitter&lt;/a&gt; (which can be viewed in full below), Eufy doesn’t explain what the bug actually was. It does say it’s working to keep this from happening again in the future, by upgrading its network and the authentication mechanisms between the cameras, servers, and app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D7wezI"&gt;The initial reports of the bug &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EufyCam/comments/neayuo/access_to_random_cameras_in_another_country/"&gt;came from Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, with users reporting that they were able to see and control the live feeds from all the Eufy cameras in someone else’s home, as well as see any previously recorded footage and the other user’s email address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZ1vq9"&gt;Eufy suggests that that users in the affected countries (listed above) should unplug then replug their security home base, then log out of the Eufy security app before logging back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRijJ9"&gt;The full statement is below: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dYJfOC"&gt;During a software update performed on our server in the United States on May 17th at 4:50 AM EDT, a bug occurred affecting a limited number of users in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Cuba, New Zealand, Australia, and Argentina. Users in Europe and other regions remain unaffected. Our engineering team identified the issue at 5:30 AM EDT and immediately rolled back the server version and deployed an emergency update. The incident was fixed at 6:30 AM EDT. We have confirmed that a total of 712 users were affected in this case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Oe4M8"&gt;Although the issue has been resolved, we recommend users in the affected countries (US, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, New Zealand, Australia, and Cuba) to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9au7fl"&gt;- Please unplug and then reconnect the eufy security home base.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z39RaK"&gt;- Log out of the eufy security app and log in again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4PojYd"&gt;All of our user video data is stored locally on the users’ devices. As a service provider, eufy provides account management, device management, and remote P2P access for users through AWS servers. All stored data and account information is encrypted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yNDzFS"&gt;In order to avoid this happening in the future, we are taking the following steps:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qCfptt"&gt;- We are upgrading our network architecture and strengthening our two-way authentication mechanism between the servers, devices, and the eufy Security app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wjfd36"&gt;- We are upgrading our servers to improve their processing capacity in order to eliminate potential risks.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>11 things we know about the new smartwatch OS from Google and Samsung — and some we don’t</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ESs1F_Zl_AyG-xjOgNOkUM36xkg=/23x0:1592x1046/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69312329/Screen_Shot_2021_05_19_at_1.48.00_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BJLmvt"&gt;Yesterday brought the momentous news that Google and Samsung will merge together their Wear OS and Tizen-based smartwatch platforms into a single operating system. The new software is currently being referred to as Wear, but that name could change as we get closer to the first devices that will ship with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rkqJBd"&gt;The unified platform is intended to give Android smartwatches a huge boost and much simpler strategy. It will also allow developers to create apps and widgets for a single OS instead of splitting their efforts between Wear OS and Tizen. A lot of this is spelled out in more detail in the below video, but let’s also focus on the big highlights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3d2POI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kYIb9g1r4lw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PCl44B"&gt;It’s going to be faster than Wear OS&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6mEUO8"&gt;Speed and responsiveness were one of the major talking points when Google and Samsung made this announcement during the I/O 2021 keynote. The companies are claiming that apps open up to 30 percent faster than they currently do on Wear OS. Google also promises “smooth user interface animations and motion,” which hasn’t always been a strength of Wear OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="V5mrLs"&gt;Battery life will be a step up, too&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="a5Ap1m"&gt;Samsung’s smartwatches were already routinely outlasting Wear OS products, so this doesn’t come as a surprise. The company is lending Google some hardware expertise to ensure better stamina. “Samsung implemented our best technology to provide optimized performances, and advanced sensor batching and low power display technology to ensure an efficient and long-lasting battery,” &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/a-new-era-of-smartwatch-innovation-starts-here/"&gt;Samsung’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Janghyun Yoon wrote&lt;/a&gt; after Tuesday’s news. &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/wear-os/wear-io21/"&gt;Google’s Bjorn Kilburn said&lt;/a&gt; customers can expect “handy optimizations like the ability to run the heart rate sensor continuously during the day, track your sleep overnight and still have battery for the next day.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s57RXPu8xV8gdBssRwTANsqbDbw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22523438/Screen_Shot_2021_05_18_at_2.31.35_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="U7FD3y"&gt;The next Samsung Galaxy Watch will run Wear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1vPwBI"&gt;Samsung has confirmed that its next smartwatch — and all others in the pipeline — will run the unified Wear platform. But the company made sure to note that it will bring over some of its popular hardware elements, like the rotating bezel mechanism. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eSi1MG"&gt;A standalone Google Maps app will do turn-by-turn directions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="USphat"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-wear-os-io-samsung-fitbit-partnership/"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, we learned that there are plans for a Google Maps app on Wear that features “a new user interface that will also work even if your phone is not with you.” That hints at cellular data support on the new unified platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7HbPmQ"&gt;Spotify and YouTube Music apps will support offline downloads&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KJQ7bt"&gt;Spotify already allows owners of Samsung smartwatches to download songs for offline listening, and now that same convenience &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442880/spotify-youtube-music-download-offline-playlists-podcasts-updates"&gt;will be extended to Wear&lt;/a&gt;. That’s one thing Spotify for the Apple Watch still doesn’t do. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xN1lTr"&gt;Google also confirmed that YouTube Music will be available on Wear. Like Spotify, it’ll include full support for offline listening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dj07Co"&gt;Fitbit activity tracking will be built into the platform&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gLK3qO"&gt;Having completed its acquisition of Fitbit at the start of this year, Google will now integrate some of the brand’s health and activity tracking features into Wear. Future premium Fitbit wearables will also run the unified platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gccHxx"&gt;Device makers will be able to customize the look and feel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="i7v57H"&gt;Google tried to emphasize on Tuesday that this platform isn’t just intended for itself and Samsung. “All device makers will be able to add a customized user experience on top of the platform,” Kilburn said. That’s going to prove important if Google wants to keep companies like Garmin on board with the new platform. And we can’t forget about the many traditional watchmakers — Fossil, Citizen, TAG Heuer, and others — that have gotten behind Wear OS in recent years in the absence of a flagship smartwatch from Google.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="j0uZLt"&gt;Apps should be faster and easier to develop with new APIs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="chEw9f"&gt;Wear’s apps will use the latest Android development techniques like Jetpack and Kotlin to help reach the best possible performance. Google is also promising to make life easier for app makers with new APIs that cover Tiles, health services, watchfaces, complications, and more. And an activity indicator will show when certain functions are running in the background. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XyPTaD"&gt;Some Wear OS smartwatches might get upgraded to Wear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="q2OdZD"&gt;There aren’t any firm promises yet, but Google at least didn’t outright say existing products &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; be updated to the new OS. The company told &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/18/wear-os-revamp-current-models/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, “we will have more updates to share on timelines once the new version launches later this year.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qPkD6H"&gt;Samsung will not update Galaxy Watch models to Wear&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8uudYx"&gt;Samsung will not be updating its Galaxy Watch line to Wear, but says it has no intention of leaving its current customers in the dust once it starts releasing Wear hardware. “For customers who already own the Tizen OS based Galaxy smartwatches, we are continuing to provide at least three years of software support after the product launch,” the &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/editorial-a-new-era-of-smartwatch-innovation-starts-here?utm_source=mainkv&amp;amp;utm_medium=internal"&gt;company said Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;. However, it seems plausible there will be more than a few features and new Wear tricks that will never make their way to older Galaxy smartwatches.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wjuRQV"&gt;Samsung will bring over its watchface designer tool&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Cupd81"&gt;Some people out there really care about having a good watchface selection on a pricey smartwatch. Google and Samsung are promising a wide mix of styles, and Samsung told Wired its design tool — and many of the company’s own signature watchfaces — will be available on Wear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="71558Q"&gt;The unknowns&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ekd1iU"&gt;Google and Samsung shared a decent chunk of information on day one, but we’re still left without answers to a few important questions. We should learn more details over the summer as we head into fall hardware season.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="PhmIyB"&gt;When will the first Wear smartwatch be available?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sVmmhq"&gt;Is the underlying operating system closer to Wear OS or closer to Tizen? (Considering that developers will be using Android tools to build apps, it seems like the former.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wNbgne"&gt;Will there be required helper apps like some of Samsung’s watches have needed?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="kwdrOg"&gt;Is Wear going to continue offering some semblance of iOS support?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eglWmQ"&gt;What’s going to happen to Samsung Pay and Bixby? Are they both goners on the wrist?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>HBO Max is getting new animated Batman and Superman shows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LSHw-Vvq6qCX8PHFxbbZ1xsS8NQ=/0x35:696x499/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69312306/Untitled.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YhjVg8"&gt;HBO Max is getting a pair of new animated DC shows: &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/hbo-max-and-cartoon-network-make-series-commitment-batman-caped-crusader"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Batman: The Caped Crusader&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://pressroom.warnermedia.com/us/media-release/cartoon-network-9/hbo-max-and-cartoon-network-take-flight-series-commitment-my-adventures-superman"&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Adventures with Superman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, WarnerMedia announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iXofpd"&gt;The two shows appear pretty different in tone. &lt;em&gt;The Caped Crusader&lt;/em&gt;, coming from a team that includes J.J. Abrams, Matt Reeves (the director of the upcoming &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt;), and Bruce Timm (one of the co-creators of the fan-favorite &lt;em&gt;Batman: The Animated Series&lt;/em&gt;) promises a noir-ish “reimagining” of the character. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MXO5Ov"&gt;“The series will be thrilling, cinematic and evocative of Batman’s noir roots, while diving deeper into the psychology of these iconic characters,” Abrams, Reeves, and Timm commented in a joint announcement. The teaser poster showcasing the art style for the series seems to back up the darker tone, with a grim-looking Batman (with an old-school pointed ear cowl) staring down at Gotham City.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PAwGbLPKkJsvryswR9QkjddiRZY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526037/Batman_Caped_Crusader_Promo_Poster_May_2021_01.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OpSIC7"&gt;On the flip side of the thematic coin is &lt;em&gt;My Adventures with Superman&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;which will follow the 20-something lives of Clark Kent (Jack Quaid), Lois Lane (Alice Lee), and Jimmy Olsen as they collectively start their journalism careers, fall in love, and for Clark, start his burgeoning career as the Man of Steel. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qiHdXVai8CgqqaGrYrq_wOkCwu8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22526046/WBA_Superman_Image_copy.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UAptqG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;My Adventures with Superman &lt;/em&gt;has already been ordered for two seasons and will be executive produced by Sam Register (&lt;em&gt;Teen Titans Go!&lt;/em&gt;), Jake Wyatt (&lt;em&gt;Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus&lt;/em&gt;), and Brendan Clogher (&lt;em&gt;Voltron: Legendary Defender&lt;/em&gt;). And based on the promotional image, expect it to fit in the mode of those more family-friendly animated shows. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O17csq"&gt;The fact that WarnerMedia is looking to expand its animated superhero portfolio isn’t a surprise: the streaming company has already found success with shows like &lt;em&gt;Harley Quinn &lt;/em&gt;(which, like &lt;em&gt;Caped Crusader&lt;/em&gt;, is co-created by Bruce Timm), originally on DC Universe and then later on HBO Max after the company consolidated content there. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T’s Discovery deal is about taking on Disney Plus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8MV96KZE6xTaolfn7ZKcHADa4m0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69312297/acastro_200602_1777_HBOMax_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y8uraA"&gt;Early Monday morning, AT&amp;amp;T announced a sudden change in direction: it reached an agreement to spin off WarnerMedia — the conglomerate of Warner Bros., HBO, CNN, DC Comics, and more — into a new company to be merged with Discovery. While Discovery’s roster of the Cooking Channel, Travel Channel, and Food Network is a whole lot less exciting than WarnerMedia’s lineup of &lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Harry Potter&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, the combined company brings together the components needed to build a new streaming giant. And it’s already clear that this new Discovery-Warner hybrid has Disney in its sights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UCK6GL"&gt;“It’s a combination of bulking up both sides of the business, creating a more compelling direct-to-consumer offering for HBO Max or Discovery Plus,” Neil Macker, an equity analyst at Morningstar, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="w5GCNf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;WarnerMedia emerges as the biggest winner&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dM9zBO"&gt;WarnerMedia has done well so far. Its streaming platform, HBO Max, hit 64 million subscribers a year after it launched. But it’s only around half the size of Disney Plus (which is about a year and a half old) and a third the size of Netflix. And AT&amp;amp;T, it seemed, didn’t have the sustained interest to see it overtake them. AT&amp;amp;T CEO John Stankey &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SquawkStreet/status/1394297818723016710"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Squawk on the Street&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on Monday that WarnerMedia needed a home where shareholders would be willing to “take that ride” to see the company grow as big as it could.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KM4jOO"&gt;The basics of the deal make sense for AT&amp;amp;T. A telecom company was never going to do a stellar job running a media arm (see: Verizon and Yahoo, AOL and Time Warner, the Snyder Cut), and it can use cash from the sale to help build out its still very-much-in-the-works 5G network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCeuCV"&gt;But WarnerMedia may be the bigger winner. It gets out from under the &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/richard-plepler-leaving-hbo-27-years-cable-giant-1191494/"&gt;rocky leadership&lt;/a&gt; of AT&amp;amp;T, and it becomes the star of the new business. It’s a far bigger company than Discovery, with $30.4 billion in 2020 in revenue to Discovery’s $10.7 billion. And Discovery is ready to spend big on content to let WarnerMedia match its rivals: it’s planning to put $20 billion per year toward content, a number rivaling Netflix ($17 billion) and exceeding Disney (which plans to hit $14–16 billion by 2024).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zruxtx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Aiming to double Netflix in subscribers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i8Tesj"&gt;Even before the new investment, the companies’ combined content library offers advantages for both sides. The new company will bring together WarnerMedia’s roster of pop culture phenomena — the types of major shows and movies known to drive signups — with Discovery’s deep well of reality shows, which “do well on streaming platforms,” Macker says, and tend to be useful for retaining subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4knLjk"&gt;In interview after interview this week, Discovery CEO David Zaslav mentioned WarnerMedia’s big properties — &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Sex and the City &lt;/em&gt;came up a lot — and praised the fact that the company had the rights to show those titles themselves. The combined company won’t be entirely at the whims of ever-shifting content deals that can make top titles vanish from streaming services month to month, and it can guarantee a steady roster of hits, much like Disney Plus offers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7P6607"&gt;“The other thing we have that some of those companies don’t have,” Zaslav &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CNBC/status/1394305919299751947"&gt;told CNBC&lt;/a&gt;, is “great, great IP.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TEqkxb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Discovery still needs to sell investors on its plan&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EGANFm"&gt;That’s a significant leg up on Netflix, which doesn’t have a long list of iconic properties. And it’s hard not to hear Zaslav taking aim at Disney when &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BloombergTV/status/1394380620567035907"&gt;he tells &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that the acquisition “makes us a real formidable global IP business to compete with the best in the business.” (Already, the former head of Disney Plus has been &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/05/18/ex-tiktok-ceo-seen-as-contender-for-discovery-warnermedia-streaming/"&gt;rumored as a contender&lt;/a&gt; to run the combined company.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fuwijm"&gt;Zaslav’s goals are big. On CNBC, he discussed hitting “2-, 3-, 400 million homes over the long term,” a number that would double what Netflix has today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bpBmsX"&gt;There’s more to that plan than just building an enormous Disney Plus competitor. Across the TV and film industry, revenues are starting to shift to streaming. But Discovery still has a huge TV business that it plans to keep growing. The company has been working to expand its news and sports channels throughout Europe (Zaslav suggested CNN could play a part in that), and the addition of WarnerMedia’s shows and channels will let Discovery “super-serve advertisers” and sell its content as a bundle on cable, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Hy7vzR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s the same strategy, just bigger than before&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rKQuDS"&gt;Macker says that’s the same strategy Disney is taking: using its existing successful businesses — in Disney’s case, ESPN, movie studios, and soon, theme parks once again — to build out its next area of growth. “All those parts generate cash,” he says. “You’re investing in direct-to-consumer for long term growth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WPFlz"&gt;WarnerMedia and Discovery still face serious challenges. Most immediately, it seems likely that WarnerMedia could face a leadership vacuum while the deal is under review, with the company’s CEO &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/17/business/jason-kilar-warnermedia.html?partner=slack&amp;amp;smid=sl-share"&gt;reportedly seeking an exit&lt;/a&gt;. And while Discovery is eager to build a streaming giant, it ultimately won’t be up to Discovery’s current leadership and shareholders. AT&amp;amp;T shareholders will own most of the combined company, so Zaslav will need to sell them on this investment — an investment that Stankey suggested AT&amp;amp;T investors weren’t sure about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ddAars"&gt;Mostly, combining the two companies seems to be a bet that the current streaming landscape — with an assortment of large and small streamers — isn’t going to last much longer. Combining WarnerMedia and Discovery is about surviving the crash that may destroy smaller services and emerging stronger on the other side. The two companies aren’t promising to do anything special or unique: they’re just going to do what they’re already doing — but together and bigger. That’s good news if you want to subscribe to fewer services at once, though it’ll be some time before we know if it’ll lead to better shows.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford F-150 Lightning announcement: how to watch the electric pickup truck’s debut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wQLXBw-FcFtKmBUezm5njyOyt4o=/590x0:6961x4247/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69312135/Lightning_16x9.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u6tXBf"&gt;Ford is getting ready to pull the curtain back on its latest electric vehicle. The F-150 Lightning, the electric version of the automaker’s bestselling pickup truck, will take center stage at Ford’s headquarters in Dearborn, MI, at 9:30PM ET on Wednesday, May 19th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aYskvW"&gt;Ford says there will be “30+ ways to watch across physical and digital destinations,” including live streams on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yjisj5T0VqE"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1390749496494022657"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ford/posts/10159043571770049"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. The event will also be broadcast in several public locations like Times Square in New York City and Las Vegas Boulevard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="B4xdiH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“30+ ways to watch across physical and digital destinations”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CZRjPe"&gt;It’s a lot of hoopla for a truck that’s been in the works for over four years and has already been seen publicly, with and without camouflage. We got our first real look at the F-150 Lightning &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22442415/ford-f150-lightning-electric-pickup-truck-first-images"&gt;during President Joe Biden’s visit&lt;/a&gt; to the Ford Rouge Electric Vehicle Center in Michigan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QsSUTV"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yjisj5T0VqE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Qmwl97"&gt;Still, most of the relevant specs are being kept under wraps (although Biden let slip that he believed the 0-60mph time to be a little more than four seconds). Details like battery size, range, trim levels, and price should be on the bill for the Wednesday evening event. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAnwzh"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441793/ford-f150-lightning-announcement-rumors-specs-details"&gt;Ford has a lot riding on the F-150 Lightning&lt;/a&gt;. It’s the company’s second major mass-market EV, after the Mustang Mach-E, and its first battery-powered pickup truck. Ford has said it would spend $22 billion over the next five years on electric vehicles — or a little more than half of what the company makes in revenue in one year of F-series sales. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New Dark Patterns tip line lets you report evil tech company menus</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jqIJld"&gt;If you’re ever annoyed by a website or app trying to trick you by using small text, brightly colored buttons, or tricky toggles, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CRAdvocacy/status/1395031496671567875?s=20"&gt;there’s a new tip line&lt;/a&gt; you can use to report the bad behavior, run by Consumer Reports and &lt;a href="https://darkpatternstipline.org/about"&gt;other advocacy groups&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://darkpatternstipline.org"&gt;Dark Patterns Tip Line&lt;/a&gt; aims to collect various examples of dark patterns, defined by the website as “design tactics used in websites and apps to persuade you into doing things you probably would not do otherwise,” and use those examples to fight back against the companies that are behaving poorly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ek59iR"&gt;Even if you’ve never heard the term “dark pattern” before, you’ve likely come across one. Consumer Reports provides a list of examples in a tweet, and on the tip line’s site, but there are entire websites (like &lt;a href="https://www.darkpatterns.org"&gt;darkpatterns.org&lt;/a&gt;) and subreddits dedicated to showing examples from across the internet. Former president Donald Trump’s campaign &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/3/22365952/trump-dark-patterns-trick-supporters-recurring-donation-winred-gary-coby"&gt;even used them to trick supporters&lt;/a&gt; into donating way more than they intended.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gwHDut"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DarkPattern?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DarkPattern&lt;/a&gt; examples:&lt;br&gt;-You can’t exit an ad because the “X” is so small&lt;br&gt;-You try to buy something and a site sneaks an extra item into your cart &lt;br&gt;-You’re forced to provide your phone number to register a new account&lt;br&gt;-You’re silently charged for a subscription after a trial ends&lt;/p&gt;— Consumer Reports Advocacy (@CRAdvocacy) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CRAdvocacy/status/1395031498584215556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ju2Lo"&gt;There has been some legislation around dark patterns, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333506/california-bans-dark-patterns-opt-out-selling-data"&gt;California banning ones&lt;/a&gt; that trick users into giving away private information earlier this year, but it’s still an area where government has been slow to step in. Consumer Reports hopes to, in part, use the submissions from the tip line as evidence when speaking to lawmakers. It also hopes the site will help inform consumers about how to avoid the unscrupulous designs, and hold companies accountable for their actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nk65Bt"&gt;If you want to see other people’s submissions to the tip line, you can go to its &lt;a href="https://darkpatternstipline.org/sightings"&gt;Sightings page&lt;/a&gt;, and if you have a submission yourself, you can go to &lt;a href="https://darkpatternstipline.org/report"&gt;the Report page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSVzsv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; A previous version of this article identified the group behind the site as Consumer Reports Advocacy, which is just a Twitter handle for Consumer Reports’ advocacy work. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
