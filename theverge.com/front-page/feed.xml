    <title>Facebook and Ray-Ban tease smart glasses announcement on September 9th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Facebook / Ray-Ban teaser" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9ArHqJ2WAgZGu1vSK8DByEgMorw=/17x0:1673x1104/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69826334/Screen_Shot_2021_09_07_at_1.22.11_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Ray-Ban&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DkdOX9"&gt;Facebook and Ray-Ban are teasing an announcement around their upcoming smart glasses on September 9th. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ray-ban.com%2Fusa%2Fc%2Fray-ban-facebook&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F7%2F22661109%2Ffacebook-ray-ban-luxottica-smart-glasses-teaser" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Ray-Ban posted&lt;/a&gt; a promotional page with a silhouette of a pair of glasses, the date “09.09 2021,” and the text “sign up now to get your release notification” — although it doesn’t specify whether that’s news &lt;em&gt;about&lt;/em&gt; the release or the release itself. Ray-Ban’s homepage also promises that “this is one story you’re going to want to follow,” plausibly a reference to &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/learn/lessons/facebook-stories-creators"&gt;Facebook Stories&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNuXT2"&gt;The announcement coincides with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1434947706393223168"&gt;some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/boztank/status/1435285259503898625"&gt;apparent&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/4/videos/282323160005193/"&gt;teaser&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/4/videos/2316429598489106/"&gt;videos&lt;/a&gt; from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and virtual and augmented reality head Andrew Bosworth. The posts show point-of-view video clips from Bosworth and Zuckerberg, including Bosworth playing golf and Zuckerberg paddling a boat — all of it seemingly designed to highlight physically active and all-weather scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5ReXHQ"&gt;
&lt;div class="iframely-embed"&gt;&lt;div class="iframely-responsive" style="padding-bottom: 56.2%;"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/4/videos/2316429598489106/" data-iframely-url="https://cdn.iframe.ly/api/iframe?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2F4%2Fvideos%2F2316429598489106%2F&amp;amp;key=9ef4a209439e42bc59783ba959d50197"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://cdn.iframe.ly/embed.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jomKcu"&gt;Facebook has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599599/facebook-ray-ban-smart-glasses-next-product-launch-specs"&gt;called its glasses&lt;/a&gt;, developed in partnership with Ray-Ban parent company EssilorLuxottica, a stepping stone toward “full augmented reality glasses.” Zuckerberg confirmed in July that the glasses would be Facebook’s next hardware launch, although he didn’t announce a date at that time. He specified that the glasses would “have [Ray-Ban’s] iconic form factor, and they let you do some pretty neat things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDvjjS"&gt;The glasses are part of a larger Facebook initiative to build glasses that augment the world visually and aurally. But they won’t have features that are commonly associated with AR glasses like the ability to project images into the environment. Facebook is likely also saving its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338008/facebook-reality-labs-emg-wristbands-ctrl-labs-ar-interface-demo"&gt;neural wristband technology&lt;/a&gt; — which it sees as the future of AR interaction — for a later release.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Matrix: Resurrections teases a full trailer on Thursday with a familiar choice</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2oBm1-riCf--nu7govJyyU2i-no=/95x0:1466x914/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69826307/Screen_Shot_2021_09_07_at_9.43.48_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9t2dtu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Matrix: Resurrections &lt;/em&gt;is still a ways off &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/08/matrix-4-trailer-unveiled-during-warner-bros-cinemacon-reel-1234821127/"&gt;with a premier date of December 22nd, 2021&lt;/a&gt;, but you can watch two (and maybe more) teasers for the highly anticipated film today, in advance of a full trailer on Thursday. The teasers appear on the recently revived &lt;a href="https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/"&gt;“What is The Matrix” website&lt;/a&gt;, gated by the film franchise’s all too familiar choice — red pill or blue pill?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaAcwt"&gt;The red pill teaser, after pushing through recognizable threads of vertical green scrolling code, makes immediate callbacks to the revolutionary conflict at the heart of the series, with clips of what looks like returning star Carrie-Anne Moss as Trinity, Keanu Reeves as Neo, and new cast member Yahya Abdul-Mateen II. A voiceover directed at you, the viewer, notes the real-life time of day, and how “it could be this is the first day of the rest of your life, but if you want it, you gotta fight for it.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/If4JgbcxDTvzSAucltT2Z2NNPn0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22831811/Screen_Shot_2021_09_07_at_9.48.02_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Warner Bros. Pictures&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;I could not tell you what’s happening here other than it looks sick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UwPXVD"&gt;The blue pill teaser, featuring the vocal stylings of another new cast member, Jonathan Groff, admonishes you for “losing the capacity to discern reality from fiction” along with clips of copious amounts of blue pills. “It becomes a problem when fantasies endanger us. We don’t want anyone to get hurt, do we?” Groff’s voicer concludes. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cplTwrHVLpvD9XcdeSeXpq6fqv0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22831812/Screen_Shot_2021_09_07_at_9.49.44_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Warner Bros. Pcitures&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prescription blue Matrix pills?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EWfHWR"&gt;The teasers don’t offer a whole lot to go on, but they are admittedly very exciting. Not just because Warner Bros. has apparently jerry-rigged a way for the teaser to somewhat robotically call out the time of day wherever you are, but also because the teasers themselves seem somewhat fluid, slotting in new clips — Keanu’s hand here, Groff smiling smugly at a city skyline there — depending on the time of day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M5kK16"&gt;You can see all the variations of the teasers yourself by heading to &lt;a href="https://thechoiceisyours.whatisthematrix.com/"&gt;The Matrix website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose takes on the Sonos Arc with its first Dolby Atmos soundbar</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P_f4xbsGxhrwcp3V1QHVdiRwc7s=/30x0:1578x1032/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69826172/bose.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Bose&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6037E6"&gt;Fresh off the announcement of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648407/bose-qc45-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;QuietComfort 45 headphones&lt;/a&gt; last week, Bose is shifting some attention to its home theater business. Today, the company introduced its latest flagship soundbar, the $899.95 Smart Soundbar 900. With features like Dolby Atmos — a first for Bose soundbars — HDMI eARC, multi-room Wi-Fi music playback, AirPlay 2, and support for both Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant, Bose’s latest soundbar seems very much intended to compete with the Sonos Arc. (It also allows for streaming audio over Bluetooth, which the Sonos does not.) It’ll be available starting September 23rd, with preorders beginning now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dp3HcG"&gt;Bose claims the Smart Soundbar 900 “produces a layer of realism no other speaker can duplicate” thanks to the company’s proprietary “PhaseGuide” technology that enhances positional audio. “When there’s no Dolby Atmos content, the horizontal spatial effects are just as effective, and Bose TrueSpace technology takes over for the vertical experience, remixing signals to add ‘height’ without adding a ceiling speaker,” the company said in its &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.bose.com/en_us/pressroom/featured/Bose-introduces-the-smart-soundbar-900.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DEsX9bjBqd0D1nBzBqmISXYunRs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22831798/Screen_Shot_2021_09_07_at_12.46.04_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Bose&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YIF8JH"&gt;Similar to the Sonos Arc, the Smart Soundbar 900 attaches to your TV with a single HDMI (or optical) cable; there’s no HDMI passthrough support offered here, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22623242/sony-ht-a7000-soundbar-review-dolby-atmos-xbox-series-x-ps5"&gt;unlike Sony’s latest premium Atmos sound systems&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ru3tRp"&gt;The Smart Soundbar 900 will be available in black or white, with a wraparound metal grille and glass top surface that includes capacitive touch controls. You’ll also notice the upward-firing Atmos drivers cut into each side of that top glass. For an optimal surround experience, Bose’s soundbar is compatible with the company’s existing rear speakers and subwoofers, but that’ll of course drive the price of the total package up quite a bit higher. You can also enable private listening with headphones like the aforementioned QC45s. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>VW’s ID Life concept teases a truly affordable electric car</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4k8c6ilw59pUhZQtugddvnxfksA=/7x0:4090x2722/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69825965/vw_volkswagen_id_life_0050.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Volkswagen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7WBGje"&gt;One of Volkswagen’s latest concept cars teases what will eventually be the most affordable entry in its lineup of ID-branded electric vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z46OC2"&gt;Revealed at the IAA Mobility conference in Munich, Germany over the weekend, the &lt;a href="https://www.volkswagen-newsroom.com/en/press-releases/a-look-ahead-to-entry-level-electric-mobility-world-premiere-of-the-id-life-7490"&gt;ID Life&lt;/a&gt; concept is a boxy little four-door compact car that’s actually more reminiscent of the overly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/10/20858725/honda-e-price-launch-date-battery-range"&gt;cute Honda E&lt;/a&gt; than its more streamlined ID siblings. It won’t go on sale until 2025 (meaning we’re likely at least two years away from seeing the final production version), but when it does, VW says it will cost around €20,000 (roughly $24,000). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2XymBv"&gt;That is an incredibly aggressive price tag, and it’s one of two big reasons VW (and the larger Volkswagen Group) has spent so many billions of dollars developing the modular “MEB” electric vehicle platform. Being able to power multiple cars at different price points with the same underlying technology is allowing the automaker to eventually charge far less for what should still be a capable EV without taking a total financial bath on the project. (The other reason was Dieselgate.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="1wO3AC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10739087"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXlS2j"&gt;The ID Life concept will use a 57kWh capacity version of the MEB battery pack, which VW says can last for around 400 kilometers (about 250 miles) on the European WLTP testing cycle. A potent 172kW motor (roughly 230 horsepower) will sit on the front axle — the ID Life will be the first MEB car with front-wheel drive — and can move the compact from 0 to 100 kilometers per hour in just under seven seconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cyrNPZ"&gt;A lot can happen in the next four years, but those specs are actually better than the current base model of the ID 3, VW’s current entry-level, Golf-style electric vehicle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d5TEVT"&gt;The inside of the ID Life is sparse. There’s a yoke-style steering wheel with touch-sensitive buttons, and there’s no standard dashboard display — instead, VW imagines owners will drop their own phone or tablet onto the wooden dash and let those devices run the infotainment system. (There’s also a wireless charging... sleeve, or pocket, in the fabric of the driver’s side door.) The rear bench seat is small, and the front trunk is also tiny, as it appears the front passenger foot well takes up much of the space under the hood that isn’t occupied by the electric motor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZOk3OW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;400km of range and 230HP — which would be better than the base model ID 3&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UOaDyC"&gt;Of course this wouldn’t be a good concept car without at least one ridiculous idea, which VW conveniently supplies in the form of an integrated projector and a projection screen that extends up from the dash — the idea being that you could fold the front seats down and watch a movie or play video games from the ID Life’s back bench seat. (VW even says there’s a video game console included, though it doesn’t actually name one.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zAj9Hl"&gt;Lastly, VW is promoting the idea of using lots of natural and recycled materials with the ID Life concept. There are wood chips in the exterior paint for coloring. The roof and hood are made of recycled PET bottles. The tires are made of “[b]io-oil, natural rubber and rice husks.” These are very popular ideas in concept cars, but recyclable materials are still only slowly making their way into production vehicles, so it’s anyone’s guess how much of this makes it into the real ID Life that will hit the road in 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hl9pZJ"&gt;Truly affordable electric cars have been elusive to date (outside of China, at least). Tesla spent years promising a $35,000 Model 3, but never totally delivered on that promise.  (Its cheapest cars now cost around $40,000.) The latest electric Mini starts at around $30,000, and some other varsity EVs like the Hyundai Kona and Chevy Bolt are &lt;a href="https://www.kbb.com/car-news/2022-hyundai-kona-price-drop-for-electric-increase-for-gas-power/"&gt;inching close to that price tag&lt;/a&gt; — though those two have also dealt with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22648922/gm-chevy-bolt-ev-production-halt-recall-fire-risk"&gt;massive recalls&lt;/a&gt; regarding the LG batteries around which they’re built. Every major automaker has a new EV or two (or three) coming in the next few years, but VW is probably the best bet to make something as affordable and capable as it’s promising with the ID Life.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s next event will take place on September 14th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g6KJjpaLhijvXuY5dfQzgmxvwCc=/160x0:1888x1152/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69825825/2048.5.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A promo image for Apple’s next event.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mi8lMi"&gt;Apple’s next big fall event will take place on Tuesday, September 14th at 1PM ET, the company announced. The event, which carries the tagline “California streaming,” will be &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-events%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F7%2F22648593%2Fapple-fall-event-2021-date-iphone-macbook-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;another virtual event broadcast from Apple Park&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XbnFMY"&gt;The company typically announces the year’s new iPhones at the fall event, and this year’s entry is expected to be &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/26/iphone-13-name-emerges-on-packaging-stickers/"&gt;called the iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;. The new series of phones will apparently come in the same sizes as the iPhone 12, but a headline feature for some models could be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307312/iphone-13-smaller-notch-high-refresh-rate-screen-hole-punch-foldable-se-5g"&gt;high refresh rate screens&lt;/a&gt;, finally delivering tech that has been available on many Android phones. The new phones are also expected to have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576703/iphone-13-rumors-sizes-notch-camera-processor"&gt;smaller display notches and improved cameras&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J82zDV"&gt;It’s hard to pull specific clues from Apple’s static event invite, though the darkening sky might suggest we’ll see improved night mode photography. And perhaps the glowing Apple logo is hinting toward an always-on lock screen for the iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J4UgAWCq6RCbnWlhN0s2leytPyE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22831676/Screen_Shot_2021_09_07_at_9.05.16_AM.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The full invite image for Apple’s September 14th event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eLBk7X"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gregjoz/status/1435272731746979840"&gt;A video from Greg Joswiak&lt;/a&gt;, Apple’s SVP of worldwide marketing, has a bit more to analyze. The video goes inside an AR Apple logo, and inside the Apple, you can see the same horizon from the static invite. Eventually, though, the perspective shifts up to linger on the stars above. That could suggest that the new iPhone could have an astrophotography mode, like what Google has offered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/28/22203782/google-removes-wide-angle-astrophotography-pixel-4a-5g-5"&gt;with some Pixel phones&lt;/a&gt;, or that Apple will discuss &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22649340/apple-iphone-13-satellite-connectivity-emergency"&gt;rumored satellite link features for iPhones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="5K2lRf"&gt;If you want to see the landscape inside the Apple logo for yourself, you can, as long as you’re on an iOS device. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-events%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F7%2F22648593%2Fapple-fall-event-2021-date-iphone-macbook-watch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;On Apple’s event site&lt;/a&gt;, tap on the event logo and the glowy AR Apple event logo will render in the world around you. Once you see the logo, you can go “through” the logo to see the virtual landscape and night sky as well as the event date.

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Definitely the best &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AppleEvent?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AppleEvent&lt;/a&gt; AR Easter egg so far &lt;a href="https://t.co/RxEMEGCTEN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/RxEMEGCTEN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Guilherme Rambo (@_inside) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_inside/status/1435279519942778881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WFWg7I"&gt;If Apple reveals the next iPhone at the event as expected, then it seems likely the company will also share &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;a release date for iOS 15&lt;/a&gt;. We already know that one of its biggest features, SharePlay, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22629165/apple-shareplay-ios-ipad-os-15-macos-delayed"&gt;won’t be included&lt;/a&gt; in the initial public release of the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pWKy3I"&gt;Apple has several other projects in the works that could make appearances at the event as well. The next Apple Watch, reportedly called the Apple Watch Series 7, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/29/22647766/apple-watch-series-7-rumors-screen-size-new-design-41mm-45mm"&gt;is rumored to have&lt;/a&gt; a new design with flatter edges and larger 41mm and 45mm screens, a 1mm bump from the Series 6. (Though, the new Watch is reportedly facing manufacturing issues &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22650516/apple-watch-series-7-delayed-manufacturing-production-issues"&gt;that could lead to delays&lt;/a&gt;.) Apple’s next entry-level AirPods &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586507/apple-airpods-2021-refresh-rumor-iphone-se-2022-5g-15-details"&gt;may have a new design&lt;/a&gt; that takes cues from the AirPods Pro. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;New 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt; equipped with the company’s custom-designed chips and an SD card slot are also rumored to be on the way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1K0fb"&gt;The event arrives following a tough few weeks for Apple. The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655644/apple-delays-controversial-child-protection-features-csam-privacy"&gt;delayed controversial child protection features&lt;/a&gt; after intense criticism from privacy and security experts. Apple announced a number of recent App Store &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;policy&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;changes&lt;/a&gt;, though they only mildly address developer concerns. And with proposed legislation in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22620454/apple-google-app-store-senate-play-bill-epic-games-fortnite"&gt;countries&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/australia-considering-new-laws-apple-google-wechat-digital-wallets-2021-08-30/"&gt;increased regulatory scrutiny&lt;/a&gt;, and the looming verdict in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Epic Games v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial&lt;/a&gt;, we could be on the precipice of profound changes in the way Apple operates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UcQ7Ty"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update September 7th, 1:10PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added details of the AR Apple logo for the event.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Start is a personalized news feed designed for Windows 11, mobile, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6kGqwrR7klMHDHu9NfHzV6ejs9Q=/0x100:2400x1700/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69825751/MSFTStart_PC_Mobile_800x600.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft Start is a personalized news feed.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bUAS26"&gt;Microsoft is launching Microsoft Start today, a personalized news feed that integrates into Windows 11 and is accessible online and on iOS and Android. Microsoft Start is very similar to the MSN feed that exists today and to Microsoft News. Microsoft is rebranding these into Microsoft Start and integrating the feed into the Windows 11 widgets section and the Windows 10 taskbar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uZ1YcM"&gt;Much like Microsoft News, Microsoft Start includes news and media channels from more than 1,000 publishers. Microsoft uses AI and machine learning algorithms to sort through which news is presented to users and to personalize content based on interests and how you engage with content. There’s also some “human moderation” involved, but Microsoft did &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/30/21275524/microsoft-news-msn-layoffs-artificial-intelligence-ai-replacements"&gt;layoff dozens of journalists and editorial workers&lt;/a&gt; at its Microsoft News and MSN organizations last year, so it’s not clear how involved editors will be.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FQHrvzfNwYkyiMTkt7nTKVsgzHo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22831048/MSFTStart_MobilePlusIcon_800x600.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Microsoft Start logo will appear on mobile first.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="goFxYY"&gt;Microsoft Start will surface top stories, personalized recommendations, and sports scores or the weather in its feed. It’s very much the combination of Microsoft’s efforts in recent years with MSN, Microsoft News, and the taskbar widget in Windows 10. MSN won’t be going away, but Microsoft Start will be the new brand for Microsoft News.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p0thHi"&gt;The standalone website, &lt;a href="https://www.microsoftstart.com"&gt;MicrosoftStart.com&lt;/a&gt;, will be accessible from all modern web browsers, and the mobile versions of Microsoft News will be rebranded to Microsoft Start. Once Windows 11 launches next month, Microsoft Start will also be available in widget form from the dedicated section of the new OS. Microsoft Edge will also include a Microsoft Start feed on the new tab page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jHpFDv"&gt;If you’re interested in trying out Microsoft Start, it’s available &lt;a href="https://www.microsoftstart.com"&gt;online right now&lt;/a&gt; or through the &lt;a href="https://aka.ms/Start_Blog_QR"&gt;iOS and Android mobile apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla is planning for a wider release of its controversial ‘Full Self-Driving’ software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QkTiGaRpbMr_byZ5bEsDPSnC0wI=/135x0:1577x961/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69825606/Screen_Shot_2021_09_07_at_10.16.41_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3SMNHgWS35A" target="_blank"&gt;YouTube/James Locke&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vyK93X"&gt;Nearly a year after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528508/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-first-reaction-video"&gt;Tesla started testing its controversial “Full Self-Driving” (FSD) beta software&lt;/a&gt; with a select group of customers, the company’s CEO Elon Musk said he is aiming for a wider release by the end of September. The news comes as an older version of the software leaked online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YsQC0u"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1430657502966910985"&gt;Musk said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that the company would begin rolling out FSD version 10 to customers in its early access program at midnight on September 10th. Then, the software “will need another few weeks after that for tuning [and] bug fixes,” which Musk estimated would take four weeks. At that point, a “public beta button” will be made available to more Tesla customers, which is expected to take the form of a download button for people who purchased the FSD package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="PmJihA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Naturally, this should all be taken with a giant grain of salt&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hFGrLl"&gt;Naturally, this should all be taken with a giant grain of salt. Musk has been promising a wider release of the beta software for those customers who purchased the FSD package (which currently costs $10,000) for a while now. It’s possible that Tesla will blow past this deadline and Musk will tweet a new date to get customers excited. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNE7nD"&gt;Just to give you a sense of how long this has been going on: In 2018, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2018/06/10/tesla-version-9-software-update-fully-self-driving-features-elon-musk/"&gt;Musk said&lt;/a&gt; that the “long awaited” version of FSD would begin rolling out in August of that year, which didn’t happen. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18512580/elon-musk-tesla-driverless-cars-lidar-simulation-waymo"&gt;He did it again in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, proclaiming that “a year from now” there would be “over a million cars with full self-driving, software, everything.” That also didn’t happen. The company actually began shipping FSD version 9 in July, but only to members of its early access program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUg6XV"&gt;So to say that Tesla fans have been anticipating this update for a while would be an understatement. Some customers have gotten sick of waiting and &lt;a href="https://www.independent.com/2021/07/22/santa-barbara-brothers-accuse-tesla-of-false-advertising/"&gt;sued the company for false advertising&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rbViOi"&gt;Tesla says the software controls the vehicle’s steering, lane centering, braking, and acceleration on highways and city streets. But it is still considered a Level 2 advanced driver assist system because it requires driver supervision at all times. &lt;a href="https://www.iihs.org/api/datastoredocument/bibliography/2220"&gt;Studies have shown&lt;/a&gt; that this supervisory role can make it more difficult for drivers to stay vigilant on the road, which can be dangerous. The driver is also legally responsible for the vehicle, which some say undercuts Tesla’s marketing of its product as “full self-driving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZAH9Pd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Studies have shown that Level 2 ADAS can make it more difficult for drivers to stay vigilant on the road&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TR1QKn"&gt;There’s no question that Tesla is more willing than its competitors to test beta versions of its Autopilot driver assist feature on its customers in the interest of gathering data and working out any bugs in the system. And Tesla customers are mostly fine with this, routinely flooding Musk’s mentions begging to be admitted into the company’s early access program for beta testers. This has helped contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-tesla-model-3-survey/autopilot.html?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Tesla’s public reputation&lt;/a&gt; as a leader in autonomous driving, despite its vehicles continuously falling short of what most experts would agree defines a self-driving car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xuyK3Z"&gt;Meanwhile, an older version of Tesla’s FSD software has leaked and is currently spreading among the hacker community, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/09/07/tesla-tsla-full-self-driving-beta-software-leaked/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Citing unnamed sources, the website reported that binary firmware files of the software are being passed around in the Tesla root access community. According to &lt;a href="http://SSH.com"&gt;SSH.com&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="9OIifd"&gt;Having root access generally means being able to log into some root account on the server, or being able to run commands as root on the server, for example by using some privilege escalation tool such as sudo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="8x7Jtp"&gt;Some Tesla owners have used root access to examine the company’s software releases and access some unreleased features. With root access, you can actually run the software on your vehicle. According to &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;, the hacker community generally tries to keep things quiet so as not to alarm Tesla. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8Kl9t"&gt;However, a Tesla owner in Ukraine recently posted a video using version 8.2 of FSD beta in Kiev, where Tesla hasn’t released it. Tesla has only been developing FSD for the US market and hasn’t adapted it for use in other countries, which have different road signs and driving rules. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/greentheonly/status/1434597252081803266"&gt;As noted by hacker @greentheonly&lt;/a&gt;, this is an example of how Tesla’s FSD works in a location without “decent maps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="45xIdT"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2PkGHvUkbPo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jsX3xk"&gt;It’s also a helpful reminder of what happens when you neglect to use high-definition maps to underpin your self-driving software. Unlike autonomous vehicle companies like Waymo and Cruise, Tesla does not use HD maps, nor does it restrict its software from being used in certain areas, also known as geofencing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObLd1x"&gt;Musk has said he is trying to create an autonomous vehicle technology that relies on vision-based sensors like cameras and a neural net-trained software. He has scoffed at the AV industry’s reliance on sensors like lidar, which uses lasers to identify nearby objects and which other companies say provides needed redundancy in case of failures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a25Fuc"&gt;The US government has taken a renewed interest in Tesla, recently announcing that it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/16/22626819/tesla-autopilot-crash-emergency-vehicle-probe-nhtsa"&gt;investigating incidents involving Tesla cars operating Autopilot that have crashed&lt;/a&gt; into parked emergency vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvNZCn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vNs9Ib"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Intel’s Mobileye will launch a robotaxi service in Germany in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/14Fu_Y-Yb7tRDD22vWF65bft8GU=/0x256:3078x2308/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69825498/Mobileye_Robotaxi___Tel_Aviv_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0qeGzx"&gt;Mobileye, the Intel-owned company that specializes in chips for vision-based autonomous vehicles, announced that it will launch a robotaxi service in Germany in 2022. It’s the latest big move by a company seeking to buck the trend in AV development by becoming both a supplier of autonomous driving technology as well as a fleet operator and service provider. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzXbaD"&gt;The taxi service will be operated in partnership with German rental car company Sixt and Moovit, an Israel-based startup that specializes in mobility data that was recently acquired by Intel for $900 million. Customers can hail a ride through either Sixt’s or Mobileye’s app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5Cp12d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;But it won’t be a full-fledged robotaxi service at launch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iqtqod"&gt;But it won’t be a full-fledged robotaxi service at launch. Mobileye says it will begin “early rider testing” in Munich in 2022, but it won’t shift from testing to fully commercial operations until it has received approval from German regulators. The vehicle’s will also include safety drivers behind the wheel “until regulatory approvals have been received,” a spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FYXbsex4dQ58478ZYJMxHI79Tlw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22829585/Mobileye_Solutions_IAA_final.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WVpOm1"&gt;Among self-driving companies today, Mobileye is uniquely ambitious in its plans for the future. The company is working on four different products that offer varying levels of automation, including an advanced driver assist system (ADAS) that it currently supplies to 25 companies and a “premium” ADAS that will launch with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22346358/geely-electric-vehicle-brand-zeekr-china"&gt;Zeekr&lt;/a&gt;, an electric vehicle brand recently announced by Geely. Neither ADAS system will include lidar, the sensor that uses lasers to determine the real-time location of objects on the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hrqrSi"&gt;Mobileye’s other two products will use lidar and are more advanced in their automation technology. Mobileye Drive is a self-driving system that utilizes the companies’ EyeQ system-on-a-chip, as well as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/1/13791848/delphi-mobileye-self-driving-car-pittsburgh-intel-maps"&gt;data crowdsourcing program called the Road Experience Management&lt;/a&gt;, or REM, which uses real-time data from Mobileye-equipped vehicles to build out a global 3D map. This product will be used by customers like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22375759/intel-mobileye-udelv-autonomous-vehicle-delivery-2023"&gt;Udelv&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.transdev.com/en/press-release/mobileye-transdev-ats-lohr-autonomous-shuttles/"&gt;Transdev, Lohr&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.automotiveworld.com/news-releases/schaeffler-and-mobileye-to-industrialize-self-driving-shuttles/"&gt;Schaeffler&lt;/a&gt; for applications like delivery vehicles and self-driving shuttles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrMvCC"&gt;The robotaxi with Sixt and Moovit will be the most advanced version of the company’s AV technology, Mobileye CEO and president Amnon Shashua said. He noted that while the company’s ADAS works using only cameras and software, that kind of hardware setup is not “safe enough” for a commercial taxi fleet without a safety driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WWgTHi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“you need to create a public trust”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="C0iNRx"&gt;“We believe that for a company that is going to deploy many thousands of their self driving vehicles, you need to create a public trust,” Shashua said, “and you need to demonstratively show that you are much, much better than human drivers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHVzLT"&gt;Previously, Intel said it would begin testing a robotaxi service in Israel in partnership with Volkswagen, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/29/18039216/volkswagen-intel-mobileye-self-driving-ride-hailing-israel-2019"&gt;which it plans to also launch in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. And the chipmaker additionally has a deal in place to test autonomous vehicles in South Korea, also for a robotaxi service. Those plans are pending local approval by regulators as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W1T1lH"&gt;Most notably, Mobileye recently announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22585338/intel-mobileye-autonomous-vehicle-av-testing-nyc"&gt;plans to test its vehicles in New York City&lt;/a&gt;, a notoriously dense and difficult city in which to test AVs. But the plan is already running into problems with local lawmakers. The city’s Department of Transportation is &lt;a href="https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2021/08/13/self-driving-car-company-to-test-a-second-autonomous-vehicle-in-nyc/"&gt;adopting new rules&lt;/a&gt; that would require AV companies to obtain a testing permit before deploying any vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VMGhBX"&gt;The issue is that the permit would require operators to state that their autonomous vehicles are “as good as human drivers” without any key performance indicators, Shashua said. “It opens up a quagmire of issues that will basically make suppliers or make companies that want to test run away from the New York City,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Demon’s Souls and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart for PS5 are discounted</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="ratchet" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8t4Eny6vuixJ_4o_U1AKYUOxNYc=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69825050/RACRA_Rivet_Molonoth.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JAAePo"&gt;People who own a PS5 console with a disc drive can enjoy some small but noteworthy discounts on exclusive games at Walmart, GameStop, and Amazon. You can get up to $25 off of the &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; remake, while &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt; is $10 off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BR7aRA"&gt;The new version of &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; made for the PS5 was developed by Bluepoint Games, the same studio that tackled the remastering of classics like &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Colossus&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Metal Gear Solid HD Collection&lt;/em&gt;, and more. &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; for PS5 features overhauled graphics and a new orchestral recording of the original soundtrack. And, of course, this one will satisfy if you like difficult games. Normally $70, it’s $45 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FDemon-Souls-PlayStation-5%2F741555735&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Demons-Souls-PlayStation-5/dp/B08FC5TTBF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fplaystation-5%2Fgames%2Fproducts%2Fdemons-souls%2F11108202.html%3Fcondition%3DNew" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; is selling it for $50.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hiRUgC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Why Demon’s Souls is Jay Peters’ game of 2020","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22150718/demons-souls-remake-ps5-playstation-5-sony-game-of-the-year-2020"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="A5BQwF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10226091"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8GJ57U"&gt;Insomniac Games’ latest game, &lt;em&gt;Ratchet &amp;amp; Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;, is especially worth checking out at a discounted price. It’s more broadly appealing than &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt;, with inviting visuals that you might swear look just like a Pixar movie and controls that are fairly easy to learn. Normally $70, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ratchet-Clank-Rift-Apart-PlayStation-5/dp/B095T8C99C/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you can get this game for $60 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; for a limited time. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523093/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-review-ps5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ask4QV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10687661"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TmNH7e"&gt;If you don’t yet have a PS5 to call your own, stay tuned this week for PS5 restocks, as they can sometimes drop with little to no notice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvYcMv"&gt;Given that Labor Day has come and gone, most of the great deals that popped up around the weekend have ended. Though, a few remain, &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836602-13527013?sid=VergeDailyDeals090221&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-airpods-max-headphones-1%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;like this one from Woot that offers an $80 discount on the Apple AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; wireless noise-canceling headphones. Normally a whopping $549, for Prime members they cost a slightly more reasonable $470.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L7pF1U"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hXh0B9"&gt;If you haven’t yet tried out one of Apple’s latest computers that feature its speedy, efficient M1 processors, you can grab the latest Mac Mini desktop that comes with one, along with 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N5PHB83/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;for $600 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. It normally costs $699. To get this price, simply add it to your cart and the lower price will reflect upon checkout.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nsc6In"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9712859"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IsImaE"&gt;For something that’s far less costly, Amazon’s Kindle Paperwhite e-reader is almost down to its most affordable price at some retailers. The ad-supported model with 8GB of storage and a waterproof design costs $85. That’s a reasonable price (just $5 of its best-ever price) for a Kindle that has a sharp, easy-to-read display, though we’re eagerly awaiting a newer model that has USB-C charging instead of this model’s Micro USB port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v1WeEc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10695294"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="yaTn53"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Alan Wake Remastered is coming to PlayStation, Xbox, and PC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sU3MZAFz5ftksgv_HeVwHbHXKmA=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69824781/Key_Art_Horizontal.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xEY5DK"&gt;Remedy Entertainment’s 2010 cult classic &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/em&gt; is getting a remastered version for multiple platforms. Epic Games’ publishing arm will release &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake Remastered&lt;/em&gt; across PlayStation 4/5, Xbox Series S/X, and the Epic Games Store on PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eXEiPC"&gt;Originally an Xbox 360-exclusive title that went through a protracted development period, &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/em&gt; is a psychological thriller where you play a writer searching for his missing wife in the Pacific Northwest. The game was later released for PC in 2012, but &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake Remastered&lt;/em&gt; will mark the first time it’s been available on PlayStation platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OG43oc"&gt;Epic says the remaster will feature “all-new rendered 4K visuals,” commentary from writer and creative director Sam Lake, and the expansions &lt;em&gt;The Signal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Writer&lt;/em&gt;. Pulp horror-influenced spinoff &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake’s American Nightmare&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t appear to be included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="s5kBZZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Epic launches publishing label, signs creators behind Control, Inside, and The Last Guardian","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195152/epic-games-publishing-label-control-last-guardian-inside"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="S4g1Lw"&gt;Last year Epic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21195152/epic-games-publishing-label-control-last-guardian-inside"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a publishing deal with Remedy for two titles, one of which the studio described as an “AAA multi-platform production,” with the other being a smaller project in the same universe. It’s not clear whether &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake Remastered&lt;/em&gt; is the latter project; if so, that could point to a possible &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/em&gt; sequel. Remedy’s last game, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/16/21010818/control-game-of-the-year-remedy-xbox-ps4-pc-story"&gt;the critically acclaimed &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, also contained some subtle &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/control-fans-believe-alan-wake-takes-place-in-the-same-1837840844"&gt;references&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X07Z6E"&gt;There isn’t a definitive release date for &lt;em&gt;Alan Wake Remastered&lt;/em&gt; just yet, but it shouldn’t be too far off — Epic says it’ll be available this fall.&lt;/p&gt;
