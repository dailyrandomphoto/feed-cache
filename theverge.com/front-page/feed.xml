    <title>Microsoft has discontinued all Xbox One consoles</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qgL2LC"&gt;Microsoft has stopped manufacturing all Xbox One consoles. The software giant originally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327330/microsoft-xbox-one-x-s-digital-edition-discontinued"&gt;discontinued the Xbox One X&lt;/a&gt; and digital Xbox One S ahead of the Xbox Series X launch, then quietly stopped manufacturing the Xbox One S at the end of 2020, leaving retailers to sell out their remaining stock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YTmUJS"&gt;“To focus on production of Xbox Series X / S, we stopped production for all Xbox One consoles by the end of 2020,” says Cindy Walker, senior director of Xbox console product marketing, in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kkz9Ba"&gt;Microsoft’s confirmation comes just as a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-12/sony-tackles-playstation-5-shortage-by-making-more-ps4-consoles"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; suggested Sony had planned to end PS4 production at the end of 2021, but that the company will now manufacture around a million PS4 consoles in 2022. Sony has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22880062/ps4-manufacturing-sony-ps5-shortage-xbox-one"&gt;confirmed PS4 production is still ongoing&lt;/a&gt;, amid struggles by both Microsoft and Sony to meet demand for their latest Xbox Series X and PS5 consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="M72MZT"&gt;Microsoft seems able to meet demand for the $299 Xbox Series S, though. At the time of publishing, the Xbox Series S is in stock at both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Xbox-RRS-00007-Series-S/dp/B08GD9MNZB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon in the UK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-series-s-512-gb-all-digital-console-disc-free-gaming-white%2F6430277.p%3FskuId%3D6430277%26intl%3Dnosplash&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy in the US&lt;/a&gt;. Speaking just after the launch of the Xbox Series X / S in 2020, Xbox chief &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611412/microsoft-phil-spencer-interview-xbox-series-x-launch-decoder-podcast"&gt;Phil Spencer told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the company had built more Xbox Series X consoles than Series S, but that ultimately the lower price point of the Series S would win out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fRlSHg"&gt;“We can actually build more of the Series S [chips] in the same [chip] die space as we can the Series X,” said Spencer. That’s a key reason for why we’re seeing steady Xbox Series S stock, alongside Microsoft’s decision to quietly discontinue the Xbox One S in favor of its next-gen consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nigeria lifts Twitter ban, says the company has agreed to government demands</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sS8nBOye7jvdBQ_Z-xJUh8xgrGQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382413/acastro_200715_1777_twitter_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XWgZty"&gt;Nigeria has lifted its ban on Twitter, first instated on June 5th, 2021. The Nigerian government says Twitter has agreed to meet all of its demands, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2022/01/12/africa/nigeria-lifts-twitter-ban-intl/index.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. These include Twitter opening a local office in Nigeria, addressing concerns over its tax payments, and “managing prohibited publication in line with Nigerian law.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5dGTz9"&gt;This last condition is particularly important, as the original ban was condemned by many international agencies as an act of censorship. The Nigerian government banned Twitter in 2021 just days after the company deleted a tweet by the country’s president, Muhammadu Buhari, that &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-57336571"&gt;threatened secessionists&lt;/a&gt; in Nigeria’s southeast region. Some had interpreted the tweet as threatening genocide for its reference to the Nigerian civil war of the 1960s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="h4PPAk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nigeria has accused Twitter of helping spread “fake news”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5KMMmC"&gt;At the time, the Nigerian government &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-57368535"&gt;said the removal of the tweet&lt;/a&gt; was “disappointing,” but that other reasons factored into the decision to ban Twitter, including its spread of “misinformation and fake news.” Many nations, including the UK, Canada, the US, and EU members &lt;a href="https://www.wionews.com/world/european-union-us-condemn-twitter-ban-in-nigeria-389797"&gt;condemned the ban&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter has previously played an important role in civil movements in Nigeria, including helping to mobilize the &lt;a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/medialse/2020/11/11/endsars-a-unique-twittersphere-and-social-media-regulation-in-nigeria/"&gt;EndSARS protests against police violence&lt;/a&gt;. It’s not clear whether Twitter’s return is then predicated on tighter government control. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BDvPlw"&gt;In a statement issued by Nigeria’s technology agency, the National Information Technology Development Agency (NITDA), the approval to lift the ban was given by President Buhari.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gpwv16"&gt;“The Federal Government of Nigeria (FGN) directs me to inform the public that President Muhammadu Buhari, GCFR, has approved the lifting of the suspension of Twitter operation in Nigeria effective from 12 am tonight, 13th January 2022,” said the statement, as &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/nigeria-lifts-ban-on-twitter-says-the-social-media-giant-has-met-some-conditions/?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAJtg48mZ9YBBoQTW09pKgEkiyD48VOILBIwmxG6VeNTlAqvCNG5appWOzG8k_AvhWIgLTLNcZW20bcVDxxHgcCI99jBqzhI_4LRVVcIGfJb-bsQ9zOOwrn3iqVDRAERDyBY4zn7e1ta2upKW0cQcHjxraika7ARarjvQ2LkNjdPq"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3Pu3G"&gt;The statement says Twitter will create “a legal entity in Nigeria during the first quarter of 2022,” and that the company has “agreed to comply with applicable tax obligations on its operations under Nigerian law.” Twitter will also “enroll Nigeria in its Partner Support and Law Enforcement Portals,” which gives police tools to request and retain data on users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4G2NXy"&gt;According to the statement: “Twitter has agreed to act with a respectful acknowledgement of Nigerian laws and the national culture and history on which such legislation has been built and work with the FGN and the broader industry to develop Code of Conduct in line with global best practices, applicable in almost all developed countries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYRAWd"&gt;We’ve reached out to Twitter for comment and will update this story if we hear back. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PC market just had another big year thanks to pandemic demand</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GGeKwRVLAiyULPqAPFJR6CaeLD0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382375/akrales_190930_3689_0056.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NHhkXv"&gt;The PC market experienced its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22225356/pc-sales-shipments-2020-growth-idc-canalys-remote-work"&gt;first big growth&lt;/a&gt; in a decade during 2020, when the pandemic began to force people to work and learn from home. Market research firms &lt;a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-01-12-gartner-says-worldwide-pc-shipments-declined-5-percent-in-fourth-quarter-of-2021-but-grew-nearly-10-percent-for-the-year"&gt;Gartner&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=prUS48770422"&gt;IDC&lt;/a&gt; are now reporting that the worldwide PC market has grown again throughout 2021, as demand for traditional PCs continued during a global chip shortage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AaFs5v"&gt;Nearly 340 million PCs were shipped in 2021, according to Gartner. That’s a nearly 10 percent increase over the already unprecedented numbers seen in 2020. IDC puts the figure at 348.8 million, up nearly 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DwBxIT"&gt;“2021 has truly been a return to form for the PC,” said Jitesh Ubrani, a research manager at IDC. “Consumer need for PCs in emerging markets and global commercial demand remained strong during the quarter with supply being a gating factor.” Ongoing supply issues relating to a global chip shortage mean the PC market “could have been even larger than it was in 2021,” according to Tom Mainelli, an executive at IDC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q6I0jH8Jc_MbcHsk45zE_XHYdak=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23165780/WMGeDrO.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gartner’s worldwide PC market shipments for 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QLRo5ADRGT7QrsIvdBl_jAX1rrA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23165781/T0kMh82.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;IDC’s PC market shipments for 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DvD8zt"&gt;Gartner reports that 2021 saw the highest shipment volume of PCs since 2013, after a 2017 milestone of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/12/14250946/pc-shipments-gartner-idc-2016"&gt;five years of PC decline&lt;/a&gt;. “As a result, annual PC shipment volumes are not expected to decline to pre-pandemic levels for at least 2-3 years,” explains Mikako Kitagawa, research director at Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWUkQs"&gt;While the global 2021 figures were positive for the PC market, the fourth quarter in the US was hit by supply chain issues and what Gartner describes as a “collapse in demand for Chromebooks.” This could mean the unexpected PC growth we’ve seen throughout 2020 and 2021 won’t continue this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKL6gd"&gt;The pandemic has revived the PC market for two straight years, though. Microsoft also launched Windows 11 last year, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/4/21246561/microsoft-windows-10x-single-screens-windows-usage-demand-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;declaring “the PC is back”&lt;/a&gt; at the beginning of the pandemic thanks to a big jump in Windows usage. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22856150/amd-ryzen-6000-laptop-chips-gaming-battery-life-zen-3-plus-ces-2022"&gt;AMD&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22855915/intel-12th-gen-alder-lake-chips-ces-2022-h-series-laptops-gaming-performance"&gt;Intel&lt;/a&gt; have also just launched their latest laptop chips at CES 2022, so expect to see even more new PCs at stores soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dropbox finally supports M1 Macs natively with new beta  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xv4a7Da6mIzYtDnjwZyi7U2b_F0=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70382333/dropbox_logo_2x.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Dropbox&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jy6cmn"&gt;Dropbox’s latest beta has added native support for Macs with M1 processors, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/12/dropbox-releases-long-awaited-macos-version-with-native-m1-support-in-beta/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The addition was confirmed by a Dropbox community manager on the &lt;a href="https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Dropbox-installs-integrations/Apple-Silicon-M1-Desktop-Sync-Compatibility/td-p/527743"&gt;company’s forums&lt;/a&gt;, and we’ve verified it by installing the latest beta of the macOS app. You can grab it yourselves from &lt;a href="https://www.dropboxforum.com/t5/Dropbox-desktop-client-builds/Beta-Build-140-3-1903/td-p/570154"&gt;this Dropbox forum&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59drqh"&gt;The service has always worked on Apple’s M1 Macs, but until now it’s had to use Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer. This allowed the macOS app, which was originally designed for old Intel-based Macs, to run on machines with Apple’s new M1 processors. Offering native M1 support should result in Dropbox having better performance and consuming less power when used with Apple Silicon devices. That said, Rosetta translation is so fast you might not notice a difference in day-to-day use (we haven’t so far).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BESiec"&gt;Dropbox was one of the last high-profile holdouts still lacking support for Apple’s ARM-based processors. In October there was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22751178/dropbox-native-apple-silicon-app-m1-2022"&gt;some controversy&lt;/a&gt; after forum posts from the company’s employees suggested more customers would have to ask for a native M1 version before the company would develop it. The outcry that followed prompted &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/drewhouston/status/1453762478479843332"&gt;Dropbox’s CEO to publicly announce&lt;/a&gt; that an M1-optimized version of the company’s macOS app would arrive in the first half of 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeGG0L"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BlzIUo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple and T-Mobile say iOS 15.2 didn’t switch off iCloud Private Relay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 13 Mini" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P5mAZc705qkg0L06yKrgETfWWVw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70381863/vpavic_210916_4760_0323.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1qF06W"&gt;Apple has denied that last month’s iOS 15.2 update is behind the difficulty some iPhone owners have faced with using the iCloud Private Relay feature on cellular networks. Verizon, AT&amp;amp;T, and T-Mobile earlier this week said they weren’t blocking the VPN-like feature, but T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22878885/verizon-att-t-mobile-apple-icloud-private-relay-feature-supported"&gt;claimed&lt;/a&gt; to have identified that iOS 15.2 toggled it off by default. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F54OgM"&gt;Now Apple says that’s not the case. After releasing an updated beta of iOS 15.3 that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/12/22880835/apple-clarify-icloud-private-relay-error-messages-ios-15-3-cell-carriers"&gt;clarifies the language&lt;/a&gt; in iCloud settings, Apple &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/12/apple-reaffirms-icloud-private-relay-availability-refutes-t-mobiles-accusation-of-a-bug-ios-15-2/"&gt;issued a statement to &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; saying that iOS 15.2 wasn’t the problem. “No changes were made to iCloud Private Relay in iOS 15.2 that would have toggled the feature off,” the statement reads. “Users are encouraged to check their Settings to see if Private Relay is enabled on their device or for a specific network.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Lq8Yr2"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 13 review: yep, bigger batteries are better","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22684421/apple-iphone-13-mini-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="jm2UUZ"&gt;T-Mobile has also followed up with &lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt; to say that that iOS 15.2 didn’t toggle the feature off after all. “Apple doesn’t change customers’ settings when they update to iOS 15.2,” the carrier says in a statement. “Customers may see an error message if they previously toggled iCloud Private Relay or Limit IP Address Tracking off in their Cellular Data Options Settings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6cTiEY"&gt;It’s still not entirely clear what caused all of this confusion, but the carriers do say they’re not blocking iCloud Private Relay (except for some T-Mobile plans that include content filtering services), so it’s worth double-checking your cellular settings to make sure everything’s the way it should be. Once the public version of iOS 15.3 is out, the language in settings won’t outright tell you that your cell plan doesn’t support the feature.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nTluDF"&gt;AmpMe &lt;em&gt;isn’t &lt;/em&gt;a brand-new app that popped up just to scam unsuspecting users out of their money. See the photo atop this post? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/24/9391461/ampme-music-streaming-app-syncing"&gt;That’s from 2015&lt;/a&gt;, when we first covered the idea: an app that can sync up a room full of smartphones into a single gigantic speaker with no fees in sight. But &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1480626605370142724"&gt;as App Store scam hunter Kosta Eleftheriou points out&lt;/a&gt;, the app looks&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;seriously shady more than six years later — if you downloaded it yesterday, it would immediately try to sell you on a $9.99 a week automatic recurring subscription. That’s $520 a year, an incredible sum if you pull it out as a party trick and then forget to cancel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AZ82b8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1480626647300669440"&gt;AppFigures estimates&lt;/a&gt; the app has raked in $13 million since 2018.&lt;/p&gt;

If you see an app that charges ridiculous subscription fees, yet still has loads of five-star ratings, something might be off. And if those reviews look absolutely fake, and the app’s barely functional, you’ve probably spotted a scam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvGrI4"&gt;What’s less easy to find: a company accused of scamming willing to stand up for itself.  Most are completely silent, but when we reached AmpMe for comment, we got a reply from its support email address. Here it is in full:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="50KOyM"&gt;Hi Sean,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lfWoj"&gt;The free version of our app is the most popular version and the vast majority of our users never paid a dime. Given its reception and popularity, AmpMe is a valued app and works as advertised. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="axaFLr"&gt;To claim that our users are commonly paying $520 per year does not reflect reality. For example, in 2021, the average user that subscribed and took advantage of our free trial paid a total average of $17. If you take only paying users, the average yearly subscription revenue is about $75. Internally, this has reinforced our belief that AmpMe’s pricing is transparent with clear and easy opt-out procedures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KUPeNZ"&gt;Regarding the reviews, we hear the feedback loud and clear. Through the years, like most startups, we’ve hired outside consultants to help us with marketing and app store optimization. More oversight is needed and that’s what we are currently working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0M21Dp"&gt;We always adhere to Apple’s subscription guidelines and are continually working to ensure their high standards are met. We also respect and value the community’s feedback. Therefore, a new version of the app with a lower price has already been submitted to the App Store for review. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gWsjEi"&gt;The AmpMe Team&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ImeJCu"&gt;We can’t confirm AmpMe’s numbers, but we’ll give them the benefit of the doubt. There are at least three other interesting takeaways in that reply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="8M9j9x"&gt;AmpMe isn’t denying that it hired someone to pump its brand in the App Store. Nor is it pledging not to do that in future. It’s simply pointing the blame somewhere else. Maybe it’s angry its consultants faked these reviews. Maybe it’s just annoyed they got caught.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="S30gXi"&gt;AmpMe is lowering its price as a result of this scrutiny. In fact, the company’s update has already been approved and is live on the store. It’s $4.99 a week now, or $260 a year. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NaPwWS"&gt;AmpMe isn’t dropping its subscription tactics, which the company believes is “transparent with clear and easy opt-out procedures”.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="x461FP"&gt;I downloaded a copy of AmpMe, and I have to admit it’s not quite as blatant as I expected having heard the news. While it absolutely does hit you with a subscription request the moment you open the app, tempts you into a three-day free subscription, and the little “X” to bypass that screen is hard to spot, the app does at least clearly say how much it’s going to charge in big white letters right away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmX39v"&gt;And if you do hit the “X” and skip the subscription, the app seems functional — if only as a way to watch music videos from YouTube while you chat with randos or friends, as the sync-multiple-phones-as-speakers functionality is locked behind AmpMe’s paywall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sOpOoB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Profiting off forgetfulness is common now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4nK6Y0"&gt;So the fact that Apple isn’t pulling this one from the App Store (and instead appears to be helping AmpMe clean up the more obvious fake reviews, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/12/music-app-ampme-lowers-pricing-after-accused-of-being-an-app-store-scammer/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) doesn’t really surprise me. It’s not one of the worst offenders, and the state of the tech industry is that many, many companies profit from the “whoops, forgot to cancel my subscription” phenomenon, including Apple itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HfcrqX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;But as I suggested in September&lt;/a&gt;, the most valuable and profitable company in the world, the one that sells privacy as its brand and claims to put customers first, could do a heck of a lot more to show it. It could lead here instead of following. It could stop profiting from people’s forgetfulness, provide automatic refunds when people have been scammed, stop auto-renewing subscriptions by default, and kill off the star rating system that allows review fakes to flourish. Last October, it took one of those suggestions and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22705405/apple-report-a-problem-button-app-store-scams"&gt;brought back a way to actually report App Store scams&lt;/a&gt;. We have more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tpp9cy"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Eight things Apple could do to prove it actually cares about App Store users","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"},{"title":"The Apple App Store: a brief history of major policy changes","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22667242/apple-app-store-major-policy-changes-history"},{"title":"Sweetheart deals and plastic knives: all the best emails from the Apple vs. Epic trial","url":"https://www.theverge.com/c/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="zv8a8b"&gt;I do wonder how much more there is to this whole “outside consultants” idea that AmpMe mentions. It isn’t the first company Eleftheriou has uncovered where a seemingly legitimate app that’s been around for years sprouts a new set of fake reviews, and a new screen advertising an exorbitant subscription price that you have to pay or dismiss the first time you launch. (Many of these screens even look largely the same.) I wouldn’t be surprised if there are companies going around shopping this exact service to old apps, in exchange for a cut of the revenue. (&lt;a href="https://www.verdict.co.uk/wajam-adware/"&gt;It seems like it may not be the first time&lt;/a&gt; AmpMe’s CEO cashed in on an old app, either.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v1V7JC"&gt;If you’ve been approached by such a company, or work for such a company, I’d love to talk to you. I’m at sean@theverge.com. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yaf75G"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Geico made the Portal ad we never asked for</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dfm7dO9FE5C432EWb56L-bDwABw=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70381646/The_Gecko_Visits_Portal___GEICO_Insurance_0_13_screenshot.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Geico&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rawcGT"&gt;We’re still waiting on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/24/22452272/jj-abrams-portal-movie-valve-half-life-2013-script-production"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt; movie that’s apparently been years in the making&lt;/a&gt;, but if you must see &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt; icon / villain GLaDOS in some sort of cinematic, there’s a new Geico ad you can &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtPwBz30Pww"&gt;watch right here&lt;/a&gt; or at the top of this post. Yes, you read that correctly — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VtPwBz30Pww"&gt;Geico actually made a &lt;em&gt;Portal&lt;/em&gt;-themed ad featuring GLaDOS&lt;/a&gt;, and the insurance company even got voice actor Ellen McLain to reprise her role as the famous robot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yM8I4S"&gt;If you’ve seen any Geico ad featuring &lt;a href="https://geicocarinsurance.fandom.com/wiki/GEICO_Gecko"&gt;Martin the Gecko&lt;/a&gt; from the past many years (or perhaps forever, it feels like he’s always been a character I’m aware of), this ad will be familiar territory. Martin, armed with an &lt;a href="https://theportalwiki.com/wiki/Handheld_Portal_Device"&gt;Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device&lt;/a&gt;, makes a few quips (and of course mentions that it’s possible to save money by switching to Geico), and GLaDOS responds with a few characteristically ominous comments. Martin ends the commercial by jumping into a portal that turns out to be an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HE8tvRzEkg"&gt;infinite portal&lt;/a&gt;, lol. (It seems GLaDOS didn’t tell Martin how to escape such a predicament.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7YhguO"&gt;It’s an odd ad. And guess what? It’s not Geico’s only video game-inspired commercial — the company released one in November &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGa89tAWVHs"&gt;featuring &lt;em&gt;Angry Birds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple will clarify iCloud Private Relay error messages in iOS 15.3 to not blame cell carriers as much</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3DF4-0WNQ2LGPIXLaHWqCZAcq8o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70380977/cgartenberg_210917_4762_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CoeElR"&gt;Apple is updating the wording for iCloud Private Relay issues in the latest iOS 15.3 beta, clarifying that problems with the service may be an inadvertently switched-off setting and not issues with a customer’s specific cell carrier, &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/12/icloud-private-relay-clarification-ios-15-3/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tUZct6"&gt;The old message put the blame for iCloud Private Relay not working squarely on the shoulders of cell carriers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ULsaTL"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private Relay is turned off for your cellular plan&lt;/strong&gt;. Your cellular plan doesn’t support ‌iCloud‌ Private Relay. With ‌iCloud‌ Private Relay turned off, this network can monitor your internet activity, and your IP address is not hidden from known trackers or websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cQVN1J"&gt;Unsurprisingly, that wording &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22878885/verizon-att-t-mobile-apple-icloud-private-relay-feature-supported"&gt;led to confusion earlier this week&lt;/a&gt; when customers couldn’t get iCloud Private Relay to work on cellular connections. The issue, at least according to T-Mobile, was actually on Apple’s end: it seems that the company’s recent iOS 15.2 update toggled off Private Relay for cellular data by accident, not that T-Mobile, AT&amp;amp;T, and Verizon had suddenly disabled the feature from working on their networks. The new wording makes things a little clearer that the issue might be an accidentally toggled setting elsewhere in iOS and not a cell company problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ZAeNGD"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Private Relay is turned off for your cellular plan&lt;/strong&gt;. Private Relay is either not supported by your cellular plan or has been turned off in Cellular Settings. With Private Relay turned off, this network can monitor your internet activity, and your IP address is not hidden from known trackers or websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ImUhRW"&gt;Apple has also updated its &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212614"&gt;iCloud Private Relay support document&lt;/a&gt; today to make it clearer that customers might not be able to use the feature if they’ve turned off the “Limit IP Address Tracking” toggle for specific Wi-Fi or cellular networks, along with how to fix that problem on their devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fh2k9M"&gt;Hopefully, the new support document, clarified language from Apple, and the confirmations from all three major US carriers will be enough to put this week’s iCloud Private Relay confusion behind everyone. Given that the service is still technically in beta, though, it’s probably a good thing that Apple is sorting out the bugs now before it turns the service on by default. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM is creating an online used car marketplace</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ms1dlnqmn10QIkHF5an2rbyUXQE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70380695/acastro_200406_1777_gm_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s called CarBravo and is set to launch in the spring.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lL3NjY"&gt;The used car market is &lt;a href="https://www.usnews.com/news/business/articles/2022-01-03/29-000-for-an-average-used-car-would-be-buyers-are-aghast"&gt;red hot&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems General Motors wants to compete squarely with used vehicle sites like &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.carvana.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F12%2F22880695%2Fgm-general-motors-carbravo-online-used-car-marketplace-website" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Carvana&lt;/a&gt; with a new website called CarBravo. GM is beginning to enroll dealers now to be a part of the site, which is set to launch in “spring 2022,” &lt;a href="https://media.gm.com/media/us/en/gm/home.detail.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2022/jan/0111-carbravo.html"&gt;according to a press release&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9NBMS"&gt;CarBravo will not only let shoppers look at inventories from both dealers and GM’s central stock of used vehicles, but it will also let people shop for non-GM used vehicles, Steve Carlisle, GM’s EVP and president of GM North America, said in a statement. That could help it better take on Carvana (which just announced &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mx2JxS6i3_g"&gt;it has sold one million cars&lt;/a&gt;) and other sites such as &lt;a href="https://www.carmax.com/"&gt;CarMax&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vroom.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F12%2F22880695%2Fgm-general-motors-carbravo-online-used-car-marketplace-website" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Vroom&lt;/a&gt;, which let people shop across many different car brands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mTpPcG"&gt;The rise of direct-to-consumer brands like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/28/16059954/tesla-model-3-2017-auto-industry-influence-elon-musk"&gt;Tesla&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22547202/lucid-motors-air-electric-vehicle-hands-on-test-drive"&gt;Lucid&lt;/a&gt; have undermined the more traditional dealership / franchise system, so CarBravo could be a way for GM to dip its toes into that direct-to-consumer strategy. But the company has failed with bets like its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/21/21229838/gm-maven-shut-down-car-sharing-service"&gt;Maven car-sharing service&lt;/a&gt;, and we’ll have to wait and see if CarBravo can break through against some of the more well-known online destinations for used cars.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus Buds Pro gain multipoint support after latest update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BB-0lQddCx6gyEBGXrzDHcwc2WM=/0x0:1520x1013/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70380501/DSCF4677_Edited.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tYMgru"&gt;Multipoint support on earbuds has long been one of Jabra’s hallmarks, but slowly we’re starting to see other brands add the convenience to their buds. The latest is OnePlus, which is adding “dual connection” to its flagship OnePlus Buds Pro with a new firmware update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEaYR8"&gt;Once that update is installed, the Buds Pro will be able to connect to two devices at once, letting you seamlessly switch between, say, listening to music on your laptop and taking a call on your mobile phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtpGkG"&gt;This functionality is common in a lot of premium wireless headphones but has been much slower to make its way to earbuds. For a long time multipoint was a big selling point for Jabra’s Elite 65t, 75t, and 85t earbuds. But other companies like Anker and JBL have increasingly been offering multipoint with their respective earbuds. Meanwhile Jabra’s latest earbuds actually shipped &lt;em&gt;without&lt;/em&gt; multipoint at launch but should be updated to support it in the coming weeks. Jabra again confirmed the feature is on the way during CES 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cYFYBv"&gt;In the case of the $149.99 OnePlus Buds Pro, multipoint adds more value to an already-excellent set of Bluetooth earbuds that feature good sound quality, impressive noise cancellation, and a very comfortable fit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFxuqy"&gt;The company says this update is being rolled out incrementally, so not everyone’s going to have it right off the bat. &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oneplus-buds-pro-ota-pair-with-and-seamlessly-switch-between-2-devices.1533910/"&gt;On its forums&lt;/a&gt;, OnePlus said, “the OTA update will initially reach a small percentage of users, and then we’ll begin a broader rollout over the next few days.” Early indications are that the dual connection feature is working just as advertised, so it’s good to see this convenient trick reaching more and more products.&lt;/p&gt;
