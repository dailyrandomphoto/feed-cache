    <title>Star Wars: Lando is a new ‘event series’ coming to Disney Plus</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="Z5fr0L"&gt;Justin Simien — the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;writer, producer, and director of &lt;em&gt;Dear White People&lt;/em&gt; — is creating a Lando Calrissian ‘event series’ for Disney Plus, fittingly titled “Star Wars: Lando.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ev2skR"&gt;The project is still in early stages of development, and Lucasfilm has yet to provide nearly any details on the project — including whether or not either Billy Dee Williams or Donald Glover, who have played the character in other live-action Star Wars installments, are attached to the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XW7V8u"&gt;

    <title>Nintendo Switch, a console you can actually buy right now, outsold PS5 and Xbox Series X in November</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7NCmb0VVDXdQTVMzEi1EznEsEos=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493994/akrales_190820_3597_0150.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f6mvoR"&gt;The best-selling video game console in the US last month was not any of the new hardware from Microsoft or Sony, but a three-year-old device from Nintendo. The Nintendo Switch and its Lite variant sold 1.35 million units last month, &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201210006138/en/"&gt;according to data from retail analytics firm The NPD Group&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="up6pjm"&gt;That marks the 24th straight month that Nintendo’s handheld topped the console hardware chart in the US market. Those figures only add to the good holiday news for Nintendo, which &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2020/11/5/21550621/nintendo-earnings-q2-2020-switch-sales"&gt;last month reported&lt;/a&gt; a 40 percent year-over-year increase in Switch sales to 6.86 million units in the quarter that ended September 30th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vggv5d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nintendo Switch has been the best-selling console in the US for two years now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zhUfXe"&gt;Now, there are a lot of caveats here. This is the US only, so it’s excluding big markets in Asia and Europe. While Microsoft and Sony have not disclosed concrete sales numbers for their new consoles, both companies have said publicly that their respective launches of the &lt;a href="https://www.vg247.com/2020/11/25/ps5-biggest-console-launch-sony/"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/11/13/the-biggest-launch-in-xbox-history/"&gt;Xbox Series X/S&lt;/a&gt; were the biggest ever launches in console history, indicating that likely millions of devices were sold worldwide. Early &lt;a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/446429/ps5-sold-an-estimated-21-to-25-million-units-worldwide-on-launch-day/#:~:text=Based%20on%20preliminary%20data%20VGChartz,of%20the%20total%20estimated%20sales."&gt;retail estimates&lt;/a&gt; already put the PS5’s launch sales at more than 2 million units worldwide. But again, that’s worldwide sales, and the PS5 has been nearly impossible to get your hands on since. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0p6bVn"&gt;The Nintendo Switch happens to be a mature console with a much more efficient supply chain at the moment. That means Nintendo is able to stock them and sell them at a much faster pace. The demand for the Switch also remains strong even three years into the device’s life cycle thanks in part to the resilience of the platform’s library of excellent first-party games, as well as the Switch’s core appeal as a handheld indie-friendly device not tethered to mainstream gaming trends in either hardware or software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YWJJTq"&gt;It also helps that the Switch was itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/28/15706682/nintendo-switch-reportedly-boosting-production-gaming"&gt;similarly hard to find&lt;/a&gt; in the early days after its February 2017 launch. That fact makes its wider availability now a strong reason why those who’ve held off for years are finally taking the plunge in large numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mQJDaA"&gt;If either Microsoft or Sony were able to actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21564282/ps5-sony-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-orders-launch-week"&gt;manufacture enough Xbox and PlayStation devices to meet demand&lt;/a&gt;, it’s possible both companies would have handily surpassed Nintendo in console sales for the month. Neither Microsoft nor Sony immediately responded to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C69NDe"&gt;Yet given that the new consoles are severely supply constrained and will remain that way well into next year, Nintendo’s reign on the console sales thrown may continue unrivaled for some time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ZCfvc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hayden Christensen returning as Darth Vader in Obi-Wan Kenobi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pBaQjIxhHv0GrgU1-4Yzb6fZUQY=/0x0:489x326/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493984/revenge_sith.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0LZxXi"&gt;Hayden Christensen will reprise his role as Darth Vader in the Disney Plus series &lt;em&gt;Obi-Wan Kenobi&lt;/em&gt;, Lucasfilm president Kathleen Kennedy announced today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLpb0c"&gt;Christensen will star opposite his former Star Wars prequel colleague Ewan McGregor, whose reprising his role as the titular character. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/23/20830478/obi-wan-kenobi-standalone-spinoff-series-disney-plus-series-ewan-mcgregor-streaming-star-wars"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Obi-Wan Kenobi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;is set 10 years after the events of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Episode III — Revenge of the Sith&lt;/em&gt;. Anakin Skywalker has become Darth Vader and Obi-Wan is still trying to recover from his greatest defeat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TemnAm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Hayden Christensen returns as Darth Vader, joining Ewan McGregor in OBI-WAN KENOBI. The Original Series begins 10 years after the dramatic events of Revenge of the Sith, and is coming to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DisneyPlus?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DisneyPlus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/9WR2npRUkk"&gt;pic.twitter.com/9WR2npRUkk&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Star Wars (@starwars) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/starwars/status/1337174593639829507?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LqpHzs"&gt;The show was officially announced at D23, Disney’s biennial fan convention, last year. McGregor was onstage at D23 to make the announcement. “It feels so nice to say,” McGregor said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ak29Sp"&gt;Production is set to reprise the role in March 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Star Wars: Andor starring Rogue One’s Diego Luna is coming to Disney Plus in 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D-cSRYefM2vNm1IhpR_GqM6NZl4=/0x0:1194x796/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493978/Screen_Shot_2020_12_10_at_6.15.41_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BOoWpk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Andor&lt;/em&gt;, Disney’s new Disney Plus show starring Diego Luna as Cassian Andor from &lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt;, is launching in 2022, Disney announced at its investor day today. Production began two weeks ago in London, Lucasfilm’s Kathleen Kennedy said during the presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpc5KW"&gt;A brief trailer was shown of early production, which you can watch below. Given that the show is still a ways away, the trailer doesn’t reveal anything about the plot. It does reveal that there will be 12 episodes in the season, though, so that’s good to look forward to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="j1fUM7"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;“Everything I did, I did for the Rebellion.” Andor, an Original Series set in the Star Wars universe, is streaming in 2022 on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DisneyPlus?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#DisneyPlus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/q2IT2qzEeR"&gt;pic.twitter.com/q2IT2qzEeR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Star Wars (@starwars) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/starwars/status/1337174062540308480?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yEYzo6"&gt;I’m a big fan of &lt;em&gt;Rogue One&lt;/em&gt;, so I’m really looking forward to watching this when it debuts in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Noah Hawley is making an Alien TV series for FX and Hulu</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BX_YEwbnTNOA9eAuI0WItIWoY5o=/131x0:1529x932/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493973/Screen_Shot_2020_12_10_at_6.01.43_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Cze57b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fargo &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Legion&lt;/em&gt; showrunner Noah Hawley is stepping into the world of &lt;em&gt;Alien &lt;/em&gt;with a new show at FX. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKLizG"&gt;This marks the first TV series based on the popular movie franchise, according to FX chairman Jon Landgraf, who announced the show at Disney’s investor event today. Disney acquired the rights to the franchise when it acquired 21st Century Fox in 2019. Not much is known about the show, except for a brief description that referred to it as a “scary thrill ride set not too far in the future here on Earth. Hawley spoke briefly about it in an &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/11/fargo-season-4-finale-alien-tv-series-noah-hawley-interview-spoilers-1234622930/"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;at the end of &lt;em&gt;Fargo&lt;/em&gt;’s fourth season this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eyNKuS"&gt;“I know that there’s an effort to reshuffle a lot of things post-Disney takeover and it was a conversation that I had a couple years back,” he said to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;. “But I know that like any studio that there’s a great desire to make the most of one’s library so I wouldn’t be surprised to see something like that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8JOVxI"&gt;Landgraf didn’t give an update on when to expect the show, but said it is currently in development. The last installment in the &lt;em&gt;Alien &lt;/em&gt;franchise was &lt;em&gt;Alien: Covenant &lt;/em&gt;in 2017. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Disney Plus is getting two new Mandalorian spinoffs: Rangers of the New Republic and Ahsoka</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kQzO3SleudvWa07GX8j-64af4lM=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493943/Untitled.5.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XgSR43"&gt;Lucasfilm has announced two new Star Wars TV shows: Star Wars: Rangers of the New Republic, and Star Wars: Ahsoka, both of which will be spinoffs from &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HZXHoI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Ahsoka, a new Original Series, starring &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rosariodawson?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@RosarioDawson&lt;/a&gt; and set within the timeline of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/themandalorian?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@TheMandalorian&lt;/a&gt;, is coming to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/disneyplus?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@DisneyPlus&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ZojpCkhPS7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ZojpCkhPS7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Disney (@Disney) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Disney/status/1337172875204308992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Q3onS7"&gt;The two shows will crossover with future seasons of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian, &lt;/em&gt;and culminate in a “climactic story event.” Disney has yet to reveal much information on the two new projects, but Rosario Dawson is set to return to reprise her role as the live-action Ahsoka Tano. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Zh1MU"&gt;The two series are just several of the new Star Wars shows coming to Disney Plus in the future, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168641/star-wars-andor-cassian-disney-plus-2022-diego-luna"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Andor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168652/hayden-christensen-darth-vader-anakin-skywalker-ewan-mcgregor-obi-wan-kenobi-disney-plus"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Obi-Wan Kenobi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168663/star-wars-lando-disney-plus-justin-simien-tv-show-announcement"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Lando&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Acolyte&lt;/em&gt;, the animated Clone Wars spin-off &lt;em&gt;The Bad Batch&lt;/em&gt;, and the anime anthology &lt;em&gt;Star Wars: Visions&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlUyvt"&gt;Disney has yet to say when exactly to expect either &lt;em&gt;Rangers of the New Republic&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Ahsoka&lt;/em&gt;, but teased that “the next chapter” of the story will debut Christmas 2021. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>x64 emulation has come to Windows on ARM</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Microsoft Surface Pro X" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xrInMzMLbfLewOwTkl-NFEm7q3s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493906/vpavic_191101_3747_0024.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rbVdgP"&gt;Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/12/10/introducing-x64-emulation-in-preview-for-windows-10-on-arm-pcs-to-the-windows-insider-program/"&gt;finally releasing x64 emulation&lt;/a&gt; on Windows for ARM to testers today, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/30/21495510/microsoft-windows-on-arm-x64-app-emulation"&gt;announcing that the feature was coming&lt;/a&gt; back in September. The feature, available to Windows Insiders in the Dev Channel, will allow users to run 64-bit apps that haven’t yet been compiled for their ARM-powered devices. This means that if you just got one of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21526702/microsoft-surface-pro-x-2020-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;the new Surface Pro X&lt;/a&gt;s (and are willing to &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/12/10/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-21277/"&gt;jump through some hoops&lt;/a&gt; and install a Windows update &lt;em&gt;long&lt;/em&gt; before it’s ready for public release), Microsoft says you should be able to play games like &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, or run productivity apps like AutoDesk’s Sketchbook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6L2Kc7"&gt;Whether they’ll run well is a different question. Windows on ARM’s emulation has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20948092/microsoft-surface-pro-x-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;pretty rough in the past&lt;/a&gt;, but even running an app poorly is better than not being able to run it at all. Just don’t expect to see the same emulation performance that your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;ARM Mac brethren&lt;/a&gt; have been seeing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qD83or"&gt;Microsoft hasn’t yet said when the emulation will be coming to the main builds of Windows, but says that it “look[s] forward to the feedback from our Windows Insider community”. Again, this is &lt;a href="https://insider.windows.com/en-us/understand-flighting"&gt;a pre-beta OS&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s not a great idea to install it on a computer you absolutely need to work. But if you simply can’t wait to run 64-bit apps on your ARM-powered Windows device, you can &lt;a href="https://insider.windows.com/"&gt;join the Windows Insider program&lt;/a&gt; and follow &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2020/12/10/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-21277/"&gt;these instructions to get emulation working&lt;/a&gt;. Let’s face it, if you’re running Windows on ARM, you’re probably okay with the cutting-edge lifestyle.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pfizer vaccine gets green light from FDA committee</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Food And Drug Administration Headquarters In Maryland" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jISL6MwrWzmsRrv8_j6BoM1iijw=/0x0:5741x3827/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493778/1227710766.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tXzHxE"&gt;An independent committee of experts recommended Thursday that the Food and Drug Administration authorize the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573072/pfizer-vaccine-effective-authorization-fda-safe"&gt;Pfizer and BioNTech&lt;/a&gt; COVID-19 vaccine for people over the age of 16. Now, the FDA will decide whether to follow that recommendation. The agency could announce a decision within days. If they do authorize the vaccine, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21779433/covid-vaccine-priority-health-care-workers-long-term-care"&gt;health care workers&lt;/a&gt; could begin receiving the shots almost immediately. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRxx1P"&gt;“It’s my hope that the FDA will act soon to accept this,” said Mark Mulligan, director of the NYU Langone Vaccine Center (a trial center for the Pfizer and BioNTech vaccine), in a press conference after the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m3oZPu"&gt;The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee (VRBPAC) met all day to review data on the vaccine, discuss plans for distribution, and outline plans for continued research. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uHZe9d"&gt;FDA scientists published a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22163146/covid-vaccine-fda-review-safe-effective-time-pfizer-biontech"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; about the vaccine on Tuesday, which analyzed data from the pharmaceutical companies and found that the vaccine was safe and 95 percent effective at preventing symptomatic COVID-19. Data from the clinical trial, which included over 43,000 participants, was &lt;a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2034577"&gt;published&lt;/a&gt; in the&lt;em&gt; New England Journal of Medicine &lt;/em&gt;on Thursday and reported the same findings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hxlem1"&gt;In addition to the recommendation, the committee meeting also outlined ways researchers will continue to study the vaccine after it is authorized. The initial trial was in tens of thousands of people, enough to understand how well it works and how safe it is — but the vaccine will eventually be given to hundreds of millions of people. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nTwJq6"&gt;“Despite the completely appropriate size and scope of the trials, it’s always important to monitor vaccines post licensure and post authorization,” Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said in a presentation to the committee on Thursday. “And that’s especially true with COVID-19 vaccines.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WFCqu2"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it’s always important to monitor vaccines post licensure and post authorization”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1Ysu66"&gt;The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the FDA will track the vaccine’s safety with multiple monitoring systems, including some focused on residents in long-term care facilities and people in the military. Pfizer and BioNTech will also monitor the safety of the vaccine. The FDA &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AlecGaffney/status/1337127752412110848"&gt;asked&lt;/a&gt; the companies to include anaphylactic reactions as part of the risks they monitor, after two people had &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-britain-vaccine-idUSKBN28J1D1"&gt;allergic reactions&lt;/a&gt; after receiving the vaccine in the United Kingdom this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dHC0Kw"&gt;Messonnier outlined priorities for continuing to track the vaccine’s ability to protect against COVID-19. In the first few months, experts will watch to see if the vaccine appears to prevent disease as well in the real world as it did in the clinical trials. They’ll also track whether the vaccine can prevent infection with the coronavirus, or transmission of the virus, not just symptomatic disease. Pfizer said during the meeting that it’s collecting data that will show if the vaccine prevented asymptomatic infections, and that it’ll have that analysis in early 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="znQE9M"&gt;“We have data not from humans but from non-human primate studies that would argue that the vaccine does prevent infection,” Kathrin Jansen, head of vaccine research and development at Pfizer, said in the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dry3ki"&gt;The committee also discussed the tricky question of whether Pfizer and BioNTech should tell people who were in the placebo group of the clinical trial that they were in that group, and offer them the vaccine. That would let everyone in the trial get the benefits of vaccination but would cut off the drug company’s ability to collect placebo-controlled data on the vaccine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t56t4r"&gt;Pfizer &lt;a href="https://www.fda.gov/media/144337/download"&gt;proposed&lt;/a&gt; offering the vaccine to people in the placebo group either six months after their second trial dose or when they’re eligible to receive it under the FDA’s authorization. The first group in the US eligible for vaccines under the CDC’s recommendations will be health care workers. There would be enough participants left in the placebo group even if health care workers in the trial took a vaccine to continue the study until the next wave of people became eligible, William Gruber, Pfizer’s senior vice president of vaccine clinical research and development, said in the meeting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CHSZOB"&gt;Next week, the committee will meet again to discuss the COVID-19 vaccine developed by Moderna. That vaccine is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21562309/pfizer-coronavirus-vaccine-gene-based"&gt;same type&lt;/a&gt; of vaccine as the one created by Pfizer and BioNTech, and had a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21569345/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-coronavirus-efficacy-announcement"&gt;similar efficacy&lt;/a&gt; in clinical trials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYKCMU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUyHRS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook won’t make employees get a COVID-19 vaccine before returning to the office</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/com650mbRguhd21S4zE3AoXvqSs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493746/mdoying_180118_2249_facebook_0417stills.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Michele Doying / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5b7AkW"&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg told employees on Thursday during an all-hands meeting that they will not be required to get vaccinated with the COVID-19 vaccine to return to the office once the social media giant begins reopening its facilities, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/mark-zuckerberg-tells-facebook-staff-they-wont-need-a-vaccine-to-return-to-work?via=twitter_page"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The Daily Beast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Facebook employs more than 50,000 corporate employees, a vast majority of which have been working from home since the beginning of the year. &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News &lt;/em&gt;also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/1337124112561438720"&gt;independently verified the news&lt;/a&gt; as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZXJFsk"&gt;The company’s offices have been closed since March, and in May, Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/facebook/2020/5/21/21265699/facebook-remote-work-shift-workforce-permanent-covid-19-mark-zuckerberg-interview"&gt;announced a permanent work-from-home policy&lt;/a&gt; that gave employees the freedom to choose where they work going forward. But the plan since at least August of this year has been to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357768/facebook-extends-remote-work-employees-july-2021-covid-19"&gt;reopen its offices by July 2021&lt;/a&gt;, which is when Facebook employees must declare a permanent residence and opt to either return to work in an office or choose to become a fully remote worker, a decision that may involve decreases in pay depending on where the employee resides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yVaLoJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Despite this, he expressed confidence in the vaccines. He also said that some employees have already started to return to offices abroad in places w/ low COVID numbers.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He did not mention contract content mods who were recently forced to come back in some US offices.&lt;/p&gt;— Ryan Mac   (@RMac18) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RMac18/status/1337128409776881664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 10, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lwVPja"&gt;Throughout its communication regarding remote work, Facebook has said little of how it plans to reopen its offices and, more importantly, what it may require of employees to begin returning to work. Zuckerberg’s internal announcement today marks the first of such declarations, and it makes him the first major tech CEO to stake out a position on whether employees will be required to get vaccinated to return to office work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FhMGtJ"&gt;Facebook did not immediately respond to a request for comment.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Embrace your inner yellow blob with Headspace’s new Netflix meditation show</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/za36vKyxDo4Q_z1xm09Okg3s5bE=/273x0:1622x899/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68493738/headspace_netflic.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Headspace and Netflix are teaming up for a new show on meditation&lt;/em&gt; | Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rPVv9g"&gt;Meditation apps and streaming services have been booming of late, with people locked down and stressed out during the coronavirus pandemic, so the next logical step was for meditation apps to launch streaming shows. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/27/21458335/new-trailers-resident-evil-truth-seekers-queens-gambit-netflix-amazon"&gt;Calm launched &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;World of Calm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; on HBO Max in October, and Headspace has just announced a &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-and-headspace-team-up-for-three-original-series"&gt;three-series deal with Netflix&lt;/a&gt; that kicks off next month with the &lt;em&gt;Headspace Guide to Meditation&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RNmhOi"&gt;Anyone who’s used Headspace will recognize the voice of co-founder Andy Puddicombe, a former Buddhist monk who advises you to “be kind to your mind.” The first series of eight episodes launches January 1st and will teach the benefits of the practice and provide guided meditations. The &lt;em&gt;Headspace Guide to Sleep&lt;/em&gt; and an interactive experience will come later in 2021. (Disclosure: the&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Headspace&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Netflix series is produced by Vox Media, parent company of &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XLTSX3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H77PL7SlI1M?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d3Ntbt"&gt;Headspace has made its content free for a variety of audiences during the pandemic, providing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21181773/headspace-free-health-care-provider-public-health"&gt;premium subscription content&lt;/a&gt; to health care providers and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21209831/headspace-app-new-york-free-content-covid-19-pandemic"&gt;landing page&lt;/a&gt; for New Yorkers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ENYauo"&gt;Helping people relax their brains has been big business during the pandemic, with downloads for Calm and Headspace surging. Earlier this week, Calm raised a new round of funding, putting the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-08/calm-hits-2-billion-value-with-lightspeed-goldman-tpg-backing"&gt;company’s valuation around $2 billion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeMDQB"&gt;The Calm series features episodes “designed to transform your feelings through enchanting music, scientifically engineered narratives, and astounding footage,” with voiceovers from celebrities like Mahershala Ali, Idris Elba, Keanu Reeves, Nicole Kidman, and Kate Winslet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6cPc5m"&gt;The Headspace show will feature 20-minute sessions, with Puddicombe’s voice guiding listeners through different mindfulness techniques to focus on things like sleep and stress with animations and music. It will be subtitled and dubbed in 30 languages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Slv9K"&gt;Just look how calm that little yellow blob creature looks in the trailer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QREpan"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
