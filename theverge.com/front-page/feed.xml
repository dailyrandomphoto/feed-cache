    <title>Walmart’s in-store Gamer Drop will be a bust if you’re looking for new consoles like the PS5 or Switch OLED</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Rt0PYBOnRxkLcojJ-czXOIwglQI=/0x24:672x472/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70224897/k2__dd3aea10_166c_434f_9b7f_7b3287ed4b4e.v1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart’s Gamer Drop prominently features the big three new consoles that are difficult to get.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Walmart&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xEHRxJ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update December 5th, 4:30PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Per &lt;/em&gt;IGN’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TayNixster/status/1467245203283140617"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taylor Lyles&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; and an updated message on the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/gamer-drop/7087317"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart Gamer Drop splash page&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, the event won’t have the new consoles you’re probably looking for, despite featuring them prominently in the artwork. The post below has been updated to reflect this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8XU9j"&gt;Walmart has announced a new &lt;a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/gamer-drop/7087317"&gt;Gamer Drop event&lt;/a&gt; coming to select stores on December 11th, where the retailer is promising to have the “latest gaming titles and consoles.” It’s billing it as a holiday shopping event, complete with discounts and exclusive gear. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="prXoF1"&gt; &lt;a href="https://i5.walmartimages.com/dfw/4ff9c6c9-4866/k2-_331621d6-7642-4095-82d1-ecac1d3f3bc9.v1.pdf"&gt;The posted circular on Walmart’s website&lt;/a&gt; prominently features the major consoles, including the Nintendo Switch OLED Model, Xbox Series X / S, and both models of the PlayStation 5 with the note of “Available in-store or online at &lt;a href="http://Walmart.com/GamerDrop"&gt;Walmart.com/GamerDrop.&lt;/a&gt;” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBT87C"&gt;After the event was announced, Walmart added more text to the notice (you can see the original one in the image below), informing gamers that “PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch OLED will not be available during this event.” It’s unclear whether or not they will have any Xbox Series X consoles on hand, but if there are, then the notice says you will only be able to purchase them as part of an All Access subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jolFad"&gt;This event is exclusive to select Walmart stores. You can find the closest Walmart that’s participating in the Gamer Drop event on Saturday, the 11th, by searching your address or zip code on the &lt;a href="https://www.walmart.com/cp/gamer-drop/7087317"&gt;Gamer Drop&lt;/a&gt; page. Listed stores indicate Gamer Drop hours of 10:30AM to 7PM, which is a limited window compared to store hours of many Walmart stores. We have reached out to Walmart for further details and will keep an eye out for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Walmart Gamer Drop site allows users to search if their local store is participating. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;

    <title>The Verizon app might be collecting your browsing history and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VTuYkY79miGTm3dxd_vXfaWPL7w=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70231632/acastro_200109_1777_verizon_0004.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S0UWrO"&gt;The My Verizon app might be collecting information about your browsing history, location, apps, and your contacts, all in the name of helping the company “understand your interests,” first spotted by &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/culture/verizon-customers-might-want-to-check-their-privacy-settings-asap"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Input&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The program, which Verizon appears to automatically opt customers into, is called Verizon Custom Experience and lays buried in the privacy settings on the app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FEtwFY"&gt;The program introduces two different options that appear in the app, Custom Experience and Custom Experience Plus, each of which varies in terms of invasiveness. Verizon provides additional information about both settings within the app, as well as on &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/support/verizon-custom-experience-programs-faqs/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a FAQ page&lt;/a&gt; on its website. It appears that the Custom Experience option is a stripped-down version of Custom Experience Plus, and as Verizon states directly in the app, it helps Verizon “personalize” its “communication with you” and “give you more relevant product and service recommendations” by using “information about websites you visit and apps you use on your mobile device.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CUQBfA"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;My Verizon's "Custom Experience" and "Custom Experience Plus" settings appear to let the company collect your device location, phone numbers you call, and your browsing history. Via &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/inputmag?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@inputmag&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/nNMLOLqQGv"&gt;https://t.co/nNMLOLqQGv&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/M4CHchHmZi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/M4CHchHmZi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Emma Roth (@emroth08) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/emroth08/status/1467549460075094023?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ksz12I"&gt;Meanwhile, Custom Experience Plus has the same purpose — to help Verizon provide you with a more “personalized” experience. However, it not only uses information about the websites and apps you use on your mobile device, but it also says it uses your “device location,” along with “phone numbers you call or that call you” to help Verizon “better understand your interests.” This also includes your CPNI, which tracks the times and duration of your calls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4sKvUM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It doesn’t appear that users are getting the chance to opt-in&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K8S3iG"&gt;As Verizon explains on its site, it might use your information to, say, present you with an offer that includes music content, or give you a music-related option in its Verizon Up reward program if it knows you like music. Verizon explicitly states that you “must opt in to participate and you can change your choice at any time,” but it doesn’t appear that users are getting the chance to opt-in themselves, or perhaps they’re doing so unknowingly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ToCtG"&gt;After checking the privacy settings on my own app, I found that “Custom Experience” and “Custom Experience Plus” were both already toggled on. I don’t recall ever turning either of these features on, or being asked about it. As Andrew Paul of &lt;em&gt;Input&lt;/em&gt; notes, he only discovered the feature after mistakenly opening a promotional email from Verizon that describes the new program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xx4PS9"&gt;To opt-out of the Custom Experience altogether, open your My Verizon app, and then hit the gear icon in the top-right corner of the screen. Scroll down and select “Manage privacy settings” beneath the “Preferences” heading. On the next page, toggle off “Custom Experience” and “Custom Experience Plus.” To erase the information that Verizon has already collected about you through the program, tap “Custom Experience Settings,” and hit “Reset.” The company says that it won’t sell your information to advertisers and that it will “use it only for Verizon purposes,” but it’s still unnerving either way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fV3HkK"&gt;In April, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22321733/t-mobile-privacy-policy-third-party-advertisers"&gt;T-Mobile started automatically enrolling users&lt;/a&gt; in a program that shares your data with advertisers unless you manually opt-out from your &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fprivacy-center%2Ftake-control-of-your-data&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F12%2F5%2F22818783%2Fverizon-app-data-collection-browsing-history" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;privacy settings&lt;/a&gt;. On &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/privacy/full_privacy_policy.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s privacy center&lt;/a&gt;, the company says that it collects web and browsing information, along with the apps you use, and that you can manage these settings from &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/privacy/rights_choices.html"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Station Eleven, The Matrix Resurrections, The Book of Boba Fett, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U8egd3nYkAzv2HWHDWnLYtryjwo=/284x0:1592x872/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70231469/mackenzie_davis_station_eleven_two.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Mackenzie Davis stars in Station Eleven | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaAG-SwEa7k&amp;amp;ab_channel=HBOMax" target="_blank"&gt;HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y6lf8U"&gt;I finally finished &lt;em&gt;The Beatles: Get Back&lt;/em&gt;, and even though it meandered a lot, I found myself wanting more. &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal’&lt;/em&gt;s Jason Gay &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/i-miss-my-new-best-friends-the-beatles-11638543379?st=0mjtpkgws5h1pit&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;nicely captures what it felt like&lt;/a&gt; to watch this 50-year old footage as a fan, like we were all kinda just hanging out with John, Paul, George, and Ringo as they worked on new material. Highly recommend watching, it will make you question some of the prevailing narratives about the Fab Four (like the widely held belief that they were at each other’s throats constantly as the band neared its breakup). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dk8hn5"&gt;Also! We got some late-breaking news Saturday about the sequel to &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man:  Into the Spider-Verse. &lt;/em&gt;It’s going to be titled &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Across the Spider-Verse, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;will actually be a two-parter, with part one to be released October 2022, and part two following in 2023. Hit that link for the first trailer:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2xh02y"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The first trailer for Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part One) teases a stunning animated sequel","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22817957/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-part-one-sequelanimated-multiverse-miles-morales"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="C8pqve"&gt;The rest of this week’s trailers include a new peeks at a few movies and shows we’ve seen previous trailers and teasers for, and a (fictional) new HBO Max series about people living in a post-pandemic world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6EoPs9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RaAG-SwEa7k?rel=0&amp;amp;start=1" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="JAa7dl"&gt;Station Eleven&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TDk3sf"&gt;Based on the Emily St. John Mandel novel, &lt;em&gt;Station Eleven&lt;/em&gt; is a series about the aftermath of a pandemic whose production was delayed by the real-world pandemic. Twenty years after most of the population was wiped out by the Georgia flu, a band of performers travels the post-apocalyptic landscape staging performances and encountering all manner of survivors including a mysterious person known as The Prophet. (One glimpse of a “museum of civilization” shows a display of some 21st-century relics including “the internet”, a “Switch, Nintendo,” and a “car key fob”). We see both the Before and After Times mainly through the eyes of Kristen, who was a child actress at the onset of the flu and is played by Mackenzie Davis as an adult. Himesh Patel, David Wilmot, Nabhaan Rizwan, Daniel Zovatto, Lori Petty and Matilda Lawler star in &lt;em&gt;Station Eleven&lt;/em&gt;, which begins its 10-episode run December 16th on HBO Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tkKri9"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IgYs_NDyaLs?rel=0&amp;amp;start=60" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="uuJiQz"&gt;The Matrix Resurrections&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="l8BVVu"&gt;I did a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/1/22812697/new-matrix-resurrections-trailer-warner-bros-keanu-reeves"&gt;quick&lt;/a&gt; review/appreciation for this trailer the day it came out and have watched it a few (OK many) times since. We don’t get a lot more insight into the movie’s plot here, except that a main element will be “change.” We do hear a voiceover mention that “maybe this isn’t the story we think it is,” and I hope the movie rolls with this idea! Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Yahya Abdul Mateen II, Jessica Henwick, Jonathan Groff, Neil Patrick Harris, Priyanka Chopra Jonas, Christina Ricci, and Jada Pinkett Smith star in &lt;em&gt;The Matrix: Resurrections,&lt;/em&gt; which comes to theaters and HBO Max December 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TtNOOi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XCAlNWNbN5c?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="57TlAX"&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="X4KDVW"&gt;“I am Boba Fett, left for dead on the sands of Tatooine” this new teaser begins. We see our protagonist submerged in what looks like a &lt;a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Bacta_tank"&gt;Bacta tank&lt;/a&gt; with a breathing apparatus attached to his face, likely explaining what happened to him post-Sarlacc ingestion in &lt;em&gt;Return of the Jedi&lt;/em&gt; (but not how he actually got out). A few characters look surprised to see Boba in this (very brief) new teaser titled “Message.” Temuera Morrison and Ming-Na Wen star in &lt;em&gt;The Book of Boba Fett&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to Disney Plus on December 29th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7BS5ly"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WHXq62VCaCM?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="XEW1qb"&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XNt4ox"&gt;We got a teaser in October, and now we have a full trailer for the eight-episode &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/em&gt; series. John Cena reprises his role from James Gunn’s &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad &lt;/em&gt;(Gunn also created the &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/em&gt; series and wrote and directed most of its episodes), but he’s teamed up here with a new bunch of oddballs to try to keep the peace by assassinating people who are supposedly threats to the US. We see in the trailer that despite his bravado Peacemaker seems to question what he’s really doing and why. Along with Cena, Robert Patrick, Freddie Stroma, Danielle Brooks, Steve Agee, Jennifer Holland, and Chukwudi Iwuji star in &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker,&lt;/em&gt; which comes to HBO Max January 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UsXJBB"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LkV2_4ZsqAQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8aaE7e"&gt;Studio 666&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="W8QtU0"&gt;The premise of this horror/comedy flick: The Foo Fighters are recording a new album in a haunted mansion and some evil and bloody hijinks ensue. We don’t get a whole lot of clues about the plot, but we see Dave Grohl get the demon eyes and start levitating, along with glimpses of monsters, an ostensibly evil book, and other supernatural staples of horror flicks. It looks silly and fun as hell. Grohl, Taylor Hawkins, Nate Mendel, Pat Smear, Chris Shiflett, and Rami Jaffee, along with Whitney Cummings, Leslie Grossman, and Will Forte star in &lt;em&gt;Studio 666&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to theaters February 25th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An interactive Doja Cat music video can introduce you to programming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sZmcFaepP24sNNY_r1haTHYAxr4=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70231226/doja_code_woman_music_video.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Doja Cat codable music video. | Photo by &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://dojacode.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Girls Who Code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R4RMua"&gt;Girls Who Code, the nonprofit organization that aims to get more women and girls interested in the field of computer science, has debuted what it calls the “first ever” codable music video. The organization partnered with Doja Cat, transforming her new music video for &lt;em&gt;Woman&lt;/em&gt; into an interactive experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fS40l4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;HUGE NEWS: We just made the first ever codable music video with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DojaCat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@dojacat&lt;/a&gt;. You can control the story using code   Go try it now at &lt;a href="https://t.co/EgVStNr5om"&gt;https://t.co/EgVStNr5om&lt;/a&gt;! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/dojacode?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#dojacode&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/q2MQhMDd0s"&gt;pic.twitter.com/q2MQhMDd0s&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Girls Who Code (@GirlsWhoCode) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GirlsWhoCode/status/1466784319846944771?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YDVREX"&gt;You can try out the experience for yourself at &lt;a href="https://dojacode.com/"&gt;Dojacode.com&lt;/a&gt;, where you’ll be greeted by a futuristic image of Doja Cat that becomes pixelated as you drag your mouse over the screen. On the next page, you’ll see three stars, each of which represents a different programming language — yellow for CSS; blue for Javascript; and pink for Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zg7bkg"&gt;Once you click the music video, the experience begins. It plays just like Doja Cat’s original music video, only you’ll get to make decisions throughout, sort of like a choose your own adventure game, but with code. The timeline on the bottom of the screen contains four color-coded stars, showing when the video will pause and which programming language will be showcased.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cnCMJ4PtLW_BR5OKDMkhkLGuLc4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23064505/doja_code_video_nails.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Emma Roth / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Typing in a color changes the look of Doja Cat’s nails.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OmrJrz"&gt;When the video stops, you’ll be able to fill in the blanks besides lines of code. For example, the first break lets you change the color of Doja Cat’s nails using CSS; the color you type in alters the color of Doja Cat’s nails in real-time. In another scenario, entering the name of a city changes the time of day in the video, and it even stays true to that location’s current time — after I typed in “Tokyo” at around 10:00AM ET, the sky in the video turned dark and constellations became visible, all in line with Tokyo’s 12:00AM local time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtHBxF"&gt;At the end of the experience, you’ll get snapshots of how each area looked after you finished “coding” it, which the site then lets you download or share to social media. While the DojaCode video doesn’t involve any intense amounts of programming, I still found it fun to experiment with typing in different options and seeing my changes instantly take effect.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Fortnite: Chapter 3 is now live with new island, Spider-Man, and plenty more changes</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z-1PfRxJvbR_4SbZkk8nvk0VbWU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70230178/19BR_KeyArt.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TexQAX"&gt;And then there were three. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22815391/fortnite-the-end-event-chapter-2-recap-highlights-news"&gt;a dramatic live event on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; is moving on to Chapter 3, which introduces some big changes for the battle royale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7Bbec"&gt;This morning developer Epic launched &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/chapter-3-season-1"&gt;season 1&lt;/a&gt; of the new chapter, called “Flipped,” and the most dramatic change is the shift to a fresh, snow-covered island, one that features weather conditions, along with new locations like Sanctuary — which appears to play a large part in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; lore — and the Daily Bugle. Those who pick up the new battle pass will also be able to get their hands on characters like Spider-Man and (eventually) The Foundation, voiced by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson. You can get the full run-down of the battle pass right here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="94buvi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/knAYcg7Tt8E?rel=0&amp;amp;start=1" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qPD4Fk"&gt;(It’s been a busy weekend for spider-news, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22817957/spider-man-across-the-spider-verse-part-one-sequelanimated-multiverse-miles-morales"&gt;a trailer for the sequel to &lt;em&gt;Into the Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt; also dropping&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dYvIt7"&gt;It also appears that the core gameplay will be shaken up quite a bit. Chapter 3 features two new mechanics — sliding and swinging — that could make the experience even faster and more vertical, particularly for high-level players. And for those who spend time in the game’s creative mode, there’s now an option to earn battle pass XP in player-made experiences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDrIdT"&gt;Outside of that, developer Epic is introducing some persistent elements to the game. Here’s how the studio explains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="hD9tXF"&gt;This new chapter brings camps, where players and their squad can heal and store items from match to match — bringing new persistent, social gameplay options to&lt;em&gt; Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. Plus, there are new weapons and items to help win a victory royale and earn the all-new, ultimate prestige — the Victory Crown. Keep winning to keep the crown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Fmcw69"&gt;Many of these details &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22817525/fortnite-chapter-3-leaked-trailer-spider-man-new-island-gears-of-war"&gt;leaked out earlier on Saturday&lt;/a&gt;, ahead of an intense live event that saw the previous island literally flip over. After that the game went down for hours as players stared at their characters adrift in a vast ocean. Once the downtime was over, players washed up on the shore of the new island before getting a pep talk from The Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dcpqea"&gt;You can check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22815391/fortnite-the-end-event-chapter-2-recap-highlights-news"&gt;our full recap&lt;/a&gt; of the event right here, or watch it all in the video below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uAoyWR"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Rasl5UwwNY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xjiVOi"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s second chapter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20905428/fortnite-chapter-2-season-1-release-date-battle-pass-black-hole"&gt;launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt; following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/13/20909812/fortnite-down-black-hole-chapter-2-the-end"&gt;a surprise black hole event&lt;/a&gt;, and similarly led to an all-new island. It spanned eight seasons that included everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670317/fortnite-alien-invasion-season-7-end-event-operation-sky-fire"&gt;an alien invasion&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling"&gt;an Ariana Grande concert&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;a Marvel superhero takeover&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>eBay accidentally suspended ‘a small number’ of users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="EBay Headquarters Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K-p-9XgnfYtA4lTec1lMjfOlO2g=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70230974/1234603350.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xJ3kCT"&gt;eBay inadvertently suspended an unspecified number of users on December 3rd. The platform has since acknowledged the incident, noting that users who were accidentally suspended have received a notification so they can resolve the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJl2ko"&gt;Users across social media began reporting that they’ve been suspended from eBay on Friday, despite not knowingly breaking any rules on the platform. An &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/r8b1rm/ebay_is_apparently_going_on_a_suspending_spree_if/"&gt;entire Reddit thread&lt;/a&gt; on r/ebay is dedicated to the issue, and although the original post has since been deleted, dozens of other users have added their own experiences to the thread. &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/r8b1rm/comment/hn4m6pp/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;One user&lt;/a&gt; describes their own account of the situation, much of which is echoed by other comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XZ5Ywp"&gt;Suspended tonight with no chance of appeal, did an online chat and the woman just told me it wouldn’t be discussed and then cut me off. Member since 1999, 100% positive, haven’t sold anything for years, no disputes, have bought 5 small items over the last month with no issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Qs2k29"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/r8b1rm/comment/hn5fda1/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;Other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/r8b1rm/comment/hn5bs7u/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;users&lt;/a&gt; claim that eBay canceled their bids on products that they’ve already purchased and received, some of which were “Buy It Now” items, which users can buy outright. As for the justification for these bans, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/r8b1rm/comment/hn5e4j3/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;users&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/r8b1rm/comment/hn4pirc/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;say&lt;/a&gt; they got an email from the company saying that they put “the eBay community at risk.” &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/r8b1rm/comment/hn4simb/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;Some&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ebay/comments/r8b1rm/comment/hn50mei/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;amp;context=3"&gt;users&lt;/a&gt; allege that when they contacted eBay’s customer service about it, their bans were upheld, and no further information was given to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rSeIjb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yesterday, a small number of eBay accounts were inadvertently suspended. The issue is resolved &amp;amp; any users who need to take action have been notified. If you still need help, please DM your name, email &amp;amp; zip so we can check it out. ~Beca  &lt;a href="https://t.co/KlP3BGeZjr"&gt;https://t.co/KlP3BGeZjr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ask eBay (@AskeBay) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AskeBay/status/1467223956168052738?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zCV4MI"&gt;Outside of Reddit, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TSteeplejack/status/1466869336732311552?s=20"&gt;users&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Zebulooon/status/1466772689499086853?s=20"&gt;across&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Onioncakes1/status/1466902427102179329?s=20"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; also complained of the seemingly random suspensions that took place on the 3rd. The next day, eBay responded to some of the reports, noting that users can DM the @AskeBay Twitter account with their information to sort out the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJwxag"&gt;“On December 3rd, a small number of eBay accounts were inadvertently suspended,” said eBay spokesperson Trina Somera in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The issue has been resolved and any users who need to take action have been notified. We regret any concern this may have caused.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g28jkJ"&gt;Although eBay has acknowledged the issue, we still don’t know how many users were accidentally suspended, as well as why this occurred. However, we can speculate that the mass suspensions might’ve been caused by some kind of error with eBay’s algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The first trailer for Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part One) teases a stunning animated sequel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TSuGUZhbcNjXJz00BK8RRzS-DnU=/460x0:1972x1008/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70229604/Screen_Shot_2021_12_04_at_7.59.46_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FAreQb"&gt;The first trailer for the highly anticipated sequel to the animated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/28/18115201/spider-man-into-the-verse-movie-review-miles-morales"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; just dropped, revealing both the title — &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part One) &lt;/em&gt;— and the surprise that the upcoming adventures of Miles Morales will actually be a two-part affair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ojuIL"&gt;The first-look trailer picks up right where the last Spider-Verse movie left off: with Miles (Shameik Moore) lying in bed, before a portal to Gwen Stacy (Hailee Steinfeld) and her universe opens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXCqdb"&gt;From there, it seems like &lt;em&gt;Across the Spider-Verse (Part One) &lt;/em&gt;is going to be trying to one-up the already stellar animation of the original film, with Miles bouncing across multiple animated universes in a variety of art styles as he dukes it out with Spider-Man 2099 (Oscar Isaac, who voiced the character in the post-credit scene of the first movie.) &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GoqE05H4JRnpDK541_WdnxGZ_u0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23063667/Screen_Shot_2021_12_04_at_8.14.28_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oEFYAZ"&gt;According to the official description, the upcoming sequel will “transport Brooklyn’s full-time, friendly neighborhood Spider-Man across the Multiverse to join forces with Gwen Stacy and a new team of Spider-People to face off with a villain more powerful than anything they have ever encountered.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6OloYN"&gt;Sony isn’t saying who that villain is (although it’s possible the movie could draw on the 2014 &lt;em&gt;Spider-Verse&lt;/em&gt; comic crossover, which saw the multiverse’s Spider-People under attack from Morlun and the Inheritors), although whatever the threat is, it appears that it couldn’t be contained to just a single film. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QExGhY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse (Part One)&lt;/em&gt; is set to hit theaters on October 7th, 2022, with Part Two set to follow sometime in 2023. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel mail-in repairs have allegedly twice resulted in leaked pics and a privacy nightmare</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bcBWgEOXjkthOdLprXGr52IZhPk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70229533/acastro_180130_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1il5Xu"&gt;After game designer and author Jane McGonigal sent her Pixel 5a to Google for repair, someone allegedly took and hacked her device. This is at least the second report in as many weeks from someone claiming they sent a Google phone in for repair, only to have it used to leak their private data and photographs. McGonigal &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/avantgame/status/1467192779973398531"&gt;posted a detailed account of the situation on Twitter on Saturday&lt;/a&gt; and advised other users not to send their phones in for repair with the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="d7nvn6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yeah, don't send your Google phone in for warranty repair/replacement. As has happened with others, last night someone used it to log into my gmail, Drive, photos backup email account, dropbox, and I can see from activity logs they opened a bunch of selfies hoping to find nudes&lt;/p&gt;— Jane McGonigal (@avantgame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/avantgame/status/1467192779973398531?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4yzw22"&gt;In October, McGonigal sent her broken phone to an official Pixel repair center in Texas. She tweeted later that Google said it never received the phone, and during the ensuing weeks, she was charged for a replacement device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0LDcrt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The photos they opened were of me in bathing suits, sports bras, form-fitting dresses, and of stitches after surgery”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yVbtpF"&gt;But according to McGonigal, FedEx tracking information shows the device arrived at the facility weeks ago. Late Friday night — a few hours after she says she finally received a refund for the device — someone seems to have used the “missing” phone to clear two-factor authentication checks and log in to several of her accounts, including her Dropbox, Gmail, and Google Drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PpG6P9"&gt;The activity triggered several email security alerts to McGonigal’s backup accounts. However, she speculates that whoever has the phone may have used it to access her backup email addresses and then dumped any security alerts into her spam folder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fJj3MV"&gt;“The photos they opened were of me in bathing suits, sports bras, form-fitting dresses, and of stitches after surgery,” McGonigal writes. “They deleted Google security notifications in my backup email accounts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lc3msi"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Google spokesperson Alex Moriconi says, “We are investigating this claim.” It’s still unclear whether the device might have been intercepted within the repair facility or while it was in transit, or who has it now. Google’s &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/9004345?hl=en"&gt;official repair instructions&lt;/a&gt; recommend backing up and then erasing a device before sending it in. Still, as Jane McGonigal points out, that’s either hard or impossible, depending on the damage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4lC6n"&gt;The whole situation reminds us of the security concerns whenever we hand over our devices for repair, and unfortunately, such activity has precedent. In June, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522560/apple-repair-multimillion-iphone-nude-photos-privacy-settlement-pegatron"&gt;Apple paid millions to a woman&lt;/a&gt; after repair technicians posted her nude photos to Facebook. Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22787245/apple-iphone-mac-self-service-program-repair-diy"&gt;recently said it would start selling DIY repair kits&lt;/a&gt;, giving users the chance to fix their own phones, or at least have the task done by someone that a user trusts, as opposed to sending it in or dropping it off at an Apple Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fmMRii"&gt;For Pixel phones, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/10227672?hl=en"&gt;your options for official service&lt;/a&gt; are either via mail-in or, in some countries, local service through an authorized provider. In the US, Google partners with &lt;a href="https://www.ubreakifix.com/"&gt;uBreakiFix&lt;/a&gt; franchises. Whatever phone you have, the options for repairs are still somewhat limited, and you end up having to trust that no one with bad intentions will get their hands on your phone while it’s out of your possession.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="7y7ROd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; big chapter-ending event just ended, and it was a big one. After an all-out war against UFOs, zombies, and the Cube Queen, players were saved in a rescue mission led by Dwayne Johnson. (Well, his in-game character.) Then, the island flipped over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Ltc4yY"&gt;The event&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="rrOiPg"&gt;Let’s back up a bit. The game’s latest season has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/13/22666441/fortnite-chapter-2-season-8-battle-pass-cubes"&gt;all about the cubes&lt;/a&gt;, and right when the event loaded up, a mysterious giant blue cube spawned on the map next to all of the players in my lobby. Jumping at the cube bounced players away, but it otherwise, didn’t do anything beyond loom ominously. We also could look at the Cube Queen in the distance, which has been floating in an energy ball over the center of the island for part of the season. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NyngylDLXA8sXyzize2dhGAAgq4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23063270/IMG_1454.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hello, blue cube.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xyZP7rFCyAS1qvKdo_vUhKGC-l8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23063427/IMG_1457.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cube Queen floats menacingly in the distance.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xW8QJz"&gt;When the even’t countdown clock reached 10 minutes, the Cube Queen’s evil laugh echoed over the island and zombies started spawning in front of our base. Fortunately, weapons were added to everyone’s inventory, so players worked to fend off the incoming zombie troopers (though the zombies didn’t seem to pose any real threat).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MNK_riUlL539Qrsz07GmoNafueA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23063437/IMG_1458.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stay back!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z1YFjl"&gt;When the clock reached zero, an alarm blared over the island, and the Cube Queen’s pyramid shone bright. She launched a beam into the sky that opened up a huge portal revealing a horde of giant UFOs. During the game’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22519431/fortnite-season-7-superman-flying-saucers-aliens"&gt;seventh season&lt;/a&gt;, the island was under the shadow of just one UFO; the Cube Queen had brought an army.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDKtJG"&gt;UFOs and zombies approached the blue cube as players tried to fend them off. But the battle began to look unwinnable, and things went from bad to worse when a UFO blew up the blue cube. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fpGGsy-uxF_jTLehS2yfywUrpME=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23063439/IMG_1465.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yikes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RwJ5A0"&gt;After that, the event took an interesting twist, moving the perspective under the surface of the island to a CGI cutscene. (It was kind of like if Netflix made a &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; TV show.) The game’s main character, Agent Jones, was strapped to a laboratory chair with a device on his head, and Doctor Slone, who betrayed players at the end of last season, was seemingly about to end Jones’ life. Then, a hulking figure known as The Foundation burst in to save the day — and he took off his mask to reveal that he’s played by, &lt;a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/12/02/fortnite-dwayne-the-rock-johnson-teases-his-role-as-the-foundation-in-new-energy-drink"&gt;as suspected&lt;/a&gt;, none other than Dwayne Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfX7Gc"&gt;As Jones and The Foundation tried to get to safety, two other characters dressed similarly to The Foundation rescued players on the surface and brought them down to the inner island. Players were then given control to follow someone called The Scientist to get to Jones and The Foundation. But during the escape, the island began to tip over bit by bit.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DgPM-iYrIV5Gcz4oWBV0kinPzkQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23063440/IMG_1462.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The island began to tip over slowly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="x2bUzD"&gt;Eventually, players made it to Jones and The Foundation at the Zero Point (essentially a big ball of energy that has been a key plot point in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;). The Scientist assured everyone that we were safe, but then one of the giant zombies smashed a window, causing water to rush in and for all of us to be forced out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W38q40"&gt;Soon, my character surfaced and watched as the island slowly tipped up to be completely vertical and then fall the other way. That crushed the Cube Queen, which caused the giant portal with the UFOs to close up. Then the island flipped all the way over revealing a whole new landscape. At a distance, you could see a little bit of the new areas to explore, but a tidal wave quickly swept my player out to sea. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jDiqjZ"&gt;When will Fortnite be back?&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8ymml0JsfclZsh1AYTFxU1dG5h8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23063392/IMG_1464.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: Jay Peters / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just me and the open water.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8U68t5"&gt;Now, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; just shows my player at sea on an empty log. I can’t move, and there’s hardly anything on screen except for me, my log, and the vast open ocean. It’s all reminiscent of the &lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/dca1e75e-a6d7-45c9-bcfe-687edf804521#:~:text=https%3A//www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913541/fortnite%2Dgame%2Dshutdown%2Dblack%2Dhole%2Devent%2Dstorytelling"&gt;bla&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913541/fortnite-game-shutdown-black-hole-event-storytelling"&gt;c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/dca1e75e-a6d7-45c9-bcfe-687edf804521#:~:text=https%3A//www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913541/fortnite%2Dgame%2Dshutdown%2Dblack%2Dhole%2Devent%2Dstorytelling"&gt;k hole&lt;/a&gt; that bridged the transition between Chapters 1 and 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zc195h"&gt;There’s no timer or any sort of indication of when Chapter 3 might be playable. But if you want a sneak peek of what’s to come, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/4/22817525/fortnite-chapter-3-leaked-trailer-spider-man-new-island-gears-of-war"&gt;a leaked trailer&lt;/a&gt; looks to have spoiled a lot of what you can expect. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkeLHf"&gt;This chapter, which kicked off in October 2019 after a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/14/20913541/fortnite-game-shutdown-black-hole-event-storytelling"&gt;multi-day downtime featuring the black hole&lt;/a&gt;, pushed &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338403/fortnite-story-narrative-interview-donald-mustard-epic-games"&gt;growing narrative ambitions&lt;/a&gt; with events featuring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/15/21291458/fortnite-device-event-agency-explosion-water-storm"&gt;first-person storytelling&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21747893/fortnite-galactus-event-chapter-2-season-5-release-date"&gt;an arcade shooter against a Marvel villain&lt;/a&gt;, a thrilling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333635/fortnites-season-6-single-player-event-storytelling"&gt;single-player event to try and stabilize reality&lt;/a&gt;, and even a mission inside &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/12/22670317/fortnite-alien-invasion-season-7-end-event-operation-sky-fire"&gt;an alien mothership full of cubes&lt;/a&gt;. Chapter 2’s concluding event took things another step forward, and now we’ll have to wait and see what Epic has in store for Chapter 3. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard won’t play a part at The Game Awards this year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Game Awards" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Dcd527AmZe8fDHYM2xNpt-Ux18s=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70229215/TGA2020_PosterPack1_PosterB_HD.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Game Awards&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FAxe1p"&gt;Geoff Keighley, the executive producer and host of The Game Awards, sent out a tweet to confirm that outside of its nominations, Activision Blizzard “will not be a part of this year’s #TheGameAwards.” This is in light of claims about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602655/activision-blizzard-employees-accusations-allegations-lawsuit"&gt;the company’s toxic culture&lt;/a&gt;, as well as allegations of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;CEO Bobby Kotick’s history of abuse and harassment&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lzDblY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Beyond its nominations, I can confirm that Activision|Blizzard will not be a part of this year’s &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheGameAwards?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#TheGameAwards&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1467007741214347264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pm3aij"&gt;In an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2021/12/03/game-awards-announcements/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Keighley hinted at Activision Blizzard’s potential removal from the award show, noting that he was contemplating how to “navigate” the situation with the company without harming its developers or employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPUQZG"&gt;Although Activision Blizzard won’t have a role in this year’s Game Awards, the company may still cast some influence over the show. Rob Kostich, the president of Activision Blizzard serves on &lt;a href="https://www.thegameawards.com/about"&gt;The Game Awards’ board of advisors&lt;/a&gt;. While the board doesn’t have a say in terms of which games receive nominations and awards, it still helps “guide and advance the mission” of The Game Awards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="svBS8v"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There is no place for abuse, harassment predatory practices in any company or any community”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eW5G9M"&gt;Other game companies have spoken out about the controversy surrounding Activision Blizzard, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787848/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-calls-out-activision-blizzard-staff-memo"&gt;PlayStation sending out a company-wide notice&lt;/a&gt; to condemn the claims, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789881/microsoft-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-deeply-troubled-by-activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick"&gt;Xbox boss Phil Spencer saying&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft is reevaluating its relationship with the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUpXjR"&gt;“There is no place for abuse, harassment or predatory practices in any company or any community,” Keighley wrote. “We all need to work together to build a better and a more inclusive environment so everyone feels safe to build the world’s best games.”&lt;/p&gt;
