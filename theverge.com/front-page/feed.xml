    <title>YouTube launches PSAs encouraging Americans to get vaccinated</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5Oz8VJ"&gt;YouTube is &lt;a href="https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/covid-19-vaccines-get-back-what-you-love/"&gt;launching a series&lt;/a&gt; of COVID-19 vaccine public service announcements, calling it the “first chapter” of a partnership with the London School of Hygiene &amp;amp; Tropical Medicine’s Vaccine Confidence Project. The ads will start running in the US today and roll out internationally in coming weeks, coinciding with local vaccine availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWG9l5"&gt;YouTube posted a dozen 16-second videos &lt;a href="http://youtube.com/vaccineinfo"&gt;on the company’s channel&lt;/a&gt;, as well as two 31-second clips (one in English, one in Spanish) and a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m4ziIcbb4xI"&gt;longer compilation&lt;/a&gt; stringing them together. The messages encourage people to “get back to what you love” by getting the vaccine, offering reasons like “because birthday songs,” “because roller coasters,” “because wedding receptions,” and “because everything.” YouTube says they’ll run across its platform — as well as television, radio, and paid social posts — through July, aiming to reach Americans between the ages of 18 to 34.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VNaNOY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/m4ziIcbb4xI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Oe7QnP"&gt;All US adults are eligible for a COVID-19 vaccine, and half the adult population has received at least one dose. But vaccination rates have &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/25/world/coronavirus-cases-rising-vaccine-rates-dropping.html"&gt;slowed markedly&lt;/a&gt; in the past weeks. The slowdown coincided with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399228/covid-vaccine-johnson-pause-lifted-fda-cdc"&gt;a now-lifted pause&lt;/a&gt; on the one-dose Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson shot, but it may also reflect the need to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/21/us/politics/coronavirus-vaccine-rates.html"&gt;make vaccination easier and more attractive&lt;/a&gt; for people who weren’t in the first rush of dedicated vaccine hunters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xnNMK"&gt;YouTube says its campaign is aimed at “making sure that people have access to reliable information about the vaccine, including how it was developed and tested, what they can expect when they get the vaccine, and how every person plays a part in the public’s health.” Its blog directs people to earlier vaccine-focused videos with health experts, but the new videos primarily focus on vaccines’ potential to restore “a more normal way of life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIqFUu"&gt;Social networks, including YouTube, have spent recent years reactively &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21573019/youtube-information-panels-fact-check-boxes-covid-19-vaccination-misinformation"&gt;addressing anti-vaccination content&lt;/a&gt; on their platforms. As COVID-19 vaccines have begun rolling out in the US, the Biden administration has encouraged the platforms to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/18/22391004/twitter-facebook-snap-white-house-vaccine-campaign"&gt;promote news about the shots&lt;/a&gt;. Facebook added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/12/22379710/facebook-us-state-covid-19-vaccine-information"&gt;state-level vaccine information&lt;/a&gt; to its News Feed earlier this month, and Twitter recently &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/i/events/1353046517142016001?s=21"&gt;added a prompt&lt;/a&gt; with info from the World Health Organization and other public health agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to unlock your iOS 14.5 iPhone with your Apple Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oMdFEphfvF9abukIpdfb71urPwg=/0x0:6240x4160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69188189/DSCF2033.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BkliOm"&gt;Apple’s iOS 14.5 is out, and with it comes the ability to have your Apple Watch unlock your Face ID-protected phone if you happen to be wearing a mask. This will make it a lot easier to get through your day without having to enter your passcode each time you need to use your phone (because the Face ID can’t recognize you with that mask on). As long as your phone and watch are in close proximity, you will be able to unlock your iPhone just by turning on the screen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMLEZg"&gt;Once you’re officially running iOS 14.5 (and watchOS 7.4), it’s easy to enable the feature that lets you unlock your iPhone with your watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="n9cWI3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10322418"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="huAMks"&gt;Go to Settings &amp;gt; Face ID &amp;amp; Passcode, and scroll down to the new Unlock With Apple Watch option. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jJTFRE"&gt;Toggle it on to turn on the feature. (There’s nothing you have to do on the watch.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="JPijRY"&gt;Now that you have it installed, here’s what you can expect. First, and most important to note, is that your phone isn’t looking for &lt;em&gt;your &lt;/em&gt;face with a mask, it’s looking for &lt;em&gt;a &lt;/em&gt;face with a mask. With this feature on, when my wife was wearing a mask, she was able to unlock my phone with no problem if I was within three or so feet. Apple even warns you about this when you turn the feature on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EpD-gKQYBs0Zk8CSxCmgskqnpas=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22471051/IMG_1328.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple warns you about the fact that your phone will only be looking for a face with a mask. (Note: “Beagle” is the name of my Apple Watch)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mVPWWS"&gt;Apple’s mitigation to this is whenever your Apple Watch is used to unlock your phone, the watch buzzes you, along with a notification saying your phone has been unlocked and a button to lock it. Pressing that lock button immediately locks your phone and requires a passcode on next unlock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="csLdnt"&gt;With that caveat out of the way, so far I’ve had great success with the feature. I tried it with a variety of masks, and it worked with all of them for me. It is worth noting again that the phone is looking for a face with a mask, so this feature won’t help you if your phone is lying on the table and you try to unlock it — because the Face ID camera can’t see you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fteXGe"&gt;Still, I find that not having to put in my passcode every time I want to check my grocery list while shopping is a huge benefit and worth what I consider to be a relatively minor security trade-off. The feature may not be for those with super-secret info on their phones, but for everyone else it’ll be a nice quality-of-life improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SiriusXM acquires Roman Mars’ 99% Invisible and a bigger stake in the podcasting world</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nuSdNUUIRntleMROvShk_Hzv638=/0x489:1500x1489/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69188106/99_Invisible_Logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;99% Invisible’s podcast artwork | Image: Sirius XM Holdings Inc.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NNdeXU"&gt;SiriusXM, a company still best known for its satellite radio stations, &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/siriusxm-acquires-roman-mars-99-invisible-podcast-301276779.html"&gt;is acquiring&lt;/a&gt; podcaster Roman Mars’ company 99% Invisible Inc. for an undisclosed sum. Mars and his team will join the company under Stitcher, the podcasting company Sirius &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21315911/siriusxm-stitcher-podcast-deal-buy-midroll-earwolf"&gt;acquired last summer&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVo0ky"&gt;Mars and the team will continue to host and produce the popular &lt;em&gt;99% Invisible &lt;/em&gt;show, as well as other shows like &lt;em&gt;What Trump Can Teach Us About Con Law&lt;/em&gt;. They’ll also create new shows under Stitcher with that programming being available across platforms, including Sirius’ own Stitcher, Pandora, and SiriusXM apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HIL9SR"&gt;In an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/26/arts/siriusxm-99-invisible-roman-mars.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Mars said he wanted to escape growing “administrative duties” while also giving his staff more resources. Meanwhile, Megan Liberman, head of talk and entertainment programming at SiriusXM, said the move would help Sirius attract more podcast talent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8ENeY"&gt;“We want the best creative talent that’s out there to know that we are a friendly home for them,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0LDdRe"&gt;The competition for big-name talent is immense. This acquisition joins a growing list of independent networks and production companies being bought by larger tech platforms. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22098312/amazon-music-wondery-acquire-buy-podcast-industry"&gt;bought Wondery&lt;/a&gt; last year while Spotify acquired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213462/spotify-podcasts-gimlet-anchor-acquisition"&gt;Gimlet Media&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/26/18282301/spotify-podcasts-parcast-acquisition-gimlet-media-anchor"&gt;Parcast&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/5/21124201/bill-simmons-the-ringer-spotify-acquistion-podcast-purchase"&gt;The Ringer&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 and 2020. Sirius’ radio competitors, like iHeartMedia and Audacy, have also built up their podcast content arsenals: iHeart inked deals with a variety of creators and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287309/podcast-iheart-media-triton-digital-acquire-spotify"&gt;bought an ad tech platform&lt;/a&gt;, and Audacy previously acquired Cadence13 and Pineapple Street Studios, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22356598/entercom-audacy-podcast-network-radio-rebrand"&gt;its own ad tech&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OfgfKY"&gt;Although independent podcasters can now, more easily than ever, record and publish their own shows, they’re vying for ad dollars alongside well-funded tech companies. Some have found success with listener subscriptions on platforms like Patreon, and companies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;like Apple&lt;/a&gt; are looking to build those subscriptions into their apps. However, as more platforms look to build proprietary distribution apps, podcasters’ administrative and management efforts add up and become a bigger job.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14.5 is out now with new Face ID mask features and Apple’s App Tracking Transparency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uxHyIL_pFeBvJfzxv_5DCN6eO0A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187801/akrales_201017_4238_0054.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5wYbbJ"&gt;Apple has begun rolling out iOS and iPadOS 14.5. The latest software update includes the new App Tracking Transparency feature, which lets users decide whether to allow apps to track their activity “across other companies’ apps and websites” for advertising purposes. A pop-up will now appear whenever apps are designed to share your activity in this way. Facebook has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;heavily criticized&lt;/a&gt; Apple over App Tracking Transparency, claiming that it presents “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260274/facebook-prompt-apple-ios-ad-tracking-opt-in-permission-privacy-update"&gt;a false tradeoff&lt;/a&gt; between personalized ads and privacy.” The new option could have a detrimental impact on Facebook’s ad business.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1cuOw"&gt;Apple made a video to explain App Tracking Transparency:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NEfPDq"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ihw_Al4RNno?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x0iFEZ"&gt;Perhaps more important to day-to-day iPhone usage, iOS 14.5 also includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260639/apple-watch-iphone-unlocked-ios-14-5-app-tracking"&gt;a very helpful and timely new trick&lt;/a&gt;: if you own an Apple Watch, you can set your iPhone to automatically unlock without requiring a Face ID match or passcode as long as Apple’s smartwatch is on your wrist. This is designed to make getting into your phone that much quicker while we’re all still wearing face masks so frequently throughout the day. Installing watchOS 7.4 is necessary for this feature to work; that update is also available as of today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="kZiE8D"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use iOS 14.5’s new app tracking blocker ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22403523/ios-14-5-tracking-consent-app-transparency-how-to"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="JJNXDH"&gt;iOS and iPadOS 14.5 include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285963/apple-emoji-ios-14-5-smiley-faces-hearts-more-skin-tones"&gt;a ton of new emoji&lt;/a&gt; with a focus on inclusivity. The update adds the ability to watch Apple Fitness Plus workouts on a TV with AirPlay 2. Apple’s Podcasts app is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22381980/apple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design"&gt;getting a new design&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396042/apple-podcast-subscriptions-launch-price"&gt;optional subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;. The latest video game controllers for the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S are now supported on the iPhone and iPad as of this update. And all iPhone 12 models will allow for 5G connectivity in dual-SIM mode in more countries. Starting with the 14.5 update, Apple will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360502/apple-siri-female-voice-default-new-voices-ios-14-5"&gt;no longer default to a female-sounding voice&lt;/a&gt; for its Siri assistant. Instead, you’ll be prompted to choose your preferred voice during device setup. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fios-14-5-offers-unlock-iphone-with-apple-watch-diverse-siri-voices-and-more%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F26%2F22403554%2Fapple-ios-ipados-14-5-now-available-iphone-unlock-face-mask-app-tracking" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple has a post up&lt;/a&gt; with all of the miscellaneous improvements and additions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hl8z9p"&gt;iOS and iPadOS 14.5 is rolling out to iPhone and iPad users now; you can check the “software update” section in settings to begin the update process right away.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best Amazon Echo deals right now </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mj7LGifJ1euP-dbrplwPMhD36I4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67781485/dseifert_191123_3810_0012.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Echo Show 5 (left), Echo Show 8 (middle), and the Echo Show (right) | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TNieh7"&gt;When it comes to the Echo smart speakers, Amazon has a slew of devices to choose from, one for practically every occasion. For example, maybe you simply want to add Alexa to a room, or you are looking for an Echo device that will allow you to easily manage your other smart home products. Regardless of the reason, these are the best Echo deals currently available right now. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zNwIju"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="maQ5h0"&gt;Last year, Amazon released the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;4th generation of the Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which looks more like a sphere than an actual dot. But if you prefer the previous design, don’t worry — Amazon has not discontinued the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/12/17965806/amazon-echo-dot-3rd-gen-review-alexa-price-specs-features"&gt;3rd-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, which still retains the familiar dot shape. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyVkKL"&gt;During Black Friday and Cyber Monday, we saw the 4th-gen Echo Dot go down to its lowest price of $30, which is what it is going for now at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733331480519791842#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-smart-speaker-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795702%3Fpreselect%3D80770243%26clkid%3D48833994N865a11eb8ae142010a246e3b%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03172021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="LzhwpX"&gt;The 4th-gen Echo Dot Kids Edition is as spherical as its adult version but is designed to look like a tiger or panda. The device also comes with a year of Amazon’s Kid Plus service, which provides access to a slew of kid-friendly content, like audiobooks and games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmKSqg"&gt;We have seen this product go down to $40, which is what it is currently available for now at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Dot-4th-Gen-Kids/dp/B084J4QQK1?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725323423176814123#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-kids-edition-with-parental-controls%2F-%2FA-81795703%3Fpreselect%3D81502548%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="wOHvPj"&gt;The 4th-gen Amazon Echo smart home hub has also gotten an updated look. Like the 4th-gen Echo Dot, the 2020 Amazon Echo has a sphere-shaped design, but it’s noticeably bigger than the Echo Dot. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JjodUT"&gt;Currently, the fourth generation Echo available for $100 (usual price) at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733330369536034962#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-4th-gen-smart-home-hub-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-81795705%3Fpreselect%3D80770246%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergebestechodeals02252021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xiNGuc"&gt;If you are looking for a pair of Amazon Echo devices, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589613981487950#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy is selling an Amazon Echo two-pack for $180&lt;/a&gt;, which knocks $20 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="cZGT85"&gt;If you’re interested in an Alexa smart speaker with better audio quality and Dolby Atmos support, the Echo Studio is the Amazon product to check out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8dmbf"&gt;There are no deals currently available for the Echo Studio, but it is available for purchase at its usual price of $200 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Echo-Studio/dp/B07G9Y3ZMC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1725325990660946512" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="WiqTO4"&gt;If you are looking for an Echo device that functions more as a smart clock than an entertainment speaker, the Echo Show 5 is the one to consider. The Echo Show 5 includes a 5.5-inch display, making it easy to fit just about anywhere inside your home. Not only does the device include a built-in camera, but there’s also a physical shutter on the device, allowing you to block the camera’s view while keeping the always-on microphone active. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wsps6q"&gt;The Echo Show 5 usually costs $90 and we have seen it go down as low as $45. At the moment, the Echo Show 5 is on sale for $80 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07HZLHPKP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589653641321861" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-5-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-77282772%3Fpreselect%3D76612867%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="xJmJw1"&gt;Amazon also has a few bundles available; you can get an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B089Q2RJH9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and three months of Amazon Kids Plus&lt;/a&gt; for $81, an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086P992GD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $90, and an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07SW188FP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 plus an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $100. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVFAcO"&gt;Best Buy is currently selling a bundle with the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1730445461281046110#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 and a 1080p Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt; for $85.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="efoU4U"&gt;Amazon’s Echo Show 8 features an eight-inch display; it costs $40 more than the Echo Show 5. When stacked up against the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/22/18005724/google-home-hub-digital-photo-frame-review-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Google Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt;, which is its closest competitor in terms of price and functionality, the Echo Show 8 is the better option for a few reasons: it has a slightly larger display, better speakers, and a camera, allowing you to use it as a video chatting device, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188551/amazon-echo-group-calling-video-voice-calls-feature-available" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zoom calls&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hcMAEq"&gt;We have seen the Show 8 go down as low as $65. The Echo Show 8 is currently on sale for $105 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07PF1Y28C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1723589734209430134#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-8-hd-8in-smart-display%2F-%2FA-81795783%3Fpreselect%3D78656158%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%26clkid%3D7eebb553N627e11ebb06342010a246e3d%26lnm%3D81938%26afid%3DVox%2520Media%26ref%3Dtgt_adv_xasd0002%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=VergeEchoDeals03012021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="x04s5v"&gt;There are also a few bundles available for a few dollars more. For $115 you can get &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086ZND1QQ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an Echo Show 8 and a 1080 Wi-Fi security camera&lt;/a&gt;; or an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07YD5WDCB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 8 with an adjustable stand&lt;/a&gt; for $135. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="VVGDbb"&gt;Recently, Amazon released a third-generation Echo Show 10. This device features a 10.1-inch HD screen and unlike the Show 5 and 8, this model allows you to adjust the angle of the screen. It is also mounted on a motorized swiveling base that lets the screen follow you as you move. If you plan on doing a lot of video calling, this is the model to get.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z9Ka9y"&gt;We have seen the latest Echo Show 10 gett discounted as low as $200, but no active deals are available right now. But, if you want to buy this product, you can get it for its usual  $250 price at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VHZ41L8?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733329406175831312#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Famazon-echo-show-10-3rd-gen-hd-smart-display-with-alexa%2F-%2FA-82381551&amp;amp;sharedid=vergedeals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford’s GT version of the Mustang Mach-E starts at $59,900</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YaC-iV8tBQfqEjSiaGpD1oz-qeU=/0x0:4193x2795/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187598/2021_Mustang_Mach_E_GT_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Ford&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zfTCn1"&gt;Ford will start taking orders for the GT and GT Performance variants of its first electric Mustang on Wednesday, and it has finally revealed how much they’ll cost. The GT version starts at $59,900, while the Mustang Mach-E GT Performance has a starting price of $64,900 (before tax, title, registration, and delivery fees).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dwcd2M"&gt;Both new versions of the Mustang Mach-E pack a more powerful wallop than the more affordable variants, and they come standard in an all-wheel drive configuration. In the Mustang Mach-E GT, that means a peak output of 480 horsepower and 600 pound-feet of torque and the ability to go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 3.8 seconds. The GT Performance has the same peak of 480 horsepower but 634 pound-feet of torque, which helps it get to 60 mph in just 3.5 seconds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nKP5Nw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Higher price tag, but it packs more of a wallop&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iiFyMf"&gt;That puts the GT versions of the Mustang Mach-E in contention with Tesla’s Model Y performance variant, which starts at $60,990, has around 450 horsepower, and can go from 0 to 60 mph in 3.5 seconds. On paper, though, the Model Y still outclasses the electric GT Mustangs when it comes to range. The Environmental Protection Agency rates the Model Y Performance at 303 miles on a full charge, while Ford says it’s targeting 250 miles for the Mustang Mach-E GT and 235 miles for the GT Performance. (More affordable versions of the Mustang Mach-E get anywhere from 211 miles to 305 miles, depending on the configuration.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0fiUEl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10466590"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NCzNmR"&gt;Of course, Ford doesn’t just want to be compared to Tesla, and in the press release it issued Monday, the company points out that the new GT variants of the Mach-E boast the same amount of horsepower as the gas-powered V8 Mustang Mach 1 but with more torque. The only more powerful Mustang Ford sells is the Shelby GT500, which has a supercharged V8 that packs nearly 800 horsepower. The Mach 1 starts at around $53,000, while the Shelby starts at nearly $73,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SOYlRH"&gt;The GT versions of the electric SUV also have a track mode (in addition to the three standard driving modes that already exist on the Mustang Mach-E), which “provides more performance-oriented traction and stability control tuned specifically for track use,” according to Ford. And to really hammer home the performance aspect, the new track mode increases the volume of &lt;a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2020/08/28/a-new-breed-of-sound-mustang-mach-e-sci-fi-drive-tones.html"&gt;the interior motor noise Ford designed for the Mustang Mach-E&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WoYUHO"&gt;There are a few other touches that separate these electric Mustangs. The pony logo on the front grille lights up, and there is a big GT badge at the rear. Ford’s GT logo is also stitched into the center console. Both come with red brake calipers and have Ford Performance seats in the front row. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="m1RNT1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The arrival of the GT variants marks the end of the Mustang Mach-E’s first chapter&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P9cgMs"&gt;Buying a GT variant is also the only way to get a Mustang Mach-E in Ford’s “cyber orange” paint color option. It comes in the similarly bright “grabber blue,” too, which was previously only available on the limited-run “First Edition” Mustang Mach-E. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EkEbF0"&gt;The arrival of the Mustang Mach-E GT and GT Performance is the end of a chapter of sorts for Ford, as it has now debuted all of the variants of the first electric Mustang, which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2019/11/17/20967565/ford-mustang-mach-e-electric-suv-specs-price-la-auto-show-2019"&gt;announced back in November 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Early sales of the electric SUV &lt;a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131783_ford-mustang-mach-e-moving-quickly-off-dealer-lots-sales-on-pace-with-early-estimates"&gt;are meeting Ford’s expectations&lt;/a&gt;, despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373903/mustang-mach-e-deep-sleep-12v-battery-jump-start"&gt;a number of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/5/22316055/ford-mustang-mach-e-recall-loose-bolt-delivery-delays"&gt;relatively isolated issues&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311594/ford-mustang-mach-e-delays-quality-free-charging-cash-back"&gt;some of the first&lt;/a&gt; Mustang Mach-Es that made it to customers. The GT variants should add to that momentum while boosting profits. As they start hitting the road, heads will inevitably turn to what Ford has waiting in the wings: &lt;a href="https://www.autoblog.com/2021/03/12/ford-f150-electric-truck-spy-photos/"&gt;an all-electric F-150&lt;/a&gt; and, perhaps one day, an electric Mustang sedan.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify is raising prices for lots of its plans</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="05K0T1"&gt;Spotify is increasing the price of many of its subscriptions this week across the UK and parts of Europe, with the US seeing a hike to Family plans. Subscribers have started to receive emails informing them of the changes, and they will affect Student, Duo, and Family plans across parts of Europe and the UK, and Family subscriptions in the US from April 30th. Single Spotify Premium subscriptions are unaffected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1KQnk"&gt;Spotify family is increasing from $14.99 to $15.99 per month in the US. Fortunately, Duo, Premium, and Student pricing will remain the same... for now. The bigger hits to pricing will affect users in the UK and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7S1AWv"&gt;In the UK, Spotify Student is increasing from £4.99 to £5.99 per month, with a Duo subscription (for two people) moving from £12.99 to £13.99 a month . Family users will also be hit with price increases, with the Spotify Family plan (up to six accounts) jumping from £14.99 to £16.99 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="jPHcga"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Spotify’s miniplayer for Facebook launches today","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22399965/spotify-facebook-integration-mini-player-music-podcasts"},{"title":"Spotify reportedly won’t take a cut from podcasters who sell in-app subscriptions ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399123/spotify-podcaster-subscription-fees-revenue"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0DIet6"&gt;Similar price increases will affect Spotify users in some European countries, too. Ireland and a handful of other European countries will see both Student and Duo increasing by a euro each per month, to €5.99 and €12.99 per month respectively. The Family plan in Europe is also increasing from €14.99 to €17.99 per month. Some countries in Asia and South America will also see similar price increases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFVY0h"&gt;All existing Spotify subscribers in the US, Europe, and UK users of Spotify will have a one-month grace period before prices are automatically increased, so existing subscribers will see an increase during the June period of billing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sCOnVb"&gt;Spotify confirmed the increases in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s likely we’ll see US pricing changes shortly, too. “We offer a variety of subscription plans tailored to our users’ needs, and we occasionally update our prices to reflect local macroeconomic factors and meet market demands while offering an unparalleled service,” says a Spotify spokesperson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5b4Jxv"&gt;Spotify’s price increases come just months after the company revealed it now has more than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/3/22262508/spotify-q4-2020-earnings-subscriber-numbers-users-podcasts-audiobooks"&gt;150 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. Despite this, Spotify still made a loss of €125 million in the recent quarter, and average revenue per user also fell by 8 percent. Spotify is due to post its latest earnings on Thursday, which will provide even more insight into why prices are increasing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6bJUEX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, April 26th 12:50PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated with additional details on markets affected.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>China censored social media posts about Chloé Zhao’s Oscar win </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="93rd Annual Academy Awards - Show" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fFB8A6emya_0gZRI60fcafRyRqQ=/0x61:5000x3394/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187267/1314443349.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Chloé Zhao accepts the Directing award for ‘Nomadland’ | Photo by Todd Wawrychuk/A.M.P.A.S. via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d4pHVL"&gt;The news of Chloé Zhao’s Oscar win for Best Director has been censored on social media and search engines in China at the direction of the country’s propaganda ministry, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/china-censors-nomadland-director-chloe-zhaos-oscar-win-11619440550?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Zhao, who was born in Beijing, is the first Chinese woman and first woman of color to take home the Academy Award for directing. &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22403117/oscars-2021-winners-losers-nomadland-anthony-hopkins-chadwick-boseman-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt; also won Best Picture&lt;/a&gt; at Sunday night’s awards ceremony, and the movie’s star, Frances McDormand, won Best Actress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWIC4J"&gt;But according to the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;, early messages congratulating Zhao had been scrubbed from Chinese social media sites by midday Monday, and searches on Chinese search engines Baidu and Sogou had few links to the Oscar news. There was no news about Zhao’s win on China Central Television, the &lt;em&gt;Xinhua News Agency&lt;/em&gt;, or the Chinese Communist Party’s &lt;em&gt;People’s Daily&lt;/em&gt; on Monday, the &lt;em&gt;Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported; according to a state media reporter, the country’s propaganda ministry told the outlets not to report the win due to “previous public opinion.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1vaaSu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Global Times&lt;/em&gt;, a news site owned by &lt;em&gt;People’s Daily&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202104/1222108.shtml"&gt;posted an op-ed late Monday&lt;/a&gt; acknowledging Zhao’s win but criticizing &lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt; as “typically American and far from the real life of the Chinese people.” Of Zhao, the &lt;em&gt;Global Times&lt;/em&gt; wrote: “We hope she can become more and more mature. In an era when the China-US confrontation is intensifying, she can play a mediating role in the two societies and avoid being a friction point. She cannot escape her special label, and she should actively use it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T009IK"&gt;Another of the few news stories that did surface in China about Zhao’s win came from small news site 163.com, which called Zhao the “second Chinese filmmaker to win the best director Oscar, after Ang Lee,” &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/chloe-zhaos-oscars-glory-met-with-media-silence-in-china"&gt;according to&lt;em&gt; The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Lee, who won Best Director twice, for &lt;em&gt;Brokeback Mountain&lt;/em&gt; in 2006 and for&lt;em&gt; Life of Pi&lt;/em&gt; in 2013, was born in Taiwan. China considers Taiwan to be part of China, a matter of &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-34729538"&gt;some contention internationally&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q8qtiX"&gt;It’s not the first time &lt;em&gt;Nomadland&lt;/em&gt; and its director have been hidden by Chinese media; last month, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/beijing-media-social-media-asia-chloe-zhao-c7aa576fd66d66204ec37371196ea569"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Associated Press &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; that social media posts and other publicity about the movie were removed by China’s censors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJZTT4"&gt;The reason for China’s erasure of Zhao’s win likely stems from her comments in Western media outlets. She said in a 2013 interview with &lt;em&gt;Filmmaker&lt;/em&gt; magazine that China was a “place where there are lies everywhere,” a comment that was later removed from that article, according to the &lt;em&gt;AP, &lt;/em&gt;but not before it drew considerable backlash in China. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roku could lose YouTube TV in standoff with Google</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Roku 4" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n9R174f6TvqgPwTqou31dtHyPU4=/0x0:2560x1707/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187150/20151026-roku-4-tv-4k-14.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="csNCoI"&gt;The YouTube TV app could disappear from Roku devices in the coming days, according to an email sent to subscribers on Monday. In a last-ditch effort, Roku is calling on subscribers to reach out to Google to “urge them” to reach an agreement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7cc4U7"&gt;In a statement issued Monday, Roku accused Google of attempting to control the platform’s user experience in a way that favors its own products as the two companies negotiate a contract renewal for YouTube TV. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V3aPSr"&gt;“Google is attempting to use its YouTube monopoly position to force Roku into accepting predatory, anti-competitive and discriminatory terms that will directly harm Roku and our users,” a Roku spokesperson said in a statement Monday. “It should come as no surprise that Google is now demanding unfair and anti-competitive terms that harm Roku’s users.”​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CwJrNp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It should come as no surprise that Google is now demanding unfair and anti-competitive terms”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GePG1N"&gt;According to Roku, Google’s demands condition Roku’s access to host the YouTube TV app on providing preferential treatment for Google’s separate YouTube app. These demands include providing Google with special access to consumer data and for Roku to build a dedicated search result row for YouTube in the platform’s interface. In addition, Google has called for Roku to meet specific hardware specs, Roku said. Google has its own Chromecast device that competes directly with Roku.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bjxXiU"&gt;While smaller than Google as a company, Roku currently controls nearly 45 percent of set-top box viewing time and has significant leverage over apps as a result. When HBO Max failed to secure a deal with the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280279/roku-hbo-max-dispute-streaming-connected-tvs-amazon-fire-apple-channels-warnermedia"&gt;for its launch last summer&lt;/a&gt;, the gap was seen as a significant hurdle for the new service — and a minor inconvenience for Roku itself. Still, Roku insists it is not seeking any additional money from the YouTube TV partnership and that its only goal is avoiding terms that favor Chromecast hardware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXDnGw"&gt;“We have been working with Roku in good faith to reach an agreement that benefits our viewers and their customers. Unfortunately, Roku often engages in these types of tactics in their negotiations. We’re disappointed that they chose to make baseless claims while we continue our ongoing negotiations,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; Monday. “All of our work with them has been focused on ensuring a high quality and consistent experience for our viewers. We have made no requests to access user data or interfere with search results. We hope we can resolve this for the sake of our mutual users.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v66pyC"&gt;Roku’s blistering allegations come amid a series of massive antitrust investigations into Google by the Justice Department, state attorneys general, and Congress. Last week, Google testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee’s antitrust panel regarding the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22396544/apple-app-store-google-play-monopoly-antitrust-bill-hearings"&gt;Play Store and the fees it charges&lt;/a&gt; to app developers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="scHXFP"&gt;“Google is already under fire from governments around the world for manipulating search results,” the Roku spokesperson said. “It is outrageous that Google would now try to insist on manipulating Roku’s search results as well.”​&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sa0EhF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated April 26, 2021 at 12:25 PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added a statement from Google.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A first look at playing Steam PC games on Xbox with mouse and keyboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m74zKArdUICtsmKR6cxjh_0QuJY=/1x0:2058x1371/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69187147/steamxboxgames.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TMug4E"&gt;Microsoft’s new Chromium-based Edge browser is coming to Xbox soon, and the company has now added all-important mouse and keyboard support that will pave the way to stream PC games to Xbox consoles. Xbox testers in the Alpha Skip-Ahead ring are now able to access this new version of Edge and try out a mouse in the console version of the browser for the first time. I’ve been testing this new support over the weekend, and I’ve even managed to play some Steam PC games on my Xbox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9mLTv"&gt;Despite a few obvious bugs here and there — as this is very much an early beta browser — it works as expected. I’ve been able to write documents using Word online, type messages into Discord chats, and even play some &lt;a href="https://krunker.io/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Krunker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.quakejs.com/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quake JS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; through the browser with a mouse and keyboard. Basic mouse navigation, scrolling, and right-click all work here just fine.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wGq6rh3CtX55loi8vsUjO0WU6iQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470549/krunkerxbox.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Krunker on an Xbox with mouse and keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Uk2WaR"&gt;Where things really get interesting is when you consider what this will mean for the future of streaming games to an Xbox through a browser. Currently, I can stream Google Stadia games and use mouse and keyboard on the Xbox, but I’ve also been able to successfully stream PC games from Steam to an Xbox through the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lWWVTV"&gt;I’ve played &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Death Stranding&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;DOTA 2&lt;/em&gt;, and a bunch of other PC games that simply aren’t available on Xbox right now. I’ve been able to do this using &lt;a href="https://parsec.app/"&gt;Parsec&lt;/a&gt;, which is essentially a remote desktop app that lets you stream what’s on your PC to a browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PXqwQC"&gt;It’s not the most ideal experience on the Xbox right now, as the virtual keyboard appears when you click, and latency / connectivity isn’t always the best, but it’s a good example of what’s possible with this new mouse and keyboard support. Microsoft’s head of Xbox, Phil Spencer, has already &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/XboxP3/status/1384154390630592521"&gt;recently committed&lt;/a&gt; to bringing full PC games to the Xbox through the company’s Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud) service.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0WkIRmjt26mGzNnkM8_AqBvvmW4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22470553/F6JN32q.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can remote-control a PC using Microsoft Edge on Xbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wryiPu"&gt;We don’t know exactly when those PC games will arrive on xCloud, as right now, Microsoft is only currently publicly testing Xbox games via the browser using either a controller or touch controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFIaPd"&gt;This new Edge browser with full mouse and keyboard support simply opens up a lot of opportunities for the Xbox to access games that aren’t typically available on the console. That even includes accessing Sony’s PC ports like &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Days Gone&lt;/em&gt;, and more if you stream them to the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PMrI7p"&gt;For now, we’re waiting on Microsoft to finalize this Edge browser and make it available to all Xbox owners, and for services like Nvidia’s GeForce Now to stop blocking Edge so the dream of playing PC games on Xbox consoles is a step closer to reality.&lt;/p&gt;
