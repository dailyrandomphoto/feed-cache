    <title>UK schools are using facial recognition to take pupils’ lunch money</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Facial Recognition" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vZ5e23-ewOCItEvkj2nILzecKYQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70009630/jbareham_170417_1617_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NVWEFs"&gt;A group of nine schools in the UK have started using facial recognition to verify children’s payments for school meals. The schools in North Ayrshire in Scotland claim that using the technology is faster and more hygienic than taking payments using cards or fingerprint scanners, but privacy advocates warn that the move is normalizing biometric surveillance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UC4My7"&gt;“With Facial Recognition, pupils simply select their meal, look at the camera and go, making for a faster lunch service whilst removing any contact at the point of sale,” reads a flyer &lt;a href="https://www.north-ayrshire.gov.uk/Documents/EducationalServices/facial-recognition-parental-flyer.pdf"&gt;distributed to parents&lt;/a&gt; by the schools. An &lt;a href="https://www.north-ayrshire.gov.uk/Documents/EducationalServices/facial-recognition-faqs.pdf"&gt;FAQ sheet&lt;/a&gt; says that children’s biometric data is stored in an encrypted form and deleted when a child leaves the school. Parents have to opt-in for children to use the technology, and can alternatively use PIN to verify payments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="k5n1aj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Parents have to opt-in to use the technology&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2NSWqR"&gt;David Swanston, managing director of CRB Cunninghams, the firm responsible for installing the technology, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/af08fe55-39f3-4894-9b2f-4115732395b9"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that facial recognition cut payment time per pupil to five seconds on average. Swanston said pilots of the system had begun in 2020, and that 65 more schools were signed up to introduce the technology. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xkr7zH"&gt;As reported by the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt;, North Ayrshire council claims that 97 percent of children or parents consented to be enrolled. But some parents said they were not sure if children fully understood what they were signing up for, and were influenced by peer pressure. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RFCfuqBSjU-5VhO1mJYwu3VYvBs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22935274/Screen_Shot_2021_10_18_at_9.49.02_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: North Ayrshire council&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A leaflet explaining the technology was distributed to parents ahead of the enrollment. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qclLnV"&gt;Facial recognition systems of various types are becoming more common throughout the world. Schools in the United States have been installing &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/12/20/21028124/schools-facial-recognition-mass-shootings"&gt;such systems for years&lt;/a&gt;, though usually as a security measure. Last week, Moscow &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/oct/15/privacy-fears-moscow-metro-rolls-out-facial-recognition-pay-system"&gt;introduced facial recognition payments&lt;/a&gt; in its metro system, with activists warning that the technology could be used to track and identify protestors. Various &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21429960/portland-passes-strongest-facial-recognition-ban-us-public-private-technology"&gt;states&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557516/maine-facial-recognition-ban-state-law"&gt;and&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/14/18623013/san-francisco-facial-recognition-ban-vote-city-agencies"&gt;cities&lt;/a&gt; in the US have banned facial recognition, arguing that the technology is frequently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21031255/facial-recognition-algorithm-bias-gender-race-age-federal-nest-investigation-analysis-amazon"&gt;biased&lt;/a&gt; across racial or gender lines. In the European Union, too, politicians and advocacy groups are &lt;a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/european-parliament-ban-facial-recognition-brussels/"&gt;calling for a ban on the technology&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that the downsides of its introduction outweigh potential benefits. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BMJcCg"&gt;Silkie Carlo of the UK campaign group Big Brother Watch told the &lt;em&gt;FT&lt;/em&gt; that the Ayrshire school scheme was unnecessary. “It’s normalising biometric identity checks for something that is mundane,” said Carlo. “You don’t need to resort to airport style [technology] for children getting their lunch.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Pixel 6 might start at a relatively affordable $599</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gvuijt355hlT98Haqc5CtsMGe3U=/448x0:7198x4500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70009616/Google_Pixel_6__Portfolio_Shot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixel 6 and 6 Pro lineup.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s1StdY"&gt;The Pixel 6’s price could start at $599 with 128GB of storage, while the 128GB Pixel 6 Pro could start at $898, according to early US pricing at Target stores spotted by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thisistechtoday/status/1449909532939804678"&gt;M. Brandon Lee&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EvanLei1/status/1449875442953949184"&gt;Evan Lei&lt;/a&gt;. Lei posted a photo of pricing already displayed on Target’s shelves, while Lee has images of the retailer’s inventory system showing the same prices. A “street date” for both phones (aka their release dates) is listed as October 28th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfvImM"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayOD9qDsSq0"&gt;Lee has previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the European starting prices of the Pixel 6 and the Pixel 6 Pro will be €649 and €899 respectively, while &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rquandt/status/1449810859807608836?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1449810859807608836%7Ctwgr%5Ehb_2_7%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2F9to5google.com%2F2021%2F10%2F17%2Fpixel-6-us-price%2F"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WinFuture&lt;/em&gt;’s Roland Quandt&lt;/a&gt; has discovered Amazon UK listings that show the 128GB Pixel 6 Pro priced at £849, with a shipping date of November 1st. The Pixel 6 Pro with 256GB of storage could cost £100 more at £949.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xE8uCQ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Here are the corroborated &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel6?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pixel6&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Pixel6Pro?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Pixel6Pro&lt;/a&gt; prices in the Target inventory system in the US.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Pixel 6: $599&lt;br&gt;Pixel 6 Pro: $898&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Google has to be subsidizing this phone like crazy. This is insanity. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/teampixel?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#teampixel&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/OUBl8cXCBh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/OUBl8cXCBh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— M. Brandon Lee | THIS IS TECH TODAY (@thisistechtoday) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thisistechtoday/status/1449909532939804678?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 18, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6h2Dhq"&gt;If accurate, these prices are much more affordable than what we expected after Google said it was making an “ultra high end” smartphone in August. Google’s hardware chief Rick Osterloh even said that the new phone would “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;certainly be a premium-priced product&lt;/a&gt;,” which suggested pricing of over $1,000. Instead, these starting prices are cheaper than the midrange &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5&lt;/a&gt; that debuted for $699 last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqI3wS"&gt;Google is poised to announce its latest smartphones at an event &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22691850/google-pixel-6-event-2021-fall-announcement"&gt;taking place on Tuesday at 1PM ET / 10AM PT&lt;/a&gt;. The two phones will be Google’s first to run its own Tensor processor, and could support face-unlock, up to 23W wireless fast charging via a new Pixel Stand, and come with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/9/22718007/google-pixel-6-leak-teases-magic-eraser-camera-five-years-android-security-updates"&gt;five years of Android security updates&lt;/a&gt;. If you want a closer look at the phones ahead of their official launch, plenty of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22729135/google-pixel-6-pro-leaked-photos-images-renders-evan-blass"&gt;images of the handset have leaked&lt;/a&gt; showing every aspect of their design.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: The Beatles: Get Back, Narcos: Mexico, The Batman, Hawkeye, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oaoHt7O247YY9ceXTJ8Q83tHDPc=/170x0:1216x697/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70008384/the_beatles.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Beatles prepare for their final live show, part of a “new” documentary from Disney. | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Auta2lagtw4&amp;amp;ab_channel=WaltDisneyStudios" target="_blank"&gt;Disney&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mIbAHx"&gt;Happy &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt; day to all of us who are celebrating, the show returns tonight and I look forward to being welcomed back by the dissonant piano chords of its theme song and the utter lunacy of the Roy family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HACFgn"&gt;Yesterday at DC FanDome we got to see a slew of new trailers for games, TV shows, and movies; the biggest of course was the latest trailer for &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt;, with the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheRock/status/1449422941142196224?s=20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Adam&lt;/em&gt; teaser&lt;/a&gt; a close second. Plenty of non-superhero trailers this week as well, including a new teaser for &lt;em&gt;The Tragedy of Macbeth&lt;/em&gt;, a new season for &lt;em&gt;Narcos: Mexico, &lt;/em&gt;another peek at &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye, &lt;/em&gt;a time-traveling flick with a corny name, and a look at the “new” Beatles documentary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EIbzSf"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Auta2lagtw4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5fL6tb"&gt;The Beatles: Get Back&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xRCAql"&gt;As the story goes, a film crew got access to document The Beatles at work in 1969, but the footage has been locked in a vault until now, and has been restored by filmmaker Peter Jackson (with the blessing of the surviving Beatles and their families). The group had three weeks to write and record a new album and it’s really fascinating to see the four of them work through what were half-written songs then, that we now know well, and argue over whether to do a live show. And as usual, Paul McCartney looks unbelievably young. It’s really poignant when you realize the film is leading up to what will be their last live performance, on a London rooftop. &lt;em&gt;The Beatles: Get Back, &lt;/em&gt;directed by Peter Jackson&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;will roll out over three days —November 25th, 26th, and 27th— on Disney Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="w2d71w"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vyXUaNhqpqE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="V9A1Pw"&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yn8SKY"&gt;This second look at the Marvel/Disney series is really leaning in to the whole “this is a Christmas show” bit. Clint Barton/Hawkeye and the family head to New York to see a show: “Rogers, The Musical,” according to the marquee (we get a glimpse of Thor and Captain America on stage with a puzzled Clint in the audience). A one-minute teaser set to Andy Williams’ &lt;em&gt;Most Wonderful Time of the Year&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t tell us a whole lot more about the show, which is a little disappointing.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Jeremy Renner, Hailee Steinfeld, Vera Farmiga, and Florence Pugh star in &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt;, which comes to Disney Plus November 24th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mSUvLo"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mqqft2x_Aa4?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=13&amp;amp;start=13" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6fn0wM"&gt;The Batman &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cFfyns"&gt;The second trailer for the Matt Reeves/Robert Pattinson version of the Dark Knight dropped during FanDome and it’s very moody and grim and has cool explosions and gunfire effects and rain, but I wished we could have seen a tiny bit more of Paul Dano’s serial killer Riddler (a far cry from the beloved but campy Frank Gorshin version). Colin Farrell is completely unrecognizable as the Penguin, and Zoe Kravitz is a mysterious, flirty Selina Kyle/Catwoman. Also I’m a little obsessed with the question mark in the Riddler’s latte (I realize it’s probably the work of an FX artist and not a barista, but still). After what feels like several hundred pandemic-related delays, &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt; will arrive in theaters March 4th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F7yw0f"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XlnLus7iqkI?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=20&amp;amp;start=20" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8v9wdu"&gt;The Tragedy of Macbeth &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="gXya3A"&gt;I need more, Apple, these short teasers are just not sufficient. “Whence is that knocking?!” asks Denzel Washington’s Macbeth. Just you wait, mister, shit is about to get &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;real. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;Oh hi, Frances McDormand looking totally innocent as Lady Macbeth (ha not really). Directed by Joel Coen, &lt;em&gt;The Tragedy of Macbeth&lt;/em&gt; will be in theaters December 25th and on Apple Plus TV on January 14th. Hopefully we get a longer trailer between now and then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6scBQ1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hhZBDO0CKJo?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="63W3W4"&gt;Narcos: Mexico &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zGmkb3"&gt;This is reportedly the final season for this excellent series about drug cartels, the third in the Mexico series and the sixth for the entire &lt;em&gt;Narcos&lt;/em&gt; franchise (multiverse?). A new generation of cartel leaders are battling for power; throw in some truth-seeking journalists and ethically flexible government agents, and you got yourself a show. &lt;em&gt;Narcos: Mexico&lt;/em&gt; returns to Netflix for season three on November 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BAMlIZ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OODneEUWUQY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rR7vFs"&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3hYYMZ"&gt;To my surprise, John Cena is delightful in this teaser for&lt;em&gt; Peacemaker, &lt;/em&gt;a series spun off from&lt;em&gt; The Suicide Squad. &lt;/em&gt;The series takes place after the events of the movie and gives some insight into Peacemaker’s origins. It looks goofy and fun, and all eight episodes of this first season were written by &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad &lt;/em&gt;director James Gunn, obviously a huge plus. Cena stars along with Steve Agee, Danielle Brooks, Robert Patrick, Jennifer Holland, Freddie Stroma, and Chukwudi Iwuji in Peacemaker, which debuts on HBO Max January 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ciyHpa"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2VfPClAsIpg?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="41IMqv"&gt;Needle in a Timestack&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MMPkyj"&gt;A movie with stars this talented should have a better name. But &lt;em&gt;Needle in a Timestack &lt;/em&gt;is based on the 1966 short story of the same name by Robert Silverberg, so we just gotta live with that title. The trailer itself looks not terrible: A blissfully happy married couple have their lives disrupted when her jealous ex goes back in time to change their lives so that the couple never meets. Leslie Odom, Jr., Cynthia Erivo, Freida Pinto, and Orlando Bloom star in &lt;em&gt;Needle in a Timestack,&lt;/em&gt; which is in select theaters now.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="HPtpoM"&gt;Facebook vice president of integrity Guy Rosen &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/hate-speech-prevalence-dropped-facebook/"&gt;wrote in blog post&lt;/a&gt; Sunday that the prevalence of hate speech on the platform had dropped by 50 percent over the past three years, and that “a narrative that the technology we use to fight hate speech is inadequate and that we deliberately misrepresent our progress” was false. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I8mx45"&gt;“We don’t want to see hate on our platform, nor do our users or advertisers, and we are transparent about our work to remove it,” Rosen wrote. “What these documents demonstrate is that our integrity work is a multi-year journey. While we will never be perfect, our teams continually work to develop our systems, identify issues and build solutions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJJ8la"&gt;The post appeared to be in response to a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-ai-enforce-rules-engineers-doubtful-artificial-intelligence-11634338184?st=fdxfcqdeo7a0g8a&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;Sunday article in the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which said the Facebook employees tasked with keeping offensive content off the platform don’t believe the company is able to reliably screen for it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fQ2tTz"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; report states that internal documents show that two years ago, Facebook reduced the time that human reviewers focused on hate speech complaints, and made other adjustments that reduced the number of complaints. That in turn helped create the appearance that Facebook’s artificial intelligence had been more successful in enforcing the company’s rules than it actually was, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SbcLey"&gt;A team of Facebook employees found in March that the company’s automated systems were removing posts which generated between 3 and 5 percent of the views of hate speech on the social platform, and less than 1 percent of all content that was in violation of its rules against violence and incitement, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; reported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3DXjt5"&gt;But Rosen argued that focusing on content removals alone was “the wrong way to look at how we fight hate speech.” He says the technology to remove hate speech is just one method Facebook uses to fight it. “We need to be confident that something is hate speech before we remove it,” Rosen said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzZ4aK"&gt;Instead, he said, the company believes focusing on the prevalence of hate speech people actually see on the platform and how it reduces it using various tools is a more important measure. He claimed that for every 10,000 views of a piece of content on Facebook, there were five views of hate speech. “Prevalence tells us what violating content people see because we missed it,” Rosen wrote. “It’s how we most objectively evaluate our progress, as it provides the most complete picture.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7sLsMO"&gt;But the internal documents obtained by the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; showed some significant pieces of content were able to evade Facebook’s detection, including videos of car crashes that showed people with graphic injuries, and violent threats against trans children. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXO6As"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; has produced a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;series of reports about Facebook&lt;/a&gt; based on internal documents provided by whistleblower Frances Haugen. She &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;testified before Congress &lt;/a&gt;that the company was aware of the negative impact its Instagram platform could have on teenagers. Facebook has disputed the reporting based on the internal documents. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hollywood union reaches contract agreement over streaming pay to avoid strike</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="IATSE members were planning to strike over working conditions" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oRsoeSw0SamTPXDkYUnwIJFP8X4=/0x663:4842x3891/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70007039/1235538501.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;IATSE members were planning to strike over working conditions | Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QdWdaR"&gt;The union representing thousands of film and television production workers has reached a tentative agreement with studios, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711567/iatse-strike-authorization-negotiations-resume-streaming-pay"&gt;averting an strike&lt;/a&gt; that was set to begin Monday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jSHoK1"&gt;The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) had been negotiating with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents major production studios like Netflix, Warner Bros., Paramount Pictures, and Disney. IATSE sought improved working conditions, including weekend rest periods and higher pay scales on streaming shows for its members, who work in many behind-the-scenes roles in Hollywood, such as broadcast technicians, animators, and makeup artists.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQTTc5"&gt;The new three-year deal, which still has to be ratified by members, includes retroactive wage increases of 3 percent annually, daily rest periods of 10 hours and weekend rest periods of 54 hours, according to a &lt;a href="https://iatse.net/landmark-tentative-agreement-reached-for-iatse-west-coast-film-and-television-workers-before-strike-deadline/"&gt;post on IATSE’s website&lt;/a&gt;. It also includes “improved wages and working conditions for streaming,” but no specific details on what that includes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cft0dK"&gt;Streaming was a major sticking point in the negotiations; under IATSE’s existing contract streaming productions received “greater flexibility” regarding pay and benefits to workers. That’s because when the contract was negotiated in 2009, streaming was a new industry with an unclear market. But streaming has become a billion-dollar industry in the years since, and IATSE argued that the pay structure for streaming productions should be adjusted accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woUVRc"&gt;The deal will stave off a walkout that would have had a major impact on Hollywood. But IATSE said negotiations are continuing on a separate contract for people who work on movies and shows produced in other parts of the country, including New York, New Mexico, Georgia, and Louisiana. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ROZnFr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s October ‘Unleashed’ event: what to expect</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple’s event invitation " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Oi-uXZIeOn-WK1BMGztkj7lVk2s=/40x0:2026x1324/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70006949/Screen_Shot_2021_10_14_at_9.13.21_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dNYIIT"&gt;Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722112/apple-october-2021-event-rumors-macbook-mac-mini-airpods-m1x"&gt;announced an event for October 18th&lt;/a&gt;, with a video containing the title “Unleashed.” If you’ve been watching the rumor mill, it won’t come as a surprise — the company still has a lot of products that are expected to come out this year but haven’t shown up in an Apple keynote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kGTo0P"&gt;Chief among those are new, more powerful MacBook Pros, which will follow the incredible Apple Silicon-powered 13-inch MacBook Pro that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21570497/apple-macbook-pro-2020-m1-review"&gt;launched last November&lt;/a&gt;. The company is also expected to release new AirPods, and it’s got an entire OS that was announced but hasn’t shipped. Read on for a deep dive into the rumors surrounding these products and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8GOXLV"&gt;Redesigned MacBook Pros&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JOdB06"&gt;Most of the rumors about the event concern redesigned MacBook Pros, which are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;expected to feature 14- and 16-inch screens&lt;/a&gt;, along with a new Apple processor. Mark Gurman and &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/01/15/new-macbook-pro-models-magsafe-ports/"&gt;Ming-Chi Kuo&lt;/a&gt; (who have pretty solid track records when it comes to rumors) have both said that the laptops will feature iPhone 12-esque flat sides with a redesigned MagSafe charging port and that they’ll no longer have the Touch Bar that’s been a staple of many MacBook Pros since 2016.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="X7XVE4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Ports, glorious ports&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yUBXN1"&gt;Apple is also rumored to be bringing ports back to its laptops with the redesign. The new MacBooks Pros may include an SD card reader and HDMI &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;and MagSafe ports&lt;/a&gt;, which will be familiar (and possibly beloved) by people who miss the days when MacBooks had more than one type of port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1IPyTE"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-12/apple-set-for-first-macbook-pro-revamp-in-five-years-on-oct-18"&gt;Mark Gurman reports&lt;/a&gt; that the laptops will be powered by new chips, which are expected to be more powerful variants of the M1 processor found in today’s computers. The “M1X” (or M2, or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/markgurman/status/1448040028832034817"&gt;whatever name Apple actually goes with&lt;/a&gt;) is expected to have more high-performance cores than its predecessor (eight instead of four) and even offer a choice of 16 or 32 graphics cores (compared to the M1’s seven or eight). What’s still unclear is whether the new processor will do away with any of the seeming limitations of the M1: none of the Apple Silicon Macs are configurable with more than 16GB of RAM or 2TB of storage, they can’t run more than two displays, and none of them have more than two Thunderbolt ports (the iMac has at most two Thunderbolt ports and two USB-C ports). Traditionally, the higher-end MacBook Pros have four Thunderbolt ports, though the inclusion of MagSafe and HDMI may make that less necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hi34v1GQ6fbP3rgqAvJmkjaDtJQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22848631/Screen_Shot_2021_09_13_at_5.21.20_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The configuration screen for an Intel-based MacBook Pro. Just having options for graphics cores would be much easier to explain to new buyers than Turbo Boosts and base clocks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrfJmQ"&gt;If you’re thinking, “Wow, these new computers sound like everything I ever could’ve wanted,” you’re not alone — a lot of people &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1448073292401815552?s=20"&gt;are hyped about the rumors&lt;/a&gt; (though it’s worth keeping in mind &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676131/apple-2021-rumor-mill-wrong-watch-leaks-airpods"&gt;that those don’t always pan out&lt;/a&gt;). If it turns out that Apple has taken all of the community’s feedback to heart, the chip shortage could make these laptops hot-ticket items for quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PcLJiF"&gt;A Pro Mac Mini&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xpSfDk"&gt;Gurman also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22637477/new-mac-mini-design-ports-m1x-release-date-gurman"&gt;recently reported&lt;/a&gt; that a more powerful Mac mini would be coming soon, featuring the same processor found in the updated MacBook Pros and more ports than are currently available on the M1-powered Mini. It’s an interesting rumor because the M1 Mini has one of the widest port selections available on an M1 Mac with USB-A, HDMI, two Thunderbolt ports, and optional 10-gigabit ethernet. But the 2018 Intel-based version, which a lot of people think of as the Mac Mini Pro (in part due to its space grey color), has all of that &lt;em&gt;plus&lt;/em&gt; two more Thunderbolt ports. For those looking for a powerful Apple-powered desktop, a replacement for the 2018 Mac Mini could be a great option, given the lack of rumors about a 27-inch iMac.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QY8S1M6eh04Y9-69e2-O4oqQJ9o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22925277/Screen_Shot_2021_10_13_at_4.51.17_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple is still selling the Intel-powered 2018 Mac Mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zOUVY6"&gt;New AirPods&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="chmWak"&gt;Gurman, &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/09/12/kuo-airpods-3-to-be-announced-at-september-event-airpods-2-to-remain-in-the-lineup/"&gt;Kuo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586507/apple-airpods-2021-refresh-rumor-iphone-se-2022-5g-15-details"&gt;all reported&lt;/a&gt; that Apple is working on a follow-up to its regular, non-Pro AirPods and have said that the headphones will feature the shorter stems found on their more expensive counterparts. It feels like AirPods would’ve fit in better at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;Apple’s iPhone event&lt;/a&gt;, but given that they were absent, we may end up seeing them on the 18th. There is also always the (hilarious) possibility that Apple just announces them via press release like it did the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936454/apple-airpods-pro-new-release-date-price-noise-cancellation-design-immersive-sound"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/21438042/apple-max-studio-noise-canceling-headphones-price-date"&gt;Max&lt;/a&gt;, but with how popular the original ones were, it feels like their successors should get some event time.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J3Em_kMm_GtLn77cNy7hsc8vIjc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22926861/Screen_Shot_2021_10_14_at_9.29.22_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple announced macOS Monterey in June.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EePdlG"&gt;A macOS Monterey release date&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ZRQ2vB"&gt;Apple has released iOS and iPadOS 15, but macOS Monterey, which was announced alongside them, is still in beta. It would be a bit strange if Apple released new Macs that were running macOS Big Sur out of the box, especially given that Monterey was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22458628/apple-macos-12-monterey-features-updates-wwdc-2021"&gt;announced about three months ago at WWDC&lt;/a&gt;. If Apple doesn’t announce that the new version of macOS is shipping with the redesigned MacBook Pros, I’ll be pretty surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Russian spacecraft returns to Earth with movie crew aboard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Soyuz MS-18 reentry capsule with Russian film crew lands in Kazakhstan" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uz3oNnyxVbsG2-Fb4HVdp5yI0Sc=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70006773/1235934095.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Actress Yulia Peresild was part of a film crew that went to the International Space Station to film scenes for a movie. She returned to Earth Sunday along with Klim Shipenko and Roscosmos cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky. | Photo by Sergei Savostyanov\TASS via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4ekvAx"&gt;A Russian actress and director-producer who spent 12 days aboard the International Space Station returned to Earth early Sunday along with cosmonaut Oleg Novitskiy who had been in space for 191 days. Actress Yulia Peresild and director-producer Klim Shipenko &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22709501/russia-soyuz-launch-actress-producer-filming-movie-space-station"&gt;went up to the ISS on October 5th&lt;/a&gt;, to film scenes for the upcoming movie &lt;em&gt;The Challenge,&lt;/em&gt; about a Russian doctor, played by Peresild, who travels to the space station to treat a sick cosmonaut.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0nwJJG"&gt;The three were aboard the Soyuz MS-18 spacecraft, which landed at 12:35AM ET in rural Kazakhstan, and will return to Russia later Sunday.    Novitskiy arrived at the ISS on April 9th for his third mission, and has now spent a total of &lt;a href="https://blogs.nasa.gov/spacestation/2021/10/17/russian-station-veteran-filmmakers-back-on-earth/"&gt;531 days in space&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWnMNT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/16/22729701/international-space-station-tilted-thrusters-russian-craft-fired-unexpectedly"&gt;The Soyuz craft &lt;/a&gt;the three were on had a bit of trouble Saturday, when its thrusters stayed on longer than expected during an engine check. The ISS tilted out of its normal position before ground crews were able to regain control within about 30 minutes. The crew of the ISS was never in danger, officials said, but it’s the second such incident with a Russian craft in the past year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3ElmYi"&gt;Peresild and Shipenko are the first multi-person movie crew to visit the ISS, as part of a commercial arrangement with Roscosmos. Cosmonauts Novitskiy, Anton Shkaplerov, and Pyotr Dubrov  will also have small roles in the movie. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The biggest announcements from DC FanDome</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W-yA-vsO2n9FtMjlAkaBfkrGw4g=/191x0:1679x992/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70005058/black_adam.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Black Adam was one of the trailers on display at DC FanDome Saturday | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/TheRock/status/1449422941142196224?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;DC/WarnerBros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Hn0LmM"&gt;DC Comics and Warner Bros. held their second annual Fandome on Saturday, revealing new trailers for movies and shows coming up, including &lt;em&gt;The Batman, The Flash&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Black Adam&lt;/em&gt;. We also got a look at the story trailer for the&lt;em&gt; Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&lt;/em&gt; game. Here’s a look at some of the biggest news that dropped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="mZVhDm"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div id="ZX4OUb"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mqqft2x_Aa4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="9u9UJx"&gt;The Batman shows off Robert Pattinson’s gritty hero&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HaEUem"&gt;We got a second trailer for &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt;, at last (and FanDome saved the reveal for the very end of the day). We’re not even sure if he thinks he &lt;strong&gt;is&lt;/strong&gt; a hero, but Pattison’s Batman is definitely Going Through Some Stuff. We didn’t learn a heck of a lot more about the characters in Matt Reeves’ interpretation of the Dark Knight’s saga. But the trailer showed off a Selina Kyle/Catwoman who seemed to be a master of disguises, and a Riddler with a much scarier vibe than we’ve seen in previous iterations. After several pandemic-related delays, The Batman comes to theaters on March 4th, 2022. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="rYPDAQ"&gt;An early look at Dwayne Johnson as Shazam antihero &lt;em&gt;Black Adam&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pKXKkx"&gt;Dwayne Johnson’s &lt;em&gt;Black Adam&lt;/em&gt; has been in development for years, but the long-gestating film is finally almost here, and has a teaser trailer showing off not just Johnson’s character&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;but also several members of the Justice Society of America who’ll be making their debuts. Johnson himself made an appearance at FanDome and said he was “born to play Black Adam,” before introducing a scene from the movie, which saw some archeologists (who should know better, frankly) hit Black Adam with a blast of electricity. In return, he disintegrates one guy, catches a bullet out of thin air, and then levitates away. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TheRock/status/1449422941142196224?s=20"&gt;Johnson tweeted the clip&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHTw9I"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Adam&lt;/em&gt; hits theaters on July 29th, 2022&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="tjCDi0"&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;h3 id="CJoi5R"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&lt;/em&gt; got a trailer reveal&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="vvqbMc"&gt;Announced at last year’s FanDome and the first game from Rocksteady Studios, the team behind the beloved &lt;em&gt;Batman: Arkham&lt;/em&gt; in nearly six years,&lt;em&gt; Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&lt;/em&gt; showed off a new trailer at this year’s event. The game is set to debut on Xbox Series X / S, PlayStation 5, and PC in 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="aFzod7"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JK-F2rsNeIk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="d3Jxpj"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Flash&lt;/em&gt; teases a multiversal meltdown&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="e4wQSN"&gt;It’s not just Marvel dabbling in the multiverse these days: the long-delayed &lt;em&gt;The Flash &lt;/em&gt;is got a sneak peak at FanDome, bringing not just Ezra Miller’s superfast hero, but also the return of both Ben Affleck &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;Michael Keaton’s versions of Batman. Keaton does the voice-over for the teaser which includes a glimpse of the unmistakable Batman cowl at the end. It’s scheduled to hit theaters November 4th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XeafWx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IT26FpgwnyM?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=1&amp;amp;start=1" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="J5W5Dw"&gt;Early behind the scenes look at Aquaman and Shazam sequels&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2cP0Zu"&gt;Neither &lt;em&gt;Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Shazam!: Fury of the Gods &lt;/em&gt;were quite ready for primetime, but DC did show off some early behind the scenes looks at both sequels, which will continue the adventures of Jason Momoa’s muscle-bound aquatic hero and Zachary Levi / Asher Angel’s Shazam. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5QAYTD6dK4s&amp;amp;ab_channel=JoBloMovieTrailers"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Shazam!&lt;/em&gt; sequel teaser&lt;/a&gt; gave a look at Rachel Zegler, Helen Mirren, and Lucy Liu as a set of new villains.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5AUWad"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TV2op47sKmY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MHtNmE"&gt;A deep dive into &lt;em&gt;Gotham Knights&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ej1M8A"&gt;While Rocksteady is off working on its &lt;em&gt;Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt; game, Warner Bros. Games Montreal is continuing the Arkham-style adventures in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21376323/gotham-knights-fandome-warner-bros-montreal-batman-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gotham Knights&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;which had originally been slated for a 2021 release before getting delayed to 2022. Players will be able to team up as Batgirl, Nightwing, Robin, and Red Hood in an open-world action RPG when the game arrives next year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wkKPnI"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OODneEUWUQY?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kQbdQf"&gt;Peacemaker gets a trailer ahead of its HBO Max debut&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JQk5Ja"&gt;John Cena’s Peacemaker character — introduced in the summer’s &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt; — is getting his own HBO Max show, where he’ll try to bring peace to the world (no matter how much violence it takes.) The first trailer shows that writer and director James Gunn isn’t letting up on the unique blend of violent comedy from the film, and Cena is surprisingly appealing and funny in the teaser. If you’ve ever wanted to see Cena in his tighty-whities, you’re in luck (if not, you’ve been warned). Oh and also he gets a hug from an eagle which is as silly/awesome as it sounds. &lt;em&gt;Peacemaker&lt;/em&gt; debuts on HBO Max on January 13th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ybBcsg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-DzN99gwJ4I?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="SbFw2p"&gt;Lots of DC TV show trailers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="V1PI54"&gt;Fandome teased new seasons of &lt;em&gt;Batwoman, The Flash, Superman &amp;amp; Lois&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Supergirl, Legends of Tomorrow, Stargirl, &lt;/em&gt;in addition to the animated &lt;em&gt;Aquaman: King of Atlantis &lt;/em&gt;and fan-favorite &lt;em&gt;Harley Quinn. &lt;/em&gt;And &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hbomax/status/1449465172368629772?s=20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Young Justice&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Titans &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DCDoomPatrol/status/1449442314850488322?s=20"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom Patrol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;have been renewed for new seasons at HBO Max, as well. The first two episodes of&lt;em&gt; Young Justice’&lt;/em&gt;s new season are already streaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaJhvu"&gt;We also got a look at the trailer for a new show on the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubLkgZHGGVU&amp;amp;ab_channel=WarnerBros.TV"&gt;CW from Ava DuVernay: &lt;em&gt;Naomi&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, about a teenager who’s not yet aware of her superheroine status. It stars Kaci Walfall as Naomi and debuts next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="BtqDf1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444200/hbo-max-new-animated-batman-superman-shows"&gt;Announced earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; as a noir-ish “reimagining” of the character, the new show comes from JJ. Abrams, Matt Reeves and Bruce Timm. The first trailer showed off the unique art style, but Timm, who worked on&lt;em&gt; Batman: The Animated Series&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Batman Beyond&lt;/em&gt;, said the show won’t be in black-and-white, however. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmtZZR"&gt;“My elevator pitch version of this show is that it’s more &lt;em&gt;Batman: The Animated Series &lt;/em&gt;than &lt;em&gt;Batman: The Animated Series,”  &lt;/em&gt;he said.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;“In Bruce’s world, in this new iteration, it’s just Batman right now. The Justice League doesn’t exist, there aren’t any other superheroes. It’s Batman. You’re watching this lone figure swimming through the cesspool of Gotham. It’s Batman, alone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBnrnZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction, 8:12PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League offered a new story trailer today, not a gameplay reveal. We regret the error.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest trailer for The Batman sees Robert Pattinson’s Dark Knight face off against the Riddler </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ybWICXQJeF1_XZtNDgWRMhHQ_Yo=/295x0:1603x872/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70004785/batman2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqft2x_Aa4" target="_blank"&gt;WarnerBros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="amz8gB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt; debuted a brand new trailer at DC FanDome on Saturday, showing off the best look yet at Robert Pattinson’s take on the Dark Knight and promising an even darker, grittier version of Gotham’s Caped Crusader than any that have hit film before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14Lqlu"&gt;Set just a few years in Batman’s career as a superhero, &lt;em&gt;The Batman &lt;/em&gt;promises to show not just a look at the early days of Batman but numerous other proto-villains and allies, including Zoë Kravitz as Catwoman, Jeffrey Wright as James Gordon, Andy Serkis as Alfred, and Colin Farrell as The Penguin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPEvxs"&gt;The new trailer also gives the first real look at Paul Dano’s take on the iconic Batman villain the Riddler, who appears to be going for a far creepier, serial killer-esque style version of the character (as opposed to the campier, trickster that most Riddler adaptations hew towards). “What’s black and blue and dead all over?” we hear him ask. An opening shot in the trailer shows a man we see only from behind sitting at a diner counter drinking a cup of coffee when the cops arrive. He puts his hands up, they slam him on the counter to cuff him and as he’s taken away, we see the unmistakable sign of the Riddler in the foam of the latte he leaves behind: a question mark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3zee1"&gt;This latest trailer gives a much different vibe than previous iterations of the Batman saga; it balances light and dark in a way that gives it almost a film noir effect. We don’t learn a lot more about the characters, but we definitely get the sense that this younger Batman hasn’t quite identified as a hero just yet. Take the way he describes the Bat Signal: “Fear is a tool. When that light hits the sky, it’s not just a call. It’s a warning.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAAw9s"&gt;Pattinson and Kravitz were joined by director Matt Reeves in a panel discussion before the trailer dropped. Pattinson said this version of the Caped Crusader “really knows what he’s doing when he puts on the cowl. He’s a bit out of control. He hasn’t really defined what Batman is ... he’s becoming this sort of odd creature.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BmBUlX"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/22/21377631/the-batman-teaser-trailer-robert-pattinson-matt-reeves-dc-fandome"&gt;The original trailer for the film&lt;/a&gt; — released over a year ago at 2020’s DC FanDome event — offered only a mere glimpse of the movie, based on the small amount of footage that Reeves was able to film before COVID-19 caused production to shut down in March 2020. Filming was also &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/the-batman-resumes-filming-after-covid-19-shutdown-4055784/"&gt;forced to pause again in September&lt;/a&gt; that year, just a few days after production had started up again when Pattinson tested positive for COVID. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nvi293"&gt;It’s been a long road to theaters for &lt;em&gt;The Batman&lt;/em&gt;; the film was originally intended to hit theaters on June 21st but was pushed first to October 1st. It’s now slated to open in theaters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21503618/the-batman-matrix-4-release-dates-warner-bros"&gt;on March 4th, 2022&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some Instacart shoppers plan Saturday strike over pay and work conditions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An Instacart shopper chooses items for a grocery order." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/i0Ga5m3NGCt19h0zEVRxFzCepXo=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70004175/instacart_shopper_produce.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An Instacart shopper chooses items for a grocery order. Some workers plan to strike Saturday in protest of pay and work conditions | Image: Instacart&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sjLtmn"&gt;Some &lt;a href="https://gigworkerscollective.medium.com/instacart-shoppers-announce-walk-off-3db7f7208ef3"&gt;Instacart shoppers are striking&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday, to protest the company’s pay structure and failure to communicate directly with workers.  The Gig Workers Collective (GWC), which represent some of the company’s shoppers, want the Instacart to address five of its policies. The group is calling for Instacart to pay shoppers by order instead of by batch, reintroduce its item commissions, fix fraud issues with its rating system, provide occupational death benefits, and raise the default tip for shoppers on the platform from 5 percent to 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4kNzXR"&gt;The group said the company ignored its demands, which led to the decision to walk off the job on Saturday. “Instacart has refused to finally address these fixes that workers have been begging the company for, in discussions both private and public,” the GWC wrote in a blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aQyG8D"&gt;An Instacart spokesperson wrote in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Saturday that the company takes worker feedback “very seriously.” adding that “historically the actions by this group have not resulted in any disruption or impact to our service.” The claims by the Gig Workers Collection “do not reflect the current shopper experience,” the Instacart statement said, adding that the company has “a variety of channels” for engaging with its shoppers to gather feedback. “The reality is that over the last year, shopper sentiment and engagement remain the highest they’ve been in company history.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wq3n0U"&gt;As noted by the Instacart statement, Saturday was not the first time the GWC has pushed for a work action among Instacart shoppers. The group organized a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/13/21064108/instacart-workers-organizing-tip-protest-delivery-default"&gt;boycott of Instacart in January 2020&lt;/a&gt; to encourage the company to reinstate the minimum 10 percent tip, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/27/21197078/instacart-workers-protest-coronavirus-protections-date-sick-leave"&gt;staged a walk-off in March 2020&lt;/a&gt; to protest the company’s lack of sick leave and protections for workers from the coronavirus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4SHnF"&gt;Following the March 2020 walk-off, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21200348/instacart-strike-coronavirus-no-impact"&gt;Instacart said it had seen “absolutely no impact”&lt;/a&gt; on its business as a result. But a spokesperson for the GWC pointed out that several days after the March walk-out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/3/21206630/instacart-health-and-safety-kits-face-mask-hand-sanitizer-sick-pay-strike"&gt;Instacart said it would provide its shoppers&lt;/a&gt; with health and safety kits that included masks and hand sanitizer, two items that were among the workers’ demands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uFw7ae"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Instacart’s reported plan to automate its workforce seems a lot like bluster","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463023/instacart-plans-automation-grocery-shopping-business-model"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="RanXZU"&gt;And, the GWC spokesperson added, the walk-offs are about more than disrupting the company’s operations; it’s hoping to change the narrative around &lt;a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/instacart-may-delay-ipo-until-121347561.html"&gt;Instacart’s plans to go public later this year&lt;/a&gt;. “It’s been a huge success,” the GWC spokesperson said of its past efforts. “Prior to this, the media stories were about how ‘Instacart’s prepping for an exciting IPO.’ Now, the stories are focused on their exploitative practices.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7I8kp"&gt;It’s also not totally clear how many of Instacart’s workers the collective represents, but its spokesperson said the company’s claims that the group doesn’t speak for the majority of its shoppers is incorrect. “Instacart knows that we’re speaking for a majority of its shoppers, because they hear about these specific grievances nonstop,” the spokesperson said. “We hope Instacart’s customers are watching how the company handles this.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kCImJT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
