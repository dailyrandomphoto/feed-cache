    <title>Honor announces its first post-Huawei phone</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GNLv0oIpgCV-YYhA0_gtZBZP9uo=/0x0:1098x732/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68703668/hv40.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JMIZyw"&gt;Honor has announced the new V40 5G flagship phone, its first since Huawei sold the company off to a Shenzhen-based consortium of Chinese partners. The phone is exclusive to China for now, but Honor’s V-series usually makes its way to the rest of the world &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21151055/honor-9x-pro-release-date-price-camera-google-apps-service-mwc"&gt;under “View” branding&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qR5Qj"&gt;The V40 has a 6.72-inch OLED screen with a 120Hz refresh rate and is powered by a MediaTek Dimensity 1000+ processor. The primary camera has a 1/1.56-inch 50-megapixel sensor. The 4,000mAh battery can be charged wirelessly at 50W or at 66W with a cable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uPGY4t"&gt;Huawei &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/16/21570744/huawei-honor-sale-announced-us-sanctions"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that it was selling off Honor in November due to “tremendous pressure” and a difficulty in securing an adequate supply chain. While Honor was operated independently from Huawei, it relied on the parent company for much of its technology, such as HiSense’s Kirin processors. That meant it was hit just as hard by US sanctions banning US companies from doing business with Huawei. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RVez89sFMcc4GyZJZiEFicb5yWg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22251828/v40.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tejl7I"&gt;The V40 phones will of course have been in development since earlier than November, but now that Huawei has divested itself of Honor, the international “View 40” version of the V40 may be able to ship with Google services on board. That would allow Honor to sell phones in Western markets and beyond without the huge disadvantage of having to rely on Huawei’s AppGallery, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21193639/huawei-mate-30-google-apps-services-appgallery-p40-preview"&gt;still can’t compete with Google’s Play Store&lt;/a&gt; outside of China, where Google has no presence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1aJcx"&gt;At the same time, Honor no longer has the advantage of relying on Huawei’s supply chain, so it’s going to have work to do in order to establish itself as a strong brand in its own right once the phones launch elsewhere. For now, it’s available in China with prices starting at 3,599 yuan (~$550) for a model with 8GB of RAM and 128GB of storage. 3,999 yuan (~$620) doubles the storage to 256GB.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bond, Uncharted and Ghostbusters movies all just got delayed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/diS5laQ-TtcoQit3FDPp5lVgB6Y=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68703244/bond_25_B25_31842_RC2_rgb.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo: DANJAQ and MGM / Nicola Dove&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="l4whVe"&gt;Hollywood has decided tonight’s the night to shove back their slate of films — including James Bond’s latest outing &lt;em&gt;No Time To Die, &lt;/em&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; movie, and &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters: Afterlife. No Time to Die&lt;/em&gt; now has a release date of October 8th, &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters &lt;/em&gt;will be pushed back five months to November 11th&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Uncharted&lt;/em&gt; now won’t arrive until 2022, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ERCboxoffice/status/1352427540292407297"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Exhibitor Relations&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HP18VH"&gt;Bond was the big film whose third delay was enough to force theater chains Regal and Cineworld to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/3/21500538/regal-cineworld-theaters-shut-down-james-bond-us-uk"&gt;close all their US and UK locations&lt;/a&gt;. It was originally slated for April 2020, then got pushed back to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164789/james-bond-no-time-to-die-movie-delayed-coronavirus"&gt;November 2020&lt;/a&gt; and now to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21499362/james-bond-no-time-to-die-delay-april-2021"&gt;April 2021&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re counting, this news marks the fourth delay. Instead of releasing the movie on streaming, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;as other studios have been doing&lt;/a&gt;, MGM seems adamant on premiering the movie in theaters — but by the time it’s safe to do so, there may not be as many of them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="saZFX3"&gt;AMC has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/11/22169538/amc-theaters-revenue-closing-warner-bros-hbo-max-streaming"&gt;warned investors&lt;/a&gt; that it’s about to run out of money, and other theaters also might not &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504536/movie-theaters-close-regal-cineworld-amc-cinemark"&gt;survive past the middle of 2021&lt;/a&gt;. So the Bond franchise moving to the end of the year is not a good sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AQw8Ch"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="es" dir="ltr"&gt;NO TIME TO DIE 8 October 2021 &lt;a href="https://t.co/HZlNG5kz8t"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HZlNG5kz8t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— James Bond (@007) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/007/status/1352416833815633922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EGkFY3"&gt;We can probably expect even more films to be delayed as delay piles on top of delay, since only a certain number of films can successfully premiere at physical theaters in any given span of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A1m27I"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="f8qZ8n"&gt;We haven’t heard from Disney yet, but you can also add delays &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/bob-odenkirk-nobody-edgar-wright-michael-bay-release-date-universal-focus-features-1234889942/"&gt;for Edgar Wright’s &lt;em&gt;Last Night In Soho!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (now October 22nd)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/01/cinderella-ghostbusters-afterlife-peter-rabbit-2-uncharted-release-date-changes-1234678097/"&gt;Sony’s &lt;em&gt;Cinderella&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; (&lt;/em&gt;now July 16th)&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to the pile.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google threatens to remove its search engine from Australia if new law goes into effect</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aGk9gnoEKMtQHV08rkSGcu0YXZM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68703157/acastro_180427_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F92iNg"&gt;Google is threatening to pull its search engine from an entire country — Australia — if a proposed law goes into effect that would force Google to pay news publishers for their content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sdFW0c"&gt;“If this version of the Code were to become law it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google Search available in Australia,” Google Australia and New Zealand VP Meg Silva told Australia’s Senate Economics Legislation Committee today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0W3tCq"&gt;“We have had to conclude after looking at the legislation in detail we do not see a way, with the financial and operational risks, that we could continue to offer a service in Australia,” she added, &lt;a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/google-threatens-to-disable-search-in-australia-if-media-code-becomes-law-20210122-p56w2h.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oR7RxV"&gt;The company, which has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/17/21371709/google-australia-paying-for-news-lobbying-media-ads-search-market"&gt;been lobbying against Australia’s plan for months&lt;/a&gt;, claims the country is trying to make it pay to show links and snippets to news stories in Google Search, not just for news articles features in places like Google News, saying it “would set an untenable precedent for our business, and the digital economy” and that it’s “not compatible with how search engines work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSkZ2W"&gt;Australia’s Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which drafted the law, &lt;a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/media-release/response-to-google-open-letter"&gt;seemed to suggest in August&lt;/a&gt; that this shouldn’t affect Google’s search business: “Google will not be required to charge Australians for the use of its free services such as Google Search and YouTube, unless it chooses to do so.” Clearly, Google disagrees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYAxFH"&gt;As Google explains &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/australia/mel-silvas-opening-statement/"&gt;in Silva’s full statement&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-asia/australia/8-facts-about-google-and-news-media-bargaining-code/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+blogspot%2FMKuf+%28The+Keyword+%7C+Official+Google+Blog%29"&gt;an accompanying blog post&lt;/a&gt;, it would rather pay publishers specifically for its Google News products. (It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302791/google-news-publishers-pay-content-australia-germany-brazil"&gt;already announced a program&lt;/a&gt; to pay publishers in Australia, Germany and Brazil back in June.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HxuCOT"&gt;Australia doesn’t seem to think that’s enough, though. The ACCC believes the proposed law addresses “a significant bargaining power imbalance between Australian news media businesses and Google and Facebook.” As my colleague Jon Porter put it in August:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="qTT8hQ"&gt;Australia’s proposed News Media Bargaining Code law, which is currently in draft and targets Facebook alongside Google, follows a &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2019/jul/26/facebook-and-google-face-tighter-rules-in-australia-as-accc-releases-report"&gt;2019 inquiry&lt;/a&gt; in Australia that found the tech giant to be taking a disproportionately large share of online advertising revenue, even though much of their content came from media organizations. Since then, the news and media industry have been hit hard by the pandemic. &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2020/apr/01/news-corp-to-suspend-print-editions-of-60-local-newspapers-as-advertising-revenue-slumps"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that over a hundred local newspapers in Australia have had to lay off journalists and either shut down or stop printing as advertising revenue has fallen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="1VBRMI"&gt;Facebook is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/19/21227263/australia-facebook-google-ad-revenue-media-coronavirus-economy"&gt;also in the ACCC’s sights&lt;/a&gt; with this particular law, and is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/31/21409644/facebook-block-news-australia-legislation-google-publishers"&gt;threatening to block its news from being shared in Australia&lt;/a&gt;, too. Both companies are calling these blockages a “worst case” scenario, and Google insisted it wasn’t a threat, but it certainly sounds like one.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alphabet is shutting down Loon, its internet balloon company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EK1olUuoKiOjCNcpH_VN0DEZCnI=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68703055/1_gEo3FCKfchd_3UWWUalsjg.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Alphabet&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0s7kYa"&gt;Alphabet is shutting down Loon, its division that provides internet from floating balloons, according to a post on the &lt;a href="https://blog.x.company/loons-final-flight-e9d699123a96"&gt;blog of Alphabet’s X moonshot division&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pVJdvn"&gt;“The road to commercial viability has proven much longer and riskier than hoped,” Astro Teller, who leads X, wrote in the blog. “In the coming months, we’ll begin winding down operations and it will no longer be an Other Bet within Alphabet.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKF73T"&gt;Alphabet, the parent company of Google, launched Loon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/6/14/4432262/google-unveils-project-loon-ballon-powered-internet-for-the-entire"&gt;in June 2013&lt;/a&gt;, and Loon “graduated” from a moonshot to an independent company within Alphabet &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/11/17559520/google-alphabet-loon-wing-independent-companies-internet-drones-balloons"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Loon launched its first commercial internet service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315961/alphabet-loon-balloons-internet-kenya-telkom-4g-remote-areas"&gt;in Kenya in July&lt;/a&gt;, comprised of a fleet of about 35 balloons that covered an area of around 50,000 square kilometers. Loon has also provided internet services to areas affected by natural disasters, deploying balloons to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/20/16512178/alphabet-project-loon-puerto-rico-lte-balloons-disaster-relief-connectivity"&gt;Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria in 2017&lt;/a&gt; and to &lt;a href="https://medium.com/loon-for-all/loon-balloons-are-now-connecting-users-in-peru-8daa32db32b7"&gt;Peru following an earthquake in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfmHpn"&gt;Teller says that Loon is working to place employees in other roles at X, Google, and Alphabet. “A small group of the Loon team will stay to ensure Loon’s operations are wrapped up smoothly and safely — this includes winding down Loon’s pilot service in Kenya,” according to Teller. Loon’s service in Kenya will run until March, an X spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. To support those in Kenya who might be affected by the loss of Loon’s service, Loon is pledging $10 million to support nonprofits and businesses in Kenya dedicated to “connectivity, Internet, entrepreneurship and education.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jYkbT"&gt;Loon isn’t the only moonshot that Alphabet has shut down. It wound down Makani, which aimed to use wind turbines attached to kites to create renewable electricity, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/19/21143540/alphabet-discontinues-makani-flying-wind-turbine-drone-kites-clean-energy"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;. And Project Foghorn, which researched how to create clean fuel from seawater, ended its work &lt;a href="https://x.company/projects/foghorn/"&gt;in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can now play Resident Evil Village’s ‘Maiden’ demo on PS5</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zdo__mL7QvQ_5IvTn3He9pnQ6wc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68702927/EsSdHQkW4AERbgv.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Capcom&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="AnDuIC"&gt;If you’ve got a PlayStation 5, you probably know there’s not a lot to play right now — particularly if you’ve already finished &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177015/ps5-best-games-playstation-5-sony-launch-2020"&gt;the likes of &lt;em&gt;Miles Morales&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Demon’s Souls&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Astro’s Playroom&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;But here’s something to (very briefly) tide you over: you can now download the &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village &lt;/em&gt;“Maiden”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;demo ahead of the full game’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242218/resident-evil-8-village-release-date-trailer-ps5-ps4-xbox-pc"&gt;just-announced May 7th&lt;/a&gt; release date. It wasn’t available in the PS Store at first, but it’s been there for about an hour now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6rzwbX"&gt;In the PlayStation Store on my PS5, the game was featured front and center in the “What’s hot” section for me, and I was able to start the download with a couple button presses. But if you’re away from your PS5 and want to remotely download the demo so it’s ready to play later, there’s a few ways to go about that, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="lTlKWG"&gt;If you’re using a browser, &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0102-PPSA01858_00-DEMOVILLAGE00001"&gt;here’s the link&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Maiden’s&lt;/em&gt; listing on the PlayStation Store, where you should be able to add the game to your library.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hkrw40"&gt;If you’re using the PlayStation mobile app, tap the magnifying glass at the bottom of the screen and search for “maiden.” For me, &lt;em&gt;Maiden&lt;/em&gt; was the fourth search result. Tap on that, and you should be able to start the download from there.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mNwBIe"&gt;On the mobile app, you can also access the &lt;em&gt;Maiden&lt;/em&gt; page from the &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; listing by tapping the box above the preorder button and selecting &lt;em&gt;Maiden&lt;/em&gt; from the list of editions for &lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s where to find the demo in the app. Click on that “PS5 Standard Edition” option to change it to “Maiden.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ivRiWM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maiden &lt;/em&gt;is a separate experience from &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village &lt;/em&gt;where&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;you play as a character known as “the maiden” instead of &lt;em&gt;Village’s&lt;/em&gt; protagonist, Ethan Winters. If you want to learn more about the demo before downloading, check out &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/01/21/resident-evil-village-maiden-demo-hits-ps5-today/"&gt;this post on the PlayStation Blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t1UGzs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; will launch on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, and PC on May 7th. Capcom says a “multiplatform demo” for the game will be available &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1352378538171756549"&gt;this spring&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dems push Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube for anti-radicalization changes after Capitol attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="House Hearing Held On Protecting Scientific Integrity In Coronavirus Response" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MAWWZ09UhqCdKSXXc4mlPDSKWN8=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68702511/1212981411.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Greg Nash-Pool / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="33JOxX"&gt;Only hours after gaining full control of Congress, House Democrats are going after &lt;a href="https://malinowski.house.gov/sites/malinowski.house.gov/files/Letter%20to%20Facebook%20--%20Malinowski_Eshoo_final_0.pdf"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://malinowski.house.gov/sites/malinowski.house.gov/files/Letter%20to%20Twitter%20--%20Malinowski_Eshoo_final_0.pdf"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://malinowski.house.gov/sites/malinowski.house.gov/files/Letter%20to%20YouTube%20--%20Malinowski_Eshoo_final_0.pdf"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt; for the platforms’ perceived roles in inciting violence at the Capitol earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rGd0q5"&gt;In letters addressed to the chief executives of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube, Reps. Anna Eshoo (D-CA) and Tom Malinowski (D-NJ), along with dozens of other members, called for the companies to make sweeping changes to their platforms to curb violent and extremist activity on their networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUUvqq"&gt;The lawmakers accused the companies of using certain product features and algorithms that boost content that evokes extreme emotions as a means of increasing engagement, pointing out specific features they want to see changed on each platform. For YouTube, lawmakers said they would like to see the company disable auto-play and stop recommending any conspiratorial content alongside videos or on users’ homepages. Facebook was asked to start a “fundamental reexamination” of its use of user engagement “as the basis of algorithmic sorting and recommendation.” Lawmakers also asked Twitter to begin prompting users to quote-tweet tweets instead of automatically retweeting them when the retweet button is selected. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EepHlT"&gt;“The horrific damage to our democracy wrought on January 6th demonstrated how these social media platforms played a role in radicalizing and emboldening terrorists to attack our Capitol,” Eshoo said in a statement Thursday. “These American companies must fundamentally rethink algorithmic systems that are at odds with democracy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8J4wJV"&gt;Facebook and YouTube declined to comment. A Twitter spokesperson said they had received the letter and planned to respond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FeMAT"&gt;Earlier Thursday, House Oversight Chair Carolyn Maloney (D-NY) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242595/house-oversight-parler-fbi-investigation-carolyn-maloney-chris-wray"&gt;called on FBI Director Chris Wray&lt;/a&gt; to open an investigation into Parler, a conservative-leaning Twitter dupe, following the pro-Trump Capitol attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glWTxR"&gt;Maloney said that the House Oversight Committee would begin its own probe into Parler and other social media websites like it. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/01/21/parler-fbi-russia-jan-6-capitol/"&gt;In an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Maloney said, “I am going to get to the bottom of who owns and funds social media platforms like Parler that condone and create violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j9bJ03"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 1/21/21 at 6:03PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Included statement from Twitter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A new meme generator lets you drop Bernie Sanders and his chair around the world</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bernie Sanders sitting at the Southernmost point in the continental United States, Key West Florida" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6-dronwcbYAT6H5txLmyrcHXo8s=/0x168:640x595/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68702404/Unknown_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;We’ve put him somewhere warm.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PlMycU"&gt;You may have seen the many memes of Sen. Bernie Sanders sitting at President Joe Biden’s inauguration (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22241049/bernie-sanders-inauguration-sitting-meme"&gt;we even did a rundown of the best ones&lt;/a&gt;), but now &lt;a href="https://bernie-sits.herokuapp.com"&gt;there’s a website that lets you&lt;/a&gt; easily drop Bernie and his chair all over the world with the help of Google Maps’ Street View (&lt;a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/bernie-sanders-can-sit-anywhere-world-power-google-maps"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Android Central&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Simply put in a location or address in the website, and after one button click, you’ll have an image of Bernie sitting wherever you specified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXFMPU"&gt;The site, made by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nick_sawhney/status/1352070155141079043"&gt;NYU masters student Nick Sawhney&lt;/a&gt;, is pretty bare-bones, and it’s not exactly fast — though &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/bernie-sanders-meme-street-view-site"&gt;the fact that it’s getting a lot of traffic&lt;/a&gt; could be partially to blame. As you can imagine, there are a lot of people, like me, using it for shenanigans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avrvdq"&gt;Here are a couple of examples Sawhney made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8KZfH2"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I made a website where you can put bernie in places using google maps street view. Enjoy!&lt;a href="https://t.co/UfY5g9xU2k"&gt;https://t.co/UfY5g9xU2k&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/8rstiEXOHf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/8rstiEXOHf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— nick (@nick_sawhney) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nick_sawhney/status/1352070155141079043?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GYViCT"&gt;And here are the results of me goofing around with the site for an embarrassing amount of time: &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Bernie Sanders sitting in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HIlaps8-3UxJF9Gc-EKElQpHwk4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22250823/Screen_Shot_2021_01_21_at_12.02.36_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bernie’s taking a break after Rocky-running up the stairs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Bernie Sanders sitting in front of a t-rex statue" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MvkWOipR6y4llq2Z9M2wm_LIzYA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22250826/Screen_Shot_2021_01_21_at_12.11.53_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Oh cool, I didn’t know Bernie was a Fallout: New Vegas fan!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JTm5eCVtUdbqTaLf0MLdjI5_p30=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22250844/Screen_Shot_2021_01_21_at_12.24.37_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bernie visiting Xavier’s School for Gifted Youngsters.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hRIHNI5mU3hcia1QxrM87OEZPjM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22250854/Screen_Shot_2021_01_21_at_12.27.08_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bernie! Watch out for the flying fish!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image of Bernie sitting at the Green Dragon Inn in Hobbiton from Lord of the Rings" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kSATqDDN6yHYB18o1BpO2nECsCU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22250866/Screen_Shot_2021_01_21_at_12.31.41_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bernie’s looking for the best brew in the Shire.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ELV0gO"&gt;Three cheers to Sawhney for this glorious meme generator. I’m sorry for how much I cost you in Google Maps API calls and Heroku fees. (If you want to help keep the site up, you can &lt;a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nicksawhney"&gt;toss Sawhney a few bucks here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Resident Evil Village will launch on May 7th, 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/a3cKmU-C5e_7442BKBsIIdi7VAU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68702356/EsRryLBXIAAE_Yd.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cGeg3K"&gt;The eighth mainline &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; game now has a release date. Today at a live-streamed event, developer Capcom announced that &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil Village&lt;/em&gt; will be coming to the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC on May 7th, 2021 — as well as current-generation consoles, the PS4 and Xbox One. The company also announced that a demo will be available for PS5 owners later today. Capcom says that &lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt; “will be eligible to upgrade from PlayStation 4 to the digital PlayStation 5 version and will support Smart Delivery for Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One consoles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VGz3hG"&gt;The event also provided a first proper look at the game with a new, rather unsettling trailer, which you can see above. It gives a good look at the disturbing castle where &lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt; takes place, along with glimpse at pure gameplay. Like the last &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt;, the new title is a first-person survival horror experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phcthE"&gt;In addition to the single-player RE game, Capcom revealed &lt;em&gt;Re:Verse&lt;/em&gt;, a multiplayer title featuring major characters from the &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; universe. It’ll be available for free for anyone who buys &lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NvShiv"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mtX1pxZ3aqE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Rpg7a1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Village&lt;/em&gt; was first announced during a PS5 reveal event last year, and it comes at a time when the &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; series is at a high point creatively. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/23/14353714/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"&gt;2017’s &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 7&lt;/em&gt; reinvigorated the franchise&lt;/a&gt; with a renewed focus on horror, and it was followed by two well-received remakes in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/22/18192773/resident-evil-2-review-ps4-xbox-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Resident Evil 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199382/resident-evil-3-remake-review-ps4-xbox-pc-2-capcom"&gt;&lt;em&gt;3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Outside of the games, there’s also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403849/netflix-resident-evil-tv-series-original-live-action-announcement"&gt;a new live-action TV series in the works at Netflix&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s every game coming to the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ctg6U9v5jr9RrXkzgL82pqnQOXQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67735830/vpavic_4261_20201023_0084.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For the early adopters of next-gen hardware&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cyuvuR"&gt;Just over two months after their release, the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S continue to be some of the most desirable gadgets in the world. While it’s still &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;very difficult&lt;/a&gt; to get your hands on a new console, those lucky enough to own one can enjoy something unprecedented in modern gaming history. For the first time, next-gen console owners can take their existing library — whether it’s physical, digital, or a mix of the two — and bring it to a next-gen platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNh3ro"&gt;That gives consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play and what performance benefits are worthwhile enough to upgrade. And technologies like cross-platform play and now even cross-generation support will allow people to still play with their friends, even if they don’t upgrade to the latest gaming hardware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5uXjX1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving consumers unprecedented freedom in deciding where they want to play&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CveWHl"&gt;Yes, both consoles arrived within seven years of the last generation of console hardware. And while it’s likely within the first year of both consoles’ lifespan that many of the hottest titles may launch on last- and current-gen simultaneously, there’s still a good chunk of games that will be exclusive titles playable only a PS5 or Xbox Series X / S. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u79IWA"&gt;Besides 4K, the solid-state drives, and other spec changes, Microsoft and Sony have pledged to support close to every title in the existing console platforms’ libraries. Every Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One game currently playable on existing Xbox One hardware (minus Kinect games) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326805/xbox-series-x-xbox-one-game-support-backward-compatible-feature-kinect"&gt;will be playable on the Series X / S&lt;/a&gt;, while Sony is supporting a “vast majority” of PS4 games, totaling &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440748/ps5-playstation-5-99-percent-backward-compatible-ps4-games-jim-ryan"&gt;more than 4,000 titles&lt;/a&gt;. With both consoles early into their lifespan, it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22163921/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-old-games-next-gen-consoles"&gt;easy for many to return to older games&lt;/a&gt; to help fill the gap in between long wait periods for more titles to be added to each console’s library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="dwgnjo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new consoles let you take a majority of your existing libraries with you&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nUlnZM"&gt;This changes the calculus a bit with regard to buying a new console. No longer do you have to abandon what you were playing on your old device and start anew. And thanks to some genuinely consumer-friendly initiatives like Xbox Smart Delivery and similar upgrade programs, plenty of the games we own now or are planning to buy in the next couple of months will not only work on the new platforms, but in most cases, they’ll also come with free upgrades from the standard PS4 and Xbox One versions. Sony also introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/28/21538383/sony-playstation-plus-collection-available-games-november-free-bugsnax"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, a library of PS4 games available for free with its online subscription service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lmWX6y"&gt;That leaves us with one big issue: how do you know what new games are coming out for which platforms and when? There’s also the painstaking process of parsing whether a game company is giving out a free next-gen upgrade of a cross-gen title, charging a little extra, or releasing a next-gen-only game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EsrpjD"&gt;2021 is packed full of new releases and full optimizations of cross-gen games that should further pad out what’s available to play on your new system of choice. We’ve compiled the list below to help you understand every game coming out during the first year of the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GM3UJT"&gt;This excludes games without release dates that may have been previously announced — like &lt;em&gt;Elder Scrolls VI &lt;/em&gt;and the &lt;em&gt;Fable &lt;/em&gt;reboot, for example — and any games that were released for either console in 2020, including launch titles. We’ve also chosen only to list release dates for games where the publisher has chosen a concrete date with both day and month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="hTe555"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:9552771"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4tQEqz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 4th, 2020, 12:35PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added that &lt;/em&gt;ARK: Survival Evolved&lt;em&gt; recently released an Xbox Series X enhancement update that will be available to new console owners on launch day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rC6OMy"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated &lt;/em&gt;Haven &lt;em&gt;would be a PS5-only release and that &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder &lt;em&gt;would be Xbox Series-only at launch. Those are incorrect; Haven is also coming to Xbox Series X and Xbox One and as part of Game Pass at launch, and &lt;/em&gt;War Thunder&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is slated for PS5 mid-November. We regret the errors. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qPYdhq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 15th, 2021, 5PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to add additional titles releasing in 2021 and update any games that may have been delayed into this year. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
