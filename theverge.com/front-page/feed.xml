    <title>Apple must allow other forms of in-app purchases, rules judge in Epic vs Apple</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LhwS4B"&gt;Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers issued &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21060628-epic-apple-injunction"&gt;a permanent injunction&lt;/a&gt; in the Epic v. Apple case on Friday morning, handing a major setback to Apple’s App Store model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K45KuA"&gt;Under the new order, Apple is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="o8d1Ip"&gt;permanently restrained and enjoined from prohibiting developers from including in their apps and their metadata buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms, in addition to In-App Purchasing and (ii) communicating with customers through points of contact obtained voluntarily from customers through account registration within the app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="3PKLf8"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21060631-apple-epic-judgement"&gt;In the full ruling&lt;/a&gt;, Judge Gonzalez-Rogers explained her thinking on the issue in greater detail. “The court cannot ultimately conclude that apple is a monopolist under either federal or state antitrust laws,” she writes in the ruling. “Nonetheless, the trial did show that apple is engaging in anti-competitive conduct under California’s competition laws.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="njgk3L"&gt;For years, Apple and Epic Games (which makes &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;) have been at odds over the transaction-fee system in the iOS App Store, which Apple sees as a necessary operating cost but Epic sees as a monopolistic tax. The fight came to a head in August 2020, when Epic installed an alternative payment system in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; to circumvent the App Store’s transaction fees. Apple responded by removing &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; from the app store, which sparked an immediate legal complaint from Epic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sjbe9m"&gt;The subsequent trial was a brutal tug-of-war over the app store model and Apple’s efforts to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;maintain control over software on iOS&lt;/a&gt;. Among other things, we learned about Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/1/22414402/epic-expert-apple-app-store-fortnite-court-profit"&gt;strange accounting methods&lt;/a&gt;, and charm offensive to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;keep major players like Netflix using in-app purchases&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="H6gxfC"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Epic v. Apple trial was bigger than Fortnite|102313" data-volume-uuid="2e5d0ec67" data-volume-id="102313" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-326" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tdb9LQ"&gt;The ruling is likely to have significant impacts outside of Apple. Google is already facing a similar lawsuit from Epic Games over its own efforts to maintain the Google Play Store as the central source of software on Android, drawing on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632804/epic-google-lawsuit-unredacted-complaint-antitrust"&gt;elaborate deals with phone manufacturers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp is adding encrypted backups</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SFguNpJIPg8_BLEaFfyg8VS-8sc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69839986/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="St5Dfm"&gt;WhatsApp will let its more than 2 billion users fully encrypt the backups of their messages, the Facebook-owned app &lt;a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/09/10/security/whatsapp-e2ee-backups/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qs89Vr"&gt;The plan, which WhatsApp is &lt;a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/security/WhatsApp_Security_Encrypted_Backups_Whitepaper.pdf"&gt;detailing in a white paper&lt;/a&gt; before rolling out to users on iOS and Android in the coming weeks, is meant to secure the backups WhatsApp users already send to either Google Drive or Apple’s iCloud, making them unreadable without an encryption key. WhatsApp users who opt into encrypted backups will be asked to save a 64-digit encryption key or create a password that is tied to the key. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ivf4g"&gt;“WhatsApp is the first global messaging service at this scale to offer end-to-end encrypted messaging and backups, and getting there was a really hard technical challenge that required an entirely new framework for key storage and cloud storage across operating systems,” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/274vW_fxjVRLSpYPhqN0yc1MelE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839764/Whatsapp_E2EE_Backups.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: WhatsApp&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RT2LJV"&gt;If someone creates a password tied to their account’s encryption key, WhatsApp will store the associated key in a physical hardware security module, or HSM, that is maintained by Facebook and unlocked only when the correct password is entered in WhatsApp. An HSM acts like a safety deposit box for encrypting and decrypting digital keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h3Ml5C"&gt;Once unlocked with its associated password in WhatsApp, the HSM provides the encryption key that in turn decrypts the account’s backup that is stored on either Apple or Google’s servers. A key stored in one of WhatsApp’s HSM vaults will become permanently inaccessible if repeated password attempts are made. The hardware itself is located in data centers owned by Facebook around the world to protect from internet outages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2XVLT7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We expect to get criticized by some for this”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jtuXHa"&gt;The system is designed to ensure that no one besides an account owner can gain access to a backup, the head of WhatsApp, Will Cathcart, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; He said the goal of letting people create simpler passwords is to make encrypted backups more accessible. WhatsApp will only know that a key exists in a HSM, not the key itself or the associated password to unlock it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yca9fq"&gt;The move by WhatsApp comes as governments around the world like India — WhatsApp’s largest market — are threatening to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454381/whatsapp-indian-government-traceability-lawsuit-break-encryption-privacy"&gt;break the way that encryption works&lt;/a&gt;. “We expect to get criticized by some for this,” Cathcart said. “That’s not new for us ... I believe strongly that governments should be pushing us to have more security and not do the opposite.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FGi2zp"&gt;WhatsApp’s announcement means the app is going a step further than Apple, which encrypts iMessages but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/21/21075033/apple-icloud-end-to-end-encryption-scrapped-fbi-reuters-report"&gt;still holds the keys to encrypted backups&lt;/a&gt;; that means Apple can assist with recovery, but also that it can be compelled to hand the keys over to law enforcement. Cathcart said WhatsApp has been working on making encrypted backups a reality for the past couple of years, and that while they are opt-in to start, he hopes, over time, to “have this be the way it works for everyone.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8EHqo"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sgogMR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new MMO could come to its Luna cloud gaming service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TkbuYFmHmQy7ysnrdDHpAShpp_4=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69839913/gallery2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from Amazon Games’ &lt;/em&gt;New World&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KIYAkE"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;, Amazon Games’ upcoming MMO, is just a few weeks away from its September 28th PC launch. But at some point in the future, it could be offered on Amazon’s Luna cloud gaming service, Richard Lawrence, studio director at Amazon Games, said in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcGx9n"&gt;“I’m fairly confident that at some point you’ll also see &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; on Luna,” Lawrence says. That could expand the number of potential players by a significant amount since Luna is available on lot of different devices, including, as of Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22663811/amazon-luna-fire-tablet-chromebook-family-retro-channels"&gt;Chromebooks and Amazon Fire tablets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OL83F7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It’s not clear when the game might come to Luna, though&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="azMWuK"&gt;However, the holdup on bringing the game to Luna is “more on the &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; side than anything else,” Lawrence says. He didn’t commit to a timeline for a potential Luna launch, as it sounds like there would be some hurdles to overcome before that would happen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUsMle"&gt;“Luna specializes in this almost impossible idea of, ‘Oh, I can sling your complex PC experience down to many different devices,’” Lawrence explains. “And [&lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;] is a very input-driven environment.” That means that if you don’t have a keyboard, mouse, and a dedicated screen or monitor for the game, it may not be as good of an experience, he says. In other words, playing an MMO designed for PC on a controller or on the iPhone 12 Mini’s small screen perhaps wouldn’t be the most optimal way to play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O50lBl"&gt;Still, having &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; on Luna could be the kind of tentpole game that brings in new subscribers. Right now, Luna lets you play many games that are also available on other platforms and consoles, but &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; could be a standout title that likely wouldn’t be available on any other cloud gaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="czXS55"&gt;Streaming &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; on Luna would also be an impressive showcase of Amazon’s AWS cloud infrastructure, which is the backbone of both the MMO and the cloud gaming service. It seems likely that Amazon would want to find a way to use its own game to promote its own cloud gaming service all running on its own infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U59wjB"&gt;That all being said, we don’t know for certain if or when &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt; will ever be playable on Luna — though based on Lawrence’s comments, it seems like you might be able to some day. In the near term, if you’re interested in &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;, you might want to check it out on PC during &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22640656/amazon-games-new-world-mmo-open-beta-date"&gt;the open beta, which begins Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, or following the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609898/new-world-mmo-amazon-delayed-release-launch-date"&gt;official launch on September 28th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKLbc4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla Model S Plaid sets production EV record at Germany’s Nürburgring race course</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UvutfgUnFtPljDqccNkI8oCbERY=/121x0:2295x1449/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69839807/Screen_Shot_2021_09_10_at_9.53.20_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Screenshot: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eo9WVSNG3yI" target="_blank"&gt;Touristen Niko&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oYSxGp"&gt;Tesla set a new lap record for a production electric vehicle at Germany’s famed Nürburgring race course. A brand-new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22528963/tesla-model-s-plaid-ev-price-specs-range-speed"&gt;Model S Plaid&lt;/a&gt; completed the 12.9-mile lap in seven minutes and 30.9 seconds, beating a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/26/20833702/porsche-taycan-nurburgring-time-nordschleife-record-break"&gt;record set in 2019 by a Porsche Taycan&lt;/a&gt; by 12 seconds. The new record was confirmed by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1436086743720251394"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hgb55"&gt;According to Musk, the Model S Plaid was “completely unmodified, [and] directly from [the] factory.” In a follow-up tweet, he said Tesla would take another crack at the Nürburgring using a “modified Plaid with added aero surfaces, carbon brakes &amp;amp; track tires (all things that can be done without Tesla being in the loop).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uDaZyg"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ujp3q_aryRA?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LVVkSJ"&gt;How important a record this is for Tesla, or any automaker for that matter, is certainly up for debate. In setting the initial record, Porsche was basically creating a new category in which to compete. As noted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s motorsports expert Sean O’Kane in 2019:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CIasbI"&gt;Automakers love bragging rights, and the Nürburgring’s Nordschleife course is one of the prime battlegrounds. But over the years, the limits of the track have mostly been explored, and so there’s not as much rarefied air left for companies who want to claim they were the fastest around the 12.9-mile course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="cwsFvx"&gt;This isn’t the first time that Tesla has set out to conquer the “Green Hell.” The company has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/12/20862105/tesla-model-s-plaid-laguna-seca-nurburgring-porsche-taycan"&gt;run prototype versions&lt;/a&gt; of its Model S Plaid around the famous race track in the lead-up to its debut as a production model. Those runs weren’t attempts to break any records, though, as Musk has called them opportunities to “review and tune” the Model S Plaid for safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="u4zw16"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eo9WVSNG3yI?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pRGt1d"&gt;The Model S Plaid is powered by a new tri-motor drivetrain that collectively put down around 1,000 horsepower, and the car can reach a top speed of 200 miles per hour — though only when outfitted with certain wheels and tires &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/06/10/tesla-warns-new-model-s-plaid-advertised-200-mph-tire-wheel-upgrade/"&gt;that won’t be available until later this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zEP2oA"&gt;But expert car reviewers are not convinced that the Plaid is worth its price tag of $130,000. After putting the new Model S through extensive tests, Edmunds concluded that it was just a “marketing exercise designed to draw attention to an aging car.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O1IBap"&gt;The question is what will Porsche do now. The German automaker isn’t likely to sit back and allow Tesla to just steal its made-up record without some sort of response. The problem, of course, is that the Taycan just isn’t as quick as the Model S Plaid. Just look at the scoreboard.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>DoorDash, Grubhub, and Uber Eats sue New York City over restaurant fee caps</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A delivery driver for DoorDash " src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pyYuWmdJJwjpK-Ae1LNGpV9Q96c=/0x0:3500x2333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69839741/1232447057.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The three food delivery services are suing NYC for capping the amount they can collect in fees from restaurants. | Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vNAJ49"&gt;Delivery service platforms DoorDash, Grubhub, and Uber Eats are suing New York City for capping the amounts they can collect in fees from restaurants. In a &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839571/Delivery_Platforms_Complaint.pdf"&gt;complaint filed&lt;/a&gt; in US District Court court late Thursday, the companies argue that the fee caps are government overreach that will harm businesses. Along with monetary damages and a jury trial, the three companies are seeking an injunction to keep New York from enforcing the fee-capping rule that the city made permanent in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lXU4KC"&gt;The city put a temporary cap on delivery fees last June to help restaurants that were relying on food deliveries to stay in business while they were closed to in-person dining because of pandemic restrictions. The platforms can’t charge restaurants more than 23 percent per order, which breaks down as 15 percent for delivery, 5 percent for having the restaurant listed on its app, and 3 percent for credit card processing feeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mudXHL"&gt;The delivery platforms have been &lt;a href="https://www.restaurantbusinessonline.com/technology/delivery-providers-accused-violating-nyc-fee-cap"&gt;accused of adding other unclear fees&lt;/a&gt; on top of their delivery fees, exceeding the maximum. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A7UF1n"&gt;New York City Councilman Mark Gjonaj, who chairs the city’s small business committee, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/grubhub-doordash-uber-eats-sue-new-york-city-over-fee-caps-11631237227"&gt;said in a statement Thursday&lt;/a&gt; that the city council would move ahead with the fee capping regulation. “The laws simply seek to bring fairness to a system that all too often lacks it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XtFcyk"&gt;A spokesperson for Grubhub said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that the company had “worked hard during the pandemic to support restaurants in New York City and across the country.” But the fee capping would “lead to a reduction of orders for both restaurants and couriers,” according to Grubhub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SqdCq1"&gt;Uber didn’t reply to a request for comment. A spokesperson for DoorDash said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the fee cap “will likely harm the very restaurants the City purports to support,” and reduce earnings for its drivers. “Imposing permanent price controls is an unprecedented and dangerous overreach by the government and will limit the options small businesses rely on to compete in an increasingly competitive market.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sODYU9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The companies made the same argument against San Francisco’s delivery fee cap&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vn2om2"&gt;That statement is nearly identical to one &lt;a href="https://news.yahoo.com/door-dash-grubhub-spar-with-san-francisco-over-arbitrary-delivery-fee-cap-190116715.html"&gt;DoorDash made in July, as it and Grubhub sued San Francisco&lt;/a&gt; to block that city from making permanent a 15 percent cap on order fees. That cap took effect in April 2020 as a temporary measure. The San Francisco board of supervisors &lt;a href="https://sfist.com/2021/06/23/san-francisco-permanently-caps-delivery-app-fees-at-15/"&gt;voted unanimously in June&lt;/a&gt; to make the fee cap permanent. SF Mayor London Breed &lt;a href="https://sfgov.legistar.com/View.ashx?M=F&amp;amp;ID=9617100&amp;amp;GUID=A4EE06FE-CC62-4BE2-B916-7DC877CD8B8F"&gt;declined to sign it&lt;/a&gt;, however, saying she considered it “unnecessarily prescriptive in limiting the business models of the third-party organizations, and oversteps what is necessary for the public good.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UquIQW"&gt;As the companies argued in San Francisco, New York City’s fee cap is likely to raise prices for consumers, they said in the latest complaint. The lawsuit also questions the city imposing a 5 percent cap on marketing services offered by food-delivery companies, when other “marketing and advertising providers, such as Google, Facebook, or Twitter remain unrestricted.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NltpNT"&gt;Some of those “marketing services” came under scrutiny during the pandemic; a report last June found that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20679021/grubhub-boycott-how-to-seamless-doordash-takeout-food-restaurant-order-direct"&gt;Grubhub was buying domain names&lt;/a&gt; to set up websites that resembled those of local restaurants — despite having no formal relationship with the business — so it could allegedly charge larger commission fees of up to 20 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wPSAUs"&gt;And as for the “harm” the fee caps could have on drivers, DoorDash came under intense criticism in 2019 when an investigation found it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20703434/delivery-app-tip-pay-theft-doordash-amazon-flex-instacart"&gt;using its delivery workers’ tips&lt;/a&gt; to pay their wages. It later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/22/20828742/doordash-tipping-policy-change-drivers-earning-more-money"&gt;revamped&lt;/a&gt; its tipping system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EfOlFN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cLoQ21"&gt;

    <title>How to use iOS 15’s Focus modes to quickly customize your iPhone’s homescreen </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gltTt7-rJuCV6Eru_gO-CpXHqyk=/6x0:2034x1352/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69839544/twarren_ios14widgets.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KscCOx"&gt;Customizing your iPhone’s homescreen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21448712/customize-iphone-home-screen-app-icons-widget-ios14"&gt;took off last year&lt;/a&gt; when iOS 14 introduced widgets and the ability to hide default app icons in favor of your own cool, customized ones. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22556236/ios-15-ipados-iphone-ipad-software-update-public-beta-preview-apple"&gt;iOS 15&lt;/a&gt; opens up a new dimension to homescreen customization, thanks to Focus modes — which give a quick and easy way to hide and reveal groups of homescreens with just a single tap. Here’s how to do it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAEVvN"&gt;Focus modes are ostensibly an extension of Apple’s Do Not Disturb mode — the intended idea behind the feature is that you can tie specific homescreens to different use cases, like having a work homescreen with your calendar and email widgets that automatically pop up when you’re in the office, and a regular homescreen with social media apps and music widgets for when you’re off the clock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T0KNUM"&gt;But since Focus modes let you choose homescreens, you can also use them to quickly swap between a slate of custom-themed icons that you’ve made with matching shortcuts and widgets, without having to manually hide all your homepages every time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XKn1sJ"&gt;To use the new feature, you’ll first need to set up a Focus mode — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579920/how-to-use-focus-modes-apple-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey"&gt;fortunately, we’ve already got a guide here&lt;/a&gt; on how to do that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zATjrr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to use Focus modes for notifications on iOS 15","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22579920/how-to-use-focus-modes-apple-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pSu6wg"&gt;You’ll also need to set up your themed homescreen with widgets and custom icons, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529978/apple-iphone-ios-apps-icon-change"&gt;which you can learn how to do here&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ptSivc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How to customize your iPhone’s app icons","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22529978/apple-iphone-ios-apps-icon-change"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="AK2oT3"&gt;Once you’ve done all that, you’ll want to go to Settings &amp;gt; Focus, select the specific Focus you want to use to trigger your custom homescreen or screens. Then select the Home Screen menu, toggle the “Custom Pages” switch, and select the homepages you’d like to appear when you enable the Focus mode. Then, all you have to do is turn on your Focus mode, and your phone will turn into your perfect themed style whenever you’d like. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SfPmGx"&gt;If you’re really willing to go the extra mile, though, you can take advantage of Shortcuts and create an automation that changes your iOS wallpaper whenever you turn on that Focus mode. Unfortunately, this doesn’t work great — at least with the current iOS 15 beta — but it is an option for those willing to muck around with Shortcuts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uGA1iL"&gt;All of this &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; still a lot of effort for a themed homescreen, of course. But unless &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451649/apple-ios-14-widgets-custom-app-icons-shortcuts-design-jailbreaking-wallpaper"&gt;Apple relents and gives us better customization tools next year&lt;/a&gt;, the new tricks in iOS 15 are the best way to get your homescreen looking stylish. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S3iBhv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Defaced on finding his way and building an icon through NFTs </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m8g0yVqr1sEInBDLpbbFe4dtAzw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69839606/defacedLede.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Taking inspiration from Jim Henson and Shigeru Miyamoto&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1J2uu1"&gt;With the rise of NFT artwork over the past year, many artists have floated my way through the Twitter content rivers. One of those people was Defaced, whose colorful, geometric designs always transport me to an alternate dimension and draw me in with characters that I can’t help but feel for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w70WWy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Defacedstudio"&gt;Defaced&lt;/a&gt;, like many digital artists, got his start in graphic design, initially developing his skills making branding packages for &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; streamers and eventually getting a job out of high school for a small tech company. He quickly realized that if he wanted his time sitting behind a computer to mean something, he’d have to make a change. After a quick stint back in school, he jumped into the world of freelance design. A bet that paid off, as within the year he’d be working for the likes of Apple and Namco. His freedom then allowed him an early shot at the NFT market, which in time would give him the money to invest back into his art and fuel his next big project. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xN8RlP"&gt;I talked with him about the development of his style, his thoughts on NFTs, and what inspires his work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wN71N65eUD33aUdfPlLAUTWjpsg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22834218/240607770_372421360992588_2146877927162023228_n.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nYhDGQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tell me a bit about Starman. What went into making this character? What does it mean to you? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bFX15W"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starmaker&lt;/em&gt; is the name of the project in its totality. Starman came about whilst creating a piece in Cinema4D. I designed the character in hopes to initially create a memorable silhouette, it later became a recurring element in a lot of my work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGKye1"&gt;As I continued to create more work, I found myself using Starman more and more as a reflection of myself a lot of time. The character was heavily inspired by the works of Jim Henson and Shigeru Miyamoto. Starman’s meaning will grow to reflect my development, but at present Starman is meant to encapsulate the contrast between childhood, the creative process, and the fear of the unknown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t3ZL378RvnGGnrs4iRwyfYhS-2A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22834348/201986605_489462478978149_8733882043520755323_n.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UICLA9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How would you describe your relationship with your own art, if you had to describe what it’s like? This is one of the more experimental questions I’m trying out.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zidOVH"&gt;Love / hate I think is the main one, because I try and do a piece daily. Some days you’re like, “I’m going to take the day off.” So like a couple of days ago, I saw my mates all day, then I came in, I was like, “Well, I might as well just spend an hour trying to make something.” Then it’s either the best hour of your life, where it all comes together seamlessly, or you’re banging your head against a wall and it’s just shit, everything looks shit, I’m a crap designer, I can’t put anything together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gQ4dOM"&gt;When you get into that, I suppose it’s a sort of semi-flow state where everything sort of slots together nicely, and especially my style is quite heavily shape-based. It’s almost like Lego how it’d all click together. You’re following the instructions, and it’s all like bang bang bang — that’s a great feeling. When you’re sitting there for two hours looking at references and you’re just like, “What the fuck should I make?” and you’re searching for ideas, that’s where I struggle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTZcbd"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When did you start that daily practice, and how has it worked out for you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qC7luR"&gt;For a couple of months now, I’ve been really consistent. I remember last year when I was coming back from France and I was trying to get fucking Wi-Fi to post something, so it’s definitely been a year of trying to be as consistent as I can really and hold myself accountable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wIP35z"&gt;I think just pushing through it on a daily basis sharpens your toolkit. Like if you’re a plumber, you can’t just turn up to work and go, “I don’t really know what to fucking do, I can’t fix this toilet today.” It’s like you’ve got to fucking do it, you’ve just got to make something, just do something. Even if it’s shit, and you put it online and someone will go, “Oh, that’s fucking cool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TVd8UVQ-Nd3Q6nbCPpdmhoZClyk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22834227/182463500_832066354065063_1402179677630049640_n.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zvUfzU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When do you have the most fun making your work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q9jCIe"&gt;I think it’s when you sort of get into that flow and everything comes together and it feels easy, almost like you’re not even trying. That’s probably the most fun part. Then at the end, I really like seeing people’s responses to it. Art in itself is quite selfish, how much time you have to spend alone, and it’s just all about you. So when people can enjoy that, that’s satisfying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G50ZN0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you pull back, what’s your favorite way to relax and unwind and gain inspiration? Or they don’t have to be mutually exclusive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u7aA92"&gt;I like playing Xbox and stuff, but it’s just seeing my friends or my girlfriend and going out for a meal and chatting. There are no fucking screens there, you’re just conversing or exchanging ideas and chatting. It just sort of switches you off and gets you into a different mind space because when the thing you love is tied in with your career and it’s tied in with your finances and social media, and when you’re on your own, it’s quite daunting just reading Twitter or something.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cKBmkA"&gt;Because the NFT market is on top of the crypto market, on days like yesterday when the market went to fucking shit big time, you can see people really fucking scared. You’re just taking in too much, you can’t process that many opinions. When everything’s tied up into a big knotted ball, you’ve just got to put it to one side and go have a fucking burger or something. You realize it’s not the be-all end-all, like we live on a fucking floating rock in space. It’s like whatever happens, fucking happens really, at the end of the day. It’s alright, nothing’s going to happen to you that badly which can’t be figured out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DfX73At8vgnccNCsVV6uGKF8yXk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22834280/staro_s.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lr8psz"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your experience of NFT’s been? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fxFWyi"&gt;I think I sold my first NFT on September 30th last year. I think one ETH was £300 or $500 USD, something like that, so I was like, “Oh, that’s good money.” Then I just thought, “Okay, I’ll just mint five other things just straight off the bat,” and I was like, “Oh, these aren’t selling like the last one.” I had no idea about the sort of scarcity idea, and I didn’t have any fucking clue about that, so that’s been a learning curve and adjusting my brain to analyze the market, analyze the business approach, and supply and demand and what makes stuff valuable, what doesn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wNfqI"&gt;Now I have been able to make some ETH, I’ve been able to put it aside and invest into a bigger project and make something cooler, and hire people to make stuff I can’t do, like 3D modeling or like a dev or some more artists to work on something, sort of building a team and go, “Okay, we’re going to go fucking big on this one.” I think as more artists figure this out and put two and two together, I think there’ll be bigger projects and there will almost be like events, and you’ll have artist events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IB3akF"&gt;The main thing for me is having a financial incentive to pursue a career in art, wherever that may lead and whatever opportunities you get from that, and however long it lasts, just making the most of it and being able to make good money doing something which you fucking enjoy. That’s like my top pillar stone, because my dad lost his job due to COVID last year, and that puts things into perspective. People can complain all they want about the carbon footprint, but there are people in Brazil who I know who lived in not great condition and they’ve been able to get into better conditions, and some artists I know who come from abusive households have been able to get out and save themselves.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="p-fullbleed-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4EVP8cPzinCFe9tw9-0LJZv5nqs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22834289/Defaced_9.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U3FFj8"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any core inspirations or some things that hold a special place in your heart? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qo0YxA"&gt;Yeah, definitely. I think Mario, that’s probably one of my top ones, and Shigeru Miyamoto and design philosophy, and all of the characters from Mario and their design. How they’ve withstood time, that’s like one of my top ones, and game mechanics and just bashing the fundamentals into it. The simplicity as well. All of that shit just shakes about in my head. Jim Henson as well, the Muppets and &lt;em&gt;Sesame Street&lt;/em&gt; and that sort of design philosophy, and even how he was as a guy and what he wanted to teach kids.	I think the two are big influences on how I want to make stuff. Kaws and Murakami are inspirations as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wNrO22"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You mentioned Henson as an inspiration, and I saw you on set (in a white bodysuit!) with Starman. What was that experience like? How has Henson impacted you and your work?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IqXarB"&gt;The experience was surreal, the day was intense but overall a great memory. I felt like an imposter at times as all of the people making it happen were all there just for me and my art.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pToTIU"&gt;Henson is one of the most overlooked artists in my eyes, the amount of people he has reached through his characters and storytelling is nothing short of impressive. To me, he represents pure creativity and vision. He has impacted my work by demonstrating how following an idea to its end can be potentially not just impactful on you but many others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SG3bKX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you give us a hint of what’s next for &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Starmaker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;? I saw someone say it’s the next Mario, which bodes well for following your inspiration. I’ve already seen artists make their own pieces of him. Seems like he’s already striking a chord. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7xdpHA"&gt;Next for &lt;em&gt;Starmaker&lt;/em&gt; will be actually dropping the first NFTs on SuperRare as my genesis drop on there. I’ll be dropping two short films including 3D animation and scenes from the studio. One of the NFTs will be accompanied by an arcade game, the collector who wins this will then have the choice to release the game publicly. Both NFTs will have a box of physicals exclusive to each NFT, including an art book, vinyl disc, bronze figure, and comic book. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XnaZz0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What role do NFTs play in this mission? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="7Pdx1Q"&gt;NFTs are the key that unlocks the door. Without NFTs, this wouldn’t even exist as a possible career path. Try finding a job where you can direct films, create games, make artwork, supervise the manufacturing, and at the crux of it create worlds from your imagination — that job doesn’t exist without NFTs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OQmM1m"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g3mH3i"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FlFohk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gd2hKT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Joe Biden’s vaccine mandate is the right thing to do</title>

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Joe Biden delivers remarks on COVID-19 vaccinations and the Delta Variant" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H2l_878PNhe4A4xBMIqkRTuOoZU=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69839460/1235150398.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Kent Nishimura / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fv0Exr"&gt;On Thursday night, President Joe Biden announced a new federal vaccine mandate, putting new pressure on Americans who refuse to be inoculated against COVID-19.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w471ZK"&gt;“This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated,” Biden said &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/FFxPz0QVgw4?t=1020"&gt;in a speech to the nation&lt;/a&gt;. “Despite the fact that for almost five months, free vaccines have been available in 80,000 different locations, we still have nearly 80 million Americans who have failed to get the shot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="V8llyl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is a pandemic of the unvaccinated”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mYxGMw"&gt;The federal government can’t directly force people to get vaccinated, but Biden’s new mandates do&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;everything short of that. Among other efforts, &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/covidplan/#vaccinate"&gt;the plan&lt;/a&gt; requires all federal workers, contractors, and a range of government-linked businesses to vaccinate their employees, including healthcare facilities that accept federal funding. Most importantly, it will establish a new OSHA standard for all businesses with more than 100 employees to require either immunization or weekly testing. Businesses that skirt the mandate could face fines of up to $14,000 per violation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PBKCQt"&gt;Right-wing media wasted little time in &lt;a href="https://view.newsletters.cnn.com/messages/1631244710856eed75eaf94dd/raw?utm_term=1631244710856eed75eaf94dd&amp;amp;utm_source=cnn_Reliable+Sources+-+September+9,+2021&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;bt_ee=VJ%2BJicg7cxSGQ2CUNwgH8YbHLH0aGDyfYCX6lp01l6lAuFlqFv4Z92vmdpNUjdMNCAeOaCJZSLDc10p%2BnD6dFQ%3D%3D&amp;amp;bt_ts=1631244710859"&gt;trashing the idea&lt;/a&gt;, with one cable news describing the order as “full totalitarian.” &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-business-health-coronavirus-pandemic-economy-e23b46e3bcc5c1110ece87fb7d63974d"&gt;A headline in the &lt;em&gt;Associated Press&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; described it as “a war on the unvaccinated.” &lt;a href="https://news.gallup.com/poll/354506/update-american-public-opinion-vaccination-requirements.aspx"&gt;While vaccine requirements are broadly popular&lt;/a&gt;, many of the biggest figures in American politics seem ready to denounce Biden’s order as an affront to personal liberty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="j5r6wc"&gt;&lt;q&gt;a federal vaccine mandate will save lives&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PQwKvv"&gt;But a federal vaccine mandate will save lives, and it’s the right thing to do. The vaccines&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;work. Billions of people around the world have already taken them, and the result has been minimal side effects and overwhelming protection against death and hospitalization from COVID-19. One, made by Pfizer-BioNTech was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22616546/pfizer-covid-vaccine-fda-approval-licensing"&gt;fully approved by the Food and Drug Administration&lt;/a&gt; in August, after meeting stringent requirements for safety and effectiveness. At the same time, hospitals across the country are overwhelmed by the new flood of cases, driven by people who refused to be vaccinated. Political leaders should use every available power to end this nightmare — and that’s exactly what Biden is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h0Lz46"&gt;The new mandate may inflame the persecution fantasies of the anti-vax rump, but it will save the lives of many of the same people who are resisting it. We’ve seen &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/unvaccinated-hospitalized-patients-say-they-regret-not-getting-shot-n1273342"&gt;case&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2021/08/18/texas-couple-declined-covid-19-vaccine-died-orphans/"&gt;case&lt;/a&gt; of vaccine resisters changing their minds once they contract the disease, only to find it’s too late. These deaths are tragic and entirely preventable. All it requires is taking the pandemic seriously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LK41Mn"&gt;The mandate also isn’t as unprecedented as it sounds. Many employers have already mandated vaccinations to enter workspaces — including Fox News, as Biden noted in his speech, but also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22600423/vaccine-mandates-federal-state-google-facebook"&gt;every major tech company&lt;/a&gt;. Much of Europe already requires proof of vaccination to enter public spaces. The effect of the mandate won’t just be to expand those mandates, but to even them out. The mandate isn’t just for certain workers or certain jobs. Everyone is at risk, and everyone should get the vaccine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="JeYysy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;more than 1,000 people in America are dying from COVID every day&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JJXsZW"&gt;To make that expansion, Biden is drawing on long-established authorities. &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150613025200/http://www.legalarchiver.org/osh.htm"&gt;The Occupational Safety and Health Act&lt;/a&gt; gives the Labor Secretary broad discretion to set and enforce mandatory standards for workplaces. COVID-19 is very much a threat to workplace health, given the hundreds of thousands of essential workers who have contracted it on the job, and &lt;a href="https://www.dir.ca.gov/dosh/coronavirus/ETS.html"&gt;various OSHA branches&lt;/a&gt; have been issuing guidance on it for months. This far into the vaccine rollout, unvaccinated people are putting their coworkers at risk, and it’s fair to treat that hesitancy as a hazard&lt;strong&gt; —&lt;/strong&gt; the same way you would treat radiation or pulverized asbestos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CW1n69"&gt;There’s also the reality that many people cannot take the vaccine for medical reasons, and rely on those who can to limit the pandemic’s spread. Children under 12 still aren’t approved for vaccination, even as we return to in-person schooling. These children are at real, tangible risk, and we should do everything we can to protect them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDGaWf"&gt;Opponents say the problem is not the vaccine itself, but the mandate. Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-TX) laid out this argument on Twitter Thursday night, arguing that the broad requirement will provoke more resistance. “The right path is built upon explaining, educating, and building trust,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DanCrenshawTX/status/1436061015708520457"&gt;Crenshaw wrote&lt;/a&gt;, “so a person can make their own decision.” It’s an appealing idea, but a misguided one. We’ve had more than six months to build trust, and there’s no sign that anti-vaxxers are coming around. If anything, opposition to public health measures is entrenching, stoked by craven culture war concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hDkgWk"&gt;Driving all of it is the sheer human cost of the virus, which is still hard to take in. Over 600,000 people have died from COVID-19 in this country, and more than 56,000 of those deaths have come since June 1st, when vaccines were widely available. As I write this, more than 1,000 people in America are dying from the virus every day. It’s a death toll on the scale of a war or, more aptly, a massacre.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RiyIQX"&gt;We know how to stop this pandemic. We’ve done the work and built the tools. We just have to use them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung releases eco-friendly watchbands made from apple peel</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4S-pF5elMiyiQ9c3FJHBTh94xLE=/0x0:6582x4388/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69839279/IMG_0072.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prices for the watchbands start at $39.99.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="632uJc"&gt;Samsung has announced six limited edition watch bands for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22629459/galaxy-watch-4-classic-review-bixby-google-wearos"&gt;Galaxy Watch 4&lt;/a&gt; made of recyclable and eco-friendly materials including apple peel. The range was made in collaboration with Sami Miró, a fashion designer whose previous collections have made use of upcycled materials. The bands are available today, with prices starting at $39.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sik6nf"&gt;There are six designs included in the collection. The “Midnight Black” and “Stratus Sky” bands are made out of 100 percent apple peel skin “recovered from the fruit industry.” Samsung claims the material has the “premium look of leather” while obviously not being sourced from animals. The other four designs (“Aurora Night,” “Cloud Navy,” “Earth Sunrise,” and “Dawn Atlas”) are made of a thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) material which Samsung says is recyclable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WBwZAq4o8c9r-a9QDIyYDr9hyqk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22839353/SamsungxSami_WatchBands_01.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Samsung&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;From left to right, first row: Aurora Night, Earth Sunrise, Midnight Black. Second row: Cloud Navy, Dawn Atlas, Stratus Sky.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="roqZ3X"&gt;Alongside the watch bands Samsung is also releasing a collection of three complementary free watch faces available for download from the Google Play store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WNXPJa"&gt;Yes, the most sustainable choice will always be to use the watch band that came with your smartwatch, but if you’re going to buy an aftermarket watchband it’s nice to know some effort’s been made to reduce its environmental footprint. Personally I hope that Samsung’s future smartwatches might use these materials as standard, rather than only in optional accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ctLqMW"&gt;Samsung already uses sustainable materials &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/27/18199663/samsung-sustainable-materials-packaging-bioplastic-recycled-plastic"&gt;in its packaging&lt;/a&gt;, and as of last year its sites across the US, China, and Europe were powered by &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/uk/sustainable-practices-samsungs-eco-friendly-efforts-towards-a-better-tomorrow"&gt;100 percent renewable energy&lt;/a&gt; (that’s not the case for all regions, &lt;a href="https://www.greenpeace.org/eastasia/blog/6690/itindustry-climate-samsung-report/"&gt;like Korea&lt;/a&gt;, but Samsung says it’s working on it). But, it still has a lot of work to do to reduce the environmental impact of its devices themselves, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F52399%2Fgalaxy-z-flip-fold-3-small-changes-make-a-big-difference&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F10%2F22666328%2Fsamsung-eco-friendly-sustainable-limited-edition-galaxy-watch-4-bands" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;particularly when it comes to repairability&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Animal Crossing: New Horizons museum exhibit finds the personal amid the pandemic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bQ5yR5VAu0B7fgKm8oJkoaOXkpk=/186x0:1266x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69839181/E_WViAAXMAIgfrI.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The National Videogame Museum explores the game’s impact by listening to players&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="EmpRsY"&gt;Fueled by pandemic restrictions, &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; became a destination for major events during 2020 and 2021. &lt;a href="https://www.usgamer.net/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-fast-becoming-a-new-way-for-hong-kong-protesters-to-fight-for-democracy"&gt;Protests&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/1/21409727/biden-harris-animal-crossing-campaign-new-horizons-yard-signs-election"&gt;political campaigns&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1avhBZoS48I&amp;amp;ab_channel=GaryWhitta"&gt;celebrity talk shows&lt;/a&gt; happened alongside the game’s own seasonal events. But when putting together its exhibition on the stories of &lt;em&gt;New Horizon&lt;/em&gt; players, the National Videogame Museum found that people were sharing things that were much more personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lmyJW"&gt;“[We were] half expecting that a lot of the submissions would be people responding to [major] events in their own way, but we found that people were marching to their own drumbeat,” says marketing and communications director Conor Clarke. “They’re not just personal [stories] in that they’re personal responses to outside events, but they’re making … the events themselves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKXTve"&gt;The Museum opened their call for entries in December, closing them a few months later so that they could capture a record of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22321111/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-archive-one-year-anniversary"&gt;game’s first year&lt;/a&gt;. “It really all started with that perfect storm of the game being released coincidentally at the moment at which many countries either went into lockdown or adopted social distancing measures,” says Claire Mead, program and collections manager. “The whole idea behind this project is being able to collect these stories and really focus not so much on the game itself, but the way in which different players have been able to shape their experience of the game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sitbNx"&gt;The exhibition, titled the &lt;a href="http://animalcrossingdiaries.thenvm.org/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing Diaries&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, launched September 2nd. Building it up from the submitted stories, Mead found that where people weren’t talking about brands or organizations using the game, they were focused on things they were building themselves, or with their communities. “Somebody putting on an exhibition in a house that they’ve purpose-built as their own gallery, or somebody creating a Halloween event for the whole neighborhood and actually learning how to play &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; because the neighborhood kids were playing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="8jXPVv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Animal Crossing: New Horizons’ anniversary","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22334355/animal-crossing-new-horizons-one-year-anniversary-nintendo-switch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EnxKDhHNSvFAbmrmlqq_hNm8n7g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22836991/Switch_ACNH_SummerUpdate_screen_02_copy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="obXStj"&gt;Sometimes these events were linked to things in the outside world. But the museum’s timeline of &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; stories is also filled with people trying to inject a bit of novelty into the monotony of pandemic life. Mead mentions Nintendo South Wales (fans who are unaffiliated with the company) who created a “shutterbug off” event using the game’s photography mechanics and abundance of nature. “[That was] based on a member of the group saying that they really missed just going out in the group in nature with people and trying to reconnect with nature even in lockdown,” she says. The &lt;a href="http://animalcrossingdiaries.thenvm.org/entry/shutterbug-off/"&gt;exhibition page&lt;/a&gt; for the event includes a video that shows off many of the photos taken by the club’s members.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CV9mZH"&gt;As well as using a timeline of the game’s first year to highlight moments like these, the website offers a “random” button for diving into more of the diaries. But to allow (virtual) exhibition attendees to explore in a more structured way, the museum’s curatorial team found that entries fit into several broad categories: keeping a routine, making your space, representing yourself, sharing creativity, and staying in touch. By browsing in each, it’s possible to get a real sense for the many different ways people have experienced the game. For example, the shutterbug-off falls under sharing creativity, as does everything from using the built-in &lt;a href="http://animalcrossingdiaries.thenvm.org/entry/stitching-in-pixels/"&gt;fashion designing&lt;/a&gt; mechanics to using the game to create &lt;a href="http://animalcrossingdiaries.thenvm.org/entry/poems/"&gt;poetry&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://animalcrossingdiaries.thenvm.org/entry/podcast/"&gt;podcasts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="1zHcVF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;When building the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AnimalCrossingDiaries?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AnimalCrossingDiaries&lt;/a&gt;, we were blown away by the amount of awesome videos people sent through. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From island tours, to short films, to so much more. The creativity on show is awe inspiring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Here's a short selection of some of those videos: &lt;a href="https://t.co/qu9uNiNyLi"&gt;pic.twitter.com/qu9uNiNyLi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— The National Videogame Museum (@nvmuk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nvmuk/status/1435873778316234752?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qQ3KVV"&gt;The themes are also designed to make the exhibition understandable for people who may not have played &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt;, or who may not play games at all. “Keeping a routine [or] staying in touch, and trying to create your own controlled predictable safe environment during an uncertain time are just universal experiences that we’ve all felt in the past year,” says Mead. “So for us it was really about also getting people who do not play &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; to approach those themes and understand how the game helped with that. And challenge their assumptions a bit more about what a game even is in the first place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fyrg0Y"&gt;Though the exhibition focuses on players’ experiences of the first year of the game, it remains open to submissions for potential future showcases. Mead has several potential avenues that she says she would be interested in exploring, like inclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ycZqNc"&gt;“There’s been lots of really interesting conversations around skin tone in the game … as well as gender inclusion and just having gender neutral options in the English version,” she says. But there are also topics she would like to see the museum explore critically, like the presence of brands and political parties in the game, or its reflection of colonialism. “[There’s] the whole optics of arriving on a deserted island or going to other islands and completely ransacking them for resources. That was definitely a case of understanding that that is a huge subject in itself that needs proper consultation and just proper creative collaboration to explore. So I think honestly the sky’s the limit in terms of where &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing Diaries&lt;/em&gt; could go.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gK_kc_qAjkgVFq3pEDPQsZg8DgM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22837010/Switch_ACNH_ND0220_screen_05_copy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zU7x5s"&gt;Though the pandemic isn’t over, there is certainly a sense that things are very different than they were in &lt;em&gt;New Horizon&lt;/em&gt;’s first year. “I think it will be very interesting, actually, to see how people’s experience of the game might evolve and shift,” says Mead. But even with fewer worldwide lockdowns, the stories the museum has curated have demonstrated that the game will continue to be a place of respite and enjoyment for many.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mSGqFm"&gt;Clarke refers to &lt;a href="http://animalcrossingdiaries.thenvm.org/entry/m-e-and-my-island/"&gt;an entry&lt;/a&gt; by Lisa Walker, who was diagnosed with the chronic health condition myalgic encephalomyelitis (M.E., also sometimes known as chronic fatigue syndrome) in 2019. She writes about many of the themes that emerged in others’ stories: the outdoor escape, creating a daily routine, and being able to participate in events like New Year’s from home. But she’s also aware that as lockdowns ease, she won’t be one of the people completely swapping out their &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; life for physical adventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vg1JuQ"&gt;“I hope the Covid-19 pandemic will be more under control; so that people can return to their lives and the lockdowns will ease,” reads the diary entry. “I imagine some of the &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; islands will end up deserted again; but, as one of the many people living with M.E., my island life will certainly continue.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="VQiRkw"&gt;For Clarke, this highlighted the potential for continuing to gather stories even as &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; becomes decoupled from pandemic life. “The stories we’re collecting are way more universal than that. When you read [something] like that you’re like, ‘Yeah, we’ve gotta keep collecting.’”&lt;/p&gt;
