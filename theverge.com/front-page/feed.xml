    <title>TikTok secures music from Universal’s ‘full catalog’ of artists</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gFbh0S"&gt;Today, TikTok and Universal Music Group (UMG) &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-and-universal-music-group-announce-expanded-global-alliance"&gt;have announced&lt;/a&gt; the formation of what they’re calling an “expanded global alliance.” It’s a continuation and deepening of the agreement that allows TikTok’s massive user base to use songs from UMG artists. “The companies have additionally pledged to experiment with exciting new features,” the companies write in &lt;a href="https://newsroom.tiktok.com/en-us/tiktok-and-universal-music-group-announce-expanded-global-alliance"&gt;a press release&lt;/a&gt;. “TikTok users will now be able to incorporate clips from UMG’s full catalog of music, spanning the company’s iconic labels, songwriters and global territories.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZjeQF"&gt;It’s a smart move. TikTokers get to use more of the music they love as the soundtrack for their videos, the artists behind the works get paid, and UMG gets greater access to a proven viral hit-making machine. For better or for worse, TikTok is one of the biggest drivers of breakout hits online; if a song blows up on the app, it feels like it’s basically guaranteed a spot on the charts. (Though, of course, that’s not always true.) It’s also a sign that the music industry is recognizing that online influencers matter to their bottom lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gSToGG"&gt;The UMG deal follows other deals with major sectors of the music industry. In the last year, TikTok has forged similar partnerships with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/2/21546323/tiktok-sony-music-licensing-deal-labels-app"&gt;Sony Music&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/23/21077363/tiktok-licensing-deal-merlin-digital-rights-indie-music-selection-access"&gt;Merlin&lt;/a&gt; (which represents a large portion of indie labels), and &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/9508010/deals-tik-tok-warner-music-melodyvr-napster/"&gt;Warner Music Group&lt;/a&gt; — and it means that TikTok now has deals with the companies that represent just about all of popular music. Which is all to say that to the music business, TikTok has become too important to fail. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iOS 14.5 lets you set Spotify and others as Siri’s default music service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T6IeGHeKTTljO-afekPg5RDNRFY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68787430/acastro_180510_1777_siri_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1bFUT2"&gt;iOS 14.5 looks like it will be packed with features, including the ability to use your Apple Watch to unlock an iPhone with Face ID &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260639/apple-watch-iphone-unlocked-ios-14-5-app-tracking"&gt;while you’re wearing a mask&lt;/a&gt; and support for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260671/ios-14-5-ps5-dualsense-xbox-series-x-controller-support"&gt;next-gen console controllers&lt;/a&gt;. But users who have already installed the beta discovered another great feature: you’ll be able to select a third-party default music service when you ask to play a song using Siri — including Spotify (&lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/08/ios-14-5-beta-siri-default-music-service/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGyfC3"&gt;When you ask Siri to play a song on iOS 14.5, you may be prompted to select which app you want to use to play it, according to a screenshot shared &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/ldzar3/siri_asking_which_music_service_to_use_afterwards/"&gt;on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zfQAOhlEGHRcytTJd0XDUegcND8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22289406/k04jlih7hvf61__1_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSBeta/comments/ldzar3/siri_asking_which_music_service_to_use_afterwards/" target="_blank"&gt;u/matejamm1 on Reddit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The menu to select an app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q5dm3P"&gt;I’m on the iOS 14.5 beta, but interestingly, the feature worked a bit differently for me. I asked Siri to play some Tame Impala, and I wasn’t presented with a list of apps to choose from, like in the screenshot above. Instead, I was shown a prompt asking for access to my Spotify data, which I allowed. After that, requests for songs went through Spotify without any prompts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVr5dy"&gt;Other users on Reddit have reported some differences in the feature’s behavior as well, so there may still be some kinks for Apple to iron out ahead of iOS 14.5’s public release. Because this feature is still in beta, there’s always a chance it could be changed or removed before iOS 14.5 comes out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jIcQN6"&gt;The ability to set a default music app follows Apple’s welcome move to let users set their default mail or browser clients &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299342/apple-ipados14-default-apps-email-browser-choice-features-wwdc-2020"&gt;starting with iOS 14&lt;/a&gt;. You’re able to set default mail or browser apps in settings, but I haven’t found a way to set a default music app in settings. Maybe Apple will add that down the line. Still, having the option to set a default music player for Siri requests in this beta is a nice step forward. Here’s hoping Apple lets users set more defaults in future updates.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Terraria co-creator says Stadia version is canceled after losing access to Google accounts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="terraria" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-_fp59WvR9A5N77hcaEZfzI5R8U=/65x0:736x447/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68787394/RomTerraria__800px.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SnG3uk"&gt;Andrew Spinks, the co-creator of &lt;em&gt;Terraria,&lt;/em&gt; announced that his studio would no longer be working on a Google Stadia port of the game, he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Demilogic/status/1358661840402845696?s=20"&gt;announced on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; earlier today. The reason: his studio, Re-Logic, has been locked out of its associated Google and YouTube accounts for “over three weeks” without any explanation and with little recourse from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYe9n1"&gt;Early Monday, Spinks tweeted that he had “not done anything to violate your terms of service, so I can take this no other way than you deciding to burn this bridge.” In the thread, Spinks says the lockout has cost him access to “thousands of dollars of apps” he purchased, and his Gmail account, which he used for more than 15 years, is gone, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="l3Veaq"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I absolutely have not done anything to violate your terms of service, so I can take this no other way than you deciding to burn this bridge. Consider it burned. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Terraria?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Terraria&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleStadia?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@GoogleStadia&lt;/a&gt; is canceled. My company will no longer support any of your platforms moving forward.&lt;/p&gt;— Andrew Spinks (@Demilogic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Demilogic/status/1358661842147692549?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 8, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D2XAGo"&gt;According to Spinks, he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Terraria_Logic/status/1354261817904816128"&gt;first flagged&lt;/a&gt; that he lost access to his accounts on or around January 16th and even used the game’s official Twitter account to call on YouTube to provide additional information, but to no avail. The official &lt;em&gt;Terraria &lt;/em&gt;account did have a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TeamYouTube/status/1354207808460357641?s=20"&gt;perplexing back-and-forth with the @TeamYouTube account&lt;/a&gt; on January 26th, but there appears to have been little help offered beyond the suggestion that the team follow standard account recovery guides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eSzxy4"&gt;Google did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o42KTO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Terraria&lt;/em&gt; is a side-scrolling action-adventure sandbox game that was initially released in 2011 on PC. Despite the game being almost 10 years old, it still receives updates and has been ported to multiple platforms, with the most recent being in 2019 on the Nintendo Switch. The game is also available on Android devices and is one of the many games available on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/23/20878843/google-play-pass-bundles-350-android-games-and-apps-for-4-99-per-month"&gt;Google’s Apple Arcade competitor, Play Pass&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gVcxqf"&gt;The cancellation of a Stadia port for &lt;em&gt;Terraria&lt;/em&gt; comes at a challenging time for Google Stadia: last week, the company announced it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;closing its in-house development studio&lt;/a&gt; and said it would rely instead solely on third-party developers. The cloud gaming service is also losing one of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254897/stadia-timed-exclusive-crayta-pc-port-state-share-beta"&gt;biggest exclusives, &lt;em&gt;Crayta&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as its timed exclusivity deal is slated to end soon. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The first member of Congress has died from COVID-19</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Freshman Members" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h3bzd_ASZzuk1KX_h5NHtXKTvPY=/0x0:5377x3585/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68787300/1062366572.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Williams / CQ Roll Call&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="boOrlw"&gt;Rep. Ron Wright (R-TX) has died after two weeks in the hospital with COVID-19, his office announced today. Wright was the first sitting member of Congress to die from the disease.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Devy1q"&gt;Wright was 67 years old and had a number of comorbidities. He was sick with lung cancer and was hospitalized for complications related to that condition in September. He &lt;a href="https://wright.house.gov/media/press-releases/wright-tests-positive-covid-19"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that he’d tested positive for COVID-19 on January 21st after coming into contact with someone who had the virus the week before. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AkeOZW"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/01/13/us/congressional-members-with-coronavirus.html"&gt;Over 60 members&lt;/a&gt; of Congress have tested positive for COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. That includes three other Texas Republican representatives: Kevin Brady, Louie Gohmert, and Kay Granger. A number of lawmakers contracted the disease after the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22239408/capitol-riot-covid-cases-superspreader-arrests"&gt;riots at the Capitol&lt;/a&gt; on January 6th after they were forced to hide in small rooms for safety. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbu3Cw"&gt;Wright’s wife, Susan, was also hospitalized with the disease. “Ron remained stoic in the face of his health challenges, and incredibly upbeat about the future of the state and the nation he loved so much,” his office &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSherman/status/1358809435397881861/photo/1"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJZpRs"&gt;Wright is one of the over 460,000 people in the US who have died from COVID-19, out of more than 27 million reported cases. Daily cases are declining across the country, and the vaccination campaign is picking up speed, but experts worry that more contagious &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22206522/coronavirus-test-variant-contagious-uk-gene"&gt;variants&lt;/a&gt; could stall or reverse that progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LxBype"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>House chair wants to know who’s financing Parler</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Postal Hearing at House Oversight" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1nDznQGeYt-6dbww-PbfKuuAo0U=/0x0:5011x3341/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68787184/1228195075.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images/Pool&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VhJKld"&gt;Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-NY), chair of the House Oversight Committee, is demanding documents from the free speech social network Parler related to its financing after last month’s deadly attack on the Capitol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9cDCw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/2021-02-08.CBM%20to%20Wernick%20-Parler%20re%20Negotiations.pdf"&gt;In her letter&lt;/a&gt; to Parler’s chief operating officer Jeffrey Wernick Monday, Maloney called on the company to hand over documents outlining who or what entities have ever had any control over the company, a list of some of its creditors, and any documents or communications tying the company to a Russian individual or entity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aETayh"&gt;“Since the attacks, numerous Parler users have been arrested and charged for their roles, with the Department of Justice citing in several instances the threats that individuals made through Parler in the days leading up to and following the attack,” wrote Maloney. “Individuals with ties to the January 6 assault should not—and must not—be allowed to hide behind the veil of anonymity provided by shell companies.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kQTyMH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Individuals with ties to the January 6 assault should not—and must not—be allowed to hide behind the veil of anonymity.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tE5N4Y"&gt;Earlier this month, Maloney called on FBI Director Christopher Wray to “conduct a robust examination of the role that the social media site Parler played” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242595/house-oversight-parler-fbi-investigation-carolyn-maloney-chris-wray"&gt;in the pro-Trump assault&lt;/a&gt; on the Capitol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eylbqw"&gt;After several Parler users were arrested for participating in the January 6th attack on the Capitol, the company’s finances have been the subject of numerous news reports and now a congressional inquiry. Last year, Rebekah Mercer, a prominent conservative donor, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/11/15/media/rebekah-mercer-parler/index.html"&gt;revealed that she was helping&lt;/a&gt; fund Parler. Mercer is the daughter of Robert Mercer, a hedge fund manager who bankrolled the now-defunct political data shop &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17165130/facebook-cambridge-analytica-scandal"&gt;Cambridge Analytica&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCiUpP"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/ryanmac/trump-parler-ownership"&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt; reported last week&lt;/a&gt; that former President Donald Trump’s company, the Trump Organization, sought stake in Parler in order for him to start an account on the platform. &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed &lt;/em&gt;said that Parler offered the Trump Organization a 40 percent stake in the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tkL3bs"&gt;Late last month, Parler’s CEO John Matze was fired. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/parler-john-matze-mercer-rebekah-robert-d9d5a394-f8a3-4037-8d8e-cb30d0f5429c.html"&gt;In an &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;interview Sunday&lt;/a&gt;, Matze said he felt “betrayed” by Rebekah Mercer after he was casted out from the company and said he didn’t want to make a deal with the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/parler-ceo-trump-twitter-deal-22531319-3432-4799-ba51-8fab022b2f48.html?utm_campaign=organic&amp;amp;utm_medium=socialshare&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter"&gt;Trump Organization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mZwmWM"&gt;Parler has been removed from both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Apple&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221730/apple-removes-suspends-bans-parler-app-store"&gt;Google’&lt;/a&gt;s app stores and forced offline after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22223335/parler-amazon-terminates-web-hosting-aws-google-apple-capitol"&gt;Amazon Web Services pulled&lt;/a&gt; out from hosting the website last month. It’s unclear when or if Parler will come back online.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mark Cuban is co-founding a podcast app where hosts can talk to fans live and monetize their conversations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2ARKuWWkiW76JzkjuFxYIhk1V-Q=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68787154/VRG_4401_Firesidechat_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xkm576"&gt;Mark Cuban is getting in on the audio and podcasting hype. Alongside co-founder Falon Fatemi, he’s planning to launch &lt;a href="https://www.firesidechat.com/"&gt;Fireside&lt;/a&gt;, a “next-gen podcast platform” that facilitates live conversation, according to an email sent to possible creator partners seen by&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The app idea is similar to the buzzy live audio startup Clubhouse, except with the ability to natively record conversations. A source close to Fireside says the app plans to launch publicly this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="29eSul"&gt;Fatemi, who co-founded and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/24/sugarcrm-acquires-node-to-gain-predictive-customer-intelligence/"&gt;sold the AI customer relations service Node&lt;/a&gt;, promises a platform where creators will be able to broadcast, record, and monetize conversations while using Fireside’s built-in analytics tools to figure out what content performs best. The app, according to a now-expired engineer job posting, has raised a “multi-million dollar” seed round to get started. The source close to the company says creators will be offered various deals and ways to monetize, and the app won’t let just anyone speak publicly. It’ll be a highly curated experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ciamva"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fireside wants to offer “civil intelligent discourse”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xAR4Ly"&gt;The startup is still seemingly in stealth mode. It’s unclear when it was founded, but job postings went live as early as September. Fatemi left Node in August, saying at the time that she would be moving on to a “new venture.” She hasn’t listed Fireside on her LinkedIn yet. Cuban and Fatemi previously collaborated on Node, with Cuban investing in the product. His co-founder status on Fireside brings him back into the audio space. He and Todd Wagner &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB922916873273123235"&gt;famously sold&lt;/a&gt; internet radio company Broadcast.com for $5.7 billion in 1999 to Yahoo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xGOXoV"&gt;“Today we say goodbye to current media platform limitations created by one-way conversations, a lack of interactivity, and non-existent analytics,” Fatemi writes in the email to creators. “We level the playing field by empowering creators based on what they have to say (not how loud they yell) and we give their ideas the reach to turn a single conversation into the seed of the next media empire.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UCATAf"&gt;Fireside’s job posting claims “social media has failed us” by creating “antagonistic echo chambers with mediums for communication that only further an outrage culture and business models that incentivize spreading disinformation.” Fireside, the posting says, is looking to foster “civil intelligent discourse, shared connected experiences, and genuine relationship building virtually” through its broadcasting platform, which will “promote driving social impact through meaningful conversations at scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OjElTY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fireside will feature curated conversations&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b6JIlK"&gt;As part of that goal, Fatemi is reaching out to established podcast creators about “Founding Firesider” spots, seemingly to build an initial roster of Fireside users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVV4Yh"&gt;Fatemi declined to comment, and Cuban confirmed that “yes,” he is a co-founder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xdzHZ5"&gt;The app is unrelated to the established podcast hosting and analytics platform &lt;a href="https://fireside.fm/"&gt;Fireside&lt;/a&gt;, which has been around since 2016. Dan Benjamin, Fireside’s founder and CEO, says there’s no connection between the two services. “Creating a memorable brand is a challenge, and we’ve already heard from customers (and potential customers) who are confused about this,” he writes to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “It’s surprising and more than a bit concerning. I imagine they just didn’t realize that we here at Fireside have been in podcast hosting for almost five years, or about my own personal involvement in podcasting since 2006. Of course I invite them to reach out to me so we can begin a dialogue and figure out a solution.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUGXgj"&gt;Cuban and Fatemi’s Fireside joins a legion of other audio apps looking to make live audio a regular way to interact online. Clubhouse, most notably, launched last year and has steadily grown, even as an invitation-only service, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22261435/elon-musk-clubhouse-podcasts-robinhood"&gt;attracted big names like Elon Musk&lt;/a&gt;. The platform &lt;a href="https://www.joinclubhouse.com/welcoming-more-voices"&gt;now has&lt;/a&gt; millions of users, and its team is looking to help creators monetize through a formal program. Twitter is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22187490/twitter-spaces-test-voice-chat-rooms"&gt;testing Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, its own take on live broadcasted conversations. While these aren’t formal podcasting apps — there’s no way to record a Clubhouse conversation natively — they all seem to take advantage of the podcasting hype buoyed by Spotify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZhIND"&gt;Spotify has invested hundreds of millions of dollars &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/6/18213462/spotify-podcasts-gimlet-anchor-acquisition"&gt;to acquire&lt;/a&gt; established podcasting networks and technology, as well as to lock down exclusive deals with big-name stars, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21263927/joe-rogan-spotify-experience-exclusive-content-episodes-youtube"&gt;Joe Rogan&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/6/18655475/spotify-signs-podcast-deal-with-the-obamas-production-company"&gt;the Obama family&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile, Apple, the original podcast creator, is &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-plans-podcasting-subscription-service-in-threat-to-spotify"&gt;reportedly exploring&lt;/a&gt; the launch of a podcast subscription service, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22098312/amazon-music-wondery-acquire-buy-podcast-industry"&gt;Amazon Music&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/24/21398875/audible-plus-premium-subscription-membership-plan-credit"&gt;Audible&lt;/a&gt; are also investing in bringing podcasts to their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can save up to $200 on new unlocked Samsung Galaxy S21 phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IRuHbMDkV-ahn_z-KIf9gwhFxpk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68786870/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3A1wHz"&gt;Samsung’s new line of Galaxy S21 smartphones launched less than two weeks ago, but &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N2FRMPN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fsearch%3Fq%3DSamsungS21%26sort%3DPRICE_LOW_TO_HIGH%26filters%3Dfct_a_filter_by%253A02_REBATE%257C03_INSTOCK%252Cfct_brand_name%253Asamsung#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1731727797377923180" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; have already marked down the phones to their lowest prices to date, with up to $200 in savings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDm8oe"&gt;If the Galaxy S21 is the phone you’re looking for, you can grab an unlocked model with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N2FRMPN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB of storage for only $700&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N38M7NT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $750&lt;/a&gt;. It includes a 6.2-inch 1080p screen with refresh rates of up to 120Hz and is equipped with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888. My colleague, Dieter Bohn, praised the Galaxy S21 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;in his review&lt;/a&gt; for having a fast processor, nice screen, and good battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9udtJt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326026"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w4jpaN"&gt;The S21 Plus normally starts at $1,000, but you can grab an unlocked model with &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N387GNG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB of storage for $800&lt;/a&gt; or a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N3573HX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model for $850&lt;/a&gt;. It includes a 6.7-inch 1080p screen with adaptive refresh rates of up to 120Hz. The Galaxy S21 Plus also includes a 12-megapixel wide-angle camera, a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera, and a 64-megapixel telephoto lens on the back, in addition to a 10-megapixel selfie camera on the front. As my colleague &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227772/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-ultra-price-specs-release-date-unpacked"&gt;Chaim Gartenberg points out in his hands-on&lt;/a&gt;, the S21 Plus no longer has a depth sensor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="J5i6vc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326050"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZNmk57"&gt;Lastly, Samsung’s flagship smartphone, the Galaxy S21 Ultra, is on sale starting at $1,000 if you want an unlocked &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N2MSSZY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model&lt;/a&gt;, $1,050 if you want &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08P54F6HB?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB of storage&lt;/a&gt;, and $1,180 if you want the highest storage configuration available for this phone, which is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08N2FS32C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L28LUW"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra is the only phone in the S21 line to include support for Samsung’s stylus, the S Pen, a first for the S-line of smartphones. The S21 Ultra also includes a 108-megapixel sensor. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;his review&lt;/a&gt;, Dieter praised the S21 Ultra’s battery life and camera system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="75FQ3F"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326077"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Twitter reportedly mulls charging for TweetDeck and new advanced features</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U88EYw8SYSJpWiiNc7EtryMS25E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68786799/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PPyeyp"&gt;Teams inside Twitter are researching ways for the company to offer paid subscriptions, which could include charging money for access to TweetDeck, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-08/twitter-considers-subscription-fee-for-tweetdeck-unique-content"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. TweetDeck is a popular alternative to the main Twitter website and mobile app that allows users to more efficiently manage multiple accounts and organize Twitter into a series of easier-to-read vertical feeds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UI1uHX"&gt;Alongside charging for TweetDeck, the teams are said to be exploring other ideas, including charging for new features like an “undo send” button or more profile customization options. Another idea involves introducing “tipping” to Twitter, where users could pay accounts for exclusive content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KORx1s"&gt;Twitter is thought to be exploring these plans as a way to reduce its reliance on advertising, which currently provides the majority of its revenue. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that competing ad businesses from Facebook and Snapchat continue to grow faster than Twitter’s, and the company is under pressure to diversify, thanks to the pandemic as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/3/10/21171477/jack-dorsey-elliott-silver-lake-deal-ceo-twitter-take-private"&gt;high-profile activist investors&lt;/a&gt;. Introducing a series of premium pay models to Twitter would be a bold move given most social media companies prioritize offering their services for free to maximize growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8ifyt8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter said plans are in the “very early exploration” stage&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MpOjKc"&gt;In a statement given to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, Twitter’s head of revenue products, Bruce Falck, confirmed the company’s plans to improve its revenue mix “may include” subscriptions, but he stressed that its plans are in the “very early exploration” stage. “We do not expect any meaningful revenue attributable to these opportunities in 2021,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nZBxTO"&gt;Twitter has been exploring some of these ideas for years. Back in 2017, the company considered charging for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/23/15043422/twitter-subscription-service-tweetdeck-survey"&gt;premium TweetDeck features&lt;/a&gt; before later abandoning the plans, and last year a customer survey &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/07/31/twitter-survey-reveals-the-subscription-options-its-eyeing-including-an-undo-send-option/?guccounter=1&amp;amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAHDiKj3-9DGPXQKPafyuDvucuOSkK9DPen5Mh28KYkVuo2hwOK6fnKfFEiczD7fY5E8JMJ7odY2mYbkIL8oODJtO01B0Id8EmwP6cHwTTW0oHP0E0gTKe4LMMVDLGHn3xjAhKz58VMA0JCobhENrnFO561StKB5AGKZHiHh-lbbA#:~:text=Undo%20Send%3A%20A%2030%2Dsecond,before%20anyone%20can%20see%20it."&gt;revealed an interest&lt;/a&gt; in charging for an “undo send” feature. &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; notes that subscriptions have been mentioned on the company’s last two earnings calls, and just this past December, Twitter CFO Ned Segal said the company was exploring charging for features like “higher-quality video” and “analytics.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xb0UU"&gt;Twitter is due to report its latest earnings tomorrow, so there’s a chance we might know more about its plans sooner rather than later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELLzVf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K0TBLX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s 10 favorite gadgets that cost less than $50</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XIbVmXwr1lx2u70cFHQlT-jsDWE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67747257/acastro_201105_4277_50guide_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="A5iGCK"&gt;While most of us wouldn’t say no to a $6,000 Apple Mac Pro or a $1,100 electric bike, sometimes it’s just as much fun to be gifted a low-cost gadget that is just fun or useful. It may not let you edit your latest video or take you to the store, but it will help your computing be easier, keep your tech clean, cook a healthy meal, or just make you smile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tDASEL"&gt;We asked some of the staff at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to tell us about stuff they like that costs less than $50. We’ve divided their responses into two categories: tech gadgets and household items. Take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TUdypU"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tech Gadgets&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QoA3wc"&gt;8BitDo M30 wireless controller&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="8BitDo M30" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DtmoeaRD5aagyY5mt1S2RqgNYFY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21995415/m30.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;8BitDo M30&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dsAThM"&gt;8BitDo makes a lot of wireless gamepads. There are wireless NES pads, wireless Super Nintendo pads, even a wireless TurboGrafx pad. They come in Bluetooth varieties — great for pairing with your phone or computer, but with some inevitable latency — and a speedier 2.4GHz option if latency trumps flexibility in your book. But out of all these possible flavor combos, my favorite 8BitDo controller is the Sega Genesis-themed M30, which uses Bluetooth. I use it on my laptop for 2D platformers, I use it on my Android phone, and on the Analogue Mega SG it was sold alongside. But the place I use it the most is my MiSTer FPGA console. Cycling through games from the Atari up to the Neo Geo, there’s very little the M30 isn’t beautifully suited for. And at $30, it’s a no-brainer for any retro gaming fan.          &lt;em&gt;—Christopher Grant, SVP, The Verge and Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pmD1y0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10321931" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"buttons_only"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="O9DIVH"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="avEMqN"&gt;Panasonic ErgoFit earbuds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Panasonic ErgoFit earbuds" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HWHmRhaemIT8NCyGbwteQKMUlEM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21995454/panasonic_earbuds.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Panasonic ErgoFit earbuds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t0lVYK"&gt;These are my favorite ultra-cheap wired headphones. If you just need some headphones to listen to music off your computer or take Zoom calls, they’ll do the job just fine. Sure, they aren’t the greatest-sounding headphones in the world — but they’re $15 as I write this, and they sound good &lt;em&gt;enough&lt;/em&gt; at that price. And because they’re so cheap, if I lose them, it’s not a huge bite out of my wallet to replace them. &lt;em&gt;—Jay Peters, news writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kYT8bs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10321935" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"buttons_only"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="v8fNUA"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="a0WnhJ"&gt;ProOptic Complete Optics Care and Cleaning Kit&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;ProOptic Complete Optics Care and Cleaning Kit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6BvgA1"&gt;At the beginning of the pandemic, I treated myself to an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/25/9201455/olympus-e-m10-mark-ii-hands-on-photos"&gt;Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark II&lt;/a&gt; mirrorless camera, and included with the purchase was the ProOptic Cleaning Kit. It was a freebie I was certain I’d just toss in the trash or set out on my stoop for someone to take. But this $20 kit has come in handy many times for reasons related to photoshoots — as expected — and also for other things. The pieces inside are great when used for cleaning glasses, and I’ve found it to come in particularly handy when I’m installing a new glass screen protector on my phone and Nintendo Switch. It comes with a squeezable dust blaster and other gadgets that make it easy to clean a screen and wipe away various particulates. —&lt;em&gt;Cameron Faulkner, writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nyeGtE"&gt;Are you a photographer who likes to hike and take lots of pictures that you want to back up from your phone to your own local media but you don’t want to take your laptop with you? Have you heard of the &lt;a href="https://www.gnarbox.com/"&gt;Gnarbox&lt;/a&gt; SSDs, but you don’t want to spend $500 or more on one? Well, this might be perfect for you. RavPower’s FileHub is a single click backup option, without the built-in SSD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zucLWW"&gt;FileHub connects to your phone (or laptop) via Wi-Fi and, using a proprietary app, works as a file management system between that and a hard drive or SSD, transferring your data from one to the other. This device also has an Ethernet port, which means you can turn it into a Wi-Fi hotspot. It’s perfect for those hotel Wi-Fi spots that are limited to only one device. Double bonus: it can also double as an external battery (although I’d save battery life for other tasks).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2IJtn"&gt;There are some downsides: the app isn’t anything pretty to look at, but it still does the job relatively well — and by “relatively well,” I mean the transfers take a very long time. I’d never use this as my primary backup device, but it’s a good option to have for redundancy’s sake. (Note: the FileHub N300 is the one described here; the current version is the FileHub AC750.) —&lt;em&gt;Vjeran Pavic, senior director, video&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O7lqSx"&gt;I owned a phone that supported wireless charging for years before I bothered to actually buy a wireless charger, and I’m glad that I did. While I still charge my phone overnight by default, it’s great being able to quickly pop it onto an Anker charging stand while I’m sitting at my desk to keep it topped up with power throughout the day — plus, it just looks neat and tidy. If your phone already supports wireless charging, then this is a cheap and simple way to get more functionality out of it. —&lt;em&gt;Jon Porter, reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zxjFPA"&gt;USB-C charging is great. Relaxing on a couch while working is also great. But not all my plugs are in reach. This 10-foot-long USB-C cable is the answer. It’s long enough to reach across most rooms with ease, with a durable braided construction and support for up to 100W USB-C PD fast charging. —&lt;em&gt;Chaim Gartenberg, news editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dQiw6j"&gt;Can you cook rice on a stovetop? Of course. But why would you? A rice cooker frees up your stove’s burners and makes the whole process basically automatic, so you can concentrate on the rest of your meal. If you’re a connoisseur, you can spend hundreds of dollars on a big cooker with specialized settings. If you just want decent rice made quickly, though, my cheap Proctor Silex has stood up to years of frequent use with very little hassle. —&lt;em&gt;Adi Robertson, senior reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QyRDFe"&gt;I like a nice bowl of cereal every now and then, but I always &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; it when my cereal gets soggy. Since I work from home and have a lot of expensive stuff on my desk, I have this rational fear that I will clumsily spill the entire bowl on my desk. The Crunch Cup allows me to get the crunchiness in every bite of my cereal and also maintain less mess on my desk. Is it an over-glorified sippy cup? Yes, but it is super convenient and it makes multitasking much easier for me.  —&lt;em&gt;Taylor Lyles, writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="h0b4vr"&gt;This low-tech classic camera has made some of my favorite photographing memories. It’s all plastic and has a fixed setting of 60mm f/8 using medium-format 120 film. The Holga has a cult following because of its price and the charm in the imperfections it creates. There is an artistry to taping the camera in different ways to block light leaks and other quirks, and the occasional softness from bowing film or the vignetting look is where Instagram got the look for its filters.  —&lt;em&gt;Amelia Holowaty Krales, staff photographer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RbQO0b"&gt;I’ve got a house that is full of stuff — gadgets, books, keepsakes, pens, old Fresh Direct bags, you name it — and as a result, I am forever losing my keys, my reading glasses, and my phone amid the chaos. So a product like the Chipolo Ocean Edition tracker is perfect for somebody like me. It’s not the most well-known tracker on the market — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/9/21428061/tile-premium-plus-launch-insurance-refund-amount-lost"&gt;that honor goes to Tile&lt;/a&gt; — but this one has the added ethical attraction of being made from recycled fishing nets (and it’s a really nice blue color as well). At $29, it’s about $5 more than the most basic Tile (and $5 more than the equally basic Chipolo One tracker), but I’m willing to fork out the extra five-spot to feel better about the purchase. —&lt;em&gt;Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;If you’re lucky, you can save on both the &lt;em&gt;LOTR Trilogy&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit Trilogy&lt;/em&gt; on 4K Blu-ray&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

If you’re interested in getting more for your money, especially when it comes to buying games, these are good opportunities to do that. You won’t find all of the latest titles looped in at either store, but games like &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty Black Ops: Cold War,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;NBA 2K21&lt;/em&gt; for the PS5 and Xbox Series X are among them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="KRMdTH"&gt;In keeping with our habit of telling you whenever and wherever Apple’s AirPods Pro see a noteworthy discount, they’re $190 at Amazon right now. (Actually, they’re listed at $200, but $10 will be knocked off when you add them to your cart.) These were originally priced at $249, but most retailers carry them for around $210 or less. This is a great price, but what’s less good is they’re currently set to come back in stock on March 7th. Amazon says the soonest they’ll arrive is February 24th. Who knows, maybe they’ll arrive earlier?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="KcpUsY"&gt;If you have a PS5 that’s equipped with a disc drive, you can get &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt; for the cheapest price we’ve seen it sell for at Amazon and Best Buy. Usually $60, it’s $30, making this next-gen version more affordable than the PS4 version. &lt;/p&gt;
