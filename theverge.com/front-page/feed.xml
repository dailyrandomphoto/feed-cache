    <title>Microsoft mocks Apple’s doomed Touch Bar in new Surface ad</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="MacBook Pro with Touch Bar" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jIsq-yfyxJcKdG89pJLVxOMEZD8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68716065/jbareham_161111_1263_0050.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="W2671R"&gt;Microsoft has a habit of reigniting the Mac vs. PC conflict for its Surface ads, and this time it’s going after Apple’s Touch Bar. In a new TV commercial, aired during Sunday night’s NFL championship games, Microsoft pits Apple’s MacBook Pro against the company’s Surface Pro 7. It’s a chance for Microsoft to mock Apple’s Touch Bar in a TV commercial for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gjmpR"&gt;“Mac gave me this little bar, but why can’t they just give me a whole touchscreen?” asks a boy comparing the two laptops. That’s something that some MacBook Pro users have been calling for, or just the removal of the Touch Bar altogether. Apple is now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22232393/macbook-pro-2021-arm-intel-touch-bar-magsafe-kuo"&gt;reportedly planning a redesign for the MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; later this year, with the Touch Bar rumored to be replaced by physical function keys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ac5d4c"&gt;Elsewhere in the ad, Microsoft tries to position the Surface Pro 7 as a gaming device. “It is a much better gaming device,” claims the ad, which is an unusual way to frame Microsoft’s popular Surface device. The Surface Pro 7 is barely capable of running the latest PC games at acceptable frame rates with its integrated Intel graphics, so it’s not the biggest selling point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Z2E20"&gt;Microsoft has previously compared its Surface Pro &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/8/11/5990217/mac-vs-pc-surface-pro-3-ads"&gt;to the MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;, bashed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/29/12688554/microsoft-surface-pro-4-ad-mac-vs-pc-cat-for-your-hat"&gt;Macs in general&lt;/a&gt;, and found a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2019/7/31/20749394/microsoft-mac-vs-pc-ad-mac-book-apple"&gt;guy named Mac Book&lt;/a&gt; to tell people to get a Surface Laptop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MUJj90"&gt;This latest ad also focuses on the older Surface Pro 7, which has now been replaced by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218445/microsoft-surface-pro-7-plus-features-price-specs-release-date"&gt;Surface Pro 7 Plus for businesses and schools&lt;/a&gt; at least. The new model includes a bigger battery, Intel’s 11th Gen processors, a removable SSD, and LTE. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix update makes your Android phone’s crappy speakers sound better</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2tF7h2CHETDfJ137aam32T_j2Ng=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68716063/acastro_181101_1777_netflix_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="P2gEyW"&gt;Netflix has detailed an upgrade to its Android app which should reduce buffering and make audio sound better and easier to hear over background noise. It’s been made possible thanks to the adoption of the xHE-AAC codec, which a &lt;a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/optimizing-the-aural-experience-on-android-devices-with-xhe-aac-c27714292a33"&gt;Netflix blog post&lt;/a&gt; says should “improve intelligibility in noisy environments, adapt to variable cellular connections, and scale to studio-quality.” Netflix’s use of the codec was &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210112005751/en/Netflix-Now-Streaming-with-Fraunhofer%E2%80%99s-xHE-AAC-Audio-on-Android-Mobile"&gt;announced earlier this month&lt;/a&gt;, and is available on devices running Android 9 and above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jDxbM4"&gt;xHE-AAC uses metadata to solve a few different audio problems people have when watching shows on mobile devices. Netflix explains this is often a problem of loud background noise making content hard to hear, combined with weak and tinny phone speakers that sound bad when you try to put up the volume. Inconsistent dialogue levels also mean you have to constantly turn your volume up and down between shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ClCKiR"&gt;Netflix says xHE-AAC offers better Dynamic Range Control, a technology that reduces the difference between the loudest and quietest parts of a show. Quiet content is made louder so you can hear it over background noise, and the volume of loud content is brought down to prevent clipping, all in theory without sacrificing audio quality. Netflix also says that the volume of dialogue is kept consistent between shows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bbXuVML71dwTBKCurWxItaXWyMY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22257742/0_HHM3UHqj5R094k8r.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Before: The volume of dialogue levels (the black bars) are inconsistent, and wide dynamic range means content gets quiet and potentially hard to hear.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8GKNOQD_Wf14iTJUNMD24sx3Cok=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22257741/0_rrskjciygUhk2FpN.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After: Dynamic range reduced, so audio can’t get too quiet or too loud, and dialogue volume normalized.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pHZODC"&gt;Finally, the codec also supports “seamless bitrate switching,” which means it should work better in environments with inconsistent internet speeds. Netflix added similar adaptive bitrate functionality to its TV apps &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525492/netflix-high-quality-audio-bitrate-scaling-kbps-dolby-atmos-5-1"&gt;back in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kc70UD"&gt;Netflix says that user testing has demonstrated the benefits of the codec. Volume changes between content are “noticeably down” and viewers switch away from using their phone’s built-in speakers 7 percent less often with the new codec. Netflix says it hopes to bring the codec to other platforms that support it. For those keeping track, iPhones have supported xHE-AAC &lt;a href="https://www.audioblog.iis.fraunhofer.com/adaptive-bitrate-audiocodec-xheaac-apple-amazon-android"&gt;since the release of iOS 13&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google workers across the globe announce international union alliance to hold Alphabet accountable</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/09bRGwRJ_zzoDiTgBUViB432qvk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68715832/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GaL0JA"&gt;Google workers across the world are coming together to form a global union alliance. The newly formed coalition, called Alpha Global, is comprised of 13 different unions representing workers in 10 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, and Switzerland. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBIgKc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://uniglobalunion.org/sites/default/files/imce/alphabet_commitment_final.pdf"&gt;The announcement&lt;/a&gt; comes weeks after &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html"&gt;workers in the US and Canada launched the Alphabet Workers Union&lt;/a&gt; (AWU), a minority union affiliated with the Communications Workers of America. AWU &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/11/22224926/google-union-700-members"&gt;grew from 230 members to more than 700 within a week&lt;/a&gt; after it launched. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEq8Um"&gt;Alpha Global is affiliated with the UNI Global Union, a federation of labor unions representing 20 million people worldwide, including workers at Amazon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ekjeiq"&gt;“We know that organizing for justice at a global company like Alphabet does not stop at national boundaries,” said Parul Koul, executive chair of the Alphabet Workers Union and a Google software engineer, in a statement. “That is why it is so important to unite with workers in other countries. In a world where inequality is tearing apart, our societies and corporations  are hoarding more influence than ever, reclaiming our power through our unions has never been more important.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ozw9uY"&gt;Minority unions like AWU get their power by building worker solidarity. The structure allows AWU to include Google contractors as well as full-time employees, but it also means the union isn’t currently recognized by the National Labor Relations Board, and &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/22213494/google-union-alphabet-workers-tech-organizing-activism-labor"&gt;can’t force Google management to negotiate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xX3ktz"&gt;Similarly, Alpha Global will gain power by uniting Google workers in different countries. The coalition won’t have a legally binding agreement with the company, at least to start. Down the road, it may try to pressure Google to sign a neutrality agreement — a contract that forces Google to support attempts to unionize — although it’s doubtful the company would agree to such terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p6WBlM"&gt;Signing a neutrality agreement also might not be necessary for Alpha Global to force change. In 2020, UNI Global Union helped to organize the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-26/amazon-unions-from-brazil-to-germany-plan-black-friday-protests?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Make Amazon Pay campaign&lt;/a&gt;, an international Black Friday strike that &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-amazon-com-protests/more-than-400-lawmakers-from-34-countries-back-make-amazon-pay-campaign-idUSKBN28D2ET"&gt;garnered support from more than 400 lawmakers&lt;/a&gt;. The federation does not have a legal agreement in place with Amazon — it’s gained power by uniting workers across the globe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x67tQ6"&gt;“The problems at Alphabet — and created by Alphabet — are not limited to any one country, and must be addressed on a global level,” says UNI general secretary Christy Hoffman. “The movement launched by tech workers at Google and beyond is inspiring. They are using their collective muscle to not only transform their conditions of employment but also to address social issues caused by increasing concentration of corporate power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OezjcK"&gt;Now that it is public, Alpha Global will elect a steering committee, which could include workers from Google as well as union organizers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwH2kq"&gt;Alpha Global organizers say they plan to tackle national issues, like the treatment of content moderators in certain countries, as well as international concerns, like workers being forced to sign nondisclosure agreements. In total, the alliance includes unions from the United States, Switzerland, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Italy, Germany, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and Belgium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3tieFH"&gt;“The power of these global tech companies is such that they’re in every part of our lives,” says Fionnuala Ní Bhrógáin, an organizer with the Communications Workers’ Union in Ireland. “If they’re acting in this way nearly entirely unchecked by governments then there is no hold on what they can do. That power needs to be checked, and it’s only through collective action that workers are able to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="euCM3z"&gt;Alpha Global is yet another sign that the fight to unionize tech workers is accelerating. If it’s successful, it could provide a template for workers at other tech giants — to find solidarity not just within a single country, but at offices and warehouses around the globe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBrv8A"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UeZmmH"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="foOqYk"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="efc28c"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gabe Newell has big plans for brain-computer interfaces in gaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c5czHhFCPb4Svk9-fxY5bPoIvQM=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68715814/msedge_vJOA5MrBw6.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Newell during a recent interview with 1 News.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/gabe-newell-says-brain-computer-interface-tech-allow-video-games-far-beyond-human-meat-peripherals-can-comprehend" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vft5gy"&gt;Valve co-founder and president Gabe Newell talks about Valve’s exploration of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) for gaming and beyond, in an interview with &lt;a href="https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/gabe-newell-says-brain-computer-interface-tech-allow-video-games-far-beyond-human-meat-peripherals-can-comprehend"&gt;New Zealand’s &lt;em&gt;1 News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Although Newell admits that the idea of having your brain interface directly with a computer sounds “indistinguishable from science fiction,” he says developers would be making a “silly mistake” if they ignore the area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d96UwI"&gt;Newell says that Valve is currently working with OpenBCI headsets to develop open-source software with the aim of making it easier for developers to understand the signals coming from people’s brains. At its most basic, this could allow software to understand whether a player is enjoying a game, and adjust the experience accordingly. For example, games could turn up the difficulty if they sense a player is getting bored. But Newell’s more ambitious ideas involve actually writing signals to people’s brains, rather than just reading them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uD39Ut"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Oh, remember Bob? Remember when Bob got hacked by the Russian malware? That sucked”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ypHH49"&gt;Newell suggests our ability to experience existing games is limited by our physical body — or “meat peripherals” as he puts it. But interfacing directly with a player’s brain could open up a lot more possibilities. “The real world will seem flat, colorless, blurry compared to the experiences you’ll be able to create in people’s brains,” Newell says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0sN6qI"&gt;Valve has spoken publicly about its work on brain-computer interfaces before. Back at 2019’s Game Developers Conference, Valve’s principal experimental psychologist, Mike Ambinder gave a talk on the company’s work in the area, &lt;a href="https://venturebeat.com/2019/03/24/valve-psychologist-explores-controlling-games-directly-with-your-brain/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;VentureBeat&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; at the time, covering many of the same possibilities and use cases that Newell outlines in his recent interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WsElhQ"&gt;Beyond their use in gaming, Newell says that BCIs could help with other areas of human life like sleep. “One of the early applications I expect we’ll see is improved sleep — sleep will become an app that you run where you say, ‘Oh, I need this much sleep, I need this much REM,’” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Xv8Bf"&gt;Despite the possibilities, Newell admits that brain-computer interfaces carry their risks. He says that the idea of a BCI making someone feel pain is a “complicated topic,” and adds that the interfaces will be susceptible to viruses like other technologies, suggesting that they’ll need similar safeguards in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbYmGP"&gt;“Nobody wants to say, ‘Oh, remember Bob? Remember when Bob got hacked by the Russian malware? That sucked — is he still running naked through the forests?’” Newell quips. “People are going to have to have a lot of confidence that these are secure systems that don’t have long-term health risks.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qWY79C"&gt;Regardless, it sounds like Valve doesn’t have any plans to commercialize its research just yet. Newell says that they’re making such rapid progress that any device risks being outdated once it’s gone through the slow process commercialization. “The rate at which we’re learning stuff is so fast,” Newell says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ErOTSy"&gt;Other high-profile companies currently exploring brain-computer interfaces include Facebook, which is working on a way to allow users to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/30/20747483/facebook-ucsf-brain-computer-interface-typing-speech-recognition-experiment"&gt;type with their brains&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406143/elon-musk-neuralink-ai-pigs-demo-brain-computer-interface"&gt;Elon Musk’s Neuralink&lt;/a&gt;, which is attempting to develop a less-invasive way of connecting a computer to the human brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TNj4z"&gt;You can check out more of Newell’s thoughts on the potential for brain-computer interfaces in the full write up from &lt;a href="https://www.tvnz.co.nz/one-news/new-zealand/gabe-newell-says-brain-computer-interface-tech-allow-video-games-far-beyond-human-meat-peripherals-can-comprehend"&gt;&lt;em&gt;1 News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, who he also recently spoke with about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/1/22/22244057/valve-gabe-newell-half-life-new-zealand-game-development"&gt;Valve’s future game development plans&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google plans vaccination clinics at some of its sites</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/k2w-755rGM-xtZdlSWkuJjNLJVE=/60x0:1541x987/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68715716/vaccinationsite.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D0a4j1"&gt;Google is launching an initiative to provide more than $150 million to promote education and equitable distribution of coronavirus vaccines, the &lt;a href="https://blog.google/technology/health/vaccines-how-were-helping"&gt;company announced today&lt;/a&gt;. It’s going to make some Google facilities — buildings, parking lots, and open spaces — available as vaccination clinics, with plans to open sites in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Kirkland, Washington, and New York City first, and expand nationally as vaccines become more widely available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSWuhB"&gt;Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai says in a blog post that the company would give $100 million in ad grants to the CDC Foundation, the World Health Organization, and other nonprofits. It also plans to invest $50 million in partnerships with public health agencies to help get information about vaccines to underserved communities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GncDn8"&gt;“Our efforts will focus heavily on equitable access to vaccines,” Pichai writes in the post. “Early data in the U.S. shows that disproportionately affected populations, especially people of color and those in rural communities, aren’t getting access to the vaccine at the same rates as other groups.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58rrBk"&gt;Google had already committed $5 million in grants to organizations like the Morehouse School of Medicine’s Satcher Health Leadership Institute, which is focused on addressing racial and geographic disparities in vaccine access. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lifxrI"&gt;Google will also expand the vaccine information panels in its search results, and will start showing state and regional distribution information in search so people can check when they’re eligible to receive a vaccine. Google launched the vaccine information panels in search &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22167185/google-vaccine-information-search-results-youtube-information-panels"&gt;last month in the UK&lt;/a&gt;, listing information on each individual vaccine. They’re similar to the info panels it used to share facts &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/21/21189051/google-coronavirus-website-launches-covid19-trump-enhanced-search-results"&gt;about COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/17/21225828/google-showing-covid-19-testing-centers-search-results"&gt;locations of testing centers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lOM9GG"&gt;The company says searches for “vaccines near me” have increased fivefold since the beginning of the year. In the coming weeks, COVID-19 vaccination locations will be available in search and Maps for Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas, and more states and countries will be added soon. The search results will include details about whether appointments or referrals from a doctor are required, whether there’s a drive-thru option or if access is limited to specific people. Google says it’s working with &lt;a href="http://VaccineFinder.org"&gt;VaccineFinder.org&lt;/a&gt;, government agencies, retail pharmacies, and other authoritative sources to gather the data on vaccination sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wTVswh"&gt;The initial rollout of coronavirus vaccines in the US has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22227531/covid-vaccine-website-appointments-accessible-seniors"&gt;slow and messy&lt;/a&gt;, as states have tried coordinate plans for appointments with little federal guidance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1iJAwm"&gt;“Getting vaccines to billions of people won’t be easy, but it’s one of the most important problems we’ll solve in our lifetimes,” Pichai writes in the post. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ESPN Plus apologizes for “technical issue” during UFC pay-per-view event</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="UFC 257: Poirier v McGregor" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hkSVnczizkXjpq46fmNoc3KN4zQ=/0x31:4031x2718/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68714105/1230757574.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WiXwsL"&gt;ESPN Plus says it will issue partial refunds to customers who paid for a UFC pay-per-view event Saturday only to run into technical problems. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2k7qOn"&gt;Conor McGregor vs Dustin Poirier was the headline match of the &lt;a href="https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/events/ufc-257"&gt;UFC 257 main card&lt;/a&gt;, which was set to get underway at about 10PM ET Saturday. To watch, ESPN Plus subscribers, who pay $59.99 per year for the streaming service, also paid $69.99 for Saturday’s event. But users in the US &lt;a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/ufc-257-pay-per-view-045617758.html"&gt;began reporting a blackout&lt;/a&gt; on the ESPN Plus app Saturday evening that lasted through some of the earlier fights on the main card.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WGX9RY"&gt;A spokesperson for Disney, which owns ESPN, said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Sunday that the company was “aware that a technical issue prevented a portion of users from accessing the early part of the ESPN+ pay-per-view event, and we apologize for that experience. We worked as quickly as possible to identify and resolve the issue.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0aL4iK"&gt;The spokesperson didn’t say what the specific issue was, but it affected some users in the western US and was resolved by 11PM ET, according to the company, in time to see the signature fights. Users were affected between a few minutes to more than an hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jW0Aca"&gt;The company says it will provide partial refunds to users affected by the outage. Customers who paid for the fight through a third-party platform like Apple, Roku, Google, or Amazon, will need to seek refunds from the platform, but Disney/ESPN says it will work with those companies on the refund process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZi32R"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New trailers: Godzilla vs. Kong, The World to Come, Son of the South and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W62kYel6R61X_nd204Edo9Z4_ZI=/362x0:1496x756/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68713716/godzilla_vs_kong.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong | Warner Bros.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZArnBR"&gt;I finally finished &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; last night and I get why everyone loved it so much. I was totally prepared to not like the earnest, goofy Ted but Jason Sudeikis won me over. I won’t spoil in case you haven’t seen it, but &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso &lt;/em&gt;has plenty of plot developments you expect will turn out a certain way —because we’ve been conditioned to have plots drawn out as long as possible and with as much unnecessary drama as possible— but then the characters behave like actual people! They’re smart and funny and nuanced and I can’t wait to see them again in Season 2. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBuqKw"&gt;But look what just dropped this morning: The &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt; trailer! Let’s gooooo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5hT3Vx"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/odM92ap8_c0?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="XooTBu"&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3ld3U3"&gt;The trailer for the long-awaited flick about the showdown between Kong and Godzilla— whose release was pushed back a year due to the coronavirus pandemic— is &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; here and it looks very awesome, with lots of roaring, punching, and stuff exploding. What more could we ask for? Alexander Skarsgard, Millie Bobby Brown, Rebecca Hall, and Brian Tyree Henry star in &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs. Kong&lt;/em&gt;, which hits theaters and HBO Max on March 26th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="owqnIs"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XdBp0KktXpk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="5qt3QJ"&gt;Dear Comrades!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="sEVuGx"&gt;Sorry if I gave you whiplash switching genres here! This movie tells the story of the 1962 Novocherkaask massacre, where Soviet troops fired on a crowd of unarmed protesters striking over working conditions and food prices (the incident was referenced in Solzhenitsyn’s &lt;em&gt;The Gulag Archipelago) Dear Comrades! &lt;/em&gt;is told through the eyes of Lyuda (played by Julia Vysotskaya), a former Communist party stalwart whose daughter goes missing after the attack. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="L3xU3a"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xEpSdb_f1pE?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6dGD7a"&gt;Boogie &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="j488zd"&gt;This film tells the story of a Chinese-American basketball player with aspirations of playing in the NBA, whose parents want him to follow the more traditional path to college. Written and directed by Eddie Huang, &lt;em&gt;Boogie&lt;/em&gt; stars Taylor Takahashi, Taylour Paige, Pamelyn Chee, Mike Moh, Jorge Lendeborg Jr., Alexa Mareka, Perry Yung, and Pop Smoke. It hits theaters March 5th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="swBQbX"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x0IjvDWw0i4?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="qX5Ux9"&gt;Son of the South &lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="HK3lzt"&gt;Based on Bob Zellner‘s autobiography &lt;em&gt;The Wrong Side of Murder Creek, &lt;/em&gt;this Spike Lee-produced movie tells the story of the son and grandson of Ku Klux Klan members who joins the civil rights movement during the 1960s. Lucas Till, Lucy Hale, Julia Ormond, and Cedric the Entertainer star in &lt;em&gt;Son of the South, &lt;/em&gt;which hits theaters in February. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kY54OZ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RhQu4tcHLeU?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="innAsn"&gt;The World to Come&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="mjx0v0"&gt;I thought I recognized Vanessa Kirby (Princess Margaret in seasons 1 and 2 of &lt;em&gt;The Crown&lt;/em&gt;) in this trailer (I did!). It’s a romance between two women set in the US in the 1800s. Kirby plays new neighbor Tallie, who connects with farmer’s wife Abigail (Katherine Waterston) as the pair battle loneliness and isolation (and awful husbands). Casey Affleck and Christopher Abbott also star in &lt;em&gt;The World to Come&lt;/em&gt;, which is due in theaters February 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O77qfD"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla sues former employee for allegedly stealing software</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yZIf8QzcGleUN7B49rtr83yLgJY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68713397/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="D3aRB4"&gt;Tesla is suing a former employee for allegedly stealing company information, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/22/tesla-sues-former-employee-for-allegedly-stealing-software-code.html"&gt;CNBC reported&lt;/a&gt;. The company says software engineer Alex Khatilov stole files from Tesla’s internal network related to its Warp Drive software, used to automated many of the company’s business processes. Tesla alleges in the lawsuit that Khatilov moved files to his personal Dropbox account, and that he was one of only a few Tesla employees who had access to the files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QsGtDZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22256438/491775490_Tesla_Inc_v_Alex_Khalitov_Case_4_21_cv_00528_YGR.pdf"&gt;According to the lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;, Khatilov told Tesla investigators he “forgot” about moving the files to his personal Dropbox when they confronted him. He &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2021/01/22/ex-staffer-being-sued-by-tesla-denies-he-stole-massive-cache-of-code/"&gt;told the &lt;em&gt;New York Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;in an interview that he had unintentionally moved the files to Dropbox, and, had been unaware that Tesla had filed a lawsuit against him until the newspaper contacted him. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhYddn"&gt;Tesla has not hesitated to sue in order to protect its proprietary data in the past; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21755428/tesla-martin-tripp-settlement-whistleblower-hacing-amount"&gt;in December the company settled&lt;/a&gt; with former process technician Martin Tripp, who admitted to leaking confidential information to a reporter. In 2019 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18275617/tesla-former-employee-lawsuit-trade-secret-theft-zoox-xpeng-feature"&gt;Tesla sued self-driving startup Zoox&lt;/a&gt; accusing four Zoox employees —who had previously worked at Tesla— of taking confidential documents. That case was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222763/tesla-zoox-startup-lawsuit-settlement-autonomous-driving"&gt;settled last April, with Zoox admitting&lt;/a&gt; that “certain of its new hires from Tesla” were in possession of Tesla documents. And its case against &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/10/20689468/tesla-autopilot-trade-secret-theft-guangzhi-cao-xpeng-xiaopeng-motors-lawsuit-filing"&gt;Guangzhi Cao, who Tesla accuses&lt;/a&gt; of stealing files related to Tesla’s Autopilot system, is still ongoing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber reportedly lays off 185 former Postmates workers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Uber logo against a dark background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zeK4IMndXXzD1gtLrouwEbHw12Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68713107/acastro_180927_1777_uber_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TaCAPP"&gt;Uber has laid off about 185 Postmates workers, and plans to further integrate Postmates’ infrastructure within its Uber Eats segment, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/23/technology/uber-postmates-layoffs.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. Uber acquired &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21312447/uber-postmates-acquisition-announced-food-delivery"&gt;Postmates in July for $2.65 billion&lt;/a&gt;, following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21287128/grubhub-just-eat-takeaway-merger-uber-deal-antitrust"&gt;failed attempt&lt;/a&gt; to buy rival food delivery service Grubhub. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HS0bly"&gt;Meal delivery has been one bright spot for Uber amid the pandemic, as bookings in its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/5/21551683/uber-q3-2020-earnings-revenue-loss-delivery"&gt;Uber Eats division rose 135 percent&lt;/a&gt; year-over-year in the third quarter while its ride-hailing segment dropped 50 percent over the same time period. It’s consolidated other parts of the company in a bid to become profitable by the end of 2021, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/7/22158745/uber-selling-autonomous-vehicle-business-aurora-innovation"&gt;selling its autonomous vehicles segment to Aurora Innovation&lt;/a&gt; in December, the same month it &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/air-taxi-start-up-joby-acquires-uber-elevate-.html"&gt;sold its Uber Elevate flying taxi division&lt;/a&gt; to Joby Aviation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dqFAJV"&gt;The latest cuts will see Postmates founder and CEO Bastian Lehmann depart the company, along with most of its executive team, according to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CspnEV"&gt;Uber Eats continues to trail competing food delivery service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21563716/doordash-ipo-profit-pandemic-food-delivery-drones"&gt;DoorDash, which went public in December&lt;/a&gt;, and showed a brief period of profitability over the summer. According to market research firm Edison Trends, in the fourth quarter &lt;a href="https://trends.edison.tech/research/food-delivery-and-rideshare-report-oct-2020.html"&gt;DoorDash had 48 percent&lt;/a&gt; of the market share for food delivery services, with the combined Uber Eats/Postmates at 35 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BZRei4"&gt;Uber did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aeLRNc"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VrHc41"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SpaceX launches record batch of satellites in first in-house rideshare mission</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/l7IebwA4RO1P-55e5zp8XqI_r-o=/0x0:2048x1365/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68713095/EsbDiSFXcAASE03.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;143 spacecraft inside Falcon 9’s payload fairing  | SpaceX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V0duL6"&gt;SpaceX launched a batch of 143 spacecraft to space from Florida on Sunday morning under the company’s new cost-cutting SmallSat Rideshare Program, breaking the record for the most satellites lofted into space on a single launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KqtJ2H"&gt;The Transporter-1 mission kicks off a potentially lucrative business line for SpaceX, which unveiled in 2019 its SmallSat Rideshare Program, essentially a carpool for dozens of satellites of different shapes and sizes. The program offers relatively cheap access to space for small satellite companies starting at $1 million for the first 485 pounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCyEuj"&gt;Much like a rideshare Uber, a company’s small satellite can hitch a ride to space with other spacecraft instead of buying an entire rocket at a much higher price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FG6kOV"&gt;After scrubbing an initial launch attempt on Saturday due to bad weather, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket lifted off 24 hours later from its Cape Canaveral Space Force Station launch pad at 10AM ET, sending a mix of shoebox-sized CubeSats and much heavier microsatellites to a 326-mile-high polar orbit — an unusual trajectory for a Florida launch site. SpaceX launched its first polar mission from Florida in August last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rQqevn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Liftoff! &lt;a href="https://t.co/js3zVM77rH"&gt;pic.twitter.com/js3zVM77rH&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— SpaceX (@SpaceX) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SpaceX/status/1353357167617732608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 24, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UWz9k8"&gt;The launch, SpaceX’s third so far this year, marks the most satellites carried to space on a single rocket, a record previously held by an Indian satellite launch in 2017 carrying 104 satellites. The 143 spacecraft aboard SpaceX’s Falcon 9 include 48 Earth imaging satellites dubbed SuperDoves from Planet, 17 tiny communications satellites for Toronto-based Kepler, and 30 small satellites for the US and Europe packaged by Berlin, Germany-based Exolaunch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5fexve"&gt;Also aboard the flight are small capsules of human ashes arranged by Celestis, a spaceflight memorial company. Ten Starlink satellites are also hitching a ride, inching SpaceX toward the 1,000 mark for the number of active satellites in space supporting its broadband internet constellation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4M8qzm"&gt;DARPA, the Pentagon’s R&amp;amp;D agency, pulled out from the rideshare mission earlier this month after its two 187-pound satellites were damaged during launch processing in Cape Canaveral.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wRthmo"&gt;The Transporter-1 mission, coming just four days after SpaceX launched 60 of its Starlink satellites to space, keeps pace with what’s set to be a remarkably eventful year in orbit as SpaceX, OneWeb and other companies race to build vast constellations of internet-beaming satellites. In the past 16 days, SpaceX has launched more satellites to space than what the entire world launched in any year before 2013, according to data compiled by Jonathan McDowell, a Harvard astronomer and expert satellite tracker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ao9SnT"&gt;Rideshare missions on larger rockets appeal to a growing demand for affordable launch services from small satellite companies, ramping up competition with companies like Rocket Lab and Virgin Orbit with smaller rockets tailored for dedicated small satellite launches.&lt;/p&gt;
