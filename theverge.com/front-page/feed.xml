    <title>Russia launches movie actress and producer to space for cosmic film shoot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Russia launches film crew to space" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dytFFleR4nnkwd84ZpFdT-z8YgI=/0x0:3500x2333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69953185/1235707056.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jgHIp5"&gt;Early this morning, a trio of Russians launched to the International Space Station on a Soyuz spacecraft, but &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-tv-coverage-set-for-russian-film-production-launch"&gt;two of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;these fliers were no ordinary cosmonauts&lt;/a&gt;. Included in the crew was a Russian actress named Yulia Peresild and a film producer named Klim Shipenko, who have just docked at the station to film scenes for an upcoming movie. With their arrival, they’re the first multiperson film crew to visit the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccqagG"&gt;Peresild and Shipenko will stay on the station for just 12 days, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/05/science/russia-soyuz-challenge-mission.html"&gt;filming scenes for a movie called &lt;em&gt;The Challenge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The movie revolves around a Russian doctor, played by Peresild, who must travel to the space station to treat a sick cosmonaut. Producer Shipenko will be working on filming and lighting. The two flew to space along with Russian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov, who will be living on the station until spring, conducting research for Russia’s space corporation, Roscosmos. He’ll also be helping out with the production. Shkaplerov, along with Russian cosmonauts Oleg Novitskiy and Pyotr Dubrov — who are already living on the station — will play minor parts in the film’s production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="swoPTk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;they’re the first multiperson film crew to visit the ISS&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Wci4Qg"&gt;This Russian film crew may be just the beginning of actors heading to space over the next few years. On October 12th, William Shatner is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708534/blue-origin-william-shatner-new-shepard-crewed-flight-october"&gt;scheduled to fly to the edge of space and back on Blue Origin’s New Shepard rocket&lt;/a&gt;, though he won’t actually make it into orbit. (There have been reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21248460/nasa-tom-cruise-movie-international-space-station"&gt;Tom Cruise may head to the space station&lt;/a&gt; on a SpaceX Dragon someday to shoot scenes for a movie, but nothing has been confirmed.)&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IDKj6y"&gt;Today’s mission got underway at 4:55AM ET, with the liftoff of Russia’s Soyuz rocket from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The trio had a short trip&lt;strong&gt;,&lt;/strong&gt; traveling just two laps around the Earth before approaching the International Space Station. However, meeting up with the station didn’t exactly go as planned. While the Soyuz capsule is capable of docking with the ISS on its own, this particular approach was out of alignment, and Shkaplerov had to take over the controls of the vehicle manually. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/roscosmos/status/1445363900824883205"&gt;He successfully docked the capsule onto the station&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mdaGMP"&gt;Peresild and Shipenko will film primarily on the Russian component of the space station while they’re up there. Meanwhile, on the US side of the ISS, an international crew of astronauts have been living and working together for many months. They include NASA astronauts Mark Vande Hei, Shane Kimbrough, and Megan McArthur, as well as French astronaut Thomas Pesquet of the European Space Agency and Aki Hoshide of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency. Once they’ve wrapped, Peresild and Shipenko will head back to Earth in another Soyuz in mid-October with Novitskiy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Fysypl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BKOK0VzTix4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GnMU65"&gt;The ISS is no stranger to visits from space tourists, and films &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; been recorded in space before. In the 1980s, astronauts onboard the early Space Shuttle flights brought IMAX cameras with them to record footage, which was compiled into a documentary called &lt;em&gt;The Dream is Alive&lt;/em&gt;. And when video game developer Richard Garriott flew to the space station in 2008 as a paying space tourist, he filmed a short science fiction film called &lt;em&gt;Apogee of Fear. &lt;/em&gt;It was the first fictional movie completely shot in space, though it was less than eight minutes long. &lt;em&gt;The Challenge&lt;/em&gt; is set to be the first feature-length film to include scenes shot in space.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Nest’s latest security cameras are now on sale</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xUIT3MoRk5DPayL078ZisjLJaug=/0x423:5225x3906/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69953138/Nest_Cam_with_floodlight_US_Keyword_Blog.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Nest’s first floodlight security camera is available to buy today.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google Nest&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SzmOg0"&gt;Following its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22609444/google-nest-cam-indoor-floodlight-doorbell-price-specs-news"&gt;announcement of an all-new Nest Cam&lt;/a&gt; lineup this summer, Google has made the last of the four cameras it announced available in its &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/nest_cam_floodlight_wired?hl=en-US"&gt;Google Store&lt;/a&gt;: The Google Nest Cam wired ($99.99) and the Google Nest Cam with floodlight ($279.99). The cameras join the new Nest Cam battery, an indoor-outdoor camera, and the Nest Doorbell battery that went on sale in August. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vFwBAm"&gt;The Nest Cam wired is the budget camera in the lineup and is much smaller than the indoor/outdoor Nest Cam, which can be wired or work off its built-in battery. The indoor model dispenses with a built-in battery and isn’t weatherproofed, helping make it cheaper and smaller. It keeps the same 16:9 aspect ratio, with 1080p video at up to 30fps, plus it has a 135-degree field of view and 6x digital zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1EUyxR"&gt;One unique feature about the Nest Cam wired is that it comes in four colors — white, pink, beige, or green — a first in the smart home security camera space. There’s also a wooden base available for the pink (sorry, Sand) version of the camera for a further aesthetic flourish and a price hike to $119.99. Interestingly, Google is keeping the original black &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/nest_cam_specs?hl=en-US"&gt;indoor Nest Cam&lt;/a&gt; around for $129.99. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mq7UyA5umlBA7xVx1zbTALJp__k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902056/NestCam_wired__Colors_Snow_SandMaple_Linen_Fog_.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google Nest&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Cam wired comes in four color choices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NqgEEO"&gt;The Nest Cam with floodlight is essentially the indoor / outdoor Nest Cam attached to a 2400 lumen floodlight. It streams 1080p video with HDR, with a 1/2.8-inch, 2-megapixel sensor, 130-degree diagonal field of view, and a 6x digital zoom. It requires permanent power, and has to be wired into your home’s wiring through a standard outdoor junction box. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FyNsn9"&gt;The key feature here is that the floodlight cam uses on-device intelligence to detect people, animals, and vehicles rather than just relying on a motion sensor, as most floodlight cams do. This should mean you’re not constantly illuminating the garden when tree branches blow in the wind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YSAtbhJ_SNsrdCft5MG4TXCi_j0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902059/Nest_Cam_with_Floodlight_night_far_front_view.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google Nest&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Cam with floodlight is Google’s first hardware foray into any kind of smart lighting.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HqHa6i"&gt;All the new Nest cameras use built-in intelligence and on-device processing, which means less reliance on the cloud — so no fees for animal, vehicle, and person detection. You can also create Activity Zones for free and get three hours of event-based video without a subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yjXaL0"&gt;Local storage on the cameras will record up to an hour of footage (about a week’s worth of events) if the power or internet go out. For more than three hours of video clips, or to enable 24/7 recording on the Nest Cam wired and Nest Cam with floodlight, you need to pay for a Nest Aware subscription, starting at $6 a month. This also enables Nest’s Familiar Faces feature that will tell you which person it’s seen as opposed to just that it’s seen a person. The Nest Cams use the Google Home app, and do not work with the Nest app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k0HbHI"&gt;However, this isn’t the last we’ll see of new Nest Cams. Google recently announced that it’s planning to release a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700859/google-nest-doorbell-wired-2nd-gen-launching-2022"&gt;new Nest Cam Doorbell wired&lt;/a&gt; in 2022, presumably to replace the excellent but aging Nest Hello video doorbell. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O7nGNw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8lmyL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Surface Pro 8 review: the best of both worlds</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;This is the best Surface Pro we’ve seen in years&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="2BqO4k"&gt;I’ve been waiting for the Surface Pro 8. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ynwEE7"&gt;Microsoft has been selling Surface Pro models with basically the same design since at least 2015. In 2019, it somewhat rectified that by releasing two flagship models. There was the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923662/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-tablet-specs-features-price-usb-c-windows-10"&gt;Surface Pro 7&lt;/a&gt; — a powerful, practical machine with a four-year-old design — and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/5/20948092/microsoft-surface-pro-x-review-arm-windows-10-apps-features-specs-price"&gt;Surface Pro X&lt;/a&gt; — a modern-looking, thin device with a slow ARM chip that wasn’t compatible with all kinds of popular apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdyD7n"&gt;Neither of these devices was really what I’d consider an ideal machine — they both had serious drawbacks. “I wish this looked like the Surface Pro X,” lamented Tom Warren in his otherwise positive review of the Surface Pro 7. Across the internet, reviewers begged Microsoft to find a way to put the Pro 7’s chips in the Pro X’s chassis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QEh2xU"&gt;And now, two years later, that’s exactly what Microsoft did. The &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=VergeMicrosoftSurfaceProReview&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fstore%2Fconfigure%2FSurface-Pro-8%2F8QWCRTQ8V8XG%3Fcrosssellid%3Dfbt-f2c%26selectedColor%3D86888a" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,099.99-and-up&lt;/a&gt; Surface Pro 8 is the best of both worlds — it takes the best parts of the Pro 7 and the best parts of the Pro X, and puts them in one really excellent device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z3sb9r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10790079"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jqFlwA"&gt;The first thing you’ll notice about the Pro 8 is its screen. The device has a 2880 x 1920 13-inch touch display, which is almost an inch bigger than that of the Pro 7. The side bezels are visibly smaller than the Pro 7’s. The top one is still chunky — which makes sense, since you need something to hold if you’re using this as a tablet — but the keyboard deck covers the bottom one when the Pro 8 is in laptop mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2YGncf"&gt;The other new thing about this display is that it has a 120Hz refresh rate, which is unusual to see outside of the gaming sphere. The extra frames make a huge difference in day-to-day use — the cursor is nicer to look at as you drag it around the screen, there’s less lag when you’re writing with the stylus, and scrolling is just &lt;em&gt;so &lt;/em&gt;much smoother. It makes for a better Windows experience, regardless of the app you’re using. But I do wish this device supported &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555295/microsoft-windows-11-dynamic-refresh-rate-laptops"&gt;Dynamic Refresh Rate&lt;/a&gt;, which is supposed to be part of Windows 11 — that feature automatically swaps a device between 120Hz and 60Hz depending on the app you’re using, in order to save battery. Microsoft hasn’t told us if or when that’s coming yet, so for the moment you’re stuck ducking into Advanced Display Settings if you want to bump the refresh rate up or down. (I just left mine on 120Hz and took the battery life hit.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1sRZpV"&gt;What does get automatically adjusted is the color profile. With the Adaptive Color feature, the Pro 8 automatically adjusts the look of your screen based on the environment around you. This feature was subtle enough that I didn’t really notice it in action while I was working — but you do see the difference when you toggle it on and off, which you can do in brightness settings. It definitely made the screen easier on my eyes, especially at night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user types on the Surface Pro 8 from behind. The screen displays the Windows 11 start menu on a white and blue background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_9MTb__ktE4j_rA8nBQsKHSjCP0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900766/bfarsace_211004_4777_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The screen is finally laptop-sized.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user removes the Surface Slim Pen 2 from its slot in the Surface Pro 8’s keyboard cover." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VINlVXrJkMf0WKTB_ejS4GGX5rg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900774/bfarsace_211004_4777_0024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is where the stylus lived on the Surface Pro X, too.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The removeable SSD with the cover removed on the bottom of the Surface Pro 8." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Cjfbi-YxegohIpAWzyDt7Lcehc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900784/bfarsace_211004_4777_0050.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Just flip the thing over to pop out the SSD.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A user types on the Surface Pro 8 keyboard. The screen displays Microsoft Teams on a blue and white background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZjOF7SqzF_4sfhE9BT9HnnRhQNM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900768/bfarsace_211004_4777_0011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s not cramped at all, which I can rarely say about detachable keyboards.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ifJIp3"&gt;Elsewhere, the Pro 8 also has a 10-megapixel rear camera (which the Pro X had but not the Pro 7). This can capture 4K video (as well as 1080p) video. Like both of its predecessors, the Pro 8 also has a 5-megapixel front-facing camera, which can capture video in 1080p for Zoom calls and the like. I rarely get to say this about webcams, but the Pro 8 actually delivers a good picture. Colors were vibrant, and my lines were clear, even in less-than-ideal lighting. The camera also supports Windows Hello facial recognition, which is handy. The camera app occasionally got stuck when I was trying to switch from front to rear, forcing me to reboot the program, but that’s my only nitpick here. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WZwCZi"&gt;Speaking of Zoom calls, the Pro 8 makes a great tele-conferencing device. There are two far-field studio microphones, which never had trouble picking up my voice. And the audio also sounds good, with clear percussion and audible bass. That’s impressive considering how small the device is — it’s 1.96 pounds and just 0.37 inches thick, which is somewhat big for a tablet but quite portable as laptops go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Surface Pro 8 open, up close, with the keyboard pulled out and the stylus visible. The screen displays a blue swirl on a white background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/H6rtt3RL8l3yWXf6gCoSZAqSD4w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900773/bfarsace_211004_4777_0021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The keyboard is a bit of a pain to pull out, but I got the hang of it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qP90rY"&gt;The keyboard cover (which costs an &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=VergeMicrosoftSurfaceProReview&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fd%2Fsurface-pro-signature-keyboard%2F90FJ6ZKW1RZB%2FMGVH%3Ficid%3DSurface_Acc_Cat_R1CP1_ProSigKB_092221%26activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;extra $179&lt;/a&gt; — it’s not included in the prices you’ll see on Microsoft’s website) is now made of a carbon fiber core. It’s much sturdier than previous Surface Pro keyboards I’ve used in the past; it wasn’t wobbling or sliding around even when I was typing on my lap or a couch. You don’t get quite the travel that you’d expect from a full laptop, but most detachable keyboards are cramped and flat — this is definitely the best one I’ve ever used. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8omilF"&gt;The keyboard deck includes a handy garage for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22686095/microsoft-surface-slim-pen-2-haptics-features-price-release-date"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Slim Pen 2&lt;/a&gt; (also not included in the price). This stylus comes with a built-in haptic motor which is meant to make you feel like you’re actually writing on physical paper while you draw or take notes. While I did feel the extra vibrations while I wrote with the Slim Pen 2, I wouldn’t say the effect necessarily mimics writing on paper — there are styluses like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569871/lenovo-yoga-9i-14-inch-laptop-review"&gt;Lenovo’s Active Pen&lt;/a&gt; that do that better. But it’s a nice stylus overall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ob2E2v"&gt;The other thing to note is that only a small group of apps currently seem to support this haptic feedback. I’m glad this feature exists, but I look forward to seeing Microsoft expand it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="AD5ecg"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10790091"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mWyjcD"&gt;For all the physical similarities the Pro 8 shares with the Pro X, it couldn’t be more different on the inside. The base consumer-facing Pro 8 models have Intel Core i5 chips — mine has the Core i7-1185G7, which is one of the most powerful chips that Intel makes for thin and light laptops. It powers the top models of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21546784/dell-xps-13-late-2020-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13&lt;/a&gt; and the Lenovo Yoga 9i — it’s the real deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="elsJts"&gt;This test unit, which also has 16GB of RAM and Iris Xe integrated graphics, was &lt;em&gt;fast&lt;/em&gt;. It booted up quickly and ran whatever I needed it to. I was regularly running video calls on top of 15 or 16 Chrome tabs, a couple different apps, and even some streaming — loads that have given all kinds of premium ultraportable laptops trouble in my testing — without any slowdown or significant heat. That’s about the bare minimum for this processor, of course — it’s a chip meant for powerful portable devices, so it would be concerning if things were freezing left and right. But it’s a stark contrast to the Pro X, where many apps were slow, and others weren’t compatible with the ARM processor at all. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mptZzw"&gt;The Pro 8 also uses an active cooling system, which is a fancy way of saying it has a fan (as well as a vapor chamber, three heat pipes, and three graphite heat spreaders). This is likely why it’s a bit thicker and heavier than its predecessors. The fan did a decent job here — the chassis was sometimes toasty, but never uncomfortably hot, and I could run heavy loads for long periods of time without issue. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgyltW"&gt;Microsoft claimed that the Surface Pro 8 would get 16 hours of continuous battery life. I didn’t get that much to a charge, but I did average eight and a half hours of consistent use with my (fairly Chrome-intensive) workload at 60Hz, with Battery Saver on and the screen at medium brightness. Using the screen at 120Hz, I generally saw closer to seven hours from the same tasks (which is worse but still not a disastrous result). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cy5j35"&gt;Charging is also decently speedy. I got the device up to 60 percent in 50 minutes with light Chrome use (it’ll charge faster in standby). That was with the Surface Connect charger that ships with the device. You can also charge the Pro 8 over USB-C, but that won’t be quite as fast, and the two Thunderbolt ports are in a slightly more awkward position. It’s (understandably, given the thin chassis) a somewhat limited port selection, but you can connect external GPUs or up to two 4K displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Surface Pro 8 seen from above and to the right on a table with the Surface Slim Pen 2 next to it and Signature Keyboard attached. The screen displays a blue swirl on a white background." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TMK3kn2nsEQNARG80VS-TfaThok=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900779/bfarsace_211004_4777_0035.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Very similar dimensions to the Surface Pro X, but slightly thicker.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="abM6za"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10790097"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2CFdDH"&gt;In the past few years, I can’t tell you how many people I’ve talked to who weren’t sure whether to buy the Pro 7 or the Pro X. They needed the Pro 7’s processor for their workload, but they much preferred the way the Pro X looked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3jWKzJ"&gt;And it was hard for me to recommend either device to those people, or to the general public. They both came with serious compromises. But the Pro 8 doesn’t. It combines a modern design with modern specs. It’s the computer those people have been waiting for. It’s the first Surface Pro I can really see myself buying as a primary driver. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Surface Pro 8 on a table seen from the back to the right, open, with the Signature Keyboard attached and the kickstand out. In the background is a green wall and a potted plant." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zb11C5V1uWvyb-ewZpCI69-vmsk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900776/bfarsace_211004_4777_0026.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;That trusted Surface logo is on the back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="c7zGOv"&gt;Of course, the flip side of all this is that the Surface Pro isn’t cheap, even for what it offers. Models start at $1,099 — but that’s going to be $1,279 with the keyboard cover, and $1,379 with the Slim Pen 2. I also don’t expect too many people to buy that base model, which only has 128GB of storage and 8GB of RAM — my test model, which has a faster processor, twice the RAM, and 256GB storage, nets $1,879 with the keyboard and stylus, is going to be more reasonable for many workloads. You can get any number of regular clamshell laptops with its specs for a few hundred dollars less, including the MacBook Pro and the Dell XPS 13. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUPwJ1"&gt;That doesn’t make the Surface Pro 8 a bad device. It just makes it a somewhat specific device. It’s really targeting enthusiasts for the Surface Pro form factor — people who need the most performance in the thinnest and lightest chassis possible. In the past, those people haven’t quite had a device that met all of their needs. For the past two years, you’ve had to compromise on performance to get a Windows tablet that looked this cool. This year, you no longer have to sacrifice that performance. You just have to sacrifice some extra cash. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="hQtSrm"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/16/16152736/v-moda-crossfade-2-wireless-review-bluetooth-headphones"&gt;Our review of the V-Moda Crossfade 2 headphones&lt;/a&gt; described them as “the best at nothing, but great at most things.” Right now, you can &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfIEW2KCPNg#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;save $50 on this pair of versatile, premium headphones at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. The Crossfade 2 feature a noise-isolating design and solid sound quality paired with a classy, comfortable, and durable design. While they can last for up to 15 hours on a single charge, it is a little disappointing to see that these headphones can only be topped off via Micro USB instead of the more modern USB-C. However, anyone on the hunt for a pair of headphones that boast some curb appeal should look no further than the V-Moda Crossfade 2. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="YB9cwR"&gt;Apple’s second-generation AirPods with a wired charging case are just $109 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-with-Charging-Case-Latest-Model%2F604342441%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_xzpTrIW%253AoxyLRAEwUx0Mo36cUkB2MtVoExnTVM0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_482924%26clickid%3DxzpTrIW%253AoxyLRAEwUx0Mo36cUkB2MtVoExnTVM0%26sharedid%3Dverge%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;sharedid=VergeTrueWirelessHeadphones042921" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;, which is nearly the lowest price we’ve seen yet. These originally sold for $159. Unlike the first-gen model, these allow for hands-free “Hey Siri” voice inquiries. They can easily connect to Apple products like the Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad, and more. And they can switch between them automatically when you’re signed in with the same Apple ID on multiple devices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="jkUbS5"&gt;Asus’ ROG Flow X13, a 2-in-1 gaming laptop that can be connected to an external graphics card enclosure for better performance, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfIZ62wlYOb" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $1,350 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. It’s stellar by itself, though, with AMD’s fast and efficient Ryzen 9 5900 HS processor, Nvidia’s RTX 3050 Ti graphics chip, 16GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD. It’s rare to find a 16:10 aspect ratio display in a gaming laptop, but this is one of the few models that offers one. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22249408/asus-rog-flow-x13-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

This 27-inch curved 1440p panel features a 165Hz refresh rate and also comes equipped with AMD FreeSync. This makes the Acer Nitro a tough contender to beat at this price point. The monitor also features a pair of built-in 3W speakers and has connectivity for HDMI 2.0 or DisplayPort inputs. The minimalist stand does have height, swivel, and tilt adjustments, but it can also be mounted on a wall or monitor arm using any 100 x 100 VESA mount.&lt;/p&gt;

Originally $250, it’s $210 right now in black or white. This model requires hardwiring, and like the Video Doorbell Pro 2, it includes 3D Motion Detection with radar, along with the Bird’s Eye View feature that can show a top-down view of someone’s movements in front of the camera.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The whistleblower hearing hits Facebook where the company is weakest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SsyEkyHjKhuE4B3fPa6R7JjI-AY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69952994/acastro_180406_1777_facebook_Congress_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="BzPhZ8"&gt;Facebook’s newest whistleblower is set to testify before a Senate subcommittee on Tuesday, and her testimony will likely to kick off a damaging new cycle in the years-long effort to regulate the platform. This time, Facebook is dealing with an unusually damaging charge: that the most central parts of its business — its product optimization, its content promotion algorithms, and its drive for advertising profits — are actively &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;hurting its most vulnerable users&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="98RAOQ"&gt;It’s an alarming and specific claim, leveled from within the company and echoed by its most prominent critics. For lawmakers, it represents the best chance in years to take meaningful regulatory action against the world’s largest social network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06ye5K"&gt;On Sunday, Frances Haugen, a former product manager on Facebook’s civic integrity team, revealed herself as the source for documents detailing how the company’s products can inflict harm in a series of articles &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;from the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. One specific set of reports, suggesting that Facebook knew Instagram was “toxic” for teenage users, was addressed in a hearing last Thursday, where lawmakers made clear that Facebook’s growth depended on its ability to onboard younger users and incentivize them to spend more time on its platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="W5XS9Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We now know that Facebook routinely puts profits ahead of kids’ online safety”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bgyTwm"&gt;“We now know that Facebook routinely puts profits ahead of kids’ online safety,” Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) said on the reports last week. “We know it chooses the growth of its products over the well-being of our children.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RYhNWu"&gt;Tuesday’s hearing will focus on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704308/finsta-instagram-facebook-privacy-kids-safety-richard-blumenthal-blackburn"&gt;children’s safety specifically&lt;/a&gt;, with testimony from a witness with substantial knowledge into the real-world harms platforms like Instagram can inflict on young users. But the hearing’s more narrow focus could also empower lawmakers with the ability to drill into the reasons why Facebook makes the decisions it does when it comes to children’s safety, and even the safety of older users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PKZa1u"&gt;Primed by last week’s hearing, lawmakers will press hard on the conflict between Facebook’s profits and the safety of younger users. On Tuesday, Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;she plans to ask Haugen to describe in detail the ways in which Facebook profits off of the youngest people on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dUhq6s"&gt;“Are they considering the profits they make off of kids in how they market things?” Klobuchar said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QA6Lbf"&gt;It’s a topic Haugen will have plenty to say about. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;In her &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes &lt;/em&gt;interview Sunday&lt;/a&gt;, Haugen said that Facebook’s hunger for profit went far and beyond feeding children harmful content like that related to eating disorders. Facebook’s business relies on user engagement, and Haugen said that if the company made its algorithm “safer,” users would “click on less ads and make less money over time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="AnBS0R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Facebook, over and over again, chose to optimize for its own interests”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SQqM9s"&gt;“The thing I saw at Facebook, over and over again, was that there were conflicts of interest between what was good for the public and what was good for Facebook,” Haugen said in her &lt;em&gt;60 Minutes &lt;/em&gt;interview Sunday. “And Facebook, over and over again, chose to optimize for its own interests, like making more money.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jfxkly"&gt;It’s a powerful message — not just for the public, but for Facebook employees. As unique as Haugen seems, she’s part of a wave of employee activism across the tech industry. Facebook needs to show it takes her concerns seriously, not just to appease regulators but to quiet its own workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ySzsjh"&gt;“There’s been this new front that Facebook’s having to fight up against, which is its current and former employees are being more outspoken in a variety of different ways about what is happening at the company,” Katie Harbath, former director of public policy at Facebook and fellow at the Atlantic Council and Bipartisan Policy Center told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an interview Monday. “People are out there wanting the company to do better and they want to think through these integrity problems and solve them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="enCmmI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is an issue that we’re going to keep working on,” says Sen. Blackburn&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uWr9w8"&gt;This confluence of employee outrage, outside criticism, and an increasingly savvy Congress has created a uniquely dangerous playing field for Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCMDyJ"&gt;“It’s the focus on the business model at the crux of this, because that is what ties all of these scandals together,” Rishi Bharwani, director of partnership and policy at Accountable Tech told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an interview Monday. “It’s why Facebook is profiting off of and playing a determining role in the Rohingya genocide. It’s why Facebook is allowing the continued spread of COVID mis- and disinformation. It’s because they’re profiting off of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zgnOvF"&gt;Congress is already signaling its plans to continue investigating Haugen’s claims. Last week, Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), the top Republican on the committee inviting Haugen to testify, told &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/10/01/here-are-five-takeaways-facebooks-latest-senate-thumping/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that she hopes to hold more fact-finding hearings over the next few months. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LGa8kA"&gt;“This is an issue that we’re going to keep working on,” Blackburn told &lt;em&gt;The Post&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXZkbT"&gt;These hearings could lead to future child online safety legislation in the future. Both Democrats and Republicans have already started introducing new bills in light of the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;’&lt;em&gt;s &lt;/em&gt;recent reporting. Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA) already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/5/21166705/youtube-kids-act-markey-blumenthal-coppa-tiktok-ryans-toy-review"&gt;brought back his KIDS Act&lt;/a&gt; last week that would create new limits for developers designing apps for kids. Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO) has also released a bill that would create a new federal tort against social media companies that are proven to harm children.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="awsoxU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The hearing could also spur further investigation into Facebook itself&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="08F5P3"&gt;The hearing could also spur further investigation into Facebook itself — this time with more legal force to compel new documents and disclosures. Bharwani is hoping the full Senate Commerce Committee will launch a formal congressional probe into Facebook’s abuses, authorizing senators to subpoena Facebook for unreleased documents related to its algorithm and how it affects the health of its users. So far, every congressional investigation into Facebook has been led by smaller committees without the full authority to issue subpoenas, limiting findings to the documents Facebook was willing to produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hkSZNN"&gt;Sen. Maria Cantwell’s (D-WA) office did not respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; when asked if she would authorize a new committee-wide investigation into Facebook in light of the &lt;em&gt;Journal’s&lt;/em&gt; reporting. Cantwell chairs the committee and would need to sign off on an investigation with subpoena power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxmWBA"&gt;“What we’re starting to see is the manifestation of scandal after scandal from 2016 to Cambridge Analytica to the Rohingya genocide to profiting off of teens’ anxiety and depression,” Bharwani said. “These taken together have been raising the temperature on Facebook for a very long time. Now we’re starting to see the water boil.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GM envisions electric vehicles with 600 miles of range with new battery research center</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kOxxbIJIyn55NPMWyk6qqRUz6EY=/366x0:4299x2622/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69952803/01___SW_w_Building_Sign___2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3CZXK1"&gt;General Motors is building a new 300,000-square-foot battery research facility in Michigan to help it realize its mission of building electric vehicle batteries that are longer-lasting, quicker to charge, and more sustainable for the environment. Through this new center, GM is setting the stage for a battery breakthrough that will help it build electric vehicles that can travel as much as 600 miles on a single charge — roughly twice the range of most EVs on the road today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qzKEL6"&gt;The new facility will be named the Wallace Battery Innovation Center after Bill Wallace, a battery engineer at GM who died in 2018. The center will be located in Warren, Michigan, near the campus of the automaker’s 710-acre Technical Center in Southeast Michigan. GM wouldn’t disclose the number of engineers that will eventually fill the center’s labs, nor would it say much money it would cost to build, but expects it to be in the “hundreds of millions of dollars.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="j1YigR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“large format prototype cells, up to a meter wide or even wider”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Eno6pz"&gt;The innovation center will be “one of the only ones in North America that can use large format prototype cells, up to a meter wide or even wider than that, with uniform stacked electrodes,” said Ken Morris, vice president for electric and autonomous vehicles at GM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eiCeEa"&gt;The goal is to produce batteries with an energy density of “up to 1,200 watt-hours per liter,” Morris said — a staggering number that &lt;a href="https://themobilist.medium.com/gm-claims-its-on-the-verge-of-commercializing-the-most-exotic-battery-chemistry-of-all-a310254fd1e2"&gt;some experts have questioned&lt;/a&gt;. “And that means that you can easily have a 500- or a 600-mile vehicle on a single charge that’s possible, creating a new reality for our customers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mqfKWr"&gt;That would be beyond the range advertised for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/4/21164513/gm-ev-platform-architecture-battery-ultium-tesla"&gt;Ultium battery architecture&lt;/a&gt;, which the company has said would allow for driving ranges of “400 miles or more.” When they were first announced, GM said that it would design its Ultium batteries to be large-format, pouch-style cells, compared to cylindrical cells that are used by Tesla and others. This enables them to be stacked vertically or horizontally inside the battery pack, as the automaker sees fit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FfFkUg"&gt;“With these high-energy-density, low-cost vehicles, we really think we can have a better package that’s less mass, better for the vehicle, better for the customer, and it can be the reality as quickly as we can through the Wallace Innovation Center,” Morris added. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pPyAF61NhHAeMTJF9j6sZ9Vot1I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900939/07___Aerial_SW_w_Building_Sign___2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mJ1VGb"&gt;The first generation of Ultium batteries will make their debut in the Hummer EV pickup truck, which is scheduled to go into production next year. The Wallace Center is being set up to develop future versions that will be completely different from the current lithium-ion composition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iUBJNv"&gt;“The Wallace Center is going to be a colocation of development engineers, research engineers, and manufacturing engineers, where we’re going to accelerate this next generation,” Morris said. “Technology like lithium metal or pure silicon anodes, even solid-state batteries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mnMjCl"&gt;The innovation center is not a battery manufacturing facility — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313251/gm-ev-second-battery-factory-lg-chem-tennessee"&gt;GM is building two of those with partner LG Chem&lt;/a&gt; — but it will be set up for pilot assembly lines so the automaker can experiment with different production methods. Other projects will include intellectual property that’s being developed under &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325241/gm-electric-vehicle-battery-range-cost-solid-energy"&gt;a joint venture between GM and SolidEnergy Systems&lt;/a&gt;, a spinoff of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology that is focused on improving the energy density in lithium-ion batteries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sSmL5q"&gt;GM grew to be the largest automaker in North America on the back of combustion engines. Now, it needs to ramp up production of electric vehicles in order to become a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254116/general-motors-carbon-neutral-vow-2040-tailpipe-emissions-ev"&gt;carbon neutral company by the year 2040&lt;/a&gt; and meet its goal to halt sales of light-duty diesel and gasoline vehicles by 2035. Having a ready supply of batteries is, therefore, a fundamental concern for GM’s future. The company had already vowed to spend $27 billion on the development and production of 30 new electric vehicles by 2025 and even redesigned its logo to look more like an electrical plug.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>OnePlus 9s get new look and features in OxygenOS 12 </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The OnePlus 9 has a slightly smaller screen" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Igjpap2aW3dgzQiRZWP61guC9E=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69949662/bfarsace_4481_20210317_0077_Edit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PZspA1"&gt;Now that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538105/oneplus-oppo-merge-integration-ownership-bbk"&gt;OnePlus is a sub-brand of the Oppo family&lt;/a&gt;, the two companies not only merged their R&amp;amp;D departments in early 2021, but they are also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/2/22560765/oneplus-oxygenos-coloros-oppo-android-updates"&gt;consolidating code for their two Android-based operating systems&lt;/a&gt;. While OxygenOS 12 will be used on global OnePlus phones, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344054/oneplus-9-oppo-coloros-in-china-hydrogenos"&gt;ColorOS 12 will only be on China-only&lt;/a&gt; Oppo and OnePlus phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2pODX"&gt;Alongside the release of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708992/android-12-aosp-available-download-install"&gt;Android 12 to AOSP today&lt;/a&gt;, OnePlus is releasing the first open beta of OxygenOS 12 to the OnePlus 9 and OnePlus 9 Pro now, while those with older models will have to wait for a later update. Once this version is deemed stable, it is likely a full version will be released within a month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;according to XDA Developers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="p4SNh5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Android 12 review: it’s mostly about the looks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 Pro review: a refined, niche flagship","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22344840/oneplus-9-pro-review-price-camera-screen-specs"},{"title":"OnePlus 9 review: semi Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="479hSr"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Look&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i3mUnD"&gt;The new and improved OxygenOS 12 is colorful and minimalist like “&lt;a href="https://jamesturrell.com/"&gt;James Turrell’s&lt;/a&gt; Light and Space artwork,” as explained &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oxygenos-12-open-beta-1-for-oneplus-9-series.1502946/"&gt;in its forum post&lt;/a&gt; announcing this release. OxygenOS 12 shares some of the same design languages as ColorOS 12 and Android 12 by extension. All three OSes make liberal use of white space, as well as large sans-serif typography to “enhance readability and ease of use.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PoGgdw"&gt;OxygenOS 12 also follows the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22439777/android-12-design-features-widgets-first-look-google"&gt;Material You aesthetic&lt;/a&gt;, where the new icons use simple lines, and new widgets use shapes to make information and actions more clear and accessible to a diverse group of users. Just like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22679087/oppo-oneplus-coloros-12-update-announced-release-date"&gt;ColorOS 12&lt;/a&gt;, the OnePlus software is enhanced with more shadows and subtle gradients to give OxygenOS 12 a more premium look. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QM3BN5-sJCAvznQ-UQDo0IcSwac=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900111/darkmodes_3up.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;OnePlus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;OxygenOS 12 offers three levels of Dark Mode to give you more control over your phone’s UI.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="orGxgt"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Features&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hviAhT"&gt;In addition to its new look, OxgyenOS 12 also learned some new tricks to improve your experience with OnePlus phones. If you’ve been playing with the developer preview of Android 12 on the OnePlus 9 series, you’ll be happy to know these features have made it into the open beta of OxygenOS 12:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="t5RKxn"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Private Safe&lt;/strong&gt;: This feature isolates sensitive files to a secured part of your phone, where you can safely store and protect specific photos, videos, audios, and documents.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="yprYw6"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Updated OnePlus Shelf &amp;amp; OnePlus Scout&lt;/strong&gt;: The handy Shelf has been enhanced with even more widgets: from notes, step counting, weather, to the calculator, according to &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/android-12-dp-2-oneplus-9-pro-oxygenos/"&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/a&gt;. You can even search for anything on your phone using OnePlus Scout, which is now part of the Shelf.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="WDehnM"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Zen Mode &amp;amp; World Life Balance 2.0:&lt;/strong&gt; First popularized by OnePlus’ Indian users, both modes help you manage work-life balance by separating your personal and work accounts. You can set up different profiles with different Wi-Fi networks, with different app notifications and messages depending on the time of day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1EPmDl"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Dark Mode:&lt;/strong&gt; This lets you choose between three levels of dark mode.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="t6WlFY"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Note app: &lt;/strong&gt;This updated app now lets you doodle as well as type out your thoughts.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9dG93J"&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Canvas AOD 2.0: &lt;/strong&gt;The app lets that you create a wireframe image on your lockscreen, based on your wallpaper, is back with more functionality. It now includes more brushes and lines for you to use, as well as more photos and effects available to support your artistic vision.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="dY7zR8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10789206"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4nDAAI"&gt;It’s possible that this is the end of the road for OxygenOS, as the two companies could more fully integrate their software into one, rather than maintain two OSes. If that’s the case, OnePlus will hopefully be able to bring some of its most popular features like the Canvas AOD 2.0 and Work Life Balance 2.0 mode to future ColorOS updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxTi9w"&gt;If you have a OnePlus 9 or 9 Pro and want to try out this open beta of OxygenOS 12, then head to &lt;a href="https://forums.oneplus.com/threads/oxygenos-12-open-beta-1-for-the-oneplus-9-and-oneplus-9-pro.1502946/"&gt;OnePlus’ community forum page&lt;/a&gt; to download it onto your computer, and follow the instructions to install the software onto your OnePlus phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TxpzMs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 7:30AM, October 5th, 2021:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Updated download link to new location for the update.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s Ryzen 5000-equipped MateBook 16 is getting a global release</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/78dM6rTuThHbhhRdaK0kygHwH_c=/0x0:723x482/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69952687/huawei_matebook_16_kv.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0vx91c"&gt;Huawei’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fconsumer.huawei.com%2Fen%2Flaptops%2Fmatebook-16%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22702083%2Fhuawei-matebook-16-ryzen-5000-laptop-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;MateBook 16&lt;/a&gt;, a laptop that combines a large 16-inch display with a 3:2 aspect ratio and a Ryzen 5000 series processor, is getting a global launch. The laptop was first announced for the &lt;a href="https://www.gizmochina.com/2021/05/20/huawei-matebook-16-with-32-display-amd-ryzen-7-5800h-and-84wh-battery-launched/"&gt;Chinese market in May&lt;/a&gt; but will shortly be launching globally with prices starting at the equivalent of €1,099 (around $1,274) for the Ryzen 5 model, and €1,199 (around $1,390) for the Ryzen 7 version. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o995vR"&gt;Huawei calls the MateBook 16 its “first high-performance notebook” thanks to it being configurable with AMD’s latest Ryzen 5000 series laptop processors. There’s a choice of either a Ryzen 5800H or a 5600H, paired with 16GB of RAM and 512GB of NVMe storage. Connectivity specs include Bluetooth 5.1 and Wi-Fi 6 support.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vkA5kS_52XGPIpIld3Z_2ULXdP8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22890054/huawei_matebook_16_overview_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Huawei&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MateBook 16’s 16-inch 2520 x 1680 display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RLGjDC"&gt;The MateBook 16’s display is a 16-inch IPS panel with a 2520 x 1680 resolution, which works out to a 3:2 aspect ratio (our preference for productivity laptops). Around the screen you’ll find a typically thin Huawei laptop bezel, helped by the fact that its 720p webcam is hidden inside the keyboard. If Huawei’s previous laptops are anything to go by, that’s likely to be great for keeping the screen bezels small but could make for a terrible nostril-focused angle for video calls. There’s also a fingerprint sensor built into the power button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="byHFwZ"&gt;Ports include two USB-A sockets, two USB-C, a full-size HDMI port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. Charging the laptop’s 84Wh battery is handled via an included 135W USB-C power adaptor. Other features include dual mics and dual front-firing 2W speakers, as well as Huawei Share support that lets you do things like mirror a Huawei phone’s screen and control it via the laptop, or use a paired tablet as a drawing surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bm54cl"&gt;Huawei did not provide release dates or markets prior to publication, but confirmed that the laptop will initially be available in “select markets in Western Europe.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZU09vW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KRpXAI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch HBO’s teaser trailer for Game of Thrones spin-off House of the Dragon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SPpnoEUivKzqpX8etlnVxTXg2O8=/216x0:2673x1638/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69952561/Screenshot_2021_10_05_at_18.55.58.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y9t7Zc"&gt;HBO has released a teaser trailer containing the first real footage of &lt;em&gt;House of the Dragon&lt;/em&gt;, its upcoming &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; prequel series. The show was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20939230/game-of-thrones-spinofff-series-house-of-the-dragons-ordered-hbo-max"&gt;announced two years ago&lt;/a&gt; and is based on George R. R. Martin’s &lt;em&gt;Fire and Blood&lt;/em&gt;, a book that centers around the history of the Targaryen family and is set two centuries before the events of the &lt;em&gt;A Song of Ice and Fire&lt;/em&gt; novels, which &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; was based on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="syjMA1"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;House of the Dragon&lt;/em&gt; trailer doesn’t reveal much about the show’s plot beats, but does demonstrate its impressive cast: actors including Paddy Considine, Matt Smith, Sonoya Mizuno, Steve Toussaint, Rhys Ifans, and Olivia Cooke are all on board. As you’d expect, there appears to be a lot of sword fighting and references to dragons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6k6LQk"&gt;The question, of course, is how many &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt; fans will return for &lt;em&gt;House of the Dragon&lt;/em&gt; considering how the former show’s final season proved to be, shall we say, divisive — not least because of the writing of a certain character with the surname “Targaryen.” HBO hasn’t given a specific release date other than to say that &lt;em&gt;House of the Dragon&lt;/em&gt; will air in 2022, and it will of course be on the HBO Max streaming service. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat launches Run for Office portal to encourage users toward political campaigns</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C01TwWhKN2v5M_a4oLyhv-jycR8=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69952508/RFO_Partner_Assets__1_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Snapchat has introduced tools to help users run for office | Snap&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gd3NVR"&gt;Snapchat is launching a new tool aimed at guiding its young user base to consider running for political office. The company says it wants to help potential future candidates deal with common barriers to launching political campaigns by providing information, resources, and encouragement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6U6tOA"&gt;The Run for Office Mini — a set of miniature applications that run within Snapchat — will let Snapchat users explore issues they care about and find information about political offices in their ZIP code. They’ll be able to connect to candidate recruitment organizations, including &lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://runforsomething.net/__;!!FCkwbCh4Gg!M0WpuFE5mSY0ffQRNhyfUA7UaW6C-cLyVJup7tVUzx8wd15dQ1wyTOVC6ee8i21k6A%24"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Run for Something&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://www.newpolitics.org/__;!!FCkwbCh4Gg!M0WpuFE5mSY0ffQRNhyfUA7UaW6C-cLyVJup7tVUzx8wd15dQ1wyTOVC6ecR_BzCmQ%24"&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Politics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.rungenz.com/__;!!FCkwbCh4Gg!M0WpuFE5mSY0ffQRNhyfUA7UaW6C-cLyVJup7tVUzx8wd15dQ1wyTOVC6efzEFLVzg%24"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Run GenZ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, and the &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://victoryinstitute.org/__;!!FCkwbCh4Gg!M0WpuFE5mSY0ffQRNhyfUA7UaW6C-cLyVJup7tVUzx8wd15dQ1wyTOVC6ecLT22vIg%24"&gt;&lt;em&gt;LGBTQ Victory Institute&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which can provide training and resources to prepare for a campaign. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8mhOc"&gt;The tool has a portal based on BallotReady’s API that lets Snapchat users find issues important to them and includes information about 75,000 upcoming elections on the federal, state, and local levels. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/47wBQTe-7DU_QFxLcamY7Wa9VRU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900867/Issues_Screen_2.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Snap&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of the issues a potential candidate might choose from &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nFChow"&gt;Once the user picks the issues they’re most interested in, the app will surface potential roles that might be a fit. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JiSE6tKeYjDO1yWMdw0RqBTBTkk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900859/School_Board_Position.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Snap&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of a potential role for a Snapchat user thinking about running for office&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="o2KgyI"&gt;The tool also includes a campaign dashboard to show Snap users what steps they need to take to get on a ballot, including any filing deadlines or signature requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oz8HexK1_UkiF3ypNfliGifgh_c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900872/My_Campaign.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Snap&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="mMMTH9"&gt;And, they’ll be able to share stickers from the portal to “campaign” within the app and share their candidacy with friends in Snapchat.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UGbPGIi-iNFZVcD9AruqCso2seM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22900890/Sticker_Example_3.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Snap&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jBbCK4"&gt;Users will also be able to “nominate” friends who they see as future leaders and encourage them to run. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QKdpZg"&gt;This isn’t Snapchat’s first foray into get-out-the-vote efforts; in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/25/17899984/snapchat-voter-registration-2018-midterm-elections-turbovote"&gt;2018, it added voter registration&lt;/a&gt; within its app, and in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/6/21357023/snapchat-voter-tools-election-app-registration"&gt;2020, the company introduced more in-app features&lt;/a&gt;, including a voter guide and voting checklist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KuDSS7"&gt;The company said it helped more than 1.2 million of its users register to vote in 2020, and half of those were first-time voters. It estimates that the in-app voter education tools were used by more than 30 million Snapchat users. The company claims to reach 90 percent of 13- to 24-year-olds in the US, and much of that demographic either has yet to vote or was eligible to vote for the first time in the 2020 election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PijM8b"&gt;The Run for Office Tool builds on the work Snap has already done, partnering with the Center for Information &amp;amp; Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) at Tufts University’s Tisch College. According to &lt;a href="https://circle.tufts.edu/latest-research/poll-young-people-believe-they-can-lead-change-unprecedented-election-cycle"&gt;CIRCLE’s research&lt;/a&gt;, this younger, diverse generation wants to lead political change.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j397Vc"&gt;“We hope launching the ‘Run for Office’ mini changes the idea of who can be in office — that no matter who you are, where you come from, that you can make a difference in your local community by running for office based on the issues they care most about,” said Sofia Gross, Snap’s head of policy partnerships and social impact. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dV8Uq0"&gt;She added that the company believes it has an important and long-term role to play in encouraging the next generation of leaders to run for office. “We want to help shape a more reflective and equitable democracy for all Americans, and that includes the Snapchat Generation — we can’t wait to see all they will do.”&lt;/p&gt;
