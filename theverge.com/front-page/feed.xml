    <title>Star Trek creator’s signature will live long and prosper in new NFT </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="“Star Trek: The Motion Picture” Portrait" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Srp4vP8gRt8EAZFeB1DhDWuozeI=/0x87:4350x2987/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70211246/78305993.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;DECEMBER 7: Actors Leonard Nimoy, DeForest Kelley and William Shatner pose for a portrait with writer Gene Roddenberry and director Robert Wise during the filming of the movie “Star Trek: The Motion Picture” which was released December 27, 1979 in the United States. | Photo by Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MllUnp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; creator Gene Roddenberry’s signature on the show’s first contract with Lucille Ball’s Desilu Productions is now an NFT. Roddenberry Entertainment is calling it the first “Living Eco-NFT,” which seems straight out of science fiction itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bPikcb"&gt;The NFT’s creators implanted the signature, signed in 1965, into a living bacteria cell in the form of DNA code. As the cell duplicates, it creates new copies of the NFT — over a billion in one night. Even though there will quickly be billions of replicas, the NFT is called “El Primero,” which means ‘the first’ in Spanish. It will be exhibited at the Art Basel Miami Beach art fair that kicks off on December 2nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zamMlW"&gt;DNA is nature’s way of storing data. But instead of encoding that data as zeros and ones as computers do, the basic building blocks for DNA are the nucleotides adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine — A, T, C, and G for short. Different combinations of those nucleotides are essentially genetic instructions for characteristics like hair and eye color. That code can also be used to store digital information — like say, an NFT. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="ygLCGm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6Ln769"&gt;There are significant climate controversies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22328203/nft-cryptoart-ethereum-blockchain-climate-change"&gt;swirling around NFTs&lt;/a&gt; and digital data more broadly. Data centers, where digital data is stored on hard disk drives, are notorious for guzzling up water and burning through electricity to keep servers cool. And NFTs tied to blockchains like Ethereum operate on an outstandingly energy inefficient security mechanism called “Proof of Work.” This method prompts miners to solve complex puzzles using energy-hungry machines to verify transactions and earn tokens, protecting the blockchain’s record of transactions by making it too expensive to mess with the ledger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlhA6p"&gt;El Primero manages to avoid some of the climate drama of traditional data storage and NFTs. For starters, early &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fresearch%2Fpublication%2Farchitecting-datacenters-for-sustainability-greener-data-storage-using-synthetic-dna%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; has shown that synthetic DNA can potentially save energy and avoid greenhouse gas emissions compared with current commercial data storage by&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;storing way more data in a much smaller, denser package. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xuGq14"&gt;Second, the NFT — as far as we know — won’t be bought and sold on energy-hungry blockchains. Roddenberry Entertainment partnered with Solana Labs, whose blockchain operates on a mechanism called “&lt;a href="https://solana.com/staking#proofofstake"&gt;Proof of Stake&lt;/a&gt;” that uses significantly less energy in comparison to the blockchain Ethereum of which most other NFTS are part. Proof of Stake nixes puzzles, instead requiring users to lock up some of their existing tokens as a security measure to “prove” they have a “stake” in keeping the ledger accurate. Getting rid of those puzzles drastically cuts energy usage and associated emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kp6N5W"&gt;Trevor Roth, COO of Roddenberry Entertainment, said in a statement that like &lt;em&gt;Star Trek &lt;/em&gt;itself, the new NFT “speaks to the world around us, acknowledging today’s constant convergence of life and technology.” For a franchise that’s &lt;a href="https://today.duke.edu/2018/09/what-star-trek-can-teach-us-about-genetics-and-evolution"&gt;been imagining&lt;/a&gt; bizarre new uses of genetic engineering technology for more than thirty years, it feels appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cyber Monday spending was reportedly down due to early shopping</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon stock image" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GznNNnH9ywWzniE9Y1mtbsRyn5A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70211063/amazon-stock-0839.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m5rYXJ"&gt;Cyber Monday sales were down 1.4 percent year over year, according to a report from &lt;a href="https://business.adobe.com/resources/holiday-shopping-report.html"&gt;Adobe Analytics&lt;/a&gt;. Shoppers spent $10.7 billion this year, $100 million less than the $10.8 billion consumers spent in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SEPQvs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Consumers were not waiting around for discounts on big shopping days like Cyber Monday and Black Friday”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gQlv4u"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/customers-drove-record-breaking-black-friday-through-cyber-monday-sales-on-amazon"&gt;Amazon’s holiday shopping report&lt;/a&gt; only backs Adobe’s claims that Cyber Monday sales took a dip — the commerce giant didn’t report that this year’s Cyber Monday was the “biggest” day of shopping as it has done in the past. &lt;a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-customers-shop-record-levels-again-holiday-season-cyber"&gt;In 2019&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon said that Cyber Monday was the platform’s “single biggest shopping day in the company’s history,” while &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/retail/supporting-small-saving-big-and-shopping-early"&gt;in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, Thanksgiving weekend was described as the “largest holiday shopping season” in Amazon history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3udKf"&gt;This time around, there was no mention of Amazon having the best shopping day or season in its history. Instead, Amazon boasted about having the biggest “kickoff to the holiday shopping season,” as well as a “record-breaking” Black Friday and Cyber Monday — but it didn’t specify which record it broke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P2DMJz"&gt;This follows the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/28/22806233/black-friday-online-spending-decreased-first-time"&gt;first decrease in spending on Black Friday&lt;/a&gt;, which Adobe attributes to shoppers taking advantage of sales and promotions earlier in the holiday season. It looks like the same early shopping trend also contributed to a dip in sales on Cyber Monday, as Adobe notes that people are getting their shopping done in October and November and are also nabbing in-demand products when they see them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4xFXvv"&gt;“With early deals in October, consumers were not waiting around for discounts on big shopping days like Cyber Monday and Black Friday,” said Taylor Schreiner, the director at Adobe Digital Insights. “This was further fueled by growing awareness of supply chain challenges and product availability. It spread out e-commerce spending across the months of October and November, putting us on track for a season that still will break online shopping records.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uf5btD"&gt;From November 1st to the 29th, Adobe reports that shoppers have spent a total of $109.8 billion, an 11.9 percent increase from last year. So far, there have been 22 days where shoppers have spent over $3 billion, while it tracked only nine around this time in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tMLnyZ"&gt;Adobe says that AirPods, Apple Watches, Apple Pencils, the Nintendo Switch, Xbox Series S, Meta (formerly Oculus) Quest 2, as well as laptops from HP, Lenovo, and Dell, were some of the top sellers in tech during Cyber Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Cyber Monday deals you can still get</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ze7vtmSs7kciZb6paCcl1Yo2a4w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70209008/Cyber_Monday_Deals_You_Can_Still_Get.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="agg4w7"&gt;If you missed out on a few great deals during Cyber Monday or Black Friday, don’t worry, you still have another chance to save big on some popular tech products. It’s “Cyber Week,” meaning that many retailers are still delivering some of the best deals of the year for you to grab all week long. Below, we’ve curated some of the top discounts you can still take advantage of on wireless noise-canceling headphones, earbuds, phones, laptops, TVs, video games, and more. Take a look, and if you like what you see,  you may want to buy the product sooner than later. These particular deals could disappear at a moment’s notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGdVSU"&gt;If they do sell out, fret not. It’s very likely that December will bring some repeat deals, plus new sales because of the holidays. If you want to keep receiving the latest deal-related updates then even after this week is over so you can continue to save, subscribe to our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/newsletters"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Verge Deals&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt;.

The Hero10 Black boasts all the amazing features found on its predecessor — which we once called the “biggest, baddest action camera out there” — and more, like a new processor that allows it to shoot in higher frame rates and upload videos to the cloud while charging. It’s also compatible with Hero9 accessories, meaning those looking to upgrade won’t necessarily need to purchase new add-ons. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22675560/gopro-hero10-action-camera-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

The mic comes packaged with its own stand but is also compatible with a wide variety of booms and mic arms if that’s more your style.

These rest near your temples, using bone conduction to transmit sound instead of covering your ears. This is a popular choice among bikers, as it’s a safer alternative to earbuds if you want to listen to music or podcasts, or to talk on the phone. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Dieter Bohn &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22330833/open-ear-headphones-review-best-bike-riding" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ranked these as his favorite model&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;li id="RjgSDL"&gt;Best Buy has a great deal on Hyperice’s Hypervolt Plus percussion massager with Bluetooth connectivity. It was available just a few months ago at a sale price of $329, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cf6OVlwOUjx" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but its deal offers it for just $245&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

    <title>The leader of Facebook’s stalled cryptocurrency project is leaving the company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YonDYUvPbrczzZXLjPCt1Gn0JIg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70210622/VRG_ILLO_3512_001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="srWKj5"&gt;Facebook cryptocurrency chief David Marcus announced today that he’s leaving the company. The former PayPal executive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/9/5794548/david-marcus-leaves-paypal-to-lead-facebook-messaging"&gt;joined Facebook in 2014 to run Messenge&lt;/a&gt;r but eventually took over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/18/18682290/facebook-libra-cryptocurrency-visa-mastercard-digital-currency-calibra-wallet-announce"&gt;plans to launch a new cryptocurrency and wallet&lt;/a&gt;, known at the time as Libra and Calibra, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="wDnHMv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Novi VP of product Stephane Kasriel will take over&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="37oVzI"&gt;After some pre-Meta &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/26/21270437/facebook-calibra-novi-rename-digital-wallet"&gt;name changes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22734487/facebook-novi-digital-wallet-pilot-program-payments-diem-cryptocurrency"&gt;the digital wallet launched with a small pilot in October under the name Novi&lt;/a&gt; but only in two countries (the US and Guatemala) and support for a single form of crypto, the Paxos stablecoin. The currency that spurred so much ire from regulators and politicians around the world, now called Diem, has yet to appear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SETRW1"&gt;In posts &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/davidm/posts/10166264804120195"&gt;on his Facebook page&lt;/a&gt; and Twitter, Marcus says, “While there’s still so much to do right on the heels of hitting an important milestone with Novi launching — and I remain as passionate as ever about the need for change in our payments and financial systems — my entrepreneurial DNA has been nudging me for too many mornings in a row to continue ignoring it.” He announced that Novi VP of product Stephane Kasriel, previously an early PayPal employee and the CEO of Upwork, will take over the leadership of the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;While there’s still so much to do right on the heels of launching Novi — and I remain as passionate as ever about the need for change in our payments and financial systems — my entrepreneurial DNA has been nudging me for too many mornings in a row to continue ignoring it.

&lt;p id="2YIsAw"&gt;As recently as October, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735171/facebook-novi-diem-libra-calibra-cryptocurrency-digital-wallet-zuckerberg-senate"&gt;politicians were openly calling&lt;/a&gt; for Facebook to drop its cryptocurrency plans. At that time, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/davidmarcus/status/1450447443250728962"&gt;Marcus said&lt;/a&gt;, “I do want to be clear that our support for Diem hasn’t changed and we intend to launch Novi with Diem once it receives regulatory approval and goes live. We care about interoperability and we want to do it right.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4T75Zw"&gt;What his departure means for the project overall is unclear, as well as how it fits in with Zuckerberg’s metaverse vision for the future. His departure also comes one day after fellow cryptocurrency proponent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22808979/twitter-jack-dorsey-steps-back-platformer"&gt;Jack Dorsey stepped down from his position as the CEO of Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>This browser extension shows how many brands on Amazon are actually just Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vh5PpgA_XSN5jvuccGV-mEsk5qE=/132x0:1551x946/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70210554/amazon_brand_detector_3200x1800_1_1682x946.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vZtTJO"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/11/29/introducing-amazon-brand-detector"&gt;new browser extension&lt;/a&gt; promises to show you which products in your Amazon search results are sold by brands that are either owned by or are exclusive to Amazon, giving you a better idea of who’s selling what you’re buying. It’s called Amazon Brand Detector, and it uses a list of Amazon brands created by &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt;, along with filters and other techniques (&lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/how-we-analyzed-amazons-treatment-of-its-brands-in-search-results#identifying-amazons-brands-and-exclusives"&gt;detailed here&lt;/a&gt;) to detect and highlight products that are a part of Amazon’s Our Brands program. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y1N2Pq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup &lt;/em&gt;created this extension after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22727842/amazon-in-house-brands-search-rankings"&gt;its investigation&lt;/a&gt; into how Amazon ranks its in-house brands in search results and says the tool (available for &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/amazon-brand-detector/hjkifponoamdhhgdfodkbaabajhdgbob"&gt;Chrome-like browsers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/amazon-brands/"&gt;Firefox&lt;/a&gt;) is designed to make searches more transparent. When we tested it, it obviously highlighted Amazon Basics and Essentials products, but it also drew attention to results that were otherwise indistinguishable from ones not affiliated with Amazon: a dog leash labeled as being made by Panykoo, socks by Teebulen, a sweater by Ofeefan. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8P9XUMfaDwzA-kYrKjw2pY_4jXk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23051477/Screen_Shot_2021_11_29_at_17.00.46.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of the products highlighted are obviously affiliated with Amazon, some less so.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M0Pi3x597KvZPS-HgxBiysyJdLQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23051456/Screen_Shot_2021_11_29_at_15.05.13.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Markup&lt;em&gt; says the tool may miss some Amazon-sold products, and I found that to be true.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1UjEpS"&gt;While Amazon marked some of those results as “featured from our brands,” that wasn’t the case for all of them. That advisory text is also small and grey, making it easy to miss if you’re casually browsing (especially since there may not be any notice of the affiliation on the actual product page), and it didn’t show up on every result the tool highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eYGmHShLkrDm2I2xQk4z4kSqN94=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23051406/Screen_Shot_2021_11_29_at_16.14.54.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Without the tool’s highlighting, it would be easy to miss the “featured from our brands” message on these socks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5fx8g9"&gt;Amazon isn’t necessarily shadowy about these brands: it &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;node=17728530011"&gt;has a page that lists&lt;/a&gt; its “private and select exclusive brands,” many of which have legit-sounding names: Happy Belly, Wag, Nature’s Wonder. Some are private labels owned by Amazon, where &lt;a href="https://sell.amazon.com/programs/our-brands"&gt;some are “curated selections”&lt;/a&gt; sold exclusively on Amazon but not necessarily operated by the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJXSLV"&gt;Clicking through to the store pages, there’s a spectrum of Amazon branding. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/59E20785-D133-47A4-B2C8-2FF309221217"&gt;Basic Care&lt;/a&gt; has a large Amazon logo right at the top, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stoneandbeam"&gt;Stone and Beam&lt;/a&gt; notes that its products are “exclusively on Amazon,” and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/rivet"&gt;Rivet’s&lt;/a&gt; product names are prefixed with “Amazon Brand.” Meanwhile, Amazon’s branding doesn’t appear on &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/E55B6B6E-F82E-4622-B1A0-9186F2853B45"&gt;the Goodthreads page&lt;/a&gt; unless you watch to the end of a video titled “Fall 2021.” Most Goodthreads products will have the phrase “An Amazon Brand” somewhere on the page, but it’s not always prominent. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UCAsI-QHd1nhc2EAalDoRMD9S8U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23051488/Screen_Shot_2021_11_29_at_17.06.40.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon has a page that lists some, but not all, of its brands, with links to their store pages.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JW3YSM"&gt;The page also doesn’t contain all of Amazon’s brands — there are letter-soup brand names highlighted by Amazon Brand Detector like Weeso and other brands like Daily Ritual, which showed up often in search results. Despite “An Amazon brand” being listed as a feature of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Ritual-Womens-Mock-Neck-Sweater/dp/B07DKF5P5D?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Daily Ritual sweater&lt;/a&gt; that showed up in my search results, that brand isn’t on Amazon’s “Our Brands” page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rL2M8O"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/amazons-new-competitive-advantage-putting-its-own-products-first"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, traditional grocery stores have long had their own private-label brands, though stores like Kroger and even Walmart are operating on a somewhat smaller scale — items are more hidden on the third page of search results than they are on the bottom level of a shelf. And, as an advisor to third-party Amazon sellers told &lt;em&gt;ProPublica&lt;/em&gt;, Amazon’s brands take up space in the coveted first page of search results that could go to other brands (some of which may have more positive reviews or higher sales numbers). Amazon denied favoring its brands in search results, though &lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://themarkup.org/amazons-advantage/2021/10/14/amazon-puts-its-own-brands-first-above-better-rated-products"&gt;has an in-depth investigation&lt;/a&gt; into how the company weights its results.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mtv4M62OxcdEoVMVgxeLhepBoeQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23051499/Screen_Shot_2021_11_29_at_17.12.28.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Knowing which products are sold by Amazon may or many not affect your buying decision, but it’s still interesting to see the results.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SXJ1kY"&gt;For some customers, it may not matter who’s selling the products, as long as they’re decent. But if you’re the kind of person who likes to know where the things you buy are coming from (or who doesn’t want to give Amazon more money than necessary), it could be worth installing the Amazon Brand Detector extension. At the very least, the results may end up being interesting — there were a few times during testing when I went, “Huh... I wouldn’t have guessed that was from Amazon.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EjYQrr"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Markup&lt;/em&gt; says the extension “does not collect any data” and that it should be compatible with other extensions, such as ones that look for fake product reviews.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Levels Health review: optimize your fitness with a $400 glucose tracker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2bgv3bDWKDTi93bUQawIf5tf110=/0x333:4000x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70210526/20211026_132108.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The key to the Levels Health system is a device that constantly monitors glucose levels in your bloodstream&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Real-time glucose tracking for fitness-based purposes is here, but it’ll cost you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Eqexk9"&gt;“What is that thing on your shoulder?” has been the question I’ve been asked most frequently for the last month. Understandably so. For the last 30 days, just barely peeking out from under the sleeve of my T-shirts, there has been a big black sticker. It’s round, about two inches in diameter, and it looks like a high-end Band-Aid. But that sticker is just a cover. Under it is a smaller plastic disk, with a little thread that is actually sticking into my body and analyzing my ever-changing blood-sugar levels. It’s the closest I’ve ever been to cyborg status. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IHsWK0"&gt;Levels Health is a new product and service — currently in late-stage beta but gettable by the public — designed to monitor your body’s glucose response to different stimuli, like exercise and stress and especially the foods you eat. It’s sort of like a Fitbit for your metabolic health, and it currently costs a hefty $400 for the one-month program. It’s aimed toward athletes and the health-conscious who are looking for everything from optimum performance to simply staying healthy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="63u9hx"&gt;Glucose monitoring devices like these are traditionally used by diabetics, who need to know their blood sugar levels and when to administer insulin or treat for low blood sugar. But Levels is marketing itself as a wellness product for anyone to use and isn’t making any diagnostic claims. “Levels is currently a general health and wellness program not intended to diagnose, manage, or treat any health conditions,” says Dr. Casey Means, the company’s co-founder and chief medical officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wrNsTr"&gt;But let’s back up a little and talk about glucose itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvGNTO"&gt;You might think of glucose as the primary building block for energy inside your body. Your digestive process breaks down the foods you eat (especially the carbohydrates, but fats and proteins, too) and converts much of it into glucose, which it puts into your bloodstream. When that happens, your pancreas gets a signal to release insulin, which is a hormone that allows the cells in your body to take up the glucose and use it as energy (every cell in your body uses glucose).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X4D2p7"&gt;The problem is that there can be too much of a good thing. When there’s too much glucose in your blood, it sort of overwhelms your system. Your muscles can’t take it all up, and bad things start to happen. It may get stored in fat cells as triglycerides. It may damage your liver, brain, and other systems. Big doses of glucose can also cause your pancreas to make too much insulin, which can lead to something known as “insulin resistance,” where your cells start ignoring the insulin and take up less and less glucose over time, which means more and more glucose stays in your blood. This can lead to a whole host of medical problems, including type-2 diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and potentially things like cancer, Alzheimer’s, reproductive issues, fatigue, brain fog, and much more. According to &lt;a href="https://www.unc.edu/posts/2018/11/28/only-12-percent-of-american-adults-are-metabolically-healthy-carolina-study-finds/"&gt;a 2018 study from UNC at Chapel Hill&lt;/a&gt;, only about 12 percent of Americans are metabolically healthy, which is a frighteningly low number.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Mc1tFkFAWLjcA67j3-M506pGVIQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23032252/20211026_142234.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Brent Rose for The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The glucose monitor has a probe that inserts into your arm. It’s surprisingly painless.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lmxyRE"&gt;This is all a fairly high-level breakdown. If you want to get into the nitty-gritty, Levels wrote what it calls its &lt;a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-metabolic-fitness"&gt;Ultimate Guide to Metabolic Fitness&lt;/a&gt;, which is a fascinating read and goes into more detail than I can here. The TL;DR version is this: High spikes in your glucose levels are bad, but every body is different, and there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution that works for humans. What causes a spike in me may not cause a spike in you. We may all respond differently to the same exact foods, exercise, or sleep routines, and while some rules of thumb may hold somewhat constant, the only way to know for sure is to experiment and track the results, which finally brings us back to the thingy on my shoulder.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ofvLJ5"&gt;The disk that’s stuck to me is a continuous glucose monitor (CGM). These products themselves aren’t super new, and Levels doesn’t actually make this one. Instead, it works with a product called the &lt;a href="https://www.freestyle.abbott/us-en/home.html"&gt;Freestyle Libre&lt;/a&gt;, made by Abbott. The gadget accounts for much of the cost of the Levels program. Each one lasts for 14 days, so you have to swap them halfway through. The disk-shaped sensor comes embedded in a larger, round plastic stamp. You try to find an out-of-the-way spot on the back of your arm, ideally in the little pocket between your triceps and deltoid, and you clean the area with an included alcohol pad. Then, you put the stamp on your arm and depress it until you hear a loud click. In that click, the device actually sticks you with a little pin, which is instantly withdrawn and replaced with a little, flexible, quarter-inch thread, which is about the thickness of a single bristle on a hairbrush. Levels promises that it’s completely painless, and indeed it was. I literally could not feel it at all, either during or after.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VB2-Pcoer66HRVFD-HmMtBLSl0k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23032257/20211026_132430.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A plastic tool is used to mount the monitor to your arm&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XzlJvs"&gt;Once you remove the plastic stamp, you’ve got this little white disk stuck to you. You slap the larger, black adhesive circle over it just to give it some added protection, and you’re good to go. It’s completely sweat-proof and waterproof (I ran, swam, surfed with it and never had any issues), and you’ll largely forget it’s there at all. The sensor logs a sample every minute and transfers all of the data over to your phone when you scan it. To do that, you simply touch the back of your phone to the sensor. It has an NFC radio, and it transfers all of the data points collected since your last scan over to the Levels app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H9Stim"&gt;That app is where you spend most of your time. That’s where you log all of your food and exercise. You simply write in what you ate and when you ate it, or you can take a photo of it if that’s easier. You don’t need to be too specific (i.e., you’re not counting calories, ingredients, or macros); you just enter in enough information so you remember what you had. You can also log events like meditation, sex, or moments of acute stress. Whatever you want, really — you can see how your body responds. Levels recommends you keep your glucose levels between 70 and 110 mg/dL. The ADA says you can go up to 140 mg/dL, but once you cross the 140 line, you’re classified as “pre-diabetic,” so Levels wants you to stay well clear of that and in the “optimal” zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqfVO3"&gt;The name of the game is avoiding glucose spikes and dips. The app shows you a graph of all your data points, and you want to see a nice, smooth curve after meals. Levels also rates each logged item from zero to 10 (with 10 being the best), so you can easily interpret your results. I logged nearly everything I ate and every minute of exercise for a month, and I was genuinely surprised by the way my body responded to certain things. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Whors0o-zO5pHW13LisL3lgQxzU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052728/meal_impact_3up.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot by Brent Rose / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Levels app tells you exactly how each meal or activity impacted your glucose levels.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I8PdTX"&gt;For instance, there’s this one protein bar that I’ve been eating for years that is high-protein and low carbohydrate, etc. I was shocked that it made my glucose spike aggressively. Levels gave it a 2. It turns out that my body doesn’t mind some sugar alcohols, but other types of sugar alcohols cause a strong reaction. Thankfully, my regular breakfast of eggs with salad and coffee came in at a 10, but if I added a bowl of oatmeal to it, my score dropped down to a 3. Chicken tenders were fine with a savory barbecue sauce, but if I switched to my favorite (a sweet one), it dropped all the way down to a 0. Damn. Potatoes seemed to be one of the worst offenders for causing me spikes, which was heartbreaking, but sweet potato fries were less bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f6AzyX"&gt;One of the biggest takeaways for me was how I could mitigate the negative impact of one thing by adding something else. For example, instead of eating that protein bar that gave me a 2 by itself, if I ate it with some jerky and almonds, it got upgraded to a 6. Dinner would frequently cause me to spike, but dinner with a walk immediately afterward improved my numbers significantly because my muscles used up some of that excess glucose in my blood. A cocktail then going to bed was bad, but a cocktail then going to bed with someone else… not so bad! You’re also given a score for each day and week as a whole, from 0 to 100, with 100 being the best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="vuQuhq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Being active after a meal often mitigated the spike in glucose levels from the food&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VokyP0"&gt;Levels suggests you don’t make any changes during the first week, so you can see what happens with your normal habits. For weeks two and three, they suggest you start experimenting with different foods to see how your body responds to different things. For week four, it’s recommended that you try to implement your learnings and go for the lowest score possible. Everything you log takes about two hours before you can see your score (because your body doesn’t respond to food or exercise immediately), but then you can see everything in the app. Levels also emails you daily and weekly reports and, finally, one big report at the end of your one-month journey that has 14 pages of granular info broken down into easy-to-understand charts and graphs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WapVTK"&gt;While the device itself doesn’t hurt at all, it must be said that there are some pain points. For starters, Levels is currently using a two-app solution. You have to download the sensor’s app (called LibreLink) and set up an account on it; then, you tell that app to share info with the Levels app. Once everything is set up and linked, you don’t really need to deal with LibreLink again, but Levels acknowledges that the onboarding process isn’t ideal, and it’s working on a better solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2KZ6D"&gt;A larger issue is that the sensor itself can only store eight hours’ worth of data points. That means that if you don’t remember to scan it right before you go to bed and again right when you wake up, then you’ll have some gaps in your data. Not ideal, especially if you’re one of those lucky people who actually gets eight-plus hours of sleep (tell me what it’s like?). Levels is working on compatibility with another continuous glucose monitor that has Bluetooth so it could constantly push updates to your phone in the background, but no word yet on if or when that option will be available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wLDyxn"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The sensor can only hold eight hours worth of data, so you have to remember to sync it often with the app&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fYNJv3"&gt;Levels could go further in clarifying what your numbers mean, especially toward the beginning. Right now, the way the app is set up, you don’t get a ton of information or advice to go along with your data. The company has written a lot of blogs that help explain the ins and outs of the science behind this, but it would be nice if it were better integrated into the app and if there was more built-in coaching as you went. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lDAHZT"&gt;Lastly, there’s the price. $400 for a month is steep. For that, you could buy a very solid multisport watch with GPS (or an Apple Watch) that would last you for years and track a ton of different metrics and activities. Of course, the data you get from Levels is unique in the pantheon of fitness trackers, but it would be easier to take the leap if the cost wasn’t so exorbitant. Its price certainly supports the argument that fitness tech really &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785163/digital-health-physical-activity-inequity"&gt;only benefits the wealthy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An adhesive, waterproof sticker helps protect the monitor as you wear it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rNMDTv"&gt;Ultimately, I enjoyed my experience with Levels, and I can see it being a useful tool for athletes who want to learn how to fuel properly for their unique body chemistry and for people who have concerns about their metabolic fitness. I didn’t lose any weight in the month I did it, but that’s because glucose levels are just one part of the picture. Levels works with Apple Health and Google Fit to automatically import activities, but part of me thought it would be nice if it could integrate with a calorie tracking system like MyFitnessPal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTgqNL"&gt;After some thought, though, I came around to believe that it might be best to take a month to simply learn how your body responds to different foods and activities and then integrate those learnings into your diet and exercise plan going forward. That’s something I’m already doing in the days since I took the tracker off. Where I used to just snack on an apple, now I’m more likely to pair it with some yogurt or cheese because I know it won’t spike my glucose as much, which will be better for my long-term health and may help prevent an energy crash a few hours later. That really is valuable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="HabFgC"&gt;Levels is targeting a full launch either at the end of 2021 or the beginning of 2022. It’s currently in a semi-closed beta, and it has more than 100,000 people on the waiting list, but if you use &lt;a href="https://www.levelshealth.com/join?partner=THEVERGE"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt;, you should be able to skip the line, and most people will get their tracker kit within two weeks of ordering.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>GTA Trilogy’s next big patch fixes spelling errors, rain, and CJ’s face covering the camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2NmW2lm8cm5KaFOoLOajYU16awU=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70210326/afa2de9642866521f4d2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The patch apparently fixes some problems with rain.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Rockstar&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qkh7CF"&gt;Rockstar’s next Title Update for &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy – The Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt; looks to address a huge list of issues with the buggy remasters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jiLYjS"&gt;The game has had a rough launch, and many of the fixes appear to clean up some of the more meme-worthy problems with the games. A lot of the fixes are &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-trilogy-pours-rain-so-hard-it-s-nearly-unplayable-1848048162"&gt;about rain&lt;/a&gt;. Many spelling errors have apparently been fixed. I spotted two fixes for “a hole in the game world” in &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City – The Definitive Edition. &lt;/em&gt;There are also two fixes for CJ’s face obscuring the camera in &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas – The Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt;, which (sadly) may address the absolutely incredible bug &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/glassbottommeg/status/1459238099955838979"&gt;shown in this video&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MVZgMM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I've changed my mind, the GTA remasters are perfect.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(this is looking backwards while in first person, on the quadbike) &lt;a href="https://t.co/JEB0SC7y3V"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JEB0SC7y3V&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Megan Fox (   OUT NOW) (@glassbottommeg) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/glassbottommeg/status/1459238099955838979?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NBnMPA"&gt;The patch also brings “stability improvements,” fixes some textures, and adds a cinematic camera mode. You can read the &lt;a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/articles/4411612846867/Grand-Theft-Auto-The-Trilogy-The-Definitive-Edition-Title-Update-Notes-1-03-PlayStation-5-PlayStation-4-Xbox-Series-X-S-Xbox-One-PC"&gt;full list of fixes for Title Update 1.03 on Rockstar’s website&lt;/a&gt;. Rockstar says the update is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarSupport/status/1465699042193657871"&gt;now available&lt;/a&gt; on PS4, PS5, Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, and PC and that it will be available for the Nintendo Switch “in the coming days.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pD1dlF"&gt;Rockstar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22791656/rockstar-gta-trilogy-remaster-mess-re-list-original-titles-pc"&gt;apologized for the rocky launch&lt;/a&gt; a little over a week after the game’s November 11th release date. “The updated versions of these classic games did not launch in a state that meets our own standards of quality, or the standards our fans have come to expect,” &lt;a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/393o373751k48k/a-note-from-the-rockstar-games-team-re-grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-th?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=o_social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=gta-trilogy_announcement_update-20211119"&gt;the company said&lt;/a&gt;. “We have ongoing plans to address the technical issues and to improve each game going forward.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>BMW shows off its new XM hybrid concept vehicle </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AV-31RvvRb5yJGke7Hl_MUWdejk=/14x0:2264x1500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70210312/P90445512_lowRes_bmw_concept_xm_11_21.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The BMW Concept XM  | BMW&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KaZadT"&gt;BMW has revealed a new concept plug-in hybrid electric vehicle, the first in its M class to get an electric motor, the company announced. The BMW XM will go into production at the company’s Spartanburg, South Carolina, plant beginning in late 2022, the company said in a &lt;a href="https://www.press.bmwgroup.com/global/article/detail/T0357372EN/the-bmw-concept-xm-%E2%80%93-power-and-luxury-beyond-all-conventions"&gt;news release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4X7ZbH"&gt;The concept BMW XM has a V8 engine combined with an electric motor to provide 750 horsepower and 737 foot-pounds of torque. BMW spokesman Jay Hanson clarified in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that while the production version of the XM will have a V8 engine paired with a plug-in hybrid system, “horsepower and torque figures should be considered preliminary at this time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nGD18Z"&gt;The company said the unusual front-end design, with two large nostril-shaped openings, shows off a new direction for its future luxury vehicles that includes an illuminated version of its black kidney grille. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oX2hkc32wfvlNDFPfIPrMUh0U48=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052561/bmw_grille.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The grille of the BMW XM shows off a new front-end design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8Ogwfy"&gt;The interior features “vintage-look leather,” with a curved display that combines the instrument panel and infotainment display into a single design, Hanson said. BMW M CEO Franciscus van Meel said in a statement that the concept XM “represents a complete re-imagining of the high-performance vehicle segment.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A9IOOS-cQQDI7xMjej692QYouxE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052559/bmw_interior.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The interior of the BMW XM concept vehicle.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hxg4cf"&gt;The company didn’t provide details about how much the vehicle will cost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hNTItd"&gt;While the XM isn’t an all-electric vehicle, BMW is moving toward an electrified future: the company said earlier this year that it expects 50 percent of its new vehicles to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22335807/bmw-i4-sedan-ev-m-performance-range-photos"&gt;fully electric by 2030&lt;/a&gt;. It’s developing all-electric versions of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345464/bmw-5-7-series-x1-electric-car-ev-plug-in"&gt;5 Series and 7 Series sedans&lt;/a&gt; and its X1 SUV. But &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21324114/bmw-ix3-electric-suv-range-specs-price-china-europe"&gt;the iX3 will only be available in Europe and China&lt;/a&gt;, not the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXHaQZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ArticleBody-InlineImage-106981867"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s genre slate for 2022 includes The Sandman and The Witcher: Blood Origin</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E9nB8ADGffqZzfUIhKn9hguQ5eY=/209x0:892x455/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70210274/Screen_Shot_2021_11_30_at_9.58.20_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8qIY2S"&gt;Netflix still has some big releases in store this year — including &lt;em&gt;Don’t Look Up&lt;/em&gt; and the second season of &lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; — but the streaming service is also looking forward to its 2022 lineup. Today, the company released its slate for genre shows and movies coming next year, and while we knew some of them (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/6/22765226/stranger-things-4-netflix-trailer-eleven-netflix-release-date"&gt;last month, Netflix revealed that &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 4&lt;/em&gt; would be coming out next summer&lt;/a&gt;), there were also some new confirmations. Most notably, both &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/25/22688895/netflix-sandman-video-neil-gaiman-comic-tudum-dream"&gt;the live-action adaptation of Neil Gaiman’s &lt;em&gt;The Sandman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565149/michelle-yeoh-netflix-the-witcher-blood-origin-sword-elves"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher&lt;/em&gt; spinoff &lt;em&gt;Blood Origin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will debut on the streaming service in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LTzJ28"&gt;Outside of those heavy hitters, there are also plenty of shows returning — &lt;em&gt;Alice in Borderland’s&lt;/em&gt; season 2, &lt;em&gt;Locke &amp;amp; Key&lt;/em&gt; season 3, &lt;em&gt;The Umbrella Academy&lt;/em&gt; season 3 — along with gaming adaptations, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/11/22466235/netflix-the-cuphead-show-geeked-week-teaser-wayne-brady-king-dice"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cuphead Show&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21403849/netflix-resident-evil-tv-series-original-live-action-announcement"&gt;a live-action &lt;em&gt;Resident Evil&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650396/magic-the-gathering-directors-netflix-avengers-series-russo-brothers"&gt;an animated &lt;em&gt;Magic: The Gathering&lt;/em&gt; show&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21303233/cyberpunk-2077-anime-edgerunners-netflix-studio-trigger-2022-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk: Edgerunners&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from the acclaimed Studio Trigger. Rounding out the selection are some horror titles, including vampire hunting romance &lt;em&gt;First Kill&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Midnight Club&lt;/em&gt;, the latest series from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683761/midnight-mass-review-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Midnight Mass&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21508362/haunting-of-bly-manor-review-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Haunting of Bly Manor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; creator Mike Flanagan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwDj7A"&gt;Most of the releases don’t have specific dates attached to them yet, but here’s the full list of genre stories coming to Netflix in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Square Enix warns players that servers might struggle with FFXIV’s next big expansion</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MZO-pTyN2Bf84tRVWu-D34l_JMI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70210241/FFXIV_PUB_DIGITAL_FANFESTIVAL_2021_13.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vaSn6Z"&gt;With &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; launching in early access this week and officially on December 7th, &lt;a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/1f70135439286fa66209cd21c10e73ebb986a6ee"&gt;Square Enix is warning players&lt;/a&gt; that they might face the longest log-in queues and wait times the game has ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ylbdrr"&gt;In a blog post, Square Enix stated that while it has optimized servers in anticipation of heavy traffic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22777216/global-chip-supply-chain-shortage-holidays-christmas-shopping"&gt;the global chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; has prevented the addition of new servers that would help alleviate congestion problems. As such, players can expect to wait longer than normal to log into game servers, visit new &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; specific areas, and experience instanced content-like duties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLdsDi"&gt;Square Enix also offered tips that players can use to ensure their &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; experience is the best it can be. If players are experiencing higher log-in queues for their home server, they can choose to temporarily play on another, less-crowded server within their data center. Also, since new character creation is disabled for congested worlds, Square Enix suggested players interested in making new characters create them now before the &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; rush or during off-hours post-launch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8Oq8E"&gt;Interest in&lt;em&gt; Final Fantasy XIV &lt;/em&gt;reached an all-time high this summer, aided by an exodus of dissatisfied &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; players, popular streamers giving the MMO airtime, and &lt;a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-critically-acclaimed-mmorpg"&gt;a clever meme&lt;/a&gt; extolling the virtues of &lt;em&gt;FFXIV&lt;/em&gt;’s free trial. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zvnymG"&gt;Even with Square Enix beefing up their existing servers and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/8/22770249/final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker-expansion-delayed-two-weeks"&gt;delaying the game by two weeks&lt;/a&gt; to ensure stability, &lt;em&gt;Endwalker&lt;/em&gt; is shaping up to be the biggest launch in &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy XIV&lt;/em&gt; history.&lt;/p&gt;
