    <title>PixelJunk Eden 2 is a stylish sequel to an indie classic</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lo9WByPkeawdC_IyrihBDiznhvM=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68484044/pixeljunk_eden_2_switch_screenshot06.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GT125j"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PixelJunk Eden&lt;/em&gt; was ahead of its time. The idea of a download-only indie game with arty, abstract 2D graphics and a pulsing techno soundtrack doesn’t sound remotely unusual in 2020, but there really wasn’t much like &lt;em&gt;Eden&lt;/em&gt; when it dropped on the PS3 in 2008. Developed by Kyoto’s Q-Games, with music and visuals from local-artist-turned-creative-director Baiyon, &lt;em&gt;Eden&lt;/em&gt; was a hypnotic triumph, if a little more challenging than its chill vibe might have led you to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbyBPh"&gt;Now we have a sequel, &lt;em&gt;PixelJunk Eden 2&lt;/em&gt;, which is coming out today as a Nintendo Switch exclusive. Much of the content and music is repurposed from a 2018 mobile game, &lt;em&gt;Eden Obscura&lt;/em&gt;. If it’s new to you, though, &lt;em&gt;Eden 2&lt;/em&gt; will feel like a true sequel — and one that can be friendlier to play than the original.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eyx2Pt"&gt;The basic premise is identical. Every stage is set in a garden, and your goal is to help your tiny character reach a glowing “spectra” somewhere on the map. You do this by growing the plants in the garden. Think of it as a platformer where there aren’t many platforms until you set them down yourself. There are seeds placed throughout the level, and you fill them up by swinging on a thread to collect floating pollen spores nearby. Once a seed is full, you can bounce or swing into it and cause branches to sprout out, which will help you get to more seeds, spores, and, ultimately, the spectra.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dlV_uvDdNmK919DxMJcB120bWtM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22156693/pixeljunk_eden_2_switch_screenshot06.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="fS7jWH"&gt;If this sounds esoteric, it’s much simpler in practice. The entire game is played with a single analog stick and a jump button, and really all you have to master is the physics of swinging around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjKoDb"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eden 2&lt;/em&gt; is also a lot more forgiving than its predecessor, which had a brutal time limit and would frequently send you plummeting all the way to the bottom of the garden if you missed a jump. Some of the ways that &lt;em&gt;Eden Obscura&lt;/em&gt; adapted its controls to be more forgiving on touchscreens have made their way back to &lt;em&gt;Eden 2&lt;/em&gt;’s traditional interface; you can hover in place, for example, and jump multiple times before landing. &lt;em&gt;Eden 2&lt;/em&gt; also brings you back to your jumping-off point if you fall too far, and there are checkpoints around the map that reset the time limit — though, really, I think the game would be better off losing the time limit altogether.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXJRK6"&gt;The visuals and music are familiar but no less mesmerizing. Baiyon’s soundtrack has a more organic feel than that of the original, which was very much of its time; its sparse minimal techno could’ve been lifted straight from a mid-2000s Kompakt compilation. (I say that in a good way: &lt;em&gt;Eden&lt;/em&gt; was a post-club staple of mine for years.) This is still definitely a game you should be playing with headphones or at loud volume.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cLH-kceNGO8BKOA_uOLJNBm0EZw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22156694/pixeljunk_eden_2_switch_screenshot05.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ZBuMEB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eden 2&lt;/em&gt;’s structure is a little odd. It serves you up a selection of levels, each of which you have to finish once to be presented with another set. You can’t replay any of them at will, which is in contrast to the original game’s map screen that let you jump directly into each stage. I like the shift to simpler menus, but I would have preferred to start out with more conventional progression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTyzTO"&gt;Still, &lt;em&gt;PixelJunk Eden 2&lt;/em&gt; is an easy recommendation. It resurrects an indie classic and makes it much less frustrating to play, which I would call an improvement for something that ought to be perfect for zoning out. &lt;em&gt;Eden 2&lt;/em&gt; isn’t quite as novel a prospect as the original was 12 years ago, but it still manages to stand out as uniquely stylish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X5VAL1"&gt;&lt;small&gt;PixelJunk Eden 2 &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is out today for the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amid HBO Max and Warner Bros. chaos, entertainment executives defend streaming push</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I1xCjkdzVXRdnfUmsn6K3oNRUHg=/125x0:575x300/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68484038/godzilla_kong.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="07PZcw"&gt;Christopher Nolan may be seething, but CEOs for AT&amp;amp;T, NBCUniversal, and ViacomCBS each reiterated their commitment to streaming at a UBS conference on Monday amid chaos in Hollywood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aiyuqv"&gt;Following WarnerMedia’s announcement that it would shift the Warner Bros. 2021 movie slate into a hybrid release, debuting movies &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22152626/hbo-max-2021-movies-release-date-matrix-dune-suicide-squad"&gt;on HBO Max at the same time they hit theaters&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T CEO John Stankey provided a small update on HBO Max as he defended WarnerMedia’s decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j5DP17"&gt;The streamer is nearing 12.6 million active subscribers, according to Stankey, as &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/att-ceo-defends-warne-bros-streaming-plan-hbo-max-nears-12-6m-activated-subs"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That’s about 4 million more since AT&amp;amp;T’s last &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528234/hbo-max-subscribers-activations-att-directv-warner"&gt;update in late October&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Active&lt;/em&gt; is the key word. Technically, HBO Max has 28.7 million eligible subscribers who can upgrade from HBO’s linear cable plan into Max, but not all of those with eligible plans have jumped on the offer. It’s something that WarnerMedia and AT&amp;amp;T executives know is an issue — one not likely helped by the confusing branding and rollout — and one that executives are hoping having high-profile movies will help solve. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZxu8p"&gt;Stankey believes having the films will help to “penetrate the market faster” and scale the platform’s subscriber growth at a time when people in the United States aren’t likely to get out to theaters for much of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zxpaqL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I know there’s a lot of noise out in the market.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A3PNzv"&gt;The first move came when Warner Bros. shifted &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984 &lt;/em&gt;to a simultaneous release in theaters &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/18/21504152/wonder-woman-1984-release-delay-new-date-warner-bros-disney-black-widow-dune-tenet"&gt;and on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;. Then, everything else followed. Internationally, where HBO Max doesn’t exist and WarnerMedia has less incentive to grow a product and where movies might perform better with more theaters open, films will play exclusively in theaters before hitting digital retailers. In the US, where HBO Max growth is a vital concern and theaters remain closed in key markets, WarnerMedia is using the opportunity presented to them — even if it angers different parts of Hollywood. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iu8vlI"&gt;“I know there’s a lot of noise out in the market, people with different viewpoints,” Stankey said, adding that this is anticipated “anytime you are going to change a model.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtSa3X"&gt;Stankey was in part addressing comments made by Nolan, who has worked with Warner Bros. for years and &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/christopher-nolan-rips-hbo-max-as-worst-streaming-service-denounces-warner-bros-plan"&gt;condemned the move&lt;/a&gt;. Talent agents and the various guilds within Hollywood were also taken aback, and reports that Legendary Pictures &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/12/warnermedia-legendary-challenge-dune-godzilla-vs-kong-streamer-battles-looming-1234651283/"&gt;is planning legal action&lt;/a&gt; over &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/5/21453047/dune-delay-release-date-warner-bros-wonder-woman-disney-marvel-black-widow"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Godzilla vs Kong&lt;/em&gt;’s move have started appearing. Warner Bros. CEO Ann Sarnoff also addressed the backlash in a &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/08/warner-bros-ceo-defends-2021-film-release-model-in-talks-with-talent.html"&gt;new interview with CNBC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;saying that changes were brought on by the pandemic, using Nolan’s &lt;em&gt;Tenet &lt;/em&gt;as a way to demonstrate Warner Bros.’ commitment to theaters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rsaewc"&gt;“We have many movies, which are ready to go, and they’ve been sitting on shelves,” Sarnoff said. “We thought this was the most creative and win-win situation to bring them out.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NdxmCn"&gt;It’s not just AT&amp;amp;T and WarnerMedia executives who positioned the pivot to streaming as an inevitable and irrevocable move forward in the industry. NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell spoke at the same conference, announcing that Peacock reached more than 26 million signups, but he didn’t specify how many were paid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="pqCtkD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We have many movies, which are ready to go, and they’ve been sitting on shelves.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2p1yeK"&gt;Shell, like other CEOs, defended the importance of theatrical experiences. Universal isn’t shifting its slate of 2021 movies to Peacock, although Peacock isn’t exactly the same bet that HBO Max is for AT&amp;amp;T. If theaters are still not where they need to be by the time &lt;em&gt;F9 &lt;/em&gt;comes out in May, it’s a little easier for Universal to delay the title instead of feeding it into Peacock. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSEJsA"&gt;Still, there’s always the possibility that Shell and his company could move titles to Peacock or, more likely, digital retailers in 2021. It was Universal that first angered theater chains like AMC after moving &lt;em&gt;Trolls World Tour &lt;/em&gt;to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21184030/universal-trolls-world-tour-hunt-coronavirus-birds-of-prey-warner-bros-disney-paramount-vod-digital"&gt;digital-only title in March&lt;/a&gt;, and it was Universal that worked out a deal with AMC to shorten the period of time &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/28/21345713/amc-universal-movies-theaters-digital-rentals-pvod-streaming-agreement"&gt;a movie must play in theaters&lt;/a&gt;. As cliche as it’s become in 2020, it’s impossible to say for certain what companies will do in the next six months because it’s impossible to know what the next six months hold. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HXanjf"&gt;“I think that theatrical will continue to thrive and the more windows can collapse so there’s other ways to see things at home and in a less premium fashion, the more money is going to be made by everybody involved in the movie business and it’s better for consumers,” Shell said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HNwYsj"&gt;Finally, ViacomCBS CEO Bob Bakish also spoke about the company’s interest in developing a number of streaming platforms, including CBS All Access (soon to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437729/cbs-all-access-paramount-plus-new-name-rebrand-2021-international-disney-hbo"&gt;be Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt;) and its free, ad-supported streamer, Pluto TV. Bakish revealed that ViacomCBS is predicting about 40 million average monthly Pluto TV users around the world and 19 million combined subscribers for CBS All Access and Showtime’s streamer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BWBihx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Hollywood is experiencing its own “move fast and break things” moment&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0wmIKX"&gt;When it comes to next year’s movies, however, Bakish wouldn’t say one way or another what happens. The CEO noted that the company has 12 movies, which includes four major franchise films. Regardless of what happens, Bakish recognized that even in a post-COVID 19 world, “it’s pretty clear that the theatrical windows will evolve and get shorter.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4uGC3"&gt;“I think there is a role for theatrical... but in parallel, some of these new monetization paths that we’re seeing are going to be more common,” Bakish said, as &lt;a href="https://thestreamable.com/news/viacomcbs-ceo-bob-bakish-says-theatrical-windows-are-bound-to-get-shorter-post-covid-19"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;The Streamable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “I think the film category will continue to be strategic and valuable, but is certainly evolving.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I0OeOc"&gt;The issue boils down to talent and various agencies wanting what they know and executives wanting what’s next. Hollywood is experiencing its own “move fast and break things” moment. (Let’s see what happens with Disney during its big investor day focused on streaming initiatives.) The issue is that the film industry’s structure isn’t built for moving fast, and the cost of breaking things is yet to be seen.  &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PUBG’s new creative director wants to put the focus back on survival</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kRWnb7PiUe4GRzLHrydevxmPC1Q=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68483699/7._parachute_2.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pj49d4"&gt;It’s been a year of experimentation for &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;. Over the course of 2020, the genre-defining battle royale game received new, smaller maps and tightly focused gameplay modes. December 16th will see the debut of &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;’s 10th season, which introduces new AI enemies in a dense, 32-player map called “Haven.” Looking ahead, though, &lt;em&gt;PUBG’&lt;/em&gt;s new creative director Dave Curd says this process of testing ideas has helped the team find what makes the game distinct among the sea of battle royale games it inspired. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbP5Fv"&gt;“[In] 2020, we made a lot of small maps, mainly because we’re trying to find the range of what’s acceptable,” he tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; “Now that we’ve had this year of development, my feeling is those big, long stretches of downtime, punctuated with exciting gunfights, that I think has the most unique &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; flavor. I think that’s what we do best that our competitors don’t.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lM4Cgt"&gt;Curd has been in the role for the last few months, serving as &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;’s first creative director &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/27/18283804/pubg-brendan-greene-playerunknown-interview-special-projects-gdc-2019"&gt;since creator Brendan “PlayerUnknown” Greene&lt;/a&gt; stepped down last year to start a new project. Curd has worked on the game for three years, starting out as an artist before heading up the relatively new &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; studio in Madison, Wisconsin. Prior to that, he served as art director at &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt; developer Raven Software. He says that, as part of his new role, he thinks a lot about the long-term life of &lt;em&gt;PUBG &lt;/em&gt;— and that process involves defining what exactly the game is.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BFG3BNFq8xqJf_YIG1r8f5gFSlE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154515/4._PILLAR.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2sJ85A"&gt;“We’re always curious what’s beyond the blue circle,” he says. “We don’t see the game of &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; as a giant team death match with a shrinking circle. We see it as a survival experience. If you think about &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, we’ve got really deep, interesting gunplay, and I think that’s contributed to our staying power. But if you analyze a match of &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt;, a very small percentage of your time is actually spent shooting. Most of the time you’re in survival phase.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OzlMB0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The game has a really steep learning curve.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aKOOOm"&gt;One of the challenges has been figuring out how to make that phase more interesting, particularly for new players. One of the goal’s of the new season 10 map is to create more interactions for players outside of fighting each other. The new AI soldiers, for instance, guard valuable gear, forcing players to make a decision about whether it’s worth the risk to engage. Similarly, the new tactical parachute is meant to make traversing the dense, more vertical map a more fun experience. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmH0ns"&gt;“You think about a new user who joins &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; today. They download it, they boot it up: the players they’re encountering are very challenging to compete with,” Curd explains. “All of the players that have been here for years have amazing recoil control, they really understand how to follow the circle, and they’re just amazing veterans. So if you’re a new user, I think it’s really difficult. The game has a really steep learning curve. So we’re playing with this in season 10 by giving more adventures to get into and more ways to get out of trouble.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5xr7GNjr8uyP3iCGL8ZWPYtuVds=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22154517/6._Pillar_Tactical.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GBZ3nA"&gt;The goal is that these new experiences will make players stick around and dig deeper into the main survival experience. Similarly, the &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; team has also been experimenting with storytelling — there’s even &lt;a href="https://lore.pubg.com/"&gt;a lore website&lt;/a&gt; — in an attempt to find more ways to lure people in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lVyF5N"&gt;It’s a very tricky balancing act, trying to grow a popular game with a dedicated player base. It’s especially challenging now as the battle royale genre is arguably as popular as its ever been, with games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty: Warzone&lt;/em&gt; all enjoying healthy player bases. Some of those titles have introduced bots and experimented with easier modes in an attempt to make the experience more approachable for new players — &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s last few years have been largely defined by developer Epic’s attempts to balance casual and competitive play, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/22/20829047/epic-fortnite-mech-suit-brute-nerf-update-changes-arena-champion-series"&gt;often with mixed results&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KenbCh"&gt;But Curd says that the &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; team is using a different philosophy. “That’s something that’s been on my mind,” he says. “Not making the game easier, or even friendlier, but just making it more interesting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C3bnHt"&gt;Season 10 of &lt;em&gt;PUBG&lt;/em&gt; launches December 16th on PC, followed by a console version on the 17th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Verge’s favorite gadgets of 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V1pRlu2zGU3hZpuaUe8V5Ambb6Q=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68483711/VRG_TEC_Verge2020Favorites_YT.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XZuVKE"&gt;We covered nearly a hundred products &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/TheVerge"&gt;on our YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 and countless more here on the site. But while we return all our review units, there are some products we get sad about having to send back — so sad, in fact, that we end up buying them for ourselves (or at least have wishful thoughts about buying them) because we simply can’t live without them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gbe4JI"&gt;What follows are some of the gadgets that our staff &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; liked.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="roA9Jc"&gt;The Galaxy Buds Live (or the Galaxy Beans as they should have been called) aren’t the perfect pair of true wireless headphones, but they fit my specific needs perfectly. That’s because I wanted a pair of earbuds to wear while cycling. So for starters, they couldn’t be too bulky or have a stem that’d catch on the straps of my helmet. Nor did I want a pair of earbuds that were too good at blocking out environmental noise; it’s more important for me to hear incoming traffic than the end of a guitar solo. That turned the Beans’ open-air design from a negative into a positive for me. Throw in a USB-C port and support for wireless charging, and you’re left with my favorite gadget of the year. &lt;em&gt;— Jon Porter, reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XwODbg"&gt;The Oculus Quest 2 is a big compromise as a platform, since it ties virtual reality directly to the Facebook service. As a gadget, though, it can’t be beat. The Quest 2 is the first piece of consumer VR hardware without a big and obvious compromise. It’s self-contained and can be used without any wires, but you can also plug it into a laptop to play higher-powered games. It’s light enough to wear without hurting your head, although it’s best when tricked out with an alternate head strap and some special short-cord headphones. And it supports some of the best VR games around, including my personal obsession &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/18/18145103/beat-saber-game-of-the-year-psvr-oculus-vive"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Quest 2 isn’t quite the Nintendo Switch of virtual reality — but it’s surprisingly close. &lt;em&gt;— Adi Robertson, senior reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="JOzQA5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Peloton bike &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="wDn3ln"&gt;Reviewing the new Peloton bike, the Bike Plus, has been a bright spot in a horrifying year. I’m still testing it and working on the review, but the small bugs I’ve found so far don’t take away from the fact that having a place to listen to good music, sweat, and work out all my 2020 frustrations has been incredible. I need an outlet for everything I’m feeling from being cooped up in my apartment. That said, the bike costs nearly $2,500 with a $40 monthly subscription plan attached. It’s a massive cost that is tempting for me to spend, but I do wonder if, when the pandemic wanes, I’ll crave in-person gym experiences again. &lt;em&gt;— Ashley Carman, senior reporter &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;PS5&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nEtI3V"&gt;The PS5 was one of my most highly anticipated pieces of tech this year, and I am happy to say it has lived up to the expectations I set for the console. While I still have concerns on how expandable storage will work, I find the PS5 to have had a stronger launch than its competitor, the Xbox Series X, for this reason: namely, the DualSense is one of the most innovative controllers I have seen in the last few years. Its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers provide extra realism to immerse me even more in the games I play. &lt;em&gt;— Taylor Lyles, writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MWMCMF"&gt;I reviewed a whole bunch of convertible laptops this year, but the Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is the closest to being one that I’d actually consider buying. There are certainly things I don’t love about it: the keyboard is a bit flat for my taste, and the lack of USB-A ports means I can’t connect some of my peripherals without a dongle. But when it comes to the most important aspects of a 2-in-1 laptop, the XPS 13 doesn’t just check all the boxes — it blows the boxes off the page. The build quality is exceptional, the touchpad is comfortable, the 16:10 display is roomy and gorgeous, the battery life lasts all day, and the chassis is unbelievably thin and light. You can even play games like &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; at well above 60fps. As someone looking for a reliable, portable machine, I really couldn’t ask for anything more. &lt;em&gt;— Monica Chin, reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NZT02l"&gt;DJI’s new Mini 2 drone is the drone I didn’t really expect to love as much as I do. It’s not the ultimate do-it-all drone — in fact, it misses a lot of features you’d find on more expensive drones. The Mini 2 doesn’t have any obstacle avoidance sensors, it has a tiny photo sensor, and photos are only 12MP. But it also nails the basics: those 12MP photos look sharp, dynamic range is good for that small sensor, and video looks crisp. It also has two awesome features: it includes DJI’s OcuSync 2 wireless connectivity and it weighs only 249g. OcuSync 2 enables radio transmission and a nearly impeccable connection, compared to the flaky Wi-Fi connection in the original Mavic Mini. And being a sub-250g drone means you don’t need FAA registration (but be sure to follow other FAA regulations). It’s easy to bring anywhere you go and it’s incredibly fun to fly. If you’re a content creator, drone enthusiast, or a total beginner, this is a perfect drone to get. &lt;em&gt;— Vjeran Pavic, senior director &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="H3DybO"&gt;The iPhone 12 mini isn’t the best iPhone 12 for most people. If you asked me, I’d tell you to get the regular iPhone 12 or maybe the 12 Pro Max, especially if you really care about the camera. But the 12 mini is my favorite and the one I purchased. It has been a very long time since we’ve had a small phone with true flagship specs. Usually, smaller phones are either nonexistent or deeply compromised. With the 12 mini, there’s really only one compromise that matters: the battery life isn’t great. That’s the reason I don’t recommend it right off the bat. But if you’re aware of that battery life and think it can fit into your lifestyle, having a small phone again is great. It just feels like it was designed for human hands instead of being designed to maximize the screen size. That’s why it’s my favorite. &lt;em&gt;— Dieter Bohn, executive editor &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ainmSd"&gt;Fujifilm went back to the basics with the Instax SQ1, which is absolutely the least tech-y gadget I reviewed this year. With no screens, only two shooting modes, and a rotating ring around the lens that turns the camera on and off, the SQ1 feels more like a toy than a $120 camera. And it’s perfect that way because it inspires creativity and fun. Although it’s a bit bulky, the joy it provides by instantly developing memories in that iconic Polaroid frame still makes me want to bring it everywhere. Plus, taking photos of the contents of your friends’ refrigerators and then hiding the photo under the milk carton never gets old. &lt;em&gt;— Becca Farsace, senior director&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp criticizes Apple’s new app privacy labels over iMessage inconsistency</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FdqPyA2heneUL-6ea89jj6hcKZI=/6x0:1086x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68483603/verge-whatsapp-notification-2040pxl.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Thomas Ricker / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="naXIJs"&gt;WhatsApp has hit back at Apple over its new privacy labels for apps in the App Store, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/whatsapp-apple-privacy-label-requirements-cc0d5edd-ab2f-4549-b9d7-ea3c97184056.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that it’s unfair that they don’t appear to cover the pre-installed first-party service iMessage, since it’s not available on the App Store. The Facebook-owned messaging service reportedly submitted its privacy label information to Apple on Monday, and it has &lt;a href="https://faq.whatsapp.com/general/unpacking-whatsapps-privacy-label-in-the-apple-app-store"&gt;published an FAQ&lt;/a&gt; outlining what each label means in terms of the service’s data collection, and why it needs this information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EwfNul"&gt;“We think labels should be consistent across first and third party apps as well as reflect the strong measures apps may take to protect people’s private information,” WhatsApp told &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;in a statement. Although it said giving users easy-to-read privacy information is “a good start,” it added that “it’s important people can compare these ‘privacy nutrition’ labels from apps they download with apps that come pre-installed, like iMessage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5zpyb5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s important people can compare these ‘privacy nutrition’ labels from apps they download with apps that come pre-installed”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Lq2mbX"&gt;Apple first announced the new privacy labels feature as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299407/apple-ios-14-new-privacy-features-data-location-tracking-premissions-wwdc-2020"&gt;host of new privacy features at WWDC 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Likening them to the nutrition labels used on packaged groceries, the company said the feature should provide app users with more information about the data being collected on them. &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/#main:~:text=This%20information%20will%20be%20required%20to,App%20Store%20starting%20December%208%2C%202020"&gt;As of December 8th&lt;/a&gt;, developers are required to provide the information when submitting new apps and updates, however &lt;em&gt;Axios &lt;/em&gt;notes that it’s unclear when they’ll start appearing on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uT7R75"&gt;Facebook has also been critical of other aspects of Apple’s privacy push this year, like its requirement that developers show a warning and ask for permission to collect a user’s Identification for Advertisers (IDFA) starting with iOS 14. This is an identifier which helps advertisers target their ads. In response, Facebook said it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/8/27/21402744/apple-idfa-facebook-fight-ads-advertising"&gt;would stop collecting IDFA information&lt;/a&gt; through its apps, in a move that would “severely impact” its ad network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NYC5km"&gt;“This is not a change we want to make, but unfortunately Apple’s updates to iOS 14 have forced this decision,” Facebook said at the time, “We know this may severely impact publishers’ ability to monetize through Audience Network on iOS 14, and, despite our best efforts, may render Audience Network so ineffective on iOS 14 that it may not make sense to offer it on iOS 14 in the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DFNAMf"&gt;Apple later announced that it would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21420176/apple-ios-14-tracking-permission-rule-developers-delay"&gt;delaying the launch of the privacy feature&lt;/a&gt; until “early next year” to allow developers to make the necessary changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OWs4pu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAuMP3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google gives Chrome users an easier way to sync info across devices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ELHcVs7SH1ZtVvfNrmnqHnXbPuk=/0x0:912x608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68483208/Image_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The feature lets Android users sign into their Google Account on the browser with a single tap.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nuWXnB"&gt;Google is making it easier for Chrome users to sync their passwords and payment information across devices, the company has announced &lt;a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2020/12/seamless-payments-and-password.html"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. The new features will roll out “over the coming weeks and months,” Google says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FluKRU"&gt;Chrome on Android will be able to access saved payment information after you log into the browser with a Google Account. Payments can be confirmed by entering a card’s CVC or via biometric security. Logging into a Google Account in the first place on an Android device will also be simplified. If you’re already logged into a Google service like Gmail, the option will be given to sign into the browser with a Google Account on the device “with a single tap.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oQuWBh"&gt;Chrome’s desktop version is also being updated to give access to saved passwords if signed in with a Google Account. When you save a new password, Chrome will give the option to save it either on the device, or to a Google Account to have access across all devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HmE6ayc1zUj4jZDL0EXc9eJ2kDU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22156714/Image_02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On desktop, you’ll have the option of saving passwords to the device, or to a Google Account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="X9IMNt"&gt;Similar functionality is already available in Chrome via its &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/185277"&gt;sync feature&lt;/a&gt;, which carries your bookmarks, history, passwords, and other settings across devices, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2020/12/08/chrome-sync-optional/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;. But Google says the problem with this approach is that it relies on the sync option being turned on for each device. The new approach, signing into a browser with a Google Account, makes it “simpler and more intuitive” to access your information, the company claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R7e1zj"&gt;These are just the latest changes Google is making to how information gets synced across devices. Last year, the company added the option to access &lt;a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2019/07/easier-payments-with-chrome.html"&gt;saved payment info on its desktop browser via Google Accounts&lt;/a&gt;, without having to turn on Chrome sync. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FireEye cybersecurity tools compromised in state-sponsored attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rNOeA_nX_xxAqbPPaynZqLnjX1c=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68483064/acastro_170629_1777_0008_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ltEORH"&gt;One of the US’s leading cybersecurity firms, FireEye, &lt;a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/products-and-services/2020/12/fireeye-shares-details-of-recent-cyber-attack-actions-to-protect-community.html"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; it’s been hacked by a state-sponsored attacker. Hackers targeted and accessed the firm’s so-called Red Team tools, which it uses to test customer security and find vulnerabilities. Now there’s concern that the hackers could release these tools publicly or use them to attack others, though there is no evidence that this has happened yet. FireEye says that it does not believe any customer information was taken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uD8hu9"&gt;Although the blog post, authored by FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia, does not say who is responsible, it says that the attacking nation has “top-tier offensive capabilities.” &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/u-s-cyber-firm-fireeye-says-it-was-breached-by-nation-state-hackers-11607461408?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Russia is a suspect, specifically its foreign-intelligence service known as the SVR. However, the investigation into who is responsible is ongoing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZqDbZg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This attack is different from the tens of thousands of incidents we have responded to throughout the years”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sR207z"&gt;“This attack is different from the tens of thousands of incidents we have responded to throughout the years,” Mandia wrote in the post, noting that the attackers “are highly trained in operational security and executed with discipline and focus.” The disclosure did not say when the hack took place or when FireEye became aware of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xko0kr"&gt;“They operated clandestinely, using methods that counter security tools and forensic examination. They used a novel combination of techniques not witnessed by us or our partners in the past,” wrote Mandia. FireEye says it’s investigating the hack alongside the Federal Bureau of Investigation, as well as industry partners like Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NzljPL"&gt;FireEye’s disclosure of the attack, which the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; notes caused its shares to drop around 7 percent in after-hours trading, was praised by US Senator Mark Warner, who serves as vice chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence and co-chairs the Senate Cybersecurity Caucus. “I applaud FireEye for quickly going public with this news, and I hope the company’s decision to disclose this intrusion serves as an example to others facing similar intrusions,” he said, adding that the attack “shows the difficulty of stopping determined nation-state hackers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8edIsL"&gt;In response to the attack, FireEye said it has developed over 300 countermeasures to help its customers and the cybersecurity community defend against the stolen tools. It’s implemented these countermeasures into its own security products, shared them with “colleagues in the security community,” and is &lt;a href="https://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/12/unauthorized-access-of-fireeye-red-team-tools.html"&gt;making them publicly available&lt;/a&gt;. FireEye intends to share further countermeasures as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Zoom, murder hornets, Among Us, and Joe Biden topped Google trending searches in 2020</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A2GXCpsrz5xhz8e7tIsVacUUeI4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68483016/acastro_200331_1777_zoom_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vk7wl0"&gt;Google has released its list of the top trending searches in the US for 2020, and as one might expect, “coronavirus,” “election results,” and “Zoom” led the way. To be clear: these aren’t top searches or most-searched topics. Rather, they’re “searches that had a high spike in traffic over a sustained period in 2020 as compared to 2019,” Google said. As year-in-review content goes, it’s pretty depressing; also among the top trending searches were Kobe Bryant, Naya Rivera, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/28/21406395/chadwick-boseman-death-cancer-black-panther-marvel-jackie-robinson"&gt;Chadwick Boseman&lt;/a&gt;, all of whom died in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qmrb04"&gt;Google’s top trending searches in news included “stimulus checks,” as the government’s distribution of $1,200 payments &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/15/21222749/irs-coronavirus-get-my-payment-portal-payment-status-not-available-stimulus-explanation"&gt;didn’t exactly go smoothly&lt;/a&gt;; “unemployment,” as &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-claims.html"&gt;millions lost their jobs &lt;/a&gt;due to pandemic lockdowns; “Australia fires” which, I have to be honest, I forgot was actually &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/3/21048891/australia-wildfires-koalas-climate-change-bushfires-deaths-animals-damage"&gt;this year&lt;/a&gt;; “Super Tuesday”; and “Hurricane Laura.” Also among the top news results was the creature that should probably be the mascot for this hellscape of a year: the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/3/21245617/tldr-murder-hornet-2020"&gt;“murder hornet.”&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFyjtP"&gt;The top people in Google’s trending searches included President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, Kanye West, Tom Brady, Tom Hanks, and North Korea leader Kim Jong Un. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Eu65dH"&gt;All in all, it’s been a pretty terrible year, and the search topics mostly bear it out. But there were a few bright spots in the entertainment categories — and thank goodness for streaming services because we really needed the distraction while we were all locked down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bYdvvJ"&gt;Under movies, the top trending searches were for Best Picture winner &lt;em&gt;Parasite, Black Panther, Sonic the Hedgehog&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Little Women&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21132868/harley-quinn-birds-of-prey-name-change-seo-warner-bros-opening-weekend-trailers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harley Quinn: Birds of Prey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Netflix dominated the top trending TV shows, which included the one we could not escape no matter how hard we tried: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202720/tiger-king-documentary-review-netflix-joe-exotic"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tiger King&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; along with &lt;em&gt;The Queen’s Gambit, Cobra Kai, Outer Banks&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Ozark&lt;/em&gt; as well as Hulu’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/20/21188528/little-fires-everywhere-review-hulu-miniseries-race-kerry-washington-reese-witherspoon"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Little Fires Everywhere&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rBhgSZ"&gt;And under games, the little game that could from 2018, &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;, topped the 2020 list, along with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355586/fall-guys-ultimate-knockout-pc-ps4-game"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fall Guys: Ultimate Knockout&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Valorant, The Last of Us 2&lt;/em&gt;, and, of course, &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bDXpnQ"&gt;There was also a “during coronavirus” trending search category; people wanted to know whether they could visit the dentist, buy a house, find a job, date, or get an Uber.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gAeZZW"&gt;So that’s what searches trended on Google in 2020, a year that felt decades long. Let’s meet back here next year, when, hopefully, things are looking a bit brighter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RCnbvL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The hard-to-find PS5 and RTX 3090 have each inspired daring heists</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9FQxIVIRj8bFzMNFLuE_xBidDuk=/85x0:988x602/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68482621/kNmhDjg.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Nvidia&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dASHp9"&gt;The 2020 holiday shopping season has been defined by how difficult it is to purchase consoles like the PS5 and GPUs like the GeForce RTX 3090, prompting some people to use other, less legal methods to get both products. Bots account for some of the consoles up for resale, but theft is apparently another source.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5HJj54"&gt;Around $340,000 worth of GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs were stolen from MSI, &lt;a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/MSI-nvidia-rtx-3090-stolen-china?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter.com"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That amounts to 40 containers of the popular cards, based off the translation of an internal document from MSI embedded in the tweet below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QsIP10"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;MSI Chinese mainland factory was stolen, stolen 40 boxes RTX3090, the total value of 2200000RMB ...... &lt;br&gt;MSI has been officially announced and informed to the police ,Reward of 100000 RMB for reporting effective information. &lt;a href="https://t.co/JWw8hOMioG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JWw8hOMioG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— 夕惕若厉 (@GoFlying8) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GoFlying8/status/1335856080711110658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 7, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0c5An"&gt;The GeForce RTX 3090 sits at the high end of of Nvidia’s line at $1,499, and often sells for hundreds of dollars more on eBay, which seems like enough motivation to steal them. What’s less clear is how these cards were stolen. &lt;em&gt;Tom’s Hardware&lt;/em&gt; says that MSI’s communications cite video surveillance and inspections of each truck as the main security for GPUs shipping out of warehouses. This has led MSI to believe company “insiders” are the thieves, but there hasn’t been any information provided other than that document in the tweet, which is dated Friday, December 4th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lcLscl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCWNAJftXlg?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WJiQKZ"&gt;On the PS5 side of things, thefts in the UK have involved a method that seems &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-12-07-gangs-are-hitting-lorries-on-the-run-to-steal-ps5s"&gt;far more dramatic and dangerous&lt;/a&gt;. In a maneuver&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetimes.co.uk%2Farticle%2Fgangs-rise-up-to-hit-lorries-on-run-0fhcw8hr9%3Fwgu%3D270525_54264_16074704053731_fd4b16de4c%26wgexpiry%3D1615246405%26utm_source%3Dplanit%26utm_medium%3Daffiliate%26utm_content%3D22278&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F8%2F22164020%2Fthieves-ps5-rtx-3090-out-of-stock-reselling#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Times&lt;/em&gt; refers to as a “rollover”&lt;/a&gt;, thieves use cars, one in front of a delivery truck and one behind, to slow down the truck from the front and open its back while standing on the hood of the car that’s following. This method reportedly requires some kind of insider information about what’s actually in a given truck, but &lt;em&gt;The Times &lt;/em&gt;says it’s been used 27 times this year, increasing in frequency as holiday shipments have started to carry more and more expensive products. You can see an example of a “rollover” in a video from Romania above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Z9KLHd"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Happy &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PS5?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PS5&lt;/a&gt; day everyone. Tried to document our one’s unveiling, but Amazon have tricked us with an unsolicited air fryer instead (after giving delivery password). Anyone else had this problem today? &lt;a href="https://t.co/99IUSzSJUU"&gt;pic.twitter.com/99IUSzSJUU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Bex April May (@bexlectric) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bexlectric/status/1329510558987644947?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 19, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GE2VKF"&gt;In another likely theft, Amazon PS5 buyers received air fryers, cat litter and other household objects instead of the console. &lt;em&gt;IGN &lt;/em&gt;found a collection of customers who received a “PS5” box with resealed tape different from Amazon’s traditional Prime-branded black version. Conversations with current Amazon employees suggested that it would be very difficult to smuggle PS5s out of an Amazon warehouse, but it’s possible the consoles were switched out from the delivery trucks. &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-continuingly-confusing-case-of-the-uks-missing-ps5s"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;’s full odyssey is worth a read&lt;/a&gt;, but as of now, affected customers &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-missing-consoles-amazon-uk-new-stock"&gt;are receiving actual PS5s&lt;/a&gt;, and the culprits remain unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w2qyQU"&gt;Getting a PS5 or GeForce RTX card at this point requires dealing with prices higher than what both products retail for. Given that you can't just easily buy one at a store, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/6/22155611/price-ps5-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-3070-3090-3060-amd-rx-6800-xt-scalpers-ebay"&gt;the true prices&lt;/a&gt; aren’t $499 for a PS5 and $1,499 for a GeForce RTX 3090, but what they cost at resale. We saw average prices of the PS5 reach $1,024 and GeForce RTX 3090 averaging $2,076 when we last surveyed eBay. You can start to see why both products have become the targets of thieves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eyVXS6"&gt;If there’s any lesson to be learned besides “don’t steal,” it’s that sellers and manufacturers need to offer ways to make &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21451144/sony-ps5-preorder-microsoft-xbox-series-x-nvidia-rtx-3080-mess"&gt;pre-orders and sales more fair&lt;/a&gt;. The pandemic has impacted the amount of consoles and graphics cards that can be safely manufactured, but creating scarcity with limited restocks only worsens the problem. Until there’s an easier method to guarantee a purchase, reselling, and the occasional theft that helps it happen, will continue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jCO1O6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7QXQN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FfZbAR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqzXjG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cloudflare and Apple made a new DNS protocol to protect your data from ISPs  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3R8UblsExmBhYnwJyU0EgrTYV5s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68481969/acastro_190204_1777_privacy_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="T0kug0"&gt;Cloudflare is &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/oblivious-dns/"&gt;proposing a new DNS standard&lt;/a&gt; it developed with Apple that’s designed to help close a blindspot in my (and I’m sure many others’) internet privacy measures (&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/08/cloudflare-and-apple-design-a-new-privacy-friendly-internet-protocol/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The protocol is called Oblivious DNS over HTTPS (ODoH), and it’s meant to help anonymize the information that’s sent before you even make it onto a website. Whether that will help you with your overall net privacy is something we’ll tackle in a second, but first, we need to understand how regular DNS works, and what Cloudflare has added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrIyJY"&gt;Basically, DNS lets us use the web without having to remember the IP address of every site we want to visit. While we humans can easily understand names like “theverge.com”, or “archive.org,” computers use IP addresses (like 207.241.224.2) to route their requests across the internet instead. This is where DNS comes in: when you type in a website’s name, your computer asks a DNS server (usually run by your ISP) to translate a name like “theverge.com” to the site’s actual IP. The DNS server will send it back, and your computer can load the site. (&lt;a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2018/05/a-cartoon-intro-to-dns-over-https/"&gt;There are WAY more steps in this process&lt;/a&gt;, but this basic flow is all we’ll need to know to understand ODoH.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GZYFCp"&gt;If you’re concerned about privacy, you may have noticed that this system lets whoever runs the DNS server know about (and keep track of) every website you’re visiting. Usually, it’s your ISP running that server, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/3/15105582/trump-signs-internet-privacy-rule-reversal-fcc"&gt;there’s nothing stopping them&lt;/a&gt; from selling that data to advertisers. This is the problem Cloudflare and co are looking to solve with ODoH.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kzQ23c"&gt;The protocol works by introducing a proxy server between you and the DNS server. The proxy acts as a go-between, sending your requests to the DNS server, and delivering its responses back without ever letting it know who requested the data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T49Pnt"&gt;Just introducing a proxy server, though, is only moving the problem up one level: if it has the request, and also knows you sent it, what keeps it from making its own log of sites you visited? That’s where the “DNS over HTTPS” (DoH) part of ODoH comes in. DoH is a standard that’s been around for a couple years, &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/dns-over-https-will-eventually-roll-out-in-all-major-browsers-despite-isp-opposition/"&gt;though it isn’t very widespread&lt;/a&gt;. It uses encryption to ensure that only the DNS server can read your requests. By using DoH, then routing it through a proxy server, you end up with a proxy server that can’t read the request, and a DNS server that can’t tell where it came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dgmI4K"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Staying private online isn’t something you can achieve by setting up a single tool&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UvCxC3"&gt;This leaves the question: Will all this actually protect your privacy? It does mean that the DNS server won’t be able to keep a log of which sites &lt;em&gt;you specifically&lt;/em&gt; are visiting, but if you’re hoping to hide your browsing information from your ISP, ODoH (or similar technologies, like DNSCrypt’s Anonymized DNS) probably won’t be enough. ISPs still route all your other traffic, so just hiding your DNS may not keep them from building a profile of you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0GApIX"&gt;The truth of the matter is that staying private online isn’t something you can achieve by setting up a single tool. It’s a lifestyle that honestly may be unobtainable in the real world (&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/strawberrywell/status/1336373138871873537?s=21"&gt;at least for me&lt;/a&gt;). With that said, anonymizing your DNS requests is a brick to add to your privacy wall when the technology becomes available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="suiloG"&gt;Cloudflare has already added ability to take ODoH requests to their 1.1.1.1 DNS service, but you may have to wait until your browser or OS support it, which could take a while (DoH, for example, was ratified in 2018, and is only on by default &lt;a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/dns-over-https-will-eventually-roll-out-in-all-major-browsers-despite-isp-opposition/"&gt;in the US version of Firefox&lt;/a&gt;). If you’re anxious to use the new protocol, Firefox might be the one to watch for ODoH, too: its CTO says the team is “excited to see it starting to take off and are looking forward to experimenting with it.”&lt;/p&gt;
