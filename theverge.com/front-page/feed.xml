  &lt;p id="mPIhun"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.mass.gov/news/ag-healey-co-leads-nationwide-investigation-into-instagrams-impact-on-young-people"&gt;group of state attorneys general&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://ago.nebraska.gov/news/ag-peterson-joins-nationwide-investigation-instagram%E2%80%99s-impact-young-people"&gt;has announced&lt;/a&gt; an investigation into “the techniques utilized by Meta to increase the frequency and duration of engagement” of children and teens on Instagram and the negative effects that may cause (&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/instagram-effects-on-children-is-being-investigated-by-coalition-of-states-11637262000"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The group, which includes officials from California, Florida, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, Tennessee, and Vermont, accuses the company of doing this despite reports that its own research showed its platform could have a negative effect on young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8VmnOr"&gt;The research in question was exposed in &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;a report from the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which said the company’s own documents show “Instagram Is Toxic for Teen Girls.” It was later &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22711947/facebook-whistleblower-teens-safety-hearing-blumenthal-algorithms-harm"&gt;discussed in a Senate hearing&lt;/a&gt;, where Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen said that the company is unlikely to change its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710371/facebook-whistleblower-congress-hearing-instagram-kids-safety-privacy-blumenthal"&gt;habit of putting profits above people’s well-being&lt;/a&gt;. The investigation will be looking into whether the company broke consumer protection laws in its quest to keep people engaging with content on Instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="1wf2ib"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook’s whistleblower report confirms what researchers have known for years","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712927/facebook-instagram-teen-mental-health-research"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="m1AnHU"&gt;This group of attorneys general isn’t the only one taking action against Meta — Ohio’s attorney general is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785206/ohio-suing-facebook-instagram-meta-misled-investors-children"&gt;suing the state separately&lt;/a&gt;, accusing the company of misleading the public about its products’ effects on children. Meta said the suit was “without merit” and has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/26/22695629/facebook-says-instagram-is-not-toxic-for-teens-despite-damning-wsj-report"&gt;largely pushed back against the reports&lt;/a&gt; from outlets like the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, saying that the research published lacked context.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="usv4Ak"&gt;Some of the attorneys general involved in the investigation announced on Thursday were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428710/facebook-instagram-children-under-13-attorney-general-letter-data-collection-coppa"&gt;involved in an effort earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; to convince Meta — then Facebook — to stop working on an Instagram for kids. The company had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338911/facebook-instagram-kids-privacy-coppa"&gt;previously announced its goal&lt;/a&gt; of making a version of the social network for people younger than 13 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696039/facebook-instagram-kids-app-pause-development-criticism"&gt;would later say&lt;/a&gt; it was “pausing” work on it. Senate and House lawmakers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696698/facebook-instagram-for-kids-mosseri-markey-blumenthal-blackburn-pause"&gt;have called the pause&lt;/a&gt; “insufficient,” arguing that the company had “completely forfeited the benefit of the doubt when it comes to protecting young people online, and it must completely abandon” the project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LgzxRs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Meta is concerned about young people not using its products&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7waulI"&gt;The company has made it clear that it wants to focus on the younger generation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22743744/facebook-teen-usage-decline-frances-haugen-leaks"&gt;amid internal concerns&lt;/a&gt; that it’s struggling to attract and keep the attention of teens and 20-somethings. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/25/22745622/facebook-young-adults-refocusing-teams"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg himself said&lt;/a&gt; in October that he wanted “serving young adults” to be some teams’ “north star.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uv7iuw"&gt;Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who is co-leading the investigative effort with Nebraska’s AG, said in a press release that Meta “failed to protect young people on its platforms and instead chose to ignore or, in some cases, double down on known manipulations that pose a real threat to physical and mental health — exploiting children in the interest of profit.” She vowed that the coalition would “get to the bottom of this company’s engagement with young users, identify any unlawful practices, and end these abuses for good.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Exxon’s new Gulf of Mexico leases aren’t what they seem</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Offshore Drilling Slowly Emerging From Downturn" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LlBfwlrQgx830PIOk8U4OXmZ4Y4=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70162240/1232462664.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An offshore oil well platform in the Gulf of Mexico off Grand Isle, Louisiana, U.S., on Wednesday, April 21, 2021.&amp;nbsp; | Luke Sharrett/Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F7ttME"&gt;ExxonMobil’s &lt;a href="https://www.energyintel.com/0000017d-2f96-defa-ab7d-6fbf0ac90000"&gt;spending spree&lt;/a&gt; during yesterday’s lease sale in the Gulf of Mexico was significant, experts say, because the company might use the area for something other than oil and gas extraction. Experts outside the company speculate that ExxonMobil wants to use Gulf waters for a novel purpose: sequestering captured carbon dioxide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GEgMko"&gt;The Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.boem.gov/newsroom/press-releases/gulf-mexico-lease-sale-results-announced"&gt;auctioned off&lt;/a&gt; vast tracts of the Gulf of Mexico to oil and gas companies yesterday in one of the &lt;a href="https://subscriber.politicopro.com/article/eenews/2021/11/17/massive-gulf-of-mexico-oil-lease-sale-draws-192-million-283335"&gt;largest federal lease sales in recent years&lt;/a&gt;. The sale drew sharp criticism from environmental groups, which say that allowing new oil and gas development is incompatible with America meeting its climate goals. But it’s possible that Exxon — the biggest bidder in yesterday’s sale — isn’t planning on extracting new fossil fuels at all. The company surprised analysts by bidding on almost 100 leases in shallow waters close to shore where fossil fuel reserves are pretty depleted. That likely means that Exxon plans to repurpose old oil and gas wells for carbon storage, or find new places in the area to pump captured CO2 underground, experts tell &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kuekRi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“There’s just not enough oil to make the bang for the buck worth it”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0Gdfx"&gt;“There’s just not enough oil to make the bang for the buck worth it for them,” says Brian Snyder, an assistant professor of environmental sciences at Louisiana State University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dkTEMa"&gt;William Turner, a lead analyst at energy research firm Rystad Energy, agreed, calling the lease areas “the equivalent of [Exxon] buying up a kind of mom and pop operation.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u2GZzN"&gt;“This has to be for something other than oil and gas exploration,” Turner says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="649TEk"&gt;ExxonMobil has yet to confirm or deny the speculation. In an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a spokesperson for the company said Exxon would “evaluate the seismic and subsurface geology for future commercial potential.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8wrDKj"&gt;If experts’ hunches are right, this would likely mark the first time that the government has leased federal waters for carbon sequestration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dUI712"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This would likely mark the first time that the government has leased federal waters for carbon sequestration&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QdEdtv"&gt;Fossil fuel companies have sold carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) as a way to minimize the harm they do to the planet. The strategy entails using new technologies to scrub planet-heating CO2 out of smokestack emissions. The captured carbon dioxide then needs to be transported via pipelines to places where it can be stored underground. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGALPE"&gt;The Gulf of Mexico’s seafloor could become a hotspot for carbon sequestration because of its proximity to a lot of heavy industry and existing oil and gas infrastructure. Experts have suggested captured CO2 might be pumped into old oil and gas fields in the Gulf or injected &lt;a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2015WR017609"&gt;into saline aquifers&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d7krvc"&gt;ExxonMobil has &lt;a href="https://energyfactor.exxonmobil.com/reducing-emissions/carbon-capture-and-storage/putting-houstons-carbon-capture-and-storage-potential-into-perspective/"&gt;called&lt;/a&gt; CCS part of its “ongoing efforts to reduce emissions.”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;This year, the company announced plans to turn the &lt;a href="https://energyfactor.exxonmobil.com/reducing-emissions/carbon-capture-and-storage/putting-houstons-carbon-capture-and-storage-potential-into-perspective/"&gt;Houston Ship Channel&lt;/a&gt; into a sort of hub for CCS. The channel connects Houston to the Gulf of Mexico and is lined with petrochemical plants and other heavy industries. The plan could entail pairing those plants with CO2 scrubbers, and then piping the captured carbon dioxide out to the Gulf. By 2040, the hub could capture up to 100 million metric tons of CO2 a year, Exxon says. Such an effort would require a joint investment from industry and government, according to ExxonMobil — to the tune of &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/climate-technology-business-paris-f76df7ee4e6a8a4b6bab96badb2eb41a"&gt;$100 billion&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRHuZH"&gt;High costs like this have historically been a prohibiting factor with carbon capture projects; they’re what &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-only-carbon-capture-plant-in-the-u-s-just-closed-1846177778"&gt;closed&lt;/a&gt; the only coal plant outfitted with CCS in the US. But some new funding could become available through the bipartisan infrastructure bill that Joe Biden signed into law this week, which includes billions of dollars of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22606395/pipeline-battle-co2-removal-carbon-capture-bipartisan-infrastructure"&gt;investments in carbon capture and removal technologies and pipelines&lt;/a&gt; with a focus on so-called ‘hard-to-decarbonize’ industries like cement and fertilizer production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5XLsvN"&gt;Many people are, unsurprisingly, wary of fossil fuel companies’ claims about CCS. Environmentalists and progressive lawmakers have called CCS a “false solution” for climate change, saying that it could derail a transition to renewable energy and keep the economy dependent on oil and gas. Scientists agree that greenhouse gas emissions need to &lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/chapter/spm/"&gt;essentially disappear by the middle of the century&lt;/a&gt; in order to avoid catastrophic climate change, and that can only be achieved by weaning economies off fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qoAH2Y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This industry has seen the Gulf as its own personal sewer”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w7Ne2c"&gt;“This industry has seen the Gulf as its own personal sewer for a long time, so the idea that they would turn to the Gulf for this project is unsurprising,” says Carroll Muffett, president and CEO of the nonprofit Center for International Environmental Law. “It’s also unacceptable because the risks of carbon capture and storage are significant,” he says. He’s worried about how construction and potential ruptures of new CO2 pipelines might affect Gulf Coast communities. High concentrations of carbon dioxide, if it leaks out of pipelines or storage wells, can be an asphyxiant to people and wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fcqxey"&gt;Another concern with CCS is that it has traditionally been used by the oil and gas industry for what’s called “enhanced oil recovery” (EOR). Basically, fossil fuel companies shoot the captured CO2 underground to push out hard-to-reach oil reserves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ye8X49"&gt;“That would be my concern, that Exxon is actually doing this not just for storage, but for EOR,” Snyder says. “My guess is they’re actually doing a little of both.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5YuFt"&gt;The Biden administration has already faced a lot of criticism for selling federal water leases to oil and gas companies just days after calling on all nations to slash greenhouse gas emissions during a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/13/22778646/glasgow-global-climate-summit-cop26-adaptation-finance-loss-damage"&gt;United Nations climate summit&lt;/a&gt; in Glasgow. The lease sale was set in motion by the Trump administration, and a Trump-appointed federal judge &lt;a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/biden-climate-gulf-oil-lease-sale_n_618eeb77e4b0b1aee9252872"&gt;blocked&lt;/a&gt; an executive order by Biden earlier this year to suspend new oil and gas leases. Still, environmentalists argue that Biden could have done more to stop yesterday’s sale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2WUBIV"&gt;But while the Biden administration might not have wanted to hold the lease sale, if ExxonMobil is in fact planning to store captured CO2 in the Gulf, that could change the administration’s calculus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qFMQfl"&gt;“You could hypothesize with this, that maybe this gets the attention of the administration to say ‘Okay, maybe we need to rethink completely shutting down new leasing,’” Turner says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6sozh5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford and GM are getting into chip development to help deal with the shortage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZVu_JcHnv0gpmlVrlYWqh7NAB4o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70162223/acastro_200406_1777_ford_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vMbtLf"&gt;A year into the computer chip shortage that’s heavily affecting vehicle production, Ford announced a collaboration with chipmaker GlobalFoundries Inc., as &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ford-enters-semiconductor-business-amid-chip-shortage-impact-11637242202?mod=djemalertNEWS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; first reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9xEP7"&gt;Ford’s &lt;a href="https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2021/11/18/globalfoundries-ford-auto-chip-supply.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; about the non-binding agreement is light on specifics but mentions plans “to advance semiconductor manufacturing and technology development within the United States.” Without committing to building any plants, the two companies say they will “explore expanded semiconductor manufacturing opportunities to support the automotive industry.” Speaking during an event later in the day, GM CEO Mark Reuss &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/gm-will-co-develop-chips-with-several-producers-to-secure-supply?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;said his company is working to co-develop new chips&lt;/a&gt; with many semiconductor partners like Qualcomm, TSMC, and others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zS4TaF"&gt;Ford’s VP of vehicle embedded software and controls, Chuck Gray, told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; that “[we] feel like we can really boost our product performance and our tech independence at the same time.” GlobalFoundries spun off from AMD in 2009, eventually becoming the world’s fourth-largest semiconductor manufacturer, behind TSMC, Samsung, and UMC, &lt;a href="https://www.trendforce.com/presscenter/news/20210831-10914.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;TrendForce&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It manufactures chips for other companies like AMD, Qualcomm, and even Samsung. The company went public last month, and its CEO said at the time that its chip supply &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/30/globalfoundries-ceo-were-sold-out-of-semiconductor-chip-capacity-through-2023.html"&gt;is sold out through 2023&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="LGt8ah"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it’s about time for us to catch up”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ak2QYL"&gt;The car industry’s demand for chips has risen in recent years to accommodate new technology in vehicles. However, many rely on older, cheaper technology and make smaller orders than a company like Apple or Nvidia. Throw in pandemic-related supply chain issues and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-19/renesas-aims-to-resume-full-production-at-fire-hit-plant-in-may"&gt;a fire at a key plant&lt;/a&gt;, and you have a situation that could last for years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="sqz4Bv"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The chip shortage will likely get worse before it gets better ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547826/chip-shortage-cars-playstation-5-gpus-semiconductors-time-foundaries-tsmc"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="OTxKGq"&gt;After announcing the electric F-150 in May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22444294/ford-f150-lightning-pickup-truck-jim-farley-interview"&gt;Ford CEO Jim Farley told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that its plan to address the chip shortage involved going direct, and now we’re seeing what that looks like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="25GmDM"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s a big push from a number of chip makers and foundries to &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/23/22347250/intel-new-factories-arizona-20-billion-chips-outsourcing-foundry-services-manufacturing"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;do the manufacturing in the United States&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;, to get various incentives from the administration to support that investment. All of that still looks like 10 years out. How do you solve the chip shortage today? Do you just wait it out, or are there steps you can take?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fama0h"&gt;Well, there’s certainly things we can do. For single-source content, like the &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-19/renesas-aims-to-resume-full-production-at-fire-hit-plant-in-may"&gt;Renesas Naka facility that had a fire&lt;/a&gt;, those single-sourced chips, we can run some buffer stocks. Which is not ideal. It’s kind of a waste, but it’s better than running out of what we have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2D4w9P"&gt;The other thing we can do is to give the foundries more confidence in future production by going direct with them. So on behalf of our supply base, actually going and contracting purchases. I think boots on the ground in places like Taiwan and China and Asia are going to be more important for us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GEJ4ax"&gt;I think there’s certainly things we can do to make it better. We are starting to see some confidence in the second half of this year, but when I talk to my colleagues at Cisco, and Dell, and other companies, they run the supply chain totally different than automotive. And it’s about time for us to catch up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wGYT5w"&gt;He also mentioned that the plans to help build company autonomy mean bringing in “real expertise on silicon and chip design.” Having software and chip design knowledge in-house is helpful if you’re like Tesla and decide to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595060/tesla-chip-shortage-software-rewriting-ev-processor"&gt;rewrite your vehicle software to work on the chips that are available&lt;/a&gt;. In today’s announcement, Farley says, “This agreement is just the beginning and a key part of our plan to vertically integrate key technologies and capabilities that will differentiate Ford far into the future.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hsTWPP"&gt;In February, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266483/ford-f150-production-slowdown-semiconductor-chip-shortage"&gt;F-150 was hit hard&lt;/a&gt; by the global chip shortage as it reportedly cut production of Ford’s most popular vehicle in half. Several of Ford’s North American plants shut down at times this year as a result of the shortages. The effects have been felt across the industry similarly, with plant shutdowns and the removal of features like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787339/chevrolet-trucks-heated-seats-2022-models-chip-shortage-supply-chain-issues"&gt;heated seats in Chevy trucks&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765709/bmw-chip-shortage-touchscreen-car-suv-manufacturing"&gt;touchscreens in BMWs&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/13/22780037/tesla-reportedly-shipping-cars-without-usb-ports"&gt;USB ports in some Teslas&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook tests giving more control of News Feed content to users again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_3w85LD2qXZ9T50PgnOGyO-gY1M=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70162060/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook is switching up the News Feed again | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r65vn8"&gt;Facebook parent company Meta said it &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/introducing-more-control-for-brands-and-people-in-feed"&gt;is testing new ways&lt;/a&gt; for users to customize the content they see in their News Feeds. The company said in a &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/introducing-more-control-for-brands-and-people-in-feed"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; post Thursday that the test, available to a “small percentage” of users to start, would allow people to adjust their preferences to increase or reduce the amount of content they see from specific friends, family, groups, and pages they’re connected with on the platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yRwSDZ"&gt;Facebook has tweaked the way the News Feed presents content numerous times in the past several years and seems to keep rethinking what content should be prioritized and why. In 2015, it said it was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/21/8463051/facebook-algorithm-changes-publishers-newsfeed"&gt;changing News Feeds&lt;/a&gt; to favor content from close friends over that from brands and publishers. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/29/12055124/facebook-news-feed-algorithm-changes"&gt;2016, Facebook said again&lt;/a&gt; it would adjust its algorithm so posts from friends would get priority over publishers. Then in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/11/16881102/facebook-news-feed-changes-meaningful-interactions"&gt;2018, the company said it was changing the News Feed&lt;/a&gt; so posts that might spark “back and forth discussion” (aka engagement, which is Facebook’s bread-and-butter) would be more likely to appear than more passive content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WSds8g"&gt;Guess what Facebook did in 2020? Well, a few things, but also it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612728/facebook-news-feed-us-election-change-mainstream-news-misinformation"&gt;tweaked the News Feed yet again&lt;/a&gt;, this time to favor more trustworthy and quality news sources. It &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22180259/facebook-news-feed-change-post-election-publishers-misinformation"&gt;rolled back that “nicer” version&lt;/a&gt; of the News Feed in December 2020 to the reported chagrin of some Facebook employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FsJ6ZD"&gt;How the social media giant controls its News Feed has largely been a mystery, but Facebook &lt;a href="https://transparency.fb.com/en-gb/features/approach-to-ranking/types-of-content-we-demote/"&gt;released a report in September&lt;/a&gt; it said would give the public some insights into how it decides what content it suppresses, or “demotes” — like clickbait and posts from those who repeatedly violate its rules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="VHUa9W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Meta goes into lockdown","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785397/meta-facebook-leak-lockdown"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="1hH2JX"&gt;But now users in the new test will be able to turn down the volume on friends, family, pages, and groups in their News Feeds if they prefer. Meta said in the blog post that this was “part of our ongoing work to give people more control over News Feed, so they see more of what they want and less of what they don’t.” Sounds great! Again!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AGPGfu"&gt;Facebook is also going to make changes to news controls for its business customers, expanding the “topic exclusion” controls to a test group of advertisers that run ads in English. The advertisers can select from three topic groups — news and politics, social issues, and crime and tragedy— so that they can prevent their ads from appearing near posts about those topics if they prefer. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Xbox boss Phil Spencer tells staff he’s ‘deeply troubled’ by Activision Blizzard</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KmsLmMhGKc-jEKiyObxwrA6ClHQ=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70161475/vpavic_070616_1091_0165.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cnwmiN"&gt;Following &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785457/activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-ceo-wall-street-journal-wsj-report-allegations"&gt;a bombshell &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; that Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick allegedly knew, withheld, and even participated in harassment and abusive behavior, the company’s big console partners Sony and Microsoft are semi-privately expressing their distress. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/xbox-chief-says-he-s-evaluating-relationship-with-activision?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; is now reporting&lt;/a&gt; that Microsoft boss Phil Spencer has now told staff he was “disturbed and deeply troubled by the horrific events and actions” at Activision Blizzard and that Microsoft is “evaluating all aspects of our relationship with Activision Blizzard and making ongoing proactive adjustments” as a result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hToAgA"&gt;“The &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report is accurate,” a Microsoft spokesperson tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge. &lt;/em&gt;Microsoft also shared a generic, completely unrelated statement about how Microsoft wants a “welcoming and inclusive environment for all of our employees at Xbox.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2HFV3l"&gt;Yesterday, Sony PlayStation boss Jim Ryan similarly told employees that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787848/playstation-boss-jim-ryan-calls-out-activision-blizzard-staff-memo"&gt;the company had expressed “deep concern” with Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;, adding that “[we] do not believe their statements of response properly address the situation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AliP1c"&gt;These private statements from Sony and Microsoft obviously don’t carry anywhere near the same weight as if these companies &lt;em&gt;publicly&lt;/em&gt; called out the situation at Activision Blizzard, and it’s not clear if either company is interested in taking any concrete actions yet. Activision Blizzard is one of the most powerful publishers in the video game industry, and both console makers rely on them to provide new big-budget games for their consoles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zhf8mN"&gt;That said, Microsoft and Sony also want to be seen as committed to a less toxic video game industry, and Phil Spencer, in particular, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612620/phil-spencer-console-wars-tribalism-xbox-playstation-ps5-sony-microsoft"&gt;has made combating toxicity&lt;/a&gt; part of his public brand. “This type of behavior has no place in our industry,” reads part of Spencer’s new memo about Activision Blizzard, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

We are committed to the work of ensuring our culture and workplace are safe, diverse, and inclusive. We know it will take time, but we will not stop until we have the best workplace for our team.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tOoaPC"&gt;While over 1,000 Activision Blizzard employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/18/22789679/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-employees-petition-removal"&gt;have signed a petition&lt;/a&gt; to remove CEO Bobby Kotick from the company, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787484/activision-blizzard-shareholders-demand-ceo-bobby-kotick-resignation"&gt;some shareholders have demanded his resignation&lt;/a&gt;, the board of directors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785776/activision-blizzard-board-statement-ceo-bobby-kotick"&gt;has so far signaled&lt;/a&gt; they’re confident in his leadership. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jkUftR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;[Disclosure: Casey Wasserman is on the board of directors for Activision Blizzard as well as the board of directors of Vox Media, The Verge’s parent company.]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 and Xbox Series X will be available today for Walmart Plus subscribers (update: sold out)</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Nho8s5uCOy5uvd4DMAQYwopaaTo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70161313/acastro_210511_1777_psRestock_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1SWZhK"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update November 18th, 3:55PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart has sold out of both PlayStation 5 consoles and the Xbox Series X. We’ll be sure to keep you updated when we hear of another round of free or paywalled restocks.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2X3Md"&gt;Console restocks are getting more and more frequent these days — particularly as the Black Friday season heats up and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22759214/black-friday-early-deals-best-headphones-laptops-gaming-tvs-tech-sale"&gt;early Black Friday deals continue to roll out&lt;/a&gt; — but retailers have been quick to cull the herd of potential customers by putting some stock behind paid subscription services. Walmart has a next-gen console restock happening today at 3PM ET / 12PM PT, though, it’s exclusive to &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fplus&amp;amp;subid1=consolerestocks111821" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart Plus paid subscribers&lt;/a&gt;. You can queue up to purchase a disc-based &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Video-Game-Console%2F165545420&amp;amp;subid1=consolerestocks111821" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; for $500, a &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSony-PlayStation-5-Digital-Edition-Video-Game-Consoles%2F987823383&amp;amp;subid1=consolerestocks111821" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation 5 Digital Edition&lt;/a&gt; for $400, or an &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FXbox-Series-X%2F443574645&amp;amp;subid1=consolerestocks111821" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; console for $500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dy2drl"&gt;Be sure to log into your Walmart Plus account ahead of time, and it’s always a good practice to save your billing and shipping in your account ahead of time. Note that &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fplus&amp;amp;subid1=consolerestocks111821" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;you’ll need to be a paid subscriber to Walmart Plus&lt;/a&gt; for a chance to buy any of these three consoles, as a free trial account will not be accepted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SzNxrV"&gt;A Walmart Plus subscription costs $13 per month or $98 per year and promises early and special access to deals — such as console restocks like this one and a four-hour early window on Black Friday deals. It also includes free shipping options akin to competitors like Amazon Prime.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>US government seizes $56 million in crypto from BitConnect’s ‘number one promoter’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q5YLZmM_7qt08JIU4Ahc_WYLBE0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70161152/jbareham_180313_1777__bitcoin_cryptocurrency_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DrIyot"&gt;The US government &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/56-million-seized-cryptocurrency-being-sold-first-step-compensate-victims-bitconnect-fraud"&gt;has seized $56 million worth of cryptocurrency&lt;/a&gt; from an admitted participant in the BitConnect scam and intends to sell the coins and use the proceeds to reimburse victims. The Department of Justice says that it’s the largest recovery of cryptocurrency to date — and that it was willingly given up by Los Angeles resident Glenn Arcaro, who has called himself BitConnect’s “number one promoter.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D8271A"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-172"&gt;According to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)&lt;/a&gt;, BitConnect convinced people to invest a total of $2 billion by telling them that it had a bot capable of generating incredibly high rates of return from crypto trading. In other words, BitConnect sold itself as a way for people to easily invest in cryptocurrency and to make a lot of money doing so, at a time when people were hearing a lot about crypto but didn’t know much about it (around 2016 through 2018). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PN6nfG"&gt;In reality, &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdca/pr/director-and-promoter-bitconnect-pleads-guilty-global-2-billion-cryptocurrency-scheme"&gt;the DOJ says it was all a scam&lt;/a&gt; — BitConnect used money from new investors to pay old ones (otherwise known as a Ponzi scheme), and its advocates built pyramid schemes where they would get a cut for convincing others to invest by promising them the same deal. In September, Arcaro pleaded guilty to participating in both parts of the scam while allegedly posting videos online to make fun of BitConnect doubters. He said that he had earned what was then valued at $24 million by his participation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BoZLi3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lCcwn6bGUtU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EF6m5k"&gt;Some may also remember BitConnect from &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lCcwn6bGUtU"&gt;a heavily memed presentation&lt;/a&gt; given by one of its investors, who repeatedly shouted “BitConneeeeeect” and said that his wife accused him of falling for a scam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="glDuls"&gt;While BitConnect &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2021/comp-pr2021-172.pdf"&gt;largely traded in Bitcoin&lt;/a&gt; (victims would buy BitConnect’s own BCC tokens using Bitcoin and could ostensibly convert BCC back into Bitcoin through a convoluted process), the government plans to reimburse victims in USD. The DOJ’s press release says that the law enforcement arm of the US Postal Service will be helping convert the crypto to fiat currency. The government &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdca/us-v-glenn-arcaro-21cr02542-twr"&gt;has set up a website for victims&lt;/a&gt; who are looking for compensation after the court sentences Arcaro in January 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Over 1,000 Activision Blizzard employees petition to remove CEO Bobby Kotick </title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TE5Cng"&gt;Over 1,000 employees and contractors at Activision Blizzard have now &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/e/2PACX-1vSbxdA-egrhAK6TcydVcrTqQDDjU7QE4j4jpjwCO2pUIYFmtTjLksl7EBALc8O_Jla2qT1Oy0H5zn66/pub"&gt;signed and published a petition&lt;/a&gt; to remove CEO Bobby Kotick from the company, doubling the number of signatures since the petition was made public. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="XCMZne"&gt;“We, the undersigned, no longer have confidence in the leadership of Bobby Kotick as the CEO of Activision Blizzard. The information that has come to light about his behaviors and practices in the running of our companies runs counter to the culture and integrity we require of our leadership—and directly conflicts with the initiatives started by our peers. We ask that Bobby Kotick remove himself as CEO of Activision Blizzard, and that shareholders be allowed to select the new CEO without the input of Bobby, who we are aware owns a substantial portion of the voting rights of the shareholders.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="dc9ehl"&gt;In a surprising move, the petition goes on to list the names, titles, and departments of the workers, which could potentially expose the signatories to retaliation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmDoy6"&gt;The petition comes days after a bombshell report alleging Kotick knew about, enabled, and even participated in a culture of misconduct and harassment that has drawn the attention of government authorities. In response, the company’s board of directors issued a statement saying it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785776/activision-blizzard-board-statement-ceo-bobby-kotick"&gt;continue to support Kotick&lt;/a&gt;, even as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/17/22787484/activision-blizzard-shareholders-demand-ceo-bobby-kotick-resignation"&gt;a small group of shareholders demanded his removal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XgqnBJ"&gt;This petition is the latest development in a series of worker-led actions against the company, which now includes two walkouts and the formation of an employee advocacy group, A Better ABK. Since we first published this story, A Better ABK has shared a link to a &lt;a href="https://www.change.org/p/bobby-kotick-remove-bobby-kotick-from-activision-blizzard"&gt;second petition&lt;/a&gt; to remove Kotick that it is asking supporters to sign. As of this writing, it has more than 2,600 signatures.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple employees will return to offices February 1st in a hybrid work pilot</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cmtF4x"&gt;Apple employees will return to offices starting February 1st as part of a hybrid work pilot and will be able to work remotely for four weeks a year. First reported by &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/apple-sets-feb-1-for-return-to-office"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, employees learned of the news Thursday via an internal memo from CEO Tim Cook. The company had previously offered two weeks of remote work per year but added two more weeks to give “more opportunity to travel, be closer to your loved ones, or simply shake up your routines,” Cook’s memo said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fPbyzN"&gt;The pilot will start workers at one or two days in the office, then in March, workers will come to the office to work on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. They’ll be able to work from home on Wednesdays and Fridays. &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/apple-pushes-back-return-office-plan-february-rcna6026"&gt;Some employees may be asked&lt;/a&gt; to come into the office four or five days a week if their roles require more time in the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QyCOxO"&gt;Cook first announced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22465846/apple-employees-return-office-three-days-week-september"&gt;hybrid work model in June&lt;/a&gt;, when the company was planning a September return to offices that was moved back to October, then January, and now, to February. Some Apple employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22491629/apple-employees-push-back-return-office-internal-letter-tim-cook"&gt;pushed back strongly against the hybrid model&lt;/a&gt;, writing in an internal letter to Cook that they wanted a more flexible policy that allowed anyone who wanted to work from home to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gzcW1d"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately reply to a request from &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;for more details on the company’s office return. Following widespread closures of Apple stores during the height of the pandemic in 2020, the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307723/apple-stores-reopened-us-retail-open"&gt;reopened its retail stores&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, with mask requirements in place. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly wants to launch a self-driving EV in 2025 with a custom chip</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3FVtbo2763oZyprM7_3rrzX2D04=/0x1:2040x1361/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70160939/acstro_190902_apple_event_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="R7XrPj"&gt;Apple has completed “much of the core work” on a new processor meant to power its secretive autonomous electric car project known as Titan, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-11-18/apple-accelerates-work-on-car-aims-for-fully-autonomous-vehicle?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s &lt;/em&gt;Mark Gurman reports&lt;/a&gt;. The milestone comes as Apple is reportedly now accelerating its timeline for the autonomous car it’s developing, with a new target of launching it in just four years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ynw50V"&gt;Apple’s own silicon team designed the chip, which Gurman says is the “most advanced component” that’s been developed for the project so far. The company is apparently getting ready to put the chip through its real-world paces in its fleet of test vehicles in California and hopes to make a vehicle with “stronger safeguards than what’s available from Tesla and Waymo,” according to the report. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fz0Qx5"&gt;The goal now for Project Titan, after multiple pivots, is to create an autonomous car that does not have a steering wheel. The interior would be spacious and look more like the limousine-style seating arrangement that EV startup Canoo has promoted in its electric van prototypes. Apple was at one point in talks to acquire Canoo, as &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev"&gt;reported earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528448/apple-ulrich-kranz-canoo-bmw-electric-car-autonomous"&gt;recently hired one of the startup’s co-founders&lt;/a&gt;. There would be a large, iPad-style touchscreen display that will run a user interface similar to iOS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPgvES"&gt;The business model is reportedly still undecided, though. Apple has considered trying to create a self-driving fleet to compete with Uber, Lyft, and Waymo (something Tesla has proposed but is still very far from executing), but Gurman reports that the “more likely scenario” is that Apple will sell the cars to individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZlkdE"&gt;On the electric vehicle side of things, Apple is reportedly not looking to develop a proprietary charging cable for the car. Instead, it wants to make the vehicle compatible with the “combined charging system,” or CCS standard, which would make it possible to charge the vehicle at most public fast charging stations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ib1zFC"&gt;Of course, all of this comes after years of reported changes to the project, which was started in 2014. Five different executives have run Project Titan after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22665353/apple-watch-kevin-lync-project-titan-electric-car"&gt;Apple Watch lead Kevin Lynch took over earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. The refocusing and timeline shift reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; could be a sign that there’s real progress being made with him at the helm, or it could just become the newest footnote in whatever the project turns into next.&lt;/p&gt;
