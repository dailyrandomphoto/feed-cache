    <title>I want to taste an AI-designed flavor</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ehZjvN"&gt;When I cook, I typically just Google a recipe or try one out on the fly. But in the future, it’s possible artificial intelligence might help me concoct a meal or assist a chef as they write their next cookbook or design a menu. In today’s&lt;em&gt; Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; AI episode, we explore the world of AI product design — how far could AI go in helping humans design smells and tastes? For that discussion, we chat with Frederik Duerinck, the founder of ScentTronix, which is part software, part hardware and attempts to make customizable perfumes based on individual people. We also talk to Michael Spranger, COO at Sony AI, about how Sony is helping chefs design recipes and maximize flavor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KIave"&gt;Finally, we take it a step further and ask whether it’s even possible for a computer to eventually smell and taste. We all get to learn about e-noses together! Saket Navlakha, an associate professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, guides us through the world of algorithms, AI, and scent. (Thank fruit flies for his work.) Check out the episode below, and stay tuned to &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast &lt;/em&gt;every week for all the tech talk you need to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google just announced its Pixel 6 event on October 19th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/r5q_XRYIrOhRh-m9VKCQOXBikQY=/536x0:3761x2150/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69954788/FA8qbJ0VQAsbGif.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qW1dRE"&gt;Google traditionally holds an October hardware event to reveal its new Pixel phones. This year, it already announced them — here’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;. But the company clearly hasn’t said &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; it wants to say publicly quite yet, because &lt;a href="https://pixelevent.withgoogle.com/"&gt;it just announced a virtual event for October 19th at 1PM ET / 10AM PT&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBce9g"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OWYrKO"&gt;On October 19, we’re officially introducing you to Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro—the completely reimagined Google phones. Powered by Tensor, Google’s first custom mobile chip, they’re fast, smart and secure. And they adapt to you. #Pixel6Launch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OmPZaA"&gt;And though Google got out ahead of some of the leaks this year with its early Pixel announcements, there’s still a lot we don’t know about the Pixel 6 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686534/google-pixel-6-pro-leak-display-screen-video"&gt;the Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, such as when they might arrive. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664341/google-pixel-6-real-world-photos-october-19th-launch-date-rumor"&gt;Perhaps October 19th&lt;/a&gt;?) We’re intrigued by what we’ve heard &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676099/google-pixel-6-tensor-processor-rumor-arm-cortex-x1-core-mystery-strange"&gt;about the Pixel 6’s Tensor processor&lt;/a&gt;, which undoubtedly deserves some sort of deep dive, and we’re still waiting to hear if &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;Google’s first folding-screen Pixel&lt;/a&gt; will see its rumored 2021 reveal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nrt8U6"&gt;Plus, of course, we’re still waiting for Google to formally announce when it’ll release Android 12. We’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;already reviewed the update&lt;/a&gt;, of course, but Google was only willing to say that a push to Pixel devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708992/android-12-aosp-available-download-install"&gt;will begin in the “next few weeks.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="UL7spL"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"This is the Pixel 6","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"},{"title":"Google Pixel 5A review: boring, but better than ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"},{"title":"Android 12 review: it’s mostly about the looks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"},{"title":"Google Pixel 6 teaser gives first real-world look at the upcoming phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22664341/google-pixel-6-real-world-photos-october-19th-launch-date-rumor"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0Xz6JM"&gt;We’re having quite a run of big gadget events this fall, having just finished &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22663657/apple-iphone-13-pro-ipad-mini-watch-event-biggest-announcements"&gt;Apple’s September iPhone 13 and iPad event&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22684950/microsoft-surface-event-biggest-announcements-pro-8-duo-studio-laptop"&gt;Microsoft’s Surface Pro 8 and Laptop Studio event&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22692147/amazon-devices-event-echo-ring-biggest-announcements"&gt;Amazon fall hardware event last week&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6uhr6I"&gt;We’ll have coverage of the Google event (according to the invite, we can expect a “pre-recorded livestream”) this October as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch icon Nickmercs isn’t going anywhere</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/awstVsr8sDn7Pu90inZzKP77unc=/0x0:8256x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69954742/FaZe_NICKMERCS___Main_Press_Photo_1___Credit_Jeffrey_Cleary.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;FaZe Clan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5iTmXG"&gt;Nick “Nickmercs” Kolcheff, one of the biggest streamers on Twitch, has signed a deal to continue streaming exclusively on the Amazon-owned streaming platform. The deal locks down one of Twitch’s most important creators for the foreseeable future, and it comes at a particularly important time, since Twitch lost two major streamers to YouTube Gaming in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8moJg"&gt;Just to give you an idea of just how big Kolcheff is, the &lt;a href="https://twitchtracker.com/subscribers"&gt;unofficial metrics site TwitchTracker&lt;/a&gt; says he has more than 28,000 subscribers, making him one of the most-subscribed streamers on the platform. If he had been convinced to stream on another site, it would have been a big blow for Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W6z5MJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;THE SHOW GOES ON! &lt;a href="https://t.co/SE93iSIFe0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/SE93iSIFe0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FaZe Nickmercs (@NICKMERCS) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NICKMERCS/status/1445426865565483011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nhx0fx"&gt;The streaming talent wars kicked off in August 2019, when Tyler “Ninja” Blevins defected &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20750393/ninja-mixer-exclusive-twitch-fortnite-streaming-gaming-announcement"&gt;from Twitch&lt;/a&gt; to the Microsoft-owned streaming platform Mixer. That led to an intense period of streamer shuffling as some of the biggest players signed exclusive deals with Twitch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20932354/shroud-twitch-mixer-channel-search-hide"&gt;Mixer&lt;/a&gt;, and other platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948315/twitch-jack-courage-dunlop-youtube-live-exclusive-deal-fortnite-100-thieves"&gt;YouTube Gaming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20977702/disguisedtoast-twitch-facebook-gaming-hearthstone-teamfight-tactics-jeremy-wang"&gt;Facebook Gaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Db7bo"&gt;While the deal-making has cooled as of late (in part because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299032/microsoft-mixer-closing-facebook-gaming-partnership-xcloud-features"&gt;Microsoft shut down Mixer&lt;/a&gt;, removing an entire streaming platform from the market) in recent weeks, the ecosystem has shown signs of shifting again. In September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22643215/drlupo-move-from-twitch-youtube-gaming-exclusivity-deal"&gt;Ben “DrLupo” Lupo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timthetatman/status/1433096643121909766"&gt;Tim “TimTheTatman” Betar&lt;/a&gt; announced exclusive streaming deals with YouTube Gaming within days of each other — and nearly two years after they had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21004943/twitch-timthetatman-drlupo-lirik-exclusive-deal-sign"&gt;signed deals&lt;/a&gt; with Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NfP7zv"&gt;In response to an emailed question about whether or not he considered switching from Twitch, Kolcheff said “yes and no,” and highlighted how he produces content on other platforms every day. “That said, there is currently nothing like streaming on Twitch,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7V7zo"&gt;Terms weren’t disclosed for Kolcheff’s new Twitch deal. But I’d guess that Twitch may have dug deep into its coffers to entice him to stick around.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is getting rid of IGTV, sort of</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ikGjvnlzHqgKzQt23gnO4PYzVso=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69954505/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hKSX8b"&gt;Instagram is finally acknowledging that IGTV, its first big push into video, didn’t pan out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58ivKh"&gt;Today, the company is rebranding IGTV as “Instagram TV,” and it’s getting rid of the exclusive IGTV video format. Videos posted to the main Instagram feed can now run up to 60 minutes long — a length previously reserved for IGTV videos — and you’ll no longer have to leave the main app to view them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUy9lK"&gt;A spokesperson for Instagram says the IGTV app, now called the Instagram TV app, will remain as a “destination for people to visit with the intent of watching video.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AgHQaud6HLT7XcEvWAhYou5fSlA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902533/244367723_884783532474523_6124902347763306887_n.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Feed videos and IGTV videos will be consolidated into Instagram TV, which will get a single tab on profile pages. Reels will remain discrete.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rQcpkI"&gt;IGTV was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17484436/instagram-igtv-video-app-launch"&gt;introduced in June 2018&lt;/a&gt; and was essentially meant to become a mobile equivalent to YouTube, creating a space to discover and watch longer videos. But the longer format never caught on. And just two months later, an app called TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17644260/musically-rebrand-tiktok-bytedance-douyin"&gt;launched in the US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dcap6T"&gt;Instagram has since refocused its video efforts on rivaling TikTok with its short video format Reels. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;Reels launched in August 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and Instagram has aggressively pushed forward with them, giving them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21561099/instagram-reels-shopping-home-screen-tab-update"&gt;a central spot in the app’s navigation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22537297/instagram-reels-ads-launch-globally"&gt;starting to sell ads&lt;/a&gt;, and cross-posting them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700289/facebook-reels-instagram-play-bonus-tiktok"&gt;into Facebook’s News Feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvXr66"&gt;Reels still has one major shortcoming, though: it doesn’t offer a consistent way for creators to get paid out, as YouTube and TikTok do. Facebook plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577242/facebook-1-billion-payments-creators-2022"&gt;pay $1 billion to creators&lt;/a&gt; by the end of 2022. Some of that money has gone to Reels creators, but it’s not a dedicated system for videomakers to get paid — always a good way to encourage people to make things on your app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Several Kingdom Hearts games are coming to Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rCRZyVU_HTDIuU5P5hl6VNkYGxE=/142x0:1299x771/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69954097/Screen_Shot_2018_06_05_at_2.36.30_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dx59nZ"&gt;The final new fighter coming to &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22690440/sora-kingdom-hearts-final-smash-ultimate-character-nintendo-switch"&gt;was revealed as Sora from &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But the event, hosted by game director Masahiro Sakurai, culminated in some arguably bigger news. The three mainline &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; games are coming to the Nintendo Switch. This includes &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 Remix, Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts III&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMQ7H2"&gt;Notably, all three titles will be delivered via cloud streaming instead of native ports, so they won’t be stored locally on your Switch. Nintendo showed the games running on PlayStation 4 during the stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s96Y2Y"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-q6Gz_4Yqc?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=3839&amp;amp;start=3839" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W1mg2J"&gt;Prices and release dates for each of the games weren’t detailed during the stream, but Sakurai stated that the release date will be announced later. It’s hard to say how &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; will look and feel while streamed over the internet instead of played locally. Other games, like &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;, also have cloud versions on the Switch, and the experience wasn’t as bad as I feared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MzUrVa"&gt;If this &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; release gets similar treatment, Nintendo will likely offer a free trial period for the games to make sure that your internet connection can handle it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Xbox web store integrates Xbox Cloud Gaming and wish lists</title>

  &lt;p id="2q3rFZ"&gt;Microsoft is starting to roll out a new Xbox web store that integrates Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud), wish lists, and more. The new Xbox web store includes buttons to add games to wish lists, quick access to redeem codes, and full Xbox Cloud Gaming integration. If you’re an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate member, you can simply click play on a supported game, and it will instantly stream from the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9KLNpl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tamelucas/status/1445184671864741890"&gt;Twitter user tamelucas&lt;/a&gt; first spotted the new Xbox web store yesterday, and it only appears to be live in Canada. It’s very different from the usual Microsoft Store listing and has a design that’s similar to the rest of the Xbox UI. You can also use the web store to quickly install games to an Xbox console you own or buy the game as a gift for a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M5PQ7tXUUE22t8OKKZb1pD4PMxQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902451/UFX1HGF.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new Xbox web store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VBLbek"&gt;If you’re interested in trying the new Xbox web store, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-CA%2Fgames%2Fstore%2FHalo-Wars%3A-Definitive-Edition%2FBPRPQSKXTD1L%2F0001%2F9V55MMP1XDBZ&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22710708%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-web-store-xcloud-cloud-gaming-wishlists-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check out this listing for &lt;em&gt;Halo Wars: Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which also supports Xbox Cloud Gaming. Microsoft hasn’t officially announced this new Xbox web store, but given it’s already appearing in Canada, we’d expect to see it roll out generally to other regions very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Destiny 2 arrives on Xbox Game Pass for PC on October 12th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D_ZPOWB_qgY71UlVqmKuF4M3yLI=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69953872/bungie_net_metadata_beyondlight_1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Gsclnz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; is finally arriving on Xbox Game Pass for PC later this month. While the looter shooter has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335483/destiny-2-xbox-game-pass-release-date-microsoft-bungie"&gt;available on the Xbox console side of Xbox Game Pass&lt;/a&gt; for more than a year, PC players have been patiently waiting for it to be included on Xbox Game Pass for PC. Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/10/05/xbox-game-pass-update-october-2021/"&gt;now bundling&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2: Beyond Light&lt;/em&gt; on Xbox Game Pass for PC on October 12th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e2OtR0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; developer Bungie made some clear optimizations for the console version of the game on Xbox Series X last year, with support for 4K resolution at 60fps on both the Xbox Series X and PS5. The PC version launching on Xbox Game Pass for PC won’t be any different from what’s already available on Steam, but it will mean cross-play players will see a new Windows logo next to Xbox Game Pass for PC players, instead of the familiar Steam one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q38goH"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt; will include the &lt;em&gt;Beyond Light&lt;/em&gt; DLC with its stasis-freezing abilities, Bungie has already made it clear that &lt;em&gt;Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;’s next big expansion, won’t be available on Xbox Game Pass at launch. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22639582/destiny-2-the-witch-queen-expansion-release-date-gjallarhorn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; will continue the story of the sci-fi space series and see players finally face off against Savathûn, the Witch Queen. &lt;em&gt;Destiny 2:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Witch Queen &lt;/em&gt;launches on February 22nd, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lost Judgment is a better sequel with a messy story</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Hr1YPmnxhg0Fg2EWVtkTM9sF2E=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69953729/LJ12.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ii3K4Y"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; series is beloved for its uncanny ability to bounce between absurd humor, deep pathos, and brutal violence and making it seem like the most natural thing in the world. Lost Judgment, the sequel to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18744110/judgment-game-review-ps4-yakuza"&gt;2019’s detective-focused spinoff &lt;em&gt;Judgment&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, marks a rare misstep in that regard. In many ways it’s much improved on its predecessor and spins a more ambitious story — but it can’t quite deliver on its themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RTrvpn"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lost Judgment&lt;/em&gt; picks up after the first game with Takayuki Yagami — played in droll, deadpan fashion by Japanese megastar Takuya Kimura — returning to his work as a private detective. Yagami is hired to investigate an incident of bullying at a high school in Yokohama, but soon enough the case becomes entwined with a groping conviction in Tokyo and a murder nearby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z5OH3c"&gt;The plot is more than a little far-fetched, as is the case with most Japanese crime procedurals, and the inevitable shoehorning in of gang warfare feels like the writers were overly beholden to the &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; series. But it’s told at a briskly entertaining pace and feels more focused than the previous game’s spiraling Big Pharma conspiracy. I generally appreciated the effort to tell a more intimate, smaller-scale story, even though it doesn’t ultimately pay off.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="lost judgment" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7-zjL_dBmSgBGjCO1PRzyHWVCks=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899878/LJCombat13.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nldAL4"&gt;The detective elements of the game are much improved. You’ll still have to tail enemies through the streets and go through some pointless on-rails stealth sections, but they mostly serve as palate cleansers rather than points of frustration. With its streamlined talking-heads cutscenes and emphasis on presenting meaningful evidence, &lt;em&gt;Lost Judgment&lt;/em&gt; sometimes feels more like &lt;em&gt;Ace Attorney&lt;/em&gt; than its predecessor, which was essentially &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; with an occasional gumshoe mini-game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Li3QPM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The story deals with some of the darkest subject matter yet seen in the series&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P887sr"&gt;Speaking of &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Lost Judgment &lt;/em&gt;will be worth playing for anyone turned off by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21558093/yakuza-like-a-dragon-review-xbox-series-x"&gt;the series’ shift to turn-based RPG-style combat with &lt;em&gt;Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; The brawling is as smooth and satisfying as it’s ever been, with three distinct combat styles that all have clear uses. It helps that &lt;em&gt;Lost Judgment&lt;/em&gt; is by far the best-looking &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt;-adjacent game to date, with a dramatic lighting system, realistic characters, and solid 60fps performance (at least on the PS5 I used for testing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QVbTgG"&gt;Kamurocho has never looked so good, and this time Yagami gets to play in Yokohama, too, with the much larger Ijincho district returning from &lt;em&gt;Like a Dragon&lt;/em&gt;. Unlike most recent &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; games, the original &lt;em&gt;Judgment&lt;/em&gt; only took place in Kamurocho and felt quite cramped as a result; the sequel gives you far more to explore. As ever, Sega’s &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; team does a great job at reusing locations and packing them full of new detail. You’re now able to skateboard on streets to get around faster, for example, and in Yokohama you can take a cute shiba inu for walks and discover side quests in return. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="lost judgment" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7vSJPXKqutgUjYWX2RhCJfG8Vvc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899879/LJInvestigative03.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="io5ULL"&gt;The breezy vibe is offset by the main storyline, which deals with some of the darkest subject matter yet seen in the series. The plot centers around high school bullying and suicide, which is certainly a topical and contentious issue in Japan; just last week a case involving a sixth-grade girl who died by suicide made news as the school denied that bullying was the cause. But&lt;em&gt; Lost Judgment&lt;/em&gt; takes a flippant approach to the problem, with Yagami resorting to preposterous methods like placing remote speakers under classroom tables to vocally stand up for bullied kids when their classmates won’t. Other characters, meanwhile, get killed off or make jarring heel turns in endless twists that don’t feel earned by the plot, and the game often makes ham-fisted attempts to get you to sympathize with some pretty clearly terrible people. It’s good that Sega tried to highlight the central issue, and I don’t think anyone expects a video game to solve it altogether, but it doesn’t feel like a good match for &lt;em&gt;Lost Judgment&lt;/em&gt;’s otherwise schlocky tone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="upusLF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I can’t ignore the big leaps this game makes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="URwt8c"&gt;You can look at &lt;em&gt;Lost Judgment&lt;/em&gt; in two ways: an often clumsy attempt at serious storytelling, or a technically accomplished sequel that much improves on its predecessor. It’s both, really. The plot doesn’t fully land, and I found there to be more awkward moments than in &lt;em&gt;Judgment&lt;/em&gt; or other &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; games. But I also can’t ignore the big leaps this game makes in other areas, and it still keeps up the irreverent charm of the series for much of its running time. Overall, I think this is a much better game than &lt;em&gt;Judgment&lt;/em&gt; and I would like to see where it goes next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeY7t5"&gt;The future of the &lt;em&gt;Judgment&lt;/em&gt; series is unclear, however. Various rumors suggest that &lt;em&gt;Yakuza&lt;/em&gt; creator and executive director Toshihiro Nagoshi may be leaving Sega, while Kimura’s notoriously protective talent agency Johnny’s is reportedly refusing to allow future games with his likeness due to a dispute over a PC version. I’m hoping none of this stops Sega from working on the next installment, though — while &lt;em&gt;Lost Judgment&lt;/em&gt; would be an unfortunately messy ending, I could see it as the ambitious middle part of a trilogy that finds its feet in the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrScbC"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Lost Judgment &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;is out now on the PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S / X.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Everything you need to know from the Facebook whistleblower hearing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Children’s Online Safety-Facebook Whistleblower" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CpKYuZyJwxMQDy3QzWpvcmPeLdM=/0x0:5239x3493/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69953544/1235709440.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Congress will hear new concerns about child safety on the world’s largest social network&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="mXO6As"&gt;On Tuesday, Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen is appearing before a Senate Commerce subcommittee in what promises to be one of Facebook’s toughest congressional hearings in years. After serving as a source for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686364/facebook-oversight-board-xcheck-moderation-exemption"&gt;string&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;bombshell reports&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;, Haugen &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;went public on Sunday&lt;/a&gt; with concerns about Instagram’s mental health impacts on its youngest users, drawn from internal Facebook reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5iWnc"&gt;The result has been a new focus on child safety — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710371/facebook-whistleblower-congress-hearing-instagram-kids-safety-privacy-blumenthal"&gt;a particularly sore point for Facebook&lt;/a&gt;. The company has disputed claims that Instagram exacerbates body issues in teenage girls, but the broader concerns about algorithmic amplification of harmful content have been harder to dismiss. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704308/finsta-instagram-facebook-privacy-kids-safety-richard-blumenthal-blackburn"&gt;In a hearing last week&lt;/a&gt;, Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) shared the results of a test in which his own staff was bombarded with Instagram posts related to eating disorders and self-harm after creating a dummy account posing as a teenage girl. Today’s hearing is expected to focus on the same topics, with direct testimony from Haugen on the company’s decisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dFIO34"&gt;We’ll be updating this post with everything that happens during the hearing — every question from lawmakers, every important quote, and every piece of new information from Haugen. Stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DKVAUl"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZRu93KLU868?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="VJmWF7"&gt;
&lt;p id="mpFIZk"&gt;In his opening remarks, &lt;strong&gt;Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT)&lt;/strong&gt; described how Facebook “has put profits ahead of people.” He noted how the platform’s algorithmic feeds can amplify insecurities in its younger users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qtDYUK"&gt;“I hope we will discuss whether there is such a thing as a safe algorithm,” Blumenthal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mLjwiF"&gt;Blumenthal also called on &lt;strong&gt;Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg&lt;/strong&gt; to return to Congress to testify on behalf of the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal’s &lt;/em&gt;recent revelations on child safety. Facebook has vigorously contested many of Haugen’s claims, but has done so through surrogates like global head of safety Antigone Davis or public relations lead Nick Clegg. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LhkTpD"&gt;“Rather than taking responsibility and showing leadership, Mr. Zuckerberg is going sailing,” Blumenthal said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="QZrEB7"&gt;
&lt;p id="l06NNc"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-TN)&lt;/strong&gt; tackled Facebook’s business model in her first remarks during the hearing. “Facebook is not interested in making significant changes to improve kids’ safety on their platforms, at least not when that would result in losing eyeballs on posts or decreasing their ad revenues,” she said. “Follow the money.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4Z5Xo2"&gt;Following up on last week’s “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/1/22704308/finsta-instagram-facebook-privacy-kids-safety-richard-blumenthal-blackburn"&gt;finsta” discussion&lt;/a&gt;, Blackburn says that Facebook turns a blind eye to these private accounts as a means of boosting its active user numbers. Children can use these private accounts to interact with other people and the platform without their parents’ approval, she said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="0GURQZ"&gt;
&lt;p id="fjXrT0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whistleblower Frances Haugen&lt;/strong&gt; said Facebook has “repeatedly” misled the public about “what its own research reveals about the safety of children and the efficacy of its artificial intelligence systems as a role in spreading divisive and extreme messages.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQBeyZ"&gt;Haugen also called on Congress to take regulatory action to change Facebook’s business incentives to amplify harmful content to its users. She also encouraged lawmakers to push for further transparency into the company to tackle its “closed design.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eAUnt9"&gt;“It is unaccountable until the incentives change,” Haugen said. “Facebook will not change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rNyLJ0"&gt;But she also showed optimism that the problem can be solved if the government intervenes. “These problems are solvable. A safer, free-speech-respecting social media is possible,” Haugen said. “Facebook can change, but it’s clearly not going to do so on its own.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="n4Bvpg"&gt;
&lt;p id="IQMs7P"&gt;Outside of Facebook’s business model, &lt;strong&gt;Haugen identified several structural issues&lt;/strong&gt; that make it more difficult for the company to react to scandals. “Facebook is stuck in a cycle where it struggles to hire. That causes it to understaff projects, which causes scandals, which then makes it harder to hire,” Haugen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="0hoLX4"&gt;“A pattern of behavior I saw at Facebook was that, often problems were so understaffed that there was an implicit discouragement from having better detection systems. So for example, I worked on the counterespionage team, and at any given time, our team could only handle a third of the cases we knew about. We knew that if we built even a basic detector, we would likely have even more cases.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VWvGPu"&gt;Haugen also pointed out how Facebook’s engagement numbers are often the deciding factor in developing its services. “Mark has built an organization that is very metrics-driven. It is intended to be flat. There is no unilateral responsibility,” she said. “The metrics make the decision.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="BabbZ1"&gt;
&lt;p id="xhF3lD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In her &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;60 Minutes &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;interview Sunday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Haugen described how Facebook’s Civic Integrity group dissolved after the 2020 presidential election. Those processes were later reinstated as an emergency decision during the January 6th riots at the US Capitol. &lt;strong&gt;Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-MN)&lt;/strong&gt; asked Haugen why Facebook decided to disband the integrity group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OH7Tyn"&gt;“Facebook has been emphasizing a false choice,” Haugen told Klobuchar. “They’ve said the safeguards that were in place before the election implicated free speech.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="kBjf5a"&gt;
&lt;p id="1BS4mI"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sen. John Thune (R-SD)&lt;/strong&gt; has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302170/facebook-google-brian-schatz-john-thune-section-230-content-moderation"&gt;previously introduced legislation&lt;/a&gt; to amend Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act. On Tuesday, Thune asked Haugen whether a change to that law could encourage Facebook to change its algorithms in a way that decreases user harm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NtNmgS"&gt;“I think if we had appropriate oversight, or if we reformed Section 230 to make Facebook responsible for the consequences of their intentional ranking decisions, I think they would get rid of engagement-based ranking because it is causing teenagers to be exposed to more anorexia content. It is pulling families apart, and in places like Ethiopia, it is literally fanning ethnic violence,” Haugen said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="35SEnl"&gt;
&lt;p id="rl6K0b"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In discussion with Sen. Jerry Moran (R-KS)&lt;/strong&gt;, Haugen came out in support of Section 230 reform that relates to algorithms even though these reforms can be “very complicated.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Matabe"&gt;“Companies have 100 percent control over their algorithms, and Facebook should not get a free pass on choices it makes to prioritize growth and virality and reactiveness over public safety,” Haugen said. “They’re paying for their profits right now with our safety.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="tOTGlM"&gt;
&lt;p id="LqNG8z"&gt;One of the big themes of the hearing has been that committee members want to respond to this by passing actual legislation — something that didn’t happen after the Cambridge Analytica hearings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cBdLsC"&gt;After his questions with Haugen, &lt;strong&gt;Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA)&lt;/strong&gt; put that sentiment in stark confrontational terms:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="CdkJ9N"&gt;Here’s my message for Mark Zuckerberg: Your time of invading our privacy, promoting toxic content, and preying on children and teens is over. Congress will be taking action. You can work with us or not work with us, but we will not allow your company to harm our children and our families and our democracies any longer. Thank you, Ms. Haugen. We will act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="D7RKCZ"&gt;
&lt;p id="R1CTUl"&gt;Haugen’s most consistent point is that optimizing Facebook leads to user harm in unpredictable ways — so &lt;strong&gt;Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-CO)&lt;/strong&gt; responded with a tricky question: will Facebook still be profitable without optimization?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GVluKN"&gt;It was an easy one to answer. Haugen said Facebook is currently making roughly $40 billion a year in profit. (It’s actually even higher, if you go by &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598592/facebook-second-quarter-earnings-29-billion"&gt;the latest earnings&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exqc4w"&gt;“The changes I’m talking about today wouldn’t make Facebook an unprofitable company,” she told the committee. “It just wouldn’t be a ludicrously profitable company ... People would consume less content on Facebook, but Facebook would still be profitable.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="lwQDsQ"&gt;
&lt;p id="IsFfbR"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX)&lt;/strong&gt; led Haugen toward a recurring theme in his hearing questions: alleged political censorship on Facebook. Haugen gently redirected the question. “A lot of the things that I advocate for are around changing the mechanisms of amplification, not around picking winners and losers in the marketplace of ideas,” she said, referring to features like asking someone to read an article before they share it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MLEyI9"&gt;“Small actions like that friction don’t require picking good ideas and bad ideas; they just make the platform less twitchy, less reactive. And Facebook’s internal research says that each one of those small actions dramatically reduces misinformation, hate speech, and violence-inciting content on the platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="HB3pE6"&gt;
&lt;p id="OV1on4"&gt;In questioning from &lt;strong&gt;Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY)&lt;/strong&gt;, Haugen called for more transparency. “Just disclosing the most popular content on the platform, including statistics around what factors went into the promotion of that content, would cause radically more transparency than we have today on how Facebook chooses what we focus on, how they shape our reality,” said Haugen, calling out “a pattern of behavior of Facebook hiding behind walls and operating in the shadows.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="rV8kCm"&gt;
&lt;p id="8S1Ci5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sen. Rick Scott (R-FL)&lt;/strong&gt; referenced &lt;a href="https://www.rickscott.senate.gov/2021/5/sen-rick-scott-introduces-data-act-shield-americans-personal-information-big-tech-companies"&gt;his DATA Act&lt;/a&gt;, which would require more transparency from social networks. Haugen seemed skeptical that transparency alone would solve the problems with Facebook’s algorithmic ordering of content — saying that if people were offered the option to pick a feed that was chronologically ordered or engagement-driven, they might still “choose the more addictive option.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sora is the final Smash Ultimate character</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TzOqy88uqJESqWOU0tR-ayauLGU=/92x0:1004x608/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69953534/Screen_Shot_2021_10_05_at_10.06.28_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OKqFdk"&gt;The newest &lt;em&gt;Super&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; fighter has been announced, and it is not Waluigi. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oC7v4Y"&gt;Nintendo, during a livestream event, announced Sora from &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; will join the roster as the 82nd playable character (if we’re not counting the echo fighters). Check out the trailer below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="scuZnD"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jqhp4M1lMTw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4Fiacu"&gt;Sora joins the esteemed company of characters from across celebrated Nintendo titles and beyond, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534874/super-smash-bros-ultimate-kayuza-tekken-dlc-character-fighters-pass-2-e3-2021"&gt;Jin Kazuya&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/10/22168749/next-smash-bros-character-sephiroth-fighters-pass-2"&gt; Sephiroth&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/8/17655942/super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch-castlevania-simon-belmont"&gt; a couple of Belmonts&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21065278/super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch-dlc-character-byleth-fire-emblem"&gt; entirely too many Fire Emblem characters&lt;/a&gt;. In advance of the &lt;em&gt;Smash&lt;/em&gt; livestream, the internet was alight with speculation as to who the newest character would be. Master Chief from &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; was an early favorite as was &lt;em&gt;Dragonball Z’s &lt;/em&gt;Goku. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W92rff"&gt;Waluigi, however, was one of the most popular guesses as fans have been &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2018/06/12/waluigi-was-robbed-and-humiliated-by-nintendo-and-his-fans-are-furious/"&gt;clamoring for his addition&lt;/a&gt; for years. As there will be no more characters added to &lt;em&gt;Smash&lt;/em&gt;, that dream now dies and with it the hopes of his many fans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E12q3m"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Smash Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; director &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17453214/super-smash-bros-ultimate-nintendo-switch-masahiro-sakurai-e3"&gt;Masahiro Sakurai&lt;/a&gt; has said this character &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22553841/super-smash-bros-ultimate-kazuya-release-date-tekken"&gt;will be the last fighter added&lt;/a&gt; to the game. In a tweet, the celebrated Nintendo personality also revealed this will be his last fighter presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="52peaw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Good morning.&lt;br&gt;The last DLC fighter for Super Smash Bros. Ultimate will be announced shortly.&lt;br&gt;This will also be my final fighter presentation.&lt;br&gt;It'll be sad to say farewell, but I hope you all enjoy it. &lt;a href="https://t.co/gV1B8fgtd6"&gt;https://t.co/gV1B8fgtd6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— 桜井 政博 / Masahiro Sakurai (@Sora_Sakurai) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Sora_Sakurai/status/1445382876086902790?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zycu0G"&gt;Sakurai frequently joked during presentations that working on &lt;em&gt;Smash&lt;/em&gt; has been tiring and wondered if he’d ever &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fccgHnBQ0YM&amp;amp;t=1906s"&gt;get a break&lt;/a&gt;. With Sora as the last &lt;em&gt;Smash Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; character, Mr. Sakurai can, at last, get some &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/please-for-the-love-of-god-let-masahiro-sakurai-rest-1845241032"&gt;well-deserved rest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
