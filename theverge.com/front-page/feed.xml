    <title>Forza Horizon 5 will add on-screen sign language interpreters in a post-launch update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U3b6UY8gBmOahTeoULjND-AMUF8=/295x0:1587x861/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70108394/forza_screen_cap.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Forza Horizon 4 will add sign language interpreters to cut scenes in a post-launch update | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o450zdpHZ7U&amp;amp;t=259s&amp;amp;ab_channel=Forza" target="_blank"&gt;Playground Games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NoX385"&gt;The developers of &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; are planning to add on-screen sign language interpreters who would appear in a picture-in-picture display during the game’s cutscenes. The feature won’t be available when the game launches worldwide on November 9th, but Playground Games creative director Mike Brown wrote in a blog post on Xbox Wire that it would be “coming soon.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="722oTq"&gt;“We’re constantly listening to the community to make &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; an inclusive experience for everyone to enjoy,” Brown &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/11/04/gaming-for-everyone-the-accessibility-features-of-forza-horizon-5/"&gt;said in a blog post on Xbox Wire&lt;/a&gt;. “With this in mind, the team is excited to share we are also working on American Sign Language (ASL) and British Sign Language (BSL) support for cinematics in &lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt;.” He didn’t offer an exact release date for the feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hvTjoX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forza Horizon 5&lt;/em&gt; will have several other accessibility features available at launch. They include a game speed modification setting to play at reduced speeds when playing off line, a high contrast mode, a color blindness mode, customizable subtitles, a screen reader narrator who reads aloud text, buttons, and other game elements, and the ability to disable moving backgrounds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dU4bNG"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o450zdpHZ7U?rel=0&amp;amp;start=259" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="935CuW"&gt;“We want everyone in the world to be able to experience our game, and with more than an estimated 400 million gamers with disabilities across the globe, it is vital that all players be able to tailor their gameplay in a way that works best for them,” Brown wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="86DI0q"&gt;Forza Horizon 5 launches November 9th on Xbox Series X / S, Xbox One, and PC. Those who bought the Premium Edition or Premium Add-Ons Bundle got access to play the game starting November 5th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go read this report about how GM’s deal with Rivian fell apart</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jc0W4_cDOysbz7UXq2tywmIIpVg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70108250/mclark_210923_4776_0008.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Mitchell Clark / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2w4UOs"&gt;A little over two years ago when Rivian’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/transportation/2021/9/28/22697309/rivian-r1t-electric-truck-test-drive-off-roading-camp-tested"&gt;all-electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt; were still just blueprints, American carmakers Ford and GM were itching to invest. Fast-forward to the present, and Ford wound up becoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590848/rivian-raise-amazon-ford-new-factory-ipo-electric-pickup"&gt;one of Rivian’s biggest partners alongside Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. What most people may not realize, however, is that Ford nearly lost its spot to GM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cR456n"&gt;This &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-ford-won-the-race-for-rivian-11636171218"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; describes some of the clandestine dealings in cinematic detail, and explores how Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe’s bond with Joe Hinrichs, Ford’s former president of global operations, became the foundation of Ford’s investment in the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hsHR4P"&gt;According to the&lt;em&gt; WSJ&lt;/em&gt;, Hinrichs first met with Scaringe in 2018. But because Ford had just missed its earnings targets, it wasn’t ready to invest in Rivian. This left room for GM, which had already started working on its electric vehicles, to slide in. However, &lt;em&gt;The WSJ &lt;/em&gt;says that leaders at Rivian remained skeptical of a deal with GM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HwjjJt"&gt;In 2019, Hinrichs met with Scaringe just after Amazon invested $700 million in Rivian. Hinrichs tried convincing him to reconsider a deal with Ford, after Scaringe said his company was on the verge of a deal with GM. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Qs9WGf"&gt;Sensing hesitancy about GM, Mr. Hinrichs said he urged the young executive to reconsider. ‘Just because you got engaged to someone doesn’t mean you need to marry them,’ Mr. Hinrichs said he told Mr. Scaringe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="TUXBJ6"&gt;Hinrichs gave Scaringe yet another chance to talk — both of them happened to have meetings in Seattle, and Hinrichs offered to give Scaringe a ride back to Detroit in Ford’s Gulfstream jet. Scaringe still had yet to seal a deal with GM, and during the flight, Hinrich and Scaringe laid out a deal. When they landed, Hinrichs helped Scaringe stay out of sight of nearby GM executives:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="tv0qWh"&gt;As the plane taxied toward a hangar used by both Ford and GM, executives on board spotted another jet outside the hangar with two GM-made black Cadillac Escalades waiting nearby. Mr. Hinrichs said he sensed Mr. Scaringe didn’t want to be seen by GM executives, so Mr Hinrichs requested that a Lincoln Navigator be pulled alongside the plane. When the door opened, Mr. Scaringe dashed down the plane’s steps and into the Navigator, keeping his head down as Mr. Hinrichs loaded their luggage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Fvlmns"&gt;Ford and Rivian’s talks continued overnight, and the two companies reached a deal at 4AM, according to the&lt;em&gt; WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. In April 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18514031/ford-electric-pickup-truck-ev-startup-rivian-tech"&gt;Ford announced that it would invest $500 million&lt;/a&gt; in the startup — it has since invested a total of $1.2 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jUug2t"&gt;The stories of how deals come together don’t always have as many twists and turns as the stories of how deals fall apart. This great &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-ford-won-the-race-for-rivian-11636171218"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; piece&lt;/a&gt; has a little of both, and it’s a fascinating read. Go check out the dramatic tale, that has all the makings of a movie — or a really captivating novel.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk polls his Twitter followers to ask if he should sell 10 percent of his Tesla stock </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="GERMANY-US-POLITICS-ELECTION-ECONOMY-TESLA" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cyzGx3raWrRYNjc3325O1p_XkrE=/0x152:3678x2604/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70108047/1234651136.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Elon Musk polled his Twitter followers | Photo by PATRICK PLEUL/POOL/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JchOSd"&gt;Tesla CEO and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22163361/elon-musk-billionaire-richest-world-jeff-bezos-tesla-stock-spacex"&gt;wealthiest&lt;/a&gt; person in the world Elon Musk tweeted out a poll Saturday, asking his Twitter followers whether he should sell 10 percent of his stock in the automaker, ostensibly to pay more tax. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="coNDYE"&gt;“Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock,” he &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457066048944066565?s=20"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;. He said in a subsequent tweet that he’d abide by the results of the poll “whichever way it goes.” By Sunday morning, “yes” replies were leading, with 57 percent of more than 3.1 million votes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="5dcmVn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I will abide by the results of this poll, whichever way it goes&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457066048944066565?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QPNAbf"&gt;Musk had been a vocal critic of a &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-the-billionaires-income-tax-would-work-11635325201?mod=article_inline"&gt;proposal to tax unrealized gains&lt;/a&gt; on publicly traded assets for some of the wealthiest Americans. Under the &lt;a href="https://www.finance.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/Billionaires%20Income%20Tax%20-%20One%20Pager.pdf"&gt;proposal&lt;/a&gt; by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Oregon), if assets increased in value, even if the person didn’t sell the assets, the person would have to pay taxes on the unrealized gain. It would basically end the tax loophole that lets billionaires defer capital gains taxes indefinitely, while still being able to borrow against that wealth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IMidhq"&gt;“Eventually, they run out of other people’s money and then they come for you,” Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1452792781726961668"&gt;tweeted in October&lt;/a&gt;, in response to a tweet expressing concerns about the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BYvF1I"&gt;Wyden responded to Musk’s idea, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RonWyden/status/1457110175932846080?s=20"&gt;tweeting&lt;/a&gt; on Saturday: “Whether or not the world’s wealthiest man pays any taxes at all shouldn’t depend on the results of a Twitter poll, It’s time for the Billionaires Income Tax.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t1PfxF"&gt;Saturday was also not the first time Musk has floated the idea of selling off some Tesla stock. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZP67-DECVw&amp;amp;ab_channel=Recode"&gt;Musk told journalist Kara Swisher at Code Conference&lt;/a&gt; in September that he planned to sell a big chunk of his Tesla stock options before they expired. “I have a bunch of [stock] options that are expiring early next year, so that’s a huge block of options we’ll sell in Q4,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qnW8ZV"&gt;Swisher asked if he was surprised by how much Tesla’s stock had gone up. “I have gone on record and said I think [Tesla’s] stock price is too high, in my opinion,” Musk added later. “What am I supposed to do? I’m not the one making it go up.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTbnZh"&gt;ProPublica journalist &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/eisingerj/status/1457099957635272707?s=21"&gt;Jesse Eisinger pointed out on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that the third tweet in Musk’s Saturday thread — “Note, I do not take a cash salary or bonus from anywhere. I only have stock, thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock”— appeared to confirm the news site’s reporting on how &lt;a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-secret-irs-files-trove-of-never-before-seen-records-reveal-how-the-wealthiest-avoid-income-tax"&gt;the ultra-wealthy avoid paying income taxes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QHjEBm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Note, I do not take a cash salary or bonus from anywhere. I only have stock, thus the only way for me to pay taxes personally is to sell stock.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457067398712942592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QheKCL"&gt;“Thank you for confirming our story: That for the ultra wealthy income taxes are essentially voluntary,” Eisinger tweeted, noting that Musk had previously called the story “misleading.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIjOQY"&gt;Musk’s Twitter poll had a few hours remaining on Sunday. We’ll update this post if he makes further comment. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s Arcane is a slick and exciting intro to League of Legends</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eEY9sMVp5sF8cH4Pqbx5wSSAxd8=/240x0:1545x870/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70106449/Vi_fight.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TWXeqg"&gt;For years, fans have been wondering just when the heck &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; developer Riot would make an animated series. It seemed inevitable. The studio previously created stunning animated shorts to promote everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21336218/league-of-legends-yone-anime-cinematic-riot-games"&gt;new characters&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700154/league-of-legends-world-2021-anthem-music-video"&gt;esports tournaments&lt;/a&gt;. And with an increasing focus on expanding &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;’s storytelling — something that’s tough to do within the confines of a team-based strategy game — a show made a whole lot of sense. Now, it’s real, with a nine-episode series called &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;. The best part: not only is it a lot of fun, but you don’t have to know anything about &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt; to get into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uTbT6U"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; is set (mostly) in a city called Piltover early on, which is on the verge of a big change that could impact the entirety of the fantasy realm of Runeterra: a pair of scientists are figuring out a way to harness the dangerous power of magic to use in everything from weapons to tools to transportation. Amidst this backdrop, the show follows a handful of characters throughout the city. Things start out with a street kid named Vi leading a small gang to a big score, heading to the upper reaches of the city to steal some expensive-looking gadgets. The heist, naturally, goes bad and ends with some exploding crystals. The perspective then shifts to the likes of the aforementioned scientists and an underworld kingpin with lots of scars and a big grudge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gf5rGf"&gt;What’s great about &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt;’s fantasy-meets-steampunk world is that it’s pretty easy to understand. The show doesn’t waste time with big lore dumps, nor does it expect you already know who these characters are. Vi, for instance, is one of &lt;em&gt;League&lt;/em&gt;’s most popular characters, but the show serves mostly as an origin story for her and a few others. For fans, it’s a cool chance to see how some of these characters came to be — you even learn about Vi’s iconic gauntlets — but for everyone else, you’re being introduced to interesting people at a pivotal point in their lives. No prior knowledge necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="irZkb1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3Svs_hl897c?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Hh1r2b"&gt;It helps that the story is relatively straightforward. There isn’t anything about &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; that I would call new or revolutionary. It’s a fairly typical fantasy tale that just happens to be really well done. The villains are intimidating, the would-be heroes are messy and relatable, the action is extremely satisfying to watch, and everything moves at a brisk pace. The best thing &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; has going for it is just how stylish it looks. Each frame looks like a gorgeous piece of hand-painted concept art; in motion, it’s like nothing I’ve ever seen. It’s also a world that feels lived-in and fully realized. The slums of Piltover have a toxic green look to them (police officers even wear masks when they venture in), while the upper levels are bright, airy, and luxurious. I especially loved all of the strange mechanical creations that help keep the city alive and bustling. What I’m saying is, after watching the first few episodes, I want an &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; art book ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w4ZjAK"&gt;One of the more interesting things about the show is how it’s being released. It’s not an all-you-can-watch binge-fest, nor are episodes dropping weekly. Instead, &lt;em&gt;Arcane&lt;/em&gt; uses something of a hybrid format. The nine episodes are divided into chapters and are being released as three-episode bundles over the course of three weeks. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22579993/fear-street-netflix-horror-trilogy-summer-movie"&gt;It’s reminiscent of Netflix’s experimental &lt;em&gt;Fear Stree&lt;/em&gt;t trilogy of horror movies&lt;/a&gt;.) For the first chapter, at least, it works well because the three episodes have their own clear arc, while episode four picks up some time later, though that’s as far as I’ve watched so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEyNC8"&gt;Early on,&lt;em&gt; Arcane&lt;/em&gt; walks a fine line. It’s both a tribute and an introduction to a vast fantasy realm that’s been around for a decade and has millions of existing fans. Those viewers will find a story with some exciting Easter eggs and a deeper look at characters that have been around for ages. Everyone else is in for a surprisingly thrilling adventure that doesn’t skimp on style. Really, the most jarring thing for newcomers might be if they’re inspired to play &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; itself, which is decidedly lacking in the style and speed that make the show work so well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp may be working on a Communities feature</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sE8_Kr6c4stj8ukazGjMdrkuf1Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105878/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NnCDgO"&gt;Evidence is mounting that WhatsApp may be working on a Communities feature. &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/whatsapp-new-community-feature-apk-teardown/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; first spotted&lt;/a&gt; the possibility in October, but now &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-is-working-on-communities/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; has come forward&lt;/a&gt; with similar findings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wjuvdZ"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;, the Communities feature appears to give group admins more power over groups. This includes the ability to create groups within groups, which may be similar to how channels are arranged beneath an umbrella Discord community.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="WhatsApp Communities feature" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yGOOzNKzFmslJfuWJ8wvNaYmB9I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22991747/whatsapp_communities_beta.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zDSuEp"&gt;Admins may be able to invite new users via a Community Invite Link and then start messaging other members. It’s hard to tell how exactly these chats might look right now, but &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; notes that they appear to be end-to-end encrypted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwYVWd"&gt;It also looks like a subtle design change will help distinguish Communities from regular group chats. As &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; points out, community icons will be squares with rounded corners, a format that WhatsApp mistakenly enabled (and then quickly disabled) in October. There’s no word on when Communities will be officially rolled out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ausP9C"&gt;By working on a Communities feature, WhatsApp may be trying to close the widening gap between it and other messaging apps like Telegram and Signal. Earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424769/whatsapp-privacy-policy-deadline-controversy-functionality"&gt;WhatsApp’s new privacy policy&lt;/a&gt; caused confusion among users about what it would share with parent company Facebook, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22226792/whatsapp-privacy-policy-response-signal-telegram-controversy-clarification"&gt;sparking a mass exodus&lt;/a&gt; to those other apps. When &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;WhatsApp went down along with Facebook’s entire network&lt;/a&gt; of apps last month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712191/telegram-70-million-new-users-facebook-outage-surge-whatsapp"&gt;Telegram gained a whopping 70 million users&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook reportedly is aware of the level of ‘problematic use’ among its users</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4cl22QviTCKJZdg_pANy3B-TXbg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105825/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;More leaked documents suggest Facebook is aware of its problems | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DvIzrM"&gt;Facebook’s own internal research found 1 in 8 of its users reported compulsive social media use that interfered with their sleep, work, and relationships— what the social media platform calls “problematic use” but is more commonly known as “internet addiction,” the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-bad-for-you-360-million-users-say-yes-company-documents-facebook-files-11636124681"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="366TOG"&gt;The social media platform had a team focused on user well-being, which suggested ways to curb problematic use, some of which were put into place. But the company shut down the team in 2019, according to the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NB488C"&gt;Pratiti Raychoudhury, a vice president of research for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/28/22745234/facebook-new-name-meta-metaverse-zuckerberg-rebrand"&gt;Meta, Facebook’s new parent&lt;/a&gt; company, writes in a &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/11/wsj-report-ignores-our-approach-to-well-being-research/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; misrepresented the research (a claim the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/18/22681056/facebook-vp-disputes-report-wall-street-journal-instagram-teens-clegg"&gt;has made&lt;/a&gt; about some of the other articles the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; has produced based on Facebook’s internal documents).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TR3YR2"&gt;She says the company “has been engaged and supportive throughout our multiyear effort to better understand and empower people who use our services to manage problematic use. That’s why this work has taken place over multiple years, including now.” Raychoudhury argues that “problematic use does not equal addiction,” and that the company ships “features to help people manage their experiences on our apps and services.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6oc4d"&gt;The report is the latest in an ongoing series from the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; called the &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-facebook-files-11631713039"&gt;Facebook Files&lt;/a&gt;, based on internal documents provided by whistleblower Frances Haugen, which suggest Facebook is aware of the problems its platforms can cause. One set of reports, for instance, suggested Facebook knew that its Instagram platform was toxic for teenage users. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710371/facebook-whistleblower-congress-hearing-instagram-kids-safety-privacy-blumenthal"&gt;Haugen testified before Congress&lt;/a&gt; on October 5th, saying Facebook was “internally dysfunctional,” and that it was unlikely to change its behaviors without action from external regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Federal appeals court temporarily halts new Biden vaccine rule for companies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of several vaccine vials over a pink and purple background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tXVMP7qOG7PCm3YyYVQStUPItZk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105574/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;New vaccine rules have been frozen by an appeals court | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QSYpdy"&gt;A federal appeals court on Saturday issued a stay against the Biden administration’s vaccine rules for US companies. The new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/4/22757969/biden-covid-vaccine-osha-cms-masking-federal-mandate"&gt;rule announced Thursday&lt;/a&gt; requires workers at businesses with 100 or more employees to be vaccinated against COVID-19, or submit to weekly testing. The rule requires affected companies to provide paid time for employees to get vaccinated, and to ensure any unvaccinated employees wear face masks while at work. The deadline for meeting the provisions is January 4th, 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhiljM"&gt;Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TXAG/status/1457045504710356999"&gt;petitioned for an emergency stay&lt;/a&gt; of the rule, which was to be enforced by the Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). The petition was joined by attorneys general from Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Utah, and several private businesses and advocacy groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jvUpzR"&gt;The three-judge panel with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals &lt;a href="https://www.ca5.uscourts.gov/opinions/unpub/21/21-60845.0.pdf"&gt;said Saturday&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) that it was issuing the stay “because the petitions give cause to believe there are grave statutory and constitutional issues with the mandate.” The court didn’t provide additional detail for why it issued the stay, but the Biden administration now has until 5PM ET on Monday to respond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zQIJFu"&gt;Solicitor of Labor Seema Nanda said in a statement that the Labor Department was “confident” it has the legal authority to issue the rule, and was prepared to defend it in court. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TjBATH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Someone stole an entire shipment of EVGA RTX graphics cards</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wMEddsflyzWfObLzoVgC8IHoc-k=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105438/twarren_20210601_4611_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="emXcPL"&gt;As if &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22363232/global-semiconductor-chip-shortage-pandemic-consoles-cpus-graphics-cards-cars"&gt;the chip shortage&lt;/a&gt; didn’t make it hard enough to get our hands on graphics cards, criminals are making it a heck of a lot worse. According to &lt;a href="https://forums.evga.com/Notice-of-Stolen-EVGA-GeForce-RTX-30Series-Graphics-Cards-m3490851.aspx"&gt;a forum post by EVGA product manager Jacob Freeman&lt;/a&gt;, thieves made off with a whole truckload of EVGA RTX 30-Series graphics cards. The graphic cards were in transit from San Francisco to EVGA’s southern California distribution center at the time of the theft, and it remains unclear how many cards were affected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="CIyZgg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If a user does end up acquiring a stolen card, we will address [it] on a case by case basis”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t613zi"&gt;If you think you may have a card that was involved in this theft, you can find out by entering your card’s serial number on &lt;a href="https://www.evga.com/warranty/check.asp"&gt;EVGA’s warranty status page&lt;/a&gt;. You can also check by attempting to register your card on the &lt;a href="https://forums.evga.com/Notice-of-Stolen-EVGA-GeForce-RTX-30Series-Graphics-Cards-m3490851.aspx"&gt;My Products&lt;/a&gt; section of this site — if you can properly register your card, you can rest assured that it wasn’t snatched from the shipment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zr7V1k"&gt;The post warns users that it’s illegal to “buy or receive” stolen goods, as well as “conceal, sell, withhold, or aid in concealing selling or withholding” that property. EVGA also says that it “will not register or honor any warranty or upgrade claims“ on stolen cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G5rOjC"&gt;Freeman couldn’t give &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; any more details about the truck heist due to an ongoing police investigation, however, he did say in an email that “If a user has a question we urge them to contact us [at] &lt;a href="mailto:stopRTX30theft@evga.com"&gt;stopRTX30theft@evga.com&lt;/a&gt;. If a user does end up acquiring a stolen card, we will address [it] on a case by case basis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N44g9f"&gt;This isn’t the first time that a large shipment of graphics cards has been stolen, and, unfortunately, it’s probably not the last. At the end of 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/8/22164020/thieves-ps5-rtx-3090-out-of-stock-reselling"&gt;about $340,000 worth of GeForce RTX 3090s&lt;/a&gt; were stolen from MSI’s factory in mainland China. Graphics cards have become a prime target for thieves and scalpers — the MSRP for an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3090 is $1,499 but if scalpers have their way, this can skyrocket to $2,000 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stranger Things 4 will have a summer 2022 release date</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wsXjbNl8B7lcdFbb4eduOtXYTwA=/360x0:1628x845/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105313/eleven_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Eleven is back for Season 4 of Netflix’s Stranger Things series | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1ZQMpp4BdU&amp;amp;ab_channel=StrangerThings" target="_blank"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="X07yfR"&gt;Netflix &lt;a href="https://mobile.twitter.com/netflix/status/1457045171367989251"&gt;tweeted Saturday&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 4 &lt;/em&gt;will premiere in the summer of 2022. While not a precise release date, it’s at least something for fans of Netflix’s flagship supernatural series, who have waited through months of delays and a seemingly endless parade of mysterious teasers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MlL6gs"&gt;A new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/6/22765252/stranger-things-4-teaser-trailer-2022-release-date-netflix"&gt;teaser dropped Saturday&lt;/a&gt; as well, showing Eleven in California, adjusting to her new life and school. She writes in a letter to Mike that everything is great (even though we see her classmates being mean to her), and says she can’t wait for spring break. But of course, our girl can’t have anything nice last for too long; after a fade to black, we get some eerie music under shots of a roller rink and Eleven looking afraid, along with helicopters, explosions, and Joyce recoiling from a creepy looking doll. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7O337"&gt;We also got a look at the titles for all nine of the season 4 episodes for the first time. They will be called: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WRP63l"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Hellfire Club, Vecna’s Curse, The Monster and The Superhero, Dear Billy, The Nina Project, The Dive, The Massacre At Hawkins Lab, Papa&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Piggyback&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Amqf3v"&gt;These do not sound like episodes where a lot of good times will be had by our heroine and her crew. And &lt;em&gt;Papa &lt;/em&gt;is what Eleven called Dr. Martin Brenner (Matthew Modine), whose return was signaled in an earlier season 4 &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;amp;v=ILwLN6hV-X8&amp;amp;feature=emb_logo&amp;amp;ab_channel=StrangerThings"&gt;teaser&lt;/a&gt; where we heard his voice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="atF6yb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;What's in a name?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Stranger Things 4 premiering Summer 2022. &lt;a href="https://t.co/leznp8XJbh"&gt;pic.twitter.com/leznp8XJbh&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix (@netflix) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1457045171367989251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CMPrqy"&gt;The new announcements come as part of Netflix’s celebration of “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Stranger_Things/status/1456622489971343360"&gt;Stranger Things Day&lt;/a&gt;,” which is meant to “commemorate” the in-universe date of November 6th, 1983 — the day that Will Byers (Noah Schnapp) first disappeared into the dark Upside-Down dimension in the first season of &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things. &lt;/em&gt;(If one was feeling less charitable, one could also attribute it to a cynical and slightly desperate attempt to try and create a cash-in fan holiday for one of its most popular genre shows like May 4th’s “Star Wars Day.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wqyZHw"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;November 6, 1983. The day Will Byers disappeared and the world turned upside down. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/StrangerThingsDay?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#StrangerThingsDay&lt;/a&gt; returns tomorrow   &lt;a href="https://t.co/sRVrGwtvi0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/sRVrGwtvi0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Stranger Things (@Stranger_Things) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Stranger_Things/status/1456622489971343360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uGA3Ip"&gt;It’s been a longer than usual wait for the fourth season after &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 3 — &lt;/em&gt;which was released in July 2019 — due to a months-long delay in production caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, which shut down filming on &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things 4 &lt;/em&gt;after just two weeks in early 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="to4XIi"&gt;Netflix hasn’t wasted any of that time, though, with a plethora of teasers for the fourth season that it’s been steadily releasing over the past several months, including one that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/14/21137590/netflix-stranger-things-4-trailer-character-teaser-missing-return"&gt;teases the return of a fan-favorite character&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422642/stranger-things-4-new-trailer-netflix-eleven"&gt;one that delves into Eleven’s dark past&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22688804/stranger-things-season-4-teaser-trailer-watch-netflix"&gt;and one that sets up a new spooky location, the Creel House&lt;/a&gt; (which presumably will feature in the upcoming fourth season). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfEblT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 6 appears to fall short of expected 30W charging speeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Google Pixel 6 Pro" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pNfsde9ODBND2xI1T3rhqcMqQww=/162x0:1935x1182/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70105137/Google_Pixel_6_Pro__Alt_Angle_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HQ0Ucz"&gt;When Google released the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, it boasted about the devices’ fast-charging capabilities. Plugging a Pixel 6 series device into its &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/usb_c_30w_charger"&gt;$25 30W Fast Charger&lt;/a&gt; — which isn’t even included in the box — is supposed to take full advantage of the phone’s fast charging speed, juicing it up to 50 percent in just 30 minutes. We all can agree that this is an impressive spec, but unfortunately, it may not be totally realistic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tz4HxR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.androidauthority.com/google-pixel-6-charging-test-3051231/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; put the Pixel 6’s fast charging speed to the test, and its findings suggest that &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7158570"&gt;Google’s spec sheet&lt;/a&gt; is misleading. After trying out the 30W charger with the Pixel 6, &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; found that the Pixel 6 doesn’t fully harness the power of the charger — instead, it only hits a maximum charging speed of just 22W.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="R5zDeA"&gt;
&lt;div class="infogram-embed" data-id="_/XhxOon5FbW8f2n44upZj" data-type="interactive" data-title="Google Pixel 6 Pro Fast Charging Test"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;script&gt;!function(e,i,n,s){var t="InfogramEmbeds",d=e.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];if(window[t]&amp;&amp;window[t].initialized)window[t].process&amp;&amp;window[t].process();else if(!e.getElementById(n)){var o=e.createElement("script");o.async=1,o.id=n,o.src="https://e.infogram.com/js/dist/embed-loader-min.js",d.parentNode.insertBefore(o,d)}}(document,0,"infogram-async");&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zeJxCm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; notes that the charger took about 111 minutes to fully charge the Pixel 6 Pro’s 5,000mAh battery with its Adaptive Charging and Adaptive Battery settings switched off. Google is right; the device takes about 31 minutes for a 50 percent charge, however, filling up that final 50 percent takes much longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F6Q6Vy"&gt;The phone’s charging speed appears to dip all the way to 12W at 75 percent, and then 2.5W when the battery gets close to full, taking a whole hour to fill up the final 15 percent. While it’s normal for charging speeds to taper off over time to prevent damage to the battery and stave off high temperatures, dropping down to a mere 2.5W is still unusual. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Gqelqf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The charger took a total of 111 minutes to fully charge the Pixel 6 Pro’s 5,000mAh battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MNYf1K"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt; even compared the charging speeds of the 30W Fast Charger with the 18W Power Delivery unit that Google included with older Pixels. It found that the 30W charger barely offers any improvement in terms of speed, as it takes 121 minutes to charge the Pixel 6 Pro with the 18W charger — only 10 minutes slower than the 30W Fast Charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PyEKEy"&gt;This corroborates what we noticed during our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22750387/google-pixel-6-pro-review"&gt;hands-on Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro review&lt;/a&gt;. We pointed out that while both support fast charging, neither seemed to fuel up that fast. Also in line with &lt;em&gt;Android Authority&lt;/em&gt;’s findings, we noted that Google throttles the charging speed after reaching 80 percent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcSQMf"&gt;Google doesn’t explicitly say that the Pixel 6 has a charging rate of 30W; it just says that both phones support “up to 50 percent charge in 30 minutes with Google 30W USB-C Charger with USB-PD 3.0 (PPS)” on its spec sheets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hYAfGD"&gt;But it still doesn’t make sense that Google would promote the Fast Charger if the Pixel 6 can’t take full advantage of it. Not to mention that Google is encouraging users to buy the charger under the guise that it really does provide lightning-fast charging rates — is 10 minutes really worth an extra $25?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84waxz"&gt;Google is also set to release &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22732918/google-pixel-stand-23w-wireless-charging"&gt;a second-gen $79 Google Pixel Stand fast wireless charger&lt;/a&gt; sometime in the near future. The &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_stand_2nd_gen"&gt;“superfast wireless charger” is listed as&lt;/a&gt; providing charging speeds of up to 23W “for compatible Pixel phones,” which is closer to the 22W charging rate that the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro tops out at. It remains unclear why Google would give more realistic expectations for the upcoming wireless charger, and not for the 30W Fast Charger. We reached out to Google with a request for comment on the situation and didn’t immediately hear back.&lt;/p&gt;
