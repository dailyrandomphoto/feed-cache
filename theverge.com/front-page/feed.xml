  &lt;p&gt;From mesh networks to lap desks, here’s how The Verge’s staffers create their workspaces&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="8meJ3q"&gt;It’s been nearly two years since many of us started working from home due to the pandemic, and if you haven’t yet adjusted your workspace to accommodate your needs, then it’s probably time to get to it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4me3Vy"&gt;Whether you’ve set yourself up in the guest bedroom, on your living room couch, or in a walk-in closet, you may need a little extra effort to make it possible to type comfortably, meet online, or just concentrate. Sometimes it means buying a new desk, lamp, or monitor; sometimes it just means finding a household item that will make life a little easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ITcH40"&gt;We asked the staff of &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; what they’ve been using to make their work-at-home situations more practical, more pleasant, or simply more possible. Here are some of the answers we got.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ccfh3Y"&gt;I basically live in my AirPods Pro during the day. They let me listen to music, catch Slack pings, and take calls, all with the added benefit of some noise cancellation to help drown out outside noise. Their range is also great for my apartment — I can be anywhere in the house without losing connection to my computer, which is really nice if I need to step away from my desk to, say, microwave my second cookie of the afternoon. —&lt;em&gt;Jay Peters, news writer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="oO0PX0"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3ZzJ9d"&gt;Phone as webcam&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nexus 6p" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XEBsYa2KiJ22hcaPBPNS_L4LZz4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/4178290/nexus-6p-9459.0.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nexus 6p&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="lBd28P"&gt;Webcams are no longer a struggle to find in 2022, but if you want to save money, turning your phone into a fully functional webcam is surprisingly easy, cost-effective, and can yield good results. I already had a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/20/9571535/nexus-6p-review"&gt;Nexus 6P&lt;/a&gt; sitting around, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21225061/phone-tablet-android-ios-phone-tablet-pc-webcam-windows-mac-os-how-to-use"&gt;with these steps&lt;/a&gt; that work on most Android and iOS devices, I now have a phone-meets-webcam. It’s got picture quality roughly on par with a standalone webcam, which might cost you around $100. If you want a stand that can angle it during calls, I’d suggest picking up one of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/GripTight-GorillaPod-Stand-PRO-Compatibility/dp/B01C7UYCWW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;these Joby GorillaPod tripods&lt;/a&gt; that includes a phone clip. —&lt;em&gt;Cameron Faulkner, reviewer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="OH2qAv"&gt;While I’m working off a MacBook, this Satechi hub has been a lifesaver for plugging in podcasting mics and any other gear I’m suddenly using on my own. —&lt;em&gt;Adi Robertson, senior reporter &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hrYlj8"&gt;I go through tons of batteries with my flash when photographing at home, and I find that these rechargeable batteries last so much longer than regular single-use batteries. Not only do they save me trips to the store and keep more batteries out of the landfills, but they also save me money in the end. —&lt;em&gt;Amelia Holowaty Krales, senior photo editor &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="f5e8yx"&gt;This Thunderbolt 3 dock lets me switch my whole desk setup (keyboard, mouse, speakers, ethernet, display, external storage drives, and microphone) from one computer to another by just moving one cable. I plug all of my peripherals into the dock, and then just use the one Thunderbolt cable to hook up my Mac or whatever Windows machine I need to test at the moment. It also has a very useful high-speed SD card slot on the front, which is great for whenever I need to dump images from my camera onto my computer. —&lt;em&gt;Dan Seifert, deputy editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="jrjDdT"&gt;Last year, I installed a Google Nest Wifi router with a mesh point. I’ve had a lot of networking equipment over the years, and this was immediately the best. And it was extremely easy to set up. A year later, my system with one router and three points is still going strong. —&lt;em&gt;TC Sottek, executive editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RhEAqu"&gt;An ultrawide monitor is the best purchase I ever made for working from home. It’s so big I have to physically lean from side to side to see it all. I can have three full-size windows up at the same time or countless windows overlapping. (Right now, I have nine different windows open and it doesn’t feel cramped at all.) Mine is an old LG 34UM94-P that they don’t make anymore — it looks like there is an updated version, the LG 34WN80C-B. However, any monitor that is at least 34 inches in size with 1440p or better resolution is what I recommend. —&lt;em&gt;Dan Seifert &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kMa5qF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;We heard from two staffers about this desk:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5QBq3"&gt;I love my Jarvis desk from Fully. It’s a solidly built desk that looks great in my office, and it’s really handy to have the option to sit or stand while working. If you’re considering one, I highly recommend spending the extra cash for the extended-range height, which lets the desk get lower for sitting and higher for standing, and the programmable height switcher, which lets you preset heights that you can switch back and forth to just by pressing a button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uyjsHY"&gt;I also sprang for the $29 casters so I could wheel the desk around my apartment, which lets my wife and I use it as a mobile entertainment system. When we’re done working for the day, we can roll the desk over to our comfy chairs and watch Netflix or play &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; on the desk’s monitor. —&lt;em&gt;Jay Peters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i94S6q"&gt;I have the Jarvis, too, just in a larger size. It has served me well for about four years now. It’s a comfortable, stable, spacious desk that has more versatility than typical desk options. —&lt;em&gt;Dan Seifert&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="DGz3Ar"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10306098" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="B4cCqH"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;LapGear designer lap desk &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tnSiHd"&gt;I should work at a desk more, but I spend a lot of time working from a couch. It’s bad for me, but also very comfortable. Using a lap desk like this one helps me at least pretend to be a little more conscientious about my posture; plus, it’s helpful for writing on physical paper (or when my laptop gets too hot). —&lt;em&gt;Chaim Gartenberg, senior reporter &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YZmmvQ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10306102" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"brief_layout"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eok6fF"&gt;This monitor mount brings my screen up to a nice height so that I don’t hunch over, and it’s the tallest one I’ve found. Other monitor arms I tried just weren’t tall enough for me when I was standing while working — and I’m not that tall at 5 feet, 11 inches. The mount also lets me adjust my monitor to exactly the right height for movies or &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; when I’m using my desk as a mobile entertainment center. (Note: This monitor mount is no longer available; however, there is a similar model.) —&lt;em&gt;Jay Peters &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="OdA2UU"&gt;The desk chair that I use is the Herman Miller Sayl, which used to sell for around $500 — the low end of that company’s lineup, believe it or not. I almost purchased this chair in mid-2020 when the chair I had was really causing me physical anguish, but Vox Media allowed me to borrow it from our NYC office. So I immediately drove there, stuffed it into my car, and brought it home. My cats and I really like it. (Note: The chair now costs over $900, but you can still get it for around $600 if you eliminate several of the adjustable features.)  —&lt;em&gt;Cameron Faulkner &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QvLndi"&gt;While all of my work and most of my writing happen on my computer, sometimes it’s easier (especially for sudden phone calls or when I don’t want to switch out of a video) to simply turn to the notebook I keep next to my laptop and jot down a note or two. And I’ve found that using a classy pen is not only good for my morale, but makes it a lot less likely that I’ll find myself out of ink (or with a hand cramp) when I need to get something important written quickly. Currently, I’m using a True Writer ballpoint pen from Levenger that I got as a birthday present, but any pen that makes you feel good will do. —&lt;em&gt;Barbara Krasnoff, reviews editor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to make your home office a more pleasant place to work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lPy8KzlBzKS7Es3gv2eJj5o6ITM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70378168/VRG_ILL_4947_Pleasant_home_office.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Samar Haddad / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KRugiK"&gt;This pandemic has more people working from home than ever before, but it’s not all lollipops and daffodils. While there may have been some early excitement about not commuting or being breathed on by Chet the Xerox Tech, an actual home office can be downright depressing and / or uncomfortable. I should know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ue7mgc"&gt;As someone who has freelanced for the great majority of the last decade, I’ve worked from home nearly that whole time — even when home was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/15/16311668/how-to-live-your-best-vanlife"&gt;a camper van&lt;/a&gt; for more than five of those years. Yes, that was a tight space for a home office, but those constraints led me to refine my WFH game to keep my body healthy and my mind at least partially sane. Here are some of the tips (and items) that made the biggest difference for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lCf0Im"&gt;Desk setup&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="I0xo2R"&gt;If you only do one thing on this list, make sure your desk and chair are comfortable. That’s broad advice, but it kind of has to be, because each body is different. What you find comfortable might be a medieval torture device to me. Case in point: I once bought a desk online that had rave reviews, but it turns out that if my chair is set to the proper height, the front of the desk digs into my thighs. Not ideal! So, if at all possible, try to sit at a desk before you buy it. You might also consider &lt;a href="https://nymag.com/strategist/article/jarvis-standing-desk.html"&gt;a standing desk&lt;/a&gt; which increases the number of positions you can work from. Personally, I couldn’t find one that worked with the rest of my setup (I’m a sucker for lots of drawers).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TAqkkm"&gt;I’d argue that the chair is even more important than the desk. You’re going to want something ergonomic and with adjustable lumbar (lower back) support. Working hunched over &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2200681/"&gt;can &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003687016300515"&gt;destroy &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-15093-2"&gt;your &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://health.clevelandclinic.org/health-effects-of-poor-posture/"&gt;body&lt;/a&gt;, and your shoulders, your back, and your neck will all suffer. Chairs can cost a pretty penny, but they don’t have to. Craigslist, OfferUp, Nextdoor, and similar sites can be treasure troves for used office chairs. I read good things about the &lt;a href="https://www.hermanmiller.com/products/seating/office-chairs/aeron-chairs/"&gt;Herman Miller Aeron&lt;/a&gt;, so I went and tried it out in a store, then I found a gently used one on Craigslist for about 30 percent of the cost of a new one. You might also look into gaming chairs, as they are built for long periods of sitting. Just make sure it will fit with your desk. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="LuY9vH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Verge’s 2021 holiday gift guide for working from home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22746680/work-from-home-remote-office-holiday-gift-guide-2021-supplies-tech-gadgets"},{"title":"Our 14 favorite gadgets and hacks for working at home","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22252470/work-from-home-remote-gadgets-recommendations"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="vaGGQ4"&gt;Last for this section, let’s talk about what goes on top of your desk. Depending on the line of work you’re in, a second screen can be a real game-changer, so consider an extra monitor for your desktop or laptop. It allows for vastly easier multi-tasking with much less clicking around. If you use a laptop, it might be especially revelatory. Personally, I recently switched back to a desktop setup (a Dell tower with an Intel Core i7, an Nvidia RTX 3070 and 32GB of RAM, which has been great for photo and video editing as well as VR gaming breaks), and instead of two monitors, I went with one big one which I can divide into halves or quadrants. I chose the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeHomeOffice010422/https://www.dell.com/en-us/work/shop/dell-ultrasharp-32-4k-usb-c-monitor-u3219q/apd/210-aqzz/monitors-monitor-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Dell UltraSharp 32 4K monitor&lt;/a&gt;, and I’m in love with it. If you don’t photo or video edit, you may not need something that high-end. The point is to give yourself more space to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jGDnji"&gt;Light&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mhdi9g"&gt;There are a bunch of different studies that explore how different shades of light can impact our minds and bodies. They could affect everything from &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/emres/longhourstraining/color.html#:~:text=Blue%20light%20has%20the%20strongest,fall%20asleep%20and%20stay%20asleep."&gt;sleep quality&lt;/a&gt;, to alertness, to &lt;a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/08/130806203150.htm"&gt;mood&lt;/a&gt;, to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1779263/"&gt;our productivity at work&lt;/a&gt;. My best advice is to set up your office near a big window that gets decent light, but I know that isn’t always possible. The next best thing, in my view, is a set of color-changing lights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tv9GV5"&gt;Personally, I’ve been using &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cglNJrOC3ot" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Philips Hue&lt;/a&gt; for years, and I even set them up inside my van, back when that was my home. Philips spent a lot of time working on its light recipes, and the system comes pre-programmed with “Energize” and “Concentrate” settings that I genuinely find useful. Personally, I use Energize when I first wake up, then Concentrate (which is slightly warmer) for the bulk of my workday. When I’m ready to start winding down I’ll switch it over to the Reading setting, which I find warm and relaxing. There are a lot of other brands of color-changing lights out there, and if they don’t have presets like those I mentioned, you can experiment with different shades of light (bluer for more alertness, redder for relaxing, or something like that). It’s a small thing, but it really makes a huge difference in the way your home office feels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7FLKQD"&gt;Plants and animals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="LzIIP7"&gt;There is something about surrounding yourself with living things that makes your home office feel more natural and less like a sterile shoebox. Having a few houseplants can really change the feel of the whole room, and they can even make the air slightly fresher. I would recommend putting them near your desk, but also close enough to a window so they get plenty of light. If that’s an issue, you can get a hydroponic garden — for example, I recently got the small &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Frisegardens.com%2Fproducts%2Fpersonal-indoor-garden&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22867128%2Fhome-office-better-light-desk-chair-snacks-massage-plants" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Rise Garden&lt;/a&gt;. I am bad with plants, but it enabled me to grow lots of fresh herbs which made my apartment smell amazing. If that feels excessive (or expensive) then you can just start with this cool-looking &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https://www.thesill.com/products/snake-plant-laurentii?variant=32566716924009&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https://www.theverge.com/22746680/work-from-home-remote-office-holiday-gift-guide-2021-supplies-tech-gadgets&amp;amp;xcust=___vg__p_22510721__t_w__d_D" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;snake plant&lt;/a&gt; that we’re kind of obsessed with (it’s $35). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IdkkCe"&gt;As far as animals, I know a lot of people who adopted pandemic puppies and kittens. That’s cool, and maybe that’s a great fit for your life, but it definitely wasn’t for mine. So, I got a hummingbird feeder called &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CSH7VA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;psc=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the HummZinger&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A simple hummingbird feeder with several birds drinking at the flower-shaped holes." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/loBoIXWPwDkEAKqZxVCN3p1-3O4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23145255/414165.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Aspects&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HummZinger. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KwJQIQ"&gt;I got this one because it is simple, yet still has anti-ant and anti-fly protection. I am now obsessed. I can see the feeder from my desk, and whenever one of those little guys shows up, I stop what I’m doing and just watch. On days when I’m frying my eyeballs on my computer screen, it really helps me feel like I’m still a part of the natural cycle. You can get a regular bird feeder if you like, but I wasn’t interested in constantly cleaning bird poop off of my little outdoor space, and hummingbirds are nice and tidy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LChZF3"&gt;Take care of your body&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sP6Sat"&gt;Eliminating your commute may actually have some negative impacts on your body, especially if your commute involved some amount of walking or biking. These days you could conceivably not leave your home for days on end, and being that sedentary really isn’t good for you. Get up and move, and get your heart pumping. You don’t need a fancy home gym. Get a yoga mat and watch some YouTube workouts that require only your body weight. Force yourself to go for walks, even when you don’t wanna. Stretch! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xi7fiZ"&gt;I also tend to get a fair amount of knots in my shoulders (and in my legs if I actually go running). For those I really like the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fhyperice.com%2Fproducts%2Fhypervolt-2%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22867128%2Fhome-office-better-light-desk-chair-snacks-massage-plants" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Hypervolt 2&lt;/a&gt; massager. It is incredibly powerful, highly portable, and it comes with five different attachments for different stubborn muscles. Coming in at just under $300, it isn’t cheap, but it’s been worth it to me. The other thing I’m currently obsessed with is &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=38678&amp;amp;u1=VergeHomeOffice010522&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.llbean.com%2Fllb%2Fshop%2F65637%3Fpage%3Dmens-wicked-good-moccasins" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;this pair of slippers from LL Bean&lt;/a&gt;. They’re just so warm and comfy I pretty much work in them all day, and then lounge in them the rest of the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OZZzzV"&gt;Snacks and meals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dmKdFn"&gt;This is one of the trickiest items. Suddenly you have unfettered access to your fridge and snack cabinets, and it can be very tempting to just graze all day. So, what do you do? Here’s the strategy that has worked better for me than anything else: Fill your kitchen with healthy foods, and only healthy foods. Yep, really. If I wander into my kitchen, wanting a snack, and there are chips there, I’m going to eat those chips. But if I go there and the only snackable foods are carrots and sugar snaps, then that’s what I’m going to eat. Basically, I have to use my tendency toward slothfulness against my tendency for gluttony, and it really works!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sIO29e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I have to use my tendency toward slothfulness against my tendency for gluttony&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wdDXCu"&gt;Beyond the superficial reasons for eating healthier, doing so will lead to better, more sustainable energy levels, as opposed to spikes and crashes. Not only can I subjectively feel the difference, but when I recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22794594/levels-health-glucose-fitness-tracker-review" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;reviewed this continuous glucose monitoring system&lt;/a&gt; I was able to get hard data to back it up. When your kitchen is full of tasty but highly-processed foods, you have to have the willpower to make the healthy decision every time you want a snack. It’s easier to just be strong once, at the grocery store, and then you don’t have to make those tough decisions a dozen times a day in your own home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4fdwBu"&gt;Calling it a day&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="iZ68uz"&gt;You’ve got to know when it’s time to quit, and then you need to step away. This used to be a more delineated status for a lot of us: If you were at the office you were working, and if you weren’t at the office then it was your personal time. Working from home makes those lines a lot blurrier. It can easily feel like work never stops or that you always have to be reachable. Set some limits for yourself for your own mental health. Get your work done, and when office hours are over, get up, and walk away from your computer for a while. You’ll be happy you did, and you’ll come back to your “office” tomorrow more refreshed and ready to go. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y9iwjx"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPf0G1"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Logitech’s new stream light is an affordable, convenient alternative to Elgato</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m011ShhmrxwhlmiQtQs0iGKLotQ=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70378078/image.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="blA3sN"&gt;Logitech’s &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.logitech.com%2Fen-us%2Fproducts%2Flighting%2Flitra-glow.946-000001.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F1%2F12%2F22879811%2Flogitech-litra-glow-elgato" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Litra Glow&lt;/a&gt; is a small LED light that’s designed to illuminate you while you’re sitting at your desk. It’s designed primarily with content creators like Twitch streamers or YouTubers in mind, but should work just as well for smartening you up on a Zoom call. In other words, it looks like a competitor to &lt;a href="https://www.elgato.com/en/key-light-air"&gt;Elgato’s $129.99 Key Light Air&lt;/a&gt;, but at a more affordable $59.99 (€69) price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJKLPM"&gt;It’s not an identical accessory. Rather than having a large desk stand, the Litra Glow comes with a small mount to balance it on top of a monitor. It looks like it might be less versatile than the Key Light Air’s stand, but it could be more convenient if you want to reduce desk clutter. Power is provided via a USB-C port on its back. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MGohV5cs4-f2Gwu6uqUVOGr-4wE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23163163/tonzy_using_streaming_light.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Logitech&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The light can be mounted on a monitor, and has physical hardware controls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="0kRBHZ"&gt;Both brightness and color temperature are adjustable, and the Litra Glow comes with five presets for different scenarios. Its settings can be adjusted using controls on the back of the light, or there are software controls available via Logitech’s G Hub software. Here, you can set up custom presets, and control multiple Litra Glows simultaneously. The light also integrates with Logitech’s keyboards and mice (of course), which can be set to control it with any available macro buttons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aFS5s3"&gt;Logitech has been making a big push into the content creator market, and the Litra Glow is the latest evidence of this. The company has produced webcams alongside keyboards and mice for years, but more recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/7/30/17633144/logitech-acquires-blue-microphones-announcement"&gt;has acquired Blue Microphones&lt;/a&gt;, makers of the popular Yeti and Snowball USB mics, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/26/20886060/logitech-streamlabs-obs-acquisition-twitch"&gt;as well as Streamlabs&lt;/a&gt;, which produces streaming software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kzy0wp"&gt;The Litra Glow will be available  in the US, Canada, Australia and select countries in Europe from this month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lime launches its new electric bikes in Washington, DC as part of $50 million blitz</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J6g0DZ943HxU1opcvv9Tg1aN8wI=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70378017/DSC_0944.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Andrew J. Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ovjT90"&gt;Lime’s next-generation electric bikes are finally making their North American debut. Nearly a year after announcing its plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22303364/lime-ebike-expansion-new-cities-50-million-investment"&gt;spend $50 million on a major e-bike expansion&lt;/a&gt;, the San Francisco-based micromobility company says it will deploy the first wave of new bikes in Washington, DC, starting this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nbnKWo"&gt;Lime says the new bikes are significantly improved over the ones currently in service, which the company inherited from Jump after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/7/21250420/lime-funding-uber-deal-alphabet-scooter-jump-bike"&gt;acquiring the bike-share company from Uber&lt;/a&gt; in 2020. The $50 million investment will largely go toward designing, manufacturing, and assembling its next-generation bike, which start rolling out this year. The new model comes with a more powerful 350-watt motor and a swappable battery capable of up to 25 miles of range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qffORu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;350-watt motor and a swappable battery capable of up to 25 miles of range&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pu2Ffy"&gt;In addition to a new dual-speed automatic transmission, the bikes also feature swappable batteries that are interchangeable with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22627387/scooter-share-nyc-bronx-bike-lanes-injuries-lime-bird-veo"&gt;the company’s fleet of electric scooters&lt;/a&gt;. This will improve the customer experience, said Lime’s director of Mid-Atlantic and Northeast operations, by making it less likely that they’ll encounter vehicles with drained batteries. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zPrVca"&gt;“Now we can actually get the batteries quicker,” Lime’s Paul Holley told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “You don’t have as many low battery vehicles out in the field. Our task turnaround times are a lot quicker.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zT6tjckJChEE0HDDxwCzFit-9Ik=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23162079/DSC_0953.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Andrew J. Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="d2g02X"&gt;The swappable batteries are certainly the most important new feature in Lime’s next-gen e-bike. Lime views the ability to swap batteries between scooters and bikes as not just good for customers but also its own bottom line. Lime saves money both by simplifying its manufacturing process and operationally by reducing the amount of work that needs to be done by its teams working in each city. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xUKxBS"&gt;“When you unify that battery ecosystem and you isolate it to a single battery, what that really does is it increases the density of the work that needs to get done out in the field,” Holley said. “So now you don’t necessarily have to have two separate teams that are kind of just running out in their own lane and just doing their own thing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JDL1ks"&gt;Not every scooter and bike company is convinced. Bird, for example, has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22455384/bird-electric-scooter-third-gen-emergency-braking-battery"&gt;staked out an opposing position&lt;/a&gt;, arguing swappable batteries are typically smaller and hold less charge than non-swappable ones. The company has also argued that swappable batteries have a larger carbon footprint because they require more vehicle miles traveled to retrieve, replace, and recharge scooters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8jRGsY"&gt;Holley argued that swappable batteries don’t necessarily translate into less power or lower range; Lime can choose to install larger batteries if it wants. “We can do that within the context and the confines of a swappable battery ecosystem,” he said. “You can go up and down in terms of size and range and amp hours and all those types of things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="cfSHQA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Not every scooter and bike company is convinced swappable batteries are the solution&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mpK35U"&gt;There are other new features on the bike: the handlebars are being replaced with ones similar to Lime’s scooters, there’s a phone holder in the front basket, and the bike will be able to hit speeds of up to 20mph (depending on local regulations). It weighs 72 pounds, which is heavier than the 65-pound electric Citi Bikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7BESP9"&gt;I got a chance to try out one of Lime’s new bikes late last year. Riding the bike over from Brooklyn to Lower Manhattan, I was impressed by the motor’s ability to dole out power. The boost was nearly instantaneous as far as I could tell, without any of the jerkiness or slow motor build-up of some lesser e-bikes. It’s far from the sexiest e-bike I’ve ever ridden, but that’s by design since Lime’s e-bikes are built for power, stability, and durability. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z7CogR"&gt;That said, I don’t think people who use bike-share will abandon their preferred e-bikes and flock to Lime’s new models. Bike-share is a tool of convenience, and customers generally use the bike that’s nearest to their location. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QazEAe"&gt;Lime will keep its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355020/lime-jump-ebikes-app-share-rent-uber-scrapped"&gt;cherry-red Jump bikes in operation&lt;/a&gt;, with no plans to phase those out in favor of the new Lime-branded e-bikes. The company has stated that it wants to be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538190/lime-scooter-ceo-interview-covid-future-200-million-rides"&gt;a multimodal provider of many different types of low-speed, electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. In 2020, Lime added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21506805/lime-wheels-app-integrate-scooter-bike-mobility"&gt;pedal-less e-bikes from Wheels&lt;/a&gt; to its app in several cities as part of a new effort to integrate third-party micromobility providers. And it also rolled out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22248805/lime-electric-moped-scooter-niu-washington-paris"&gt;electric mopeds&lt;/a&gt; in several markets, including Paris and Washington, DC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J1T3qj"&gt;It’s great to see Lime investing in new technical specifications in an effort to broaden the offerings it has available in its app. Scooters are good for tourists or people who are out for a short jaunt. But bikes are better for longer distances, and e-bikes, in particular, are great at replacing car trips. In that respect, Lime will have a real powerful tool in its arsenal for its broader campaign to promote electric, zero tailpipe-emission transportation. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Wyze’s security camera pay-what-you-want subscription accepts $0</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8ixKE1calLITAsumkOocGDVSJXM=/0x0:1599x1066/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70377904/Wyze_Labs_Inc_WyzeCam.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Wyze security camera.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Wyze&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tol4R4"&gt;Wyze has officially launched a new pay-what-you-want subscription tier for its lineup of home security cameras called Cam Plus Lite. In a &lt;a href="https://forums.wyzecam.com/t/we-re-giving-wyze-person-detection-to-all-users-at-whatever-price-you-want-1-11-22/211282"&gt;forum post&lt;/a&gt;, the company explains that Cam Plus Lite includes Person Detection, which alerts you when it detects a human being rather than just motion, as well as cloud recordings that are limited to 12 seconds in length, with a 5 minute cooldown period between them. Users can choose to pay as little as $0 a month for the new tier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GzDtm6"&gt;Wyze also says it’s removing the 32GB microSD card size limit on its cameras, and is adding new rewind and skip buttons to make it easier to scrub through locally-saved footage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XcXfiz"&gt;Regarding subscriptions, Wyze started experimenting with its pay-what-you-want model for its person detection feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/20/21331974/wyze-cam-ai-person-detection-free-pay-what-you-want-model-experiment"&gt;back in 2020&lt;/a&gt;, hoping (correctly) that some users would be willing to pay to allow Wyze to provide the service for free to others. Person detection was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/9/20687708/wyze-cam-people-detection-xnor-ai-firmware-update-announcement"&gt;originally added as a free service in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but the company was forced to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/27/20985527/wyze-person-detection-ai-startup-canceled-removed-dropped"&gt;temporarily remove it the following year&lt;/a&gt; after the company providing its AI technology terminated its licensing deal &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21067594/apple-acquires-xnor-ai-wyze-camera-people-detection-feature"&gt;when it was acquired by Apple&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9kSPqB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cam Plus Lite sits below Cam Plus and Cam Plus Pro&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JIzTnZ"&gt;Smart home companies are currently split on whether to charge for person detection. Google and Eufy currently offer similar features for free, while Arlo and Ring charge. Wyze’s big selling point has always been the affordability of its security cameras, and the $0 payment option helps to preserve that. Its Wyze Cam v3, for example, is currently &lt;a href="https://wyze.com/wyze-cam.html"&gt;on sale for just $35.98&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0xbYSj"&gt;Cam Plus Lite sits below &lt;a href="https://support.wyze.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415235558939-How-does-Cam-Plus-Lite-compare-to-Cam-Plus-and-Pro-"&gt;Wyze’s other existing subscription tiers&lt;/a&gt;: Cam Plus and Cam Plus Pro. Cam Plus costs $1.99 per camera per month and removes the 12-second limit and 5-minute cooldown on cloud recordings while expanding the AI detection feature to also recognize packages, pets, and vehicles. Cam Plus Pro, meanwhile, costs $3.99 per camera per month and includes 24/7 professional monitoring, as well as the ability to recognize specific faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="luKnnE"&gt;Cam Plus Lite will be &lt;a href="https://support.wyze.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415190129691-Is-Cam-Plus-Lite-the-same-as-Name-Your-Price-"&gt;available for&lt;/a&gt; Wyze Cam v2 and v3, Wyze Cam Pan v1 and v2, and Wyze Cam Outdoor. That’s an &lt;a href="https://support.wyze.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415190129691-Is-Cam-Plus-Lite-the-same-as-Name-Your-Price-"&gt;expansion compared to the cameras&lt;/a&gt; that had access to the previous pay-what-you-want subscription, which only included the Wyze Cam v2 and Wyze Cam Pan v1. Cam Plus Lite support for Wyze video doorbells will be coming soon, the company says. According to &lt;a href="https://support.wyze.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051682391-Can-I-use-Person-Detection-outside-the-US-"&gt;its FAQ&lt;/a&gt;, Person Detection is not available outside of the US.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PCIe 6.0 is coming for the speedy SSDs and GPUs of the future</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QdeVMsGIbN6po_nyF9ZRTORefvQ=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70377900/pciexpress6.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CsEKcU"&gt;PCI Express 5.0 has only just started arriving on the consumer side, but the specification for PCIe 6.0 has just been finalized. The PCI Special Interest Group has published the &lt;a href="https://pcisig.com/pci-express-6.0-specification"&gt;final specs for PCIe 6.0&lt;/a&gt;, doubling the bandwidth over the 5.0 version up to a theoretical maximum bidirectional speed of 256GBps on an x16 slot (128GBps in a single direction).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NwYQvk"&gt;The first super fast &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/23/22851422/samsung-adata-pcie-5-0-ssd-ces-speed-date"&gt;PCIe 5.0 SSDs appeared&lt;/a&gt; just before this year’s Consumer Electronics Show, promising read speeds of up to 14GBps. That was already twice what we’re used to seeing with PCIe 4.0 drives, and with the doubling PCIe 6.0 brings we’d expect to see SSDs offer up to 28GBps in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KJJp3R5twPwQPtYysMp9uxIBxzM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23162982/wxCNoas.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: PCI Special Interest Group&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;PCIe 6.0 vs. existing PCIe specifications.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="i1DnLR"&gt;The PCI Special Interest Group has achieved the doubling of PCI Express speeds around every three years ever since the original introduction of the spec in 2003. PCIe 6.0 has overhauled the signaling technology to achieve the bandwidth gains this time, while maintaining low latency. It’s a move that &lt;a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/17203/pcie-60-specification-finalized-x16-slots-to-reach-128gbps"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Anandtech &lt;/em&gt;describes&lt;/a&gt; as “a more significant overhaul, arguably the largest in the history of the standard.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KC9vcx"&gt;The PCIe 6.0 architecture also maintains compatibility with all previous generations of PCIe. That will allow any existing hardware that uses earlier specifications to work in PCIe 6.0 hosts, and it will certainly help with adoption and the transition to this new specification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f7pXmT"&gt;While PCIe 5.0 is still in its infancy and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860374/intel-samsung-ces-2022-demo-pcie-5-0-ssd-setup-speed-test"&gt;being demonstrated with enterprise-grade SSDs&lt;/a&gt;, we shouldn’t expect to see PCIe 6.0 hardware for another 12 to 18 months. That means some servers will likely start to use the new spec at some point in 2023, with consumer hardware to follow in 2024 or 2025. Until then, get ready to hear a lot more about PCIe 5.0 SSDs, GPUs, and more throughout 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest phishing scam to watch out for: fraudulent QR codes on parking meters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Parking Meters On City Street In Reading Pennsylvania" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/maGG1bJ4Sq1NDlbdr_7LTqpfrB0=/0x108:4400x3041/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70377884/1331145067.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ben Hasty/MediaNews Group/Reading Eagle via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PzC1FZ"&gt;Police in several US cities are warning residents not to pay for their parking using QR codes stuck to parking meters. That’s because these codes have been placed there by scammers, who are using them to direct people to fraudulent sites that capture their payment details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4x9t0U"&gt;Warnings have been issued by law enforcement in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Austin_Police/status/1478122920371232770"&gt;Austin&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SATXPolice/status/1473025923951775755"&gt;San Antonio&lt;/a&gt; over the holiday period (we spotted the story &lt;a href="https://theoverspill.blog/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Overspill&lt;/em&gt; newsletter&lt;/a&gt;). Police say they discovered a number of stickers with illicit codes appearing on parking meters, while a report by local news site &lt;a href="https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2022/01/05/qr-code-scammers-hitting-on-street-parking-in-texas-cities-this-is-what-houston-officials-want-you-to-know/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click2Houston&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows how one of the fraudulent codes directed people to a site promising “quick pay parking.” (The site now appears to be offline.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i7nc2t"&gt;Police are advising anyone who inadvertently enters their credit card details into one of these sites to file a police report and contact their card vendor to reverse any payments. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ssWOco"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt; Scam Alert &lt;br&gt;APD Financial Crimes detectives are investigating after fraudulent QR code stickers were discovered on City of Austin public parking meters. People attempting to pay for parking using those QR codes may have been directed to a fraudulent website and made a payment. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Gb8gytCYn7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Gb8gytCYn7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Austin Police Department (@Austin_Police) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Austin_Police/status/1478122920371232770?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 3, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CXAiwF"&gt;Although once derided as an outdated technology, QR codes have become &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/28/style/qr-codes.html"&gt;increasingly visible&lt;/a&gt; in the West over the past few years. These two-dimensional barcodes are able to store snippets of data but are commonly used to direct people to URLs. They’ve been a staple of digital payments in Asia for many years, but have been embraced in the West during the pandemic, used to link people to restaurant menus, report vaccination status, and check in to locations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CblYnQ"&gt;The convenience of QR codes (QR stands for “quick response”) is balanced by their lack of security. Although the code itself cannot be comprised, it can be used to direct people to fraudulent or dangerous sites, as with the parking meter scam. There’s no way for a human to “read” a QR code, and preview URLs created by mobile devices are often ambiguous at best. That makes them ripe targets for surprise or malicious redirects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bi4ZjU"&gt;The advice for avoiding these scams is the same as for any phishing fraud: check the URL of the website you’ve been sent to for misspellings or less-than-professional design (not always a useful tell when it comes to local government sites). And in the case of parking fees, look for official apps which are commonly used in US cities to make such payments.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Wordle clones have disappeared from the App Store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2zZmq0Lstg1m_wcC2YCTG26fErM=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70377148/VRG_ILLO_4536_001_7.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Earlier today, the App Store was overflowing with games ripping off a viral web app. &lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QLIZAP"&gt;Has Apple taken action against apps that cloned the popular web game Wordle? They have now disappeared from the App Store, after &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/11/psa-wordle-clone-with-annual-subscription-is-the-latest-rip-off-to-hit-the-app-store/"&gt;several&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/wordle-copycat-app-store-twitter"&gt;publications&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878752/wordle-app-store-review-copies-advertisements-in-app-purchase"&gt;including &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;) called out a flood of copycats so blatant as to be named “Wordle” and that featured the same gameplay and UI, each taking advantage of the fact that developer Josh Wardle didn’t create an Apple app of his own. While we’re still seeing a few clones on the App Store, they don’t use the Wordle name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMeMb6"&gt;The clone apps had a spotlight shone on them today, when one developer &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/tech-dude-rips-off-wordle-angers-internet-1848341422"&gt;started bragging about how many downloads his version of Wordle was getting&lt;/a&gt;. Following some intense backlash from the community, he set his account to private, but people had already started finding many other apps like it on the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The search results for Wordle at 8:08PM ET — the first results are now an app from five years ago, and a story about Words With Friends 2.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fdr2q4"&gt;Apple didn’t immediately respond to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for confirmation that it was the one that took action against the Wordle-alikes, but it seems vanishingly unlikely that each developer decided to take down their app in the space of about an hour. If Apple really is initiating a crackdown on the apps, it’s tipping the scales significantly to protect the original game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KGNEZ"&gt;While there have been similar high-profile situations in the past — &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/wordle-clone-ios-mobile-gaming"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5401552/the-weird-world-of-flappy-bird-clones"&gt;Flappy Bird&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/3/28/5556760/threes-developer-releases-emails-showing-work-in-reply-to-clones"&gt;Threes vs 2048&lt;/a&gt; come to mind — it’s hard to think of a recent example where Apple stepped in as heavily as it seems to have done today. Apple &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#copycats"&gt;does have language about copycats in its developer guidelines&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s notably vague: “Come up with your own ideas,” section 4.1 reads. “Don’t simply copy the latest popular app on the App Store, or make some minor changes to another app’s name or UI and pass it off as your own.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ooG9T"&gt;There have been &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/06/21/apple-goes-after-clones-and-spam-on-the-app-store/"&gt;questions about how Apple would deal with blatant clones&lt;/a&gt;, as it’s seemingly let things slide in some instances. With disappearance of the Wordle-alikes from the App Store, we may have gotten a precedent for how similar is too similar. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Verizon, AT&amp;T, and T-Mobile say they’re not blocking Apple’s iCloud Private Relay</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bVCnW6IcjHg1auWUvneXHpkTC_U=/128x0:1073x630/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70376980/og__ishslgdhhimq.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gsPVr9"&gt;T-Mobile, Verizon, and AT&amp;amp;T — the three biggest US cellular carriers — have all confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that they aren’t blocking Apple’s new iCloud Private Relay feature, following reports that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877211/t-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block"&gt;some customers were having issues&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877211/t-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block"&gt;with the VPN-like feature&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjO0fq"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T and Verizon straight-up say they’re not blocking the feature from functioning. Verizon spokesperson George L. Koroneos confirms that Private Relay works on both cellular and Fios internet connections, and AT&amp;amp;T spokesperson Seth Bloom says the carrier’s policy is not to block Private Relay. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9IG6Sn"&gt;T-Mobile’s situation is a little more complex: most customers shouldn’t have any issues with iCloud Private Relay. But those who use content filtering services (like the carrier’s Family Controls) won’t be able to use iCloud Private Relay, the carrier tells us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fa5X2u"&gt;“Customers who chose plans and features with content filtering (e.g. parent controls) do not have access to the iCloud Private Relay to allow these services to work as designed. All other customers have no restrictions,” T-Mobile spokesperson Bennet Ladyman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. That tracks with Apple’s messaging around the feature, which notes that “Networks that require the ability to audit traffic or perform network-based filtering will block access to Private Relay.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="uuaZLl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"T-Mobile identifies issue that prevented some iPhone users from using Private Relay","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22877211/t-mobile-iphone-private-relay-block"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="X5VL8i"&gt;T-Mobile’s spokesperson also told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the carrier &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; find an issue with Apple’s recent iOS 15.2 update that caused iCloud Private Relay to be toggled off following the update. “Overnight our team identified that in the 15.2 iOS release, some device settings default to the feature being toggled off. We have shared this with Apple. This is not specific to T-Mobile.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LnIzGG"&gt;If the problem really is on Apple’s end, it could also explain the issues that some Verizon or AT&amp;amp;T customers may have been experiencing in the wake of the update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o68AKN"&gt;That said, it’s possible that carriers may sour on supporting Apple’s privacy feature in the future. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fbusiness%2F2022%2F01%2F09%2Fapple-fire-iphone-encryption-tech%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22878885%2Fverizon-att-t-mobile-apple-icloud-private-relay-feature-supported" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Telegraph&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Vodafone, Telefonica, Orange, and T-Mobile have all signed a joint letter asking the European Commission to block Private Relay, arguing that the feature is “cutting off other networks and servers from accessing vital network data and metadata, including those operators in charge of the connectivity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hZv0Sy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;iCloud Private Relay&lt;/a&gt; is similar in many ways to a VPN, working to automatically mask your internet traffic from both Apple, your ISP, and anyone else trying to snoop around what you’re doing online. The feature is still in beta but is currently available to anyone subscribing to a paid iCloud plan — although Apple doesn’t keep it toggled on by default, at least for now. There are other limitations, too: Private Relay won’t let you spoof your internet as coming from outside your rough geographic area (a popular use for VPNs to get around national or regional content limits), and it only works in Apple’s own Safari browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Apm9t5"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The App Store clones are here to profit off Wordle’s success</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Lw21bUEW8l0kQjcVdBZ7XBEnmGI=/16x0:1110x729/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70376898/IMG_3664.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Copies of the popular web app have made it past App Review.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Oddcq1"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/"&gt;Wordle&lt;/a&gt;, the word-guessing puzzle game that’s &lt;a href="https://www.bostonglobe.com/2022/01/09/lifestyle/what-is-wordle-why-is-everyone-twitter-playing-it/"&gt;taken over our Twitter timelines&lt;/a&gt;, doesn’t currently have an official app. That may come as a surprise to anyone who’s searched for it on the App Store, though — earlier today, doing so would show you several blatant unofficial copies, each of which use the same name and mechanics as the original, which &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/11/wordle-creator-overwhelmed-by-global-success-of-hit-puzzle"&gt;was made by Josh Wardle&lt;/a&gt; and distributed on the web for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iobEAS"&gt;Most people who’ve been online recently will have had at least some exposure to Wordle if they haven’t been playing it themselves (&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2022/jan/11/wordle-creator-overwhelmed-by-global-success-of-hit-puzzle"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; it has 2 million daily players). It’s a simple concept but done well: each day, you go to the Wordle website, where you’re given five chances to guess a five-letter word. The game gives you feedback about what letters you’ve put in the right place, what letters are in the word, but not in the order you’ve picked and what letters aren’t in the correct answer. Certain parts of Twitter have been taken over by black, green, and yellow square emojis, which players use to show off their gameplay without spoiling the word of the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="io8n5e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As with many good viral ideas, Wordle has spawned waves of parodies and memes&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sVgm5Z"&gt;As happens to most good ideas (especially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5401552/the-weird-world-of-flappy-bird-clones"&gt;the ones that go viral&lt;/a&gt;), there have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2022/1/11/22877996/wordle-spoofs-alternatives-letterle-sweardle-queerdle"&gt;several clever parodies of Wordle&lt;/a&gt;, along with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Fobwashed/status/1480975713620541440"&gt;waves of jokes&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter using the emoji block format that players use to share their scores. But while many of the parody versions point users back to the original, this doesn’t seem to be the case for the versions on the App Store. Instead, they try their best to look like the web version without mentioning that they’re actually a spin-off. Trying out five versions of the game from the App Store, only one seemed to acknowledge Wardle’s version — ironically, it was one of the few that didn’t actually call itself Wordle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GOchjE"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10973311"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="7978Mo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data="{&amp;quot;stories&amp;quot;:[{&amp;quot;title&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;The weird world of 'Flappy Bird' clones&amp;quot;,&amp;quot;url&amp;quot;:&amp;quot;https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5401552/the-weird-world-of-flappy-bird-clones&amp;quot;}]}"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="9wtMf3"&gt;The situation is a little embarrassing for Apple, which has often cited its high standards and App Review process as a reason it should be allowed to keep control over which apps run on iPhones and iPads. The review process has been called into question by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454468/ios-app-scam-review-3-star-force-review-process-apple"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;scams&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22654197/apple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds"&gt;controversies&lt;/a&gt;, but these feel especially blatant — they’re using the same name and have an extremely similar interface to the original. It’s easy to see many people being tricked into thinking that they’re playing an official version.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bEfdJN"&gt;Even worse is that the apps are copying a website, months after Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417725/apple-vs-epic-full-trial-slideshows-opening-arguments"&gt;championed&lt;/a&gt; progressive web apps in court as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22421912/iphone-web-app-pwa-cloud-gaming-epic-v-apple-safari"&gt;an option for developers during its legal battle with Epic Games&lt;/a&gt;. That argument may fall flat with developers targeting mobile audiences. As Owen Williams, a UX manager, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ow/status/1480984480538005504?s=20"&gt;points out on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, they won’t even get a seat at the table when someone searches for their creation on the App Store (which is something a lot of people might do if they, say, see a flurry of tweets with the name of a Cool New Thing everyone’s playing with).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tyno2K"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If Apple and Google were *actually* allowing proper competition, you’d be able to register a PWA/web app in their stores if you choose that route instead of a native app. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But uh, that doesn’t help build their walled gardens so we get…this&lt;/p&gt;— Owen Williams ⚡ (@ow) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ow/status/1480984480538005504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 11, 2022&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vqJ57J"&gt;To add insult to injury, it appears that Wordle clones aren’t nearly as rampant on Google’s Play Store. Only one of the first two dozen search results for “wordle” appeared to be a clone, and it was buried deep behind a “show more” button. Google Play reports the app has “500+ downloads” — the developer behind one of the Wordle clones on iOS claimed to be getting 5,400 downloads an hour on Twitter, and their version wasn’t even in the top three search results. (The same developer tweeted a screenshot of a notification saying that their app was waiting for review, with the caption “let’s see what Apple thinks” prior to the app going live.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LibNuw"&gt;Wardle hasn’t monetized his version of Wordle with ads, subscriptions, one-time payments, or a tip jar. It’s totally free. According to &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html"&gt;a profile in &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, he made the game for his partner, who enjoyed crossword puzzles. “I think people kind of appreciate that there’s this thing online that’s just fun,” Wardle said of Wordle’s success. “It’s not trying to do anything shady with your data or your eyeballs. It’s just a game that’s fun.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="3yUEzd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re going to the fucking moon”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hkZLp8"&gt;The Wordle apps I tried haven’t copied the original’s lack of a monetization scheme. Some showed a plethora of ads, often with the option of paying to remove them, and one even had a $30-a-year in-app purchase to unlock the “Pro” version. (That particular app’s developer said on their now-private Twitter account that the app was “going to the fucking moon” and that one of their goals for 2022 was to “make tons of fucking money.”) Paying would let you choose how many letters you wanted in the words and would allow multiple games a day. As &lt;a href="https://slate.com/culture/2022/01/wordle-game-online-free-explained.html"&gt;many have noted&lt;/a&gt;, the real Wordle’s once-a-day play is another one of the things that makes it so appealing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ugXCOB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Added a share button to Wordle that generates a spoiler-free emoji grid for you. Shoutout to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/irihapeta?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@irihapeta&lt;/a&gt; for inventing such a cool way to share your results each day.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛&lt;br&gt; ⬛  ⬛&lt;br&gt;     &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Wordle 180 3/6&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Try it out: &lt;a href="https://t.co/pZTmeT1p7E"&gt;https://t.co/pZTmeT1p7E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Josh Wardle (@powerlanguish) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/powerlanguish/status/1471493886031773707?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OYMB2N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wordle’s developer explaining the game’s share function.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I3SU7O"&gt;Most of the apps I tried didn’t have any obvious copies of the original’s share feature, which lets you easily copy a series of spoiler-free blocks to share with friends or on social media. The one that offered the $30 subscription, however, did — adding a few extra words and saying “The Wordle App” in place of Wordle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tqv7X7"&gt;Keeping blatant copies off the App Store might not be an easy moderation task if Apple wanted to do it — for example, there are a few games on the App Store that share the “Wordle” name but not gameplay. However, they’re pretty obviously not trying to capitalize on a trend by copying a popular app — many of them haven’t been updated in years (and are therefore not likely requiring any judgment calls from App Review). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VdUXQ"&gt;It appears that Apple has decided to try, though. Roughly an hour after we published this post, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1481063416630583300"&gt;we heard&lt;/a&gt; that the clones had started disappearing from the App Store. All the ones we saw that used the word “Wordle” in their title are now gone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZdiT6Q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reached out to both Apple and one of the developers behind a Wordle clone. Neither responded to our request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hw18VC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 7:50PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added that Wordle clones are now disappearing from the App Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
