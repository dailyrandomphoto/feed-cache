    <title>Workhorse starts federal court fight over lost USPS contract</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/w6Kwes6X1tJrTPbdDGSnA8oAXz8=/0x427:2560x2134/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69463950/NGDVsideView_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: USPS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="34ukEI"&gt;EV startup Workhorse has filed an official protest after losing the bid to make the United States Postal Service’s next-generation mail vehicle in February, a contract that could ultimately be worth some $6 billion. The USPS instead gave that contract to defense contractor Oshkosh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rtTrTQ"&gt;The Ohio-based company filed a bid protest in the US Court of Federal Claims on Wednesday. The complaint is currently sealed, though a judge could ultimately rule to make some parts of it public, as Workhorse also filed a redacted version of the complaint that could be made public.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vi07wJ"&gt;The bid protest kicks off a high-profile court fight over the contract for the next-generation mail truck, and could have an impact on how and when those vehicles switch over to electric power — something President Biden has said he wants across the federal fleet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="92yMFj"&gt;“While we do not comment on active litigation, the United States Postal Service is looking forward to the start of vehicle production for our Next Generation Delivery Vehicle (NGDV),” Kim Frum, senior public relations representative for the USPS said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Preproduction design, tooling, and facility preparation activities are proceeding on schedule with the first NGDVs estimated to appear on carrier routes in 2023.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7svFeJ"&gt;“While bid protests are a normal part of the government contracting process, we do not comment on such proceedings,” Alexandra C. Hittle, Oshkosh Defense’s director of global marketing and communications, said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “We are proud that the USPS selected Oshkosh Defense to fulfill the needs of the NGDV program and we look forward to getting these highly capable vehicles into the hands of mail carriers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ilMKzY"&gt;Workhorse was one of three companies that submitted final bids to the USPS last year, and was the only one proposing to build an entirely electric mail fleet. The Postal Service and Oshkosh &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297823/usps-postal-service-mail-truck-electric-oshkosh-workhorse"&gt;revealed the new vehicle in February&lt;/a&gt;, and said that it is designed to run on both gas and electric drivetrains. The defense contractor has said the gas vehicles will be “fuel-efficient [and] low-emission” but has not qualified those claims. Oshkosh agreed to build between 50,000 to 165,000 of the trucks over 10 years, but the USPS says it needs billions more in funding from Congress in order to tip the balance of the fleet more towards electric. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9kA99l"&gt;In requesting that the complaint be sealed, Workhorse &lt;a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940/gov.uscourts.uscfc.43940.5.0.pdf"&gt;told the court&lt;/a&gt; that the document “contains confidential and proprietary source selection and proposal information” about its bid, and that future filings will or are likely to contain similar information about competitors’ bids. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wlclLT"&gt;But of the options that were on Workhorse’s table, this one may prove the most effective at helping the company’s legal team understand why the USPS went with Oshkosh. “They will get to see everything, the whole file, how [the bids were] evaluated, the award memo,” a person familiar with the Postal Service’s contracting process told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;earlier this year. That process will likely take place under a protective order, though, so Workhorse’s lawyers may ultimately only be able to tell the company whether or not they have a good chance at winning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ANIrLe"&gt;Oshkosh has said it is still finalizing the design of the new vehicle, and that they won’t hit the road until 2023. The USPS agreed to invest $482 million up front to help ready the new vehicle. Oshkosh had worked with Ford during the bidding process, but the automaker has repeatedly declined to comment on whether it was involved in the defense contractor’s final pitch, which looks much different from spy shots of earlier prototypes based off the Transit van.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwazYi"&gt;The USPS set out to replace the current mail truck in 2015 with a plan to put the new vehicles on the road by 2018. It originally selected six companies (or teams of companies) to work up prototypes. But the bid process dragged on for years. A &lt;a href="https://www.trucks.com/2020/08/31/inspector-generals-report-details-new-mail-truck-program-problems/"&gt;2020 report&lt;/a&gt; from the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) detailed why: a lot of the prototypes were awful and broke down. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="3uBW6V"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How the USPS mail trucks could still go fully electric","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22423179/usps-mail-trucks-electric-oshkosh"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ZgxkoO"&gt;Replacing the current mail trucks has only become more of a pressing issue, though. Built by defense contractor Grumman, many of the so-called Long Life Vehicles have blown past their life expectancies. That has left them either breaking down, which is costing the USPS a fortune, or in some cases catching on fire. Even the Long Life Vehicles that are able to stay on the road lack modern amenities like advanced safety features and even air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Mlr4d"&gt;Beyond the OIG report, there has been little insight into the USPS’s decision to go with Oshkosh. The bid process was incredibly opaque, to the point that Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OH) called it a “black box” in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OjImk8"&gt;Workhorse itself has said very little since it lost the bid in February, but the USPS apparently still took issue with some of the company’s communications. In the request to seal the complaint filed Wednesday, Workhorse says the USPS believes the company breached its NDA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C2qb44"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epR5CE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hA0CRH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to find the best deals during Prime Day 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WUBuNWJBVBc2Tx1giH_XhGHijgk=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67609533/acastro_180329_1777_amazon_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EkLaRj"&gt;Outside of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/black-friday"&gt;Black Friday&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/cyber-monday"&gt;Cyber Monday&lt;/a&gt;, Prime Day has become one of the biggest shopping events of the year. It’s a two-day stretch wherein Amazon Prime members will likely find some of the best prices yet on popular tech products like video games, gaming peripherals, laptops, 4K TVs, phones, PC accessories, and more. The COVID-19 pandemic pushed Prime Day 2020 from July to October, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/amazon-prime-day-deals-tech"&gt;Prime Day 2021&lt;/a&gt; is back on a somewhat normal schedule, happening on Monday, June 21st, and Tuesday, June 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="teS08W"&gt;If you’re shopping for Prime Day deals on Amazon, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21493780/amazon-prime-sign-up-day-deals-sale-price-free"&gt;you’ll need to sign up for Amazon Prime&lt;/a&gt;, however, not all of the best Prime Day 2021 deals will live on Amazon. Many other retailers, including Walmart and Target, will also be running competing deals that we’ll tell you all about in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22535681/amazon-prime-day-tech-news-deals-date-time-2021"&gt;our deals coverage&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="zfAZ5B"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best early Prime Day deals","url":"https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/22533316/prime-day-early-deals-tech-headphones-tvs-echo-dot-show-luna"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pnndf2"&gt;You can count on us to publish only the best deals, but if you want to be among the first people to know about price drops on products you’re already interested in, you’ll want to get set up with a price-tracking site. We’ve included a few of our favorite examples below, pointing out how each can help you track deals in slightly different ways, with their own special features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlTdWR"&gt;All of them are free to use, and once you’ve added products that you’re interested in, you can rest easy knowing that you don’t need to take any action until it comes time to make a purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t0LPoCM3D3T2dKA3LW70zOG7yBQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21943223/camel.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Dhsh5E"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/"&gt;CamelCamelCamel&lt;/a&gt; is the best tracker for Amazon products&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="PWZiHK"&gt;CamelCamelCamel tracks the price of every product sold on Amazon and can send you alerts when they reach the price that’s right for you. Once a product reaches the desired price you’ve set, or lower, you’ll get an email about it. CamelCamelCamel &lt;em&gt;only &lt;/em&gt;works for products on Amazon, however, so you’ll need to use a different one below if you want to track price movement on Walmart, Best Buy, and other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Ipb7m"&gt;To track prices and get alerts via email, you’ll need to create a free account. Also, I suggest installing the &lt;a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/camelizer"&gt;site’s browser extension&lt;/a&gt;, called The Camelizer, which lets you see pricing trends on a product-by-product basis and allows you to set your desired price without navigating away from Amazon. It’s fantastic and easy to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HzRYbg"&gt;As soon as one of the products falls below the amount set on your price alert, you’ll instantly get an email. And if you already have a wishlist saved on Amazon, &lt;a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/wishlists/edit"&gt;you can import it&lt;/a&gt; into CamelCamelCamel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gvM1NZk6vUmj2H818mP3eqTQUxQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19348920/honey.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="vxj695"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.joinhoney.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21502865%2Famazon-prime-day-best-deals-how-to-find" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Honey&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="dqWddk"&gt;Like CamelCamelCamel, the Honey browser extension can track the prices of items that you’re interested in, and it will alert you when it finds a deal. However, unlike the price-tracking site above, Honey will also scour each site you visit for offer codes that can be applied to your checkout total to save you even more money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i9wtzY"&gt;Honey works with Amazon and many other retailers, and you can add items to your “Droplist,” which is basically just a wishlist. On Best Buy, for example, the option to add an item to your list pops up on the product’s image, and you can select the price watch duration as well as the percentage off you’re looking for.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7eGFtm6xPqsgiWutu9lchE7EJzI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19348921/slickdeals.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ARTuv7"&gt;&lt;a href="https://slickdeals.net/deal-alerts/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pByL6H"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Slickdeals &lt;/em&gt;aggregates some of the best deals around the internet, as discovered by its team and community of users. The site also allows you to create deal alerts based on keywords, but they work a little differently on &lt;em&gt;Slickdeals &lt;/em&gt;than they do with the above sites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SvOBPA"&gt;You can type in a product name, like “Nintendo Switch” or a retailer’s name, and once it’s added to your list, you’ll be notified of a deal alert if it meets your criteria. You can set it to alert you to literally any deal relating to your keyword, or you can filter out deals so that you’ll be notified if, for example, the deal is popular enough to make it to &lt;em&gt;Slickdeals&lt;/em&gt;’ front page or if it earned a high rating from the community. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oOsUhFjytA9Q9b4Ha8yBF0F6XU4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19348917/pcpartpicker.0.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tjeV6O"&gt;&lt;a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/list/"&gt;PC Part Picker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="m5XXbL"&gt;As you might have guessed by the name, PC Part Picker helps you pick PC components that are compatible with each other, making the already daunting task of piecing together a DIY PC setup a little easier. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LmbwDP"&gt;That by itself makes it a crucial tool, but it’s also an excellent price tracker, showing you a detailed graph that illustrates the current and prior movement in price for a particular component. It lets you build the PC of your dreams, and it can &lt;a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/products/pricedrop/"&gt;alert you via email to price drops&lt;/a&gt; from big retailers like Amazon, Best Buy, Newegg, B&amp;amp;H Photo, and more. That way, you can, say, choose to wait to buy everything until that processor or graphics card comes down to a lower price you know it has hit before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4wY7hy"&gt;Look outside of Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sqLCaU"&gt;Prime Day is an event that shows off Amazon’s huge retail presence, so naturally, other retail chains take notice. Because of this, you can sometimes find better deals at Best Buy, Target, Walmart, and Newegg, all of which have announced they’ll be offering a slew of deals during Prime Day. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DMUGIk"&gt;If Amazon’s sale doesn’t have everything you want or if you just want to make sure you’re getting the best deal, shop around a bit. Once again, you’ll be able to find &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals"&gt;all of our deals coverage in and outside of Amazon here&lt;/a&gt;, including our roundup of the best anti-Prime Day deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QdCPHz"&gt;Trust the experts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="clOoYt"&gt;We’re a discerning bunch here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, so don’t fret if you’re going into Prime Day 2021 without any prep. We’ll be corralling the best deals on tech and keeping our coverage up to date with new Lightning sale items while eliminating old ones to avoid any disappointment. So mark Monday and Tuesday, June 21st and 22nd, on your calendar, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21493780/amazon-prime-sign-up-day-deals-sale-price-free"&gt;sign up for Amazon Prime&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/amazon-prime-day-deals-tech"&gt;bookmark our coverage&lt;/a&gt;, and maybe start putting aside a little spending cash.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cqjWjM"&gt;Amazon Prime Day, the retail giant’s two-day blitz of deals and promotions, officially &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22459166/amazon-prime-day-dates-2021-june-21-22"&gt;lands on June 21st&lt;/a&gt;. The annual shopping event is taking a place a few weeks earlier than it has in the past, yet despite still being a week away, Amazon has already kick-started the event with a slew of deals for Amazon Prime subscribers, discounting everything from the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Charcoal/dp/B07HZLHPKP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;last-gen Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; to the latest pair of &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085WTYQ4X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt;. More deals are likely to go live in the days leading up to the main event, too, with retailers such as Walmart and Best Buy joining the shopping fray with deals of their own, many of which will rival Amazon’s offerings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nfQOiJ"&gt;Below, we’ve rounded up the best early Prime Day deals. In most instances, all you need to do is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21493780/amazon-prime-sign-up-day-deals-sale-price-free"&gt;sign up for Amazon Prime&lt;/a&gt; to take advantage of the deals, however, a few promotions come with some additional caveats that we’ll note.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="PzRclz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":" The Verge’s Father’s Day Gift Guide 2021","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22410178/fathers-day-best-gift-ideas-tech-gadgets-tools"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="Omrvrp"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085WTYQ4X/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Buds (second-gen) — $40 off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="D7ZuXF"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22432633/amazon-echo-buds-2021-review-features-specs-price"&gt;second-gen Echo Buds&lt;/a&gt; were appealing when they launched two months ago — and that was before they received a $40 discount. They also improve upon their predecessors in almost every way, offering up enjoyable sound, better comfort, and effective noise cancellation that helps you to drown out the world around you. They can’t compete with the likes of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22523584/sony-wf-1000xm4-wireless-earbuds-headphones-review"&gt;Sony’s WF-1000XM4&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt;, but if you’re looking for an affordable pair of true wireless earbuds, or a way to bring Alexa with you on the go, the Echo Buds are it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jPdJR0"&gt;Right now, you can snag the standard, second-gen &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B085WTY1HQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Buds with a wired charging case&lt;/a&gt; in either black or white for $80. Amazon is also offering $40 off the version with the wireless charging case, bringing the price down to $100 for a limited time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jFw2gO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10600144"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Z1LChb"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PMT4T11/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Halo — $30 off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gXr8Hu"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;Amazon Halo&lt;/a&gt; is no Fitbit, but if you don’t mind a little invasiveness and can get around the fact it doesn’t have a dedicated screen, it’s a convenient way to track your sleep habits, chart your physical activity, and access a host of workout programs. While the woven, band-like device can track basic fitness metrics like your steps and heart rate, it can also measure your body fat percentage and the tone of your voice, a tool which will supposedly measure your emotional state throughout the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yTy0WF"&gt;The Amazon Halo is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Halo-Fitness-And-Health-Band/dp/B07QKPCQKW/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;currently available&lt;/a&gt; in several sizes and color configurations for $70, the lowest price we’ve seen the band since its debut in August 2020. The fitness tracker also comes with a six-month membership, after which you’ll be required to pay $3.99 a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Charcoal/dp/B07HZLHPKP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Echo Show 5 (first-gen) — $35 off&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="V6vA7l"&gt;The recently updated &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review"&gt;second-gen Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; is one of the best smart displays you can get for the bedroom, however, it’s also not nearly as affordable as its last-gen counterpart. Thankfully, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/24/18714432/amazon-echo-show-5-alexa-smart-alarm-display-review-specs-price-features"&gt;first-gen Echo Show 5&lt;/a&gt; offers much of the same functionality in the same compact package. Like the newer model, it features a vibrant touchscreen and a host of voice-activated features, and while its 1-megapixel camera leaves a lot to be desired, it does come with a physical shutter if you’re someone who prefers privacy assurance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uiR31X"&gt;Normally $80, the Echo Show is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Echo-Show-Compact-Charcoal/dp/B07HZLHPKP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;priced at $45&lt;/a&gt; for Prime members, matching the lowest price we’ve seen yet on Amazon’s capable smart display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FFqJae"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513095"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="CpLNme"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ftu/plans/prepaid_3month/"&gt;Amazon Kids Plus — $29 off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="xJpt6E"&gt;Amazon Kids Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/14/21436457/amazon-kids-rebranding-freetime"&gt;formerly FreeTime Unlimited&lt;/a&gt;, isn’t so much service for you as it is for your child. As the name implies, the subscription-based service grants your child access to a host of kid-friendly content on select devices, allowing them to discover a trove of educational apps, books, movies, and games. Much of the content is exclusive to the service, however, it also spans a multitude of age groups, meaning there’s likely age-appropriate content for your kid, regardless if you have a toddler or preteen. Like most kid-centric services, you can also limit screen time, filter content, and restrict web access.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xI4rFY"&gt;In the lead-up to Prime Day, Amazon is offering Prime members a three-month subscription to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/ftu/plans/prepaid_3month/"&gt;Amazon Kids Plus for a $1&lt;/a&gt;, amounting to $29 in savings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cgwgP5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10610382"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Vl6LGO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XJ8C8F5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo Dot (fourth-gen) — $50 off a pair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="7fd6rg"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21538043/amazon-echo-dot-4th-gen-2020-review-alexa-smart-speaker"&gt;fourth-gen Echo Dot&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon’s latest entry-level smart speaker, is yet another refinement of what has become the most popular model in the Echo lineup. Despite its price and size, the Alex-equipped speaker still manages to tout impressive sound and a commendable set of mics, which allow you to play music, control your smart home gadgets, and carry out the full range of commands you might find on other, more capable Echo devices. It’s the entry-level smart speaker to get, even if the new design isn’t as convenient for mounting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UrCp0b"&gt;Now through Prime Day, the fourth-gen Echo Dot is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-new-Echo-Dot-Blue/dp/B084J4MZK8/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy one, get one free&lt;/a&gt; with offer code &lt;strong&gt;PDDOT2PK &lt;/strong&gt;(discount applies at checkout).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KiqUna"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9607515"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BMm3YQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/music/unlimited"&gt;Amazon Music Unlimited — free four-month trial&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="JpmtUX"&gt;If you haven’t tried Amazon Music Unlimited before, Amazon is offering Prime members a four-month free trial to the popular Spotify and Apple Music alternative. Its feature set is akin to most of its competitors, however, it also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440058/amazon-music-hd-price-cut-apple-lossless-audio"&gt;offers lossless audio&lt;/a&gt; at no extra cost, a perk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;Apple recently rolled&lt;/a&gt; out to Apple Music subscribers. With Amazon Music Unlimited, you’ll gain access to ad-free listening, podcasts, and a robust catalog of more than 70 million songs, not to mention the service’s deep integration with Amazon devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEAkAT"&gt;Just be sure to cancel your subscription before the trial ends if you no longer want to continue subscribing after the four-month window. Otherwise, you’ll automatically be charged an $8 monthly subscription fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="96zkrl"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10607756"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="LMENHd"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon Echo (fourth-gen) — $30 off a pair&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2NBjU1"&gt;The Amazon Echo remains the namesake of the current Echo lineup. Although it shares much of its functionality with the aforementioned Echo Dot, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21527664/amazon-echo-2020-alexa-fourth-gen-review"&gt;fourth-gen Echo&lt;/a&gt; produces bigger, bolder sound and features a built-in smart home hub, meaning you can connect it with lightbulbs, door sensors, and a host of other popular Zigbee devices sans a secondary hub. It even has a temperature sensor, just in case you want to turn on your air conditioner or fan via Alexa routines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G4YrIb"&gt;Like the fourth-gen Echo Dot, Amazon is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07XKF5RM3/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;discounting a pair&lt;/a&gt; of Echos ahead of Prime Day, knocking $30 off the price of two with offer code &lt;strong&gt;ECHOPRIME &lt;/strong&gt;(discount applies at checkout).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="407A0B"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508352"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AqGaWV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P989QTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Luna Controller — $20 off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="9qTMwM"&gt;With Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532868/amazon-game-streaming-luna-access-no-invite-prime-day-members"&gt;opening up Luna access&lt;/a&gt; to all Prime subscribers on June 21st and 22nd, now might be your best opportunity to check out Amazon’s answer to Google Stadia and Microsoft's xCloud. Using a dedicated app or browser, the cloud gaming platform is available on pretty much any device you can throw at it — including Windows, Mac, FireTV, iOS, iPadOS, and select Android devices — and offers a way to stream titles like &lt;em&gt;Control &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Metro Exodus &lt;/em&gt;without a dedicated console or gaming machine. Basic subscriptions run $5.99 a month, though, you can also pay $14.99 a month for the Ubisoft Plus beta channel, which grants you access to a range of Ubisoft titles, including &lt;em&gt;Assassin’s Creed Valhalla&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b0KHof"&gt;We found the service to be hit or miss in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525339/amazon-luna-hands-on-cloud-gaming-streaming-early-access-price-games"&gt;initial review&lt;/a&gt;, but Amazon is currently offering a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07P989QTJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Luna Controller for $49&lt;/a&gt; as part of its early Prime Day deals, making the lack of titles far more palatable. You can also purchase a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-TV-Stick-4K-with-Alexa-Voice-Remote/dp/B095ZMSY1N/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;bundle with a Fire TV Stick for $74&lt;/a&gt; or with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08KT9XY9Z/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;phone clip for $82&lt;/a&gt;, if you want to attach your phone directly to the Luna Controller.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8vEOXK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10606997"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pOhmCy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08X7KQQGJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Insignia 55-inch 4K Fire TV Edition — $150 off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BZzTsE"&gt;Insignia’s 55-inch 4K Fire TV Edition television certainly doesn’t offer the kind of picture afforded by today’s best OLEDs, but it’s hard to find a Fire TV Edition model that supports HDR10, a feature that allows for better brightness, color accuracy, and contrast. Insignia’s 4K TV also supports HDMI ARC and HDMI eARC, meaning you can utilize a single cable to send audio from a compatible soundbar or receiver to your TV, and features Amazon’s Fire TV software, allowing you to access Prime Video, Netflix, and a slew of popular streaming services without a standalone streaming device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fZi8EO"&gt;As of this week, Insignia’s 4K Fire TV Edition model is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Insignia-NS-55F301NA22-Smart-Released/dp/B08X7KQQGJ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for $350&lt;/a&gt;, a $150 discount and the lowest price we’ve seen yet on the 55-inch model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="pj5QuH"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10605845"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gLz8Bs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/membership/premiumplus/prime?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Audible Premium Plus — $32 off&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MuUbyq"&gt;If you’re an audiobook fan, it’s hard to ignore Amazon’s audiobook service, Audible. Its catalog spans more than 200,000 ad-free titles, and it's peppered with exclusives and originals, some of which come in the form of podcasts and guided wellness programs. A monthly subscription to Audible Premium Plus provides you with one credit a month, which can be redeemed for any premium audiobook in Amazon’s catalog, regardless of the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mG7MNG"&gt;Audible Premium Plus subscriptions typically run $15 a month, however, now through Prime Day, you can &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/hz/audible/mlp/membership/premiumplus/prime?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;subscribe for $7 a month&lt;/a&gt; for the first four months, after which the subscription rate will automatically revert to the standard rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ue1uCc"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10607843"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="S4zlh4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 16th, 5:45PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt; Added Amazon Kids Plus to the roundup.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senate bill would make it easier to cancel a subscription online after a free trial </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PlBHYbGeANdnBDfG3GHmhmJREG0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69463341/acastro_200302_3922_SuperTuesday_gavel.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ipGYLW"&gt;A bipartisan group of lawmakers introduced a bill Wednesday that &lt;a href="https://www.schatz.senate.gov/press-releases/schatz-thune-warnock-kennedy-introduce-new-legislation-to-stop-deceptive-subscription-business-practices"&gt;would make it easier&lt;/a&gt; for people to cancel online subscriptions after a free trial period has ended. Sens. Brian Schatz (D-HI), John Thune (R-SD), Raphael Warnock (D-GA), and John Kennedy (R-LA) say the Unsubscribe Act would require companies to be more transparent about their subscriptions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vrINHR"&gt;“The subscription-based business model is exploding, and it’s largely because of the deceptive practices that some companies use to lure and trap in customers,” Schatz said in a statement. “When people sign up for a free trial, they shouldn’t have to jump through hoops just to cancel their subscription before being charged.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QE4BtM"&gt;The bill addresses what’s known as “negative option billing,” where a customer signs up for a free trial and the company switches them to a full-price subscription automatically when the trial ends. Customers are often not notified that the free trial period is ending until the company charges them. Other companies allow prospective customers to sign up for a service online, but then require them to call a customer service phone line to cancel. And as someone who wants to support my fellow news sites and newspapers, it’s just not nice to let me easily sign up online for $1.99 but force me to call a customer service line after you’ve already charged me for a year’s subscription that I may not have wanted (maybe I did, but I would like the option to choose).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C0mL84"&gt;The Unsubscribe Act would require sellers to allow customers to cancel a subscription in the same way they signed up, require sellers to provide notice when a free or reduced-price trial is about to end, and to provide customers with a clear understanding of the terms of the contract. And sellers wouldn’t be able to automatically transfer a free trial customer to a contract longer than one month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h2Kj6e"&gt;California has had a &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/companies-must-let-customers-cancel-subscriptions-online-california-law-says/"&gt;law in place since 2018&lt;/a&gt; that requires companies to allow customers to cancel a subscription online.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5gwrxo"&gt;Companion legislation to the Unsubscribe Act is being introduced in the House, according to a news release. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wbUjBN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon confirms it removed RavPower, a popular phone battery and charger brand </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vPQ7yC9HkteJsyGz4Q_5f5FX2nQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69462083/akrales_180816_2836_0079.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H7Aqxw"&gt;One month ago, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428858/amazon-aukey-mpow-listings-disappearing"&gt;Amazon-first gadget brands Aukey and Mpow suddenly and mysteriously disappeared&lt;/a&gt; from the giant online retailer’s storefront, with almost all their electronics vanishing from Amazon’s shelves. Today, popular battery and charger brand RavPower has completely disappeared as well — and Amazon now confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it was the one that removed RavPower from its store, and that it removed Aukey and Mpow previously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3fpIGa"&gt;Amazon hasn’t yet said why it took the action on RavPower, but it’s not hard to imagine what happened here. On Sunday, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/fake-reviews-and-inflated-ratings-are-still-a-problem-for-amazon-11623587313"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s Nicole Nguyen ran a story&lt;/a&gt; about how her new RavPower charger included an offer for a $35 gift card in exchange for a review, something that Amazon confirmed was a violation of company policy. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/10/3/13155578/amazon-incentivized-reviews-ban-vine-program-product-bias"&gt;banned incentivized reviews&lt;/a&gt; in 2016. Nguyen tweeted about RavPower’s removal earlier today:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lI7yDz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Following my fake review story, listings for Amazon-native electronics brand RAVPower are gone. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The company offered $35 gift cards for reviews on a product that was sold directly by Amazon itself. RAVPower acted as a wholesale vendor on that listing.&lt;a href="https://t.co/6nazZZ5Wtb"&gt;https://t.co/6nazZZ5Wtb&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/znp9u48YHV"&gt;pic.twitter.com/znp9u48YHV&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— nicole nguyen (@nicnguyen) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nicnguyen/status/1405202548760334339?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ymIKjk"&gt;As a result, all of RavPower’s product listings have disappeared, leaving blank white spaces in the company’s Amazon storefront. Searches for “RavPower” don’t bring up any listings for products made by the company. Existing links to RavPower products either point to Amazon’s “Sorry, we couldn’t find that page” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/16/17577654/amazon-prime-day-website-down-deals-service-disruption"&gt;cute 404 dogs&lt;/a&gt;, or listings that read “Currently unavailable.”&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;RavPower’s seller page is still up, but it’s empty.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zs6aQB"&gt;By and large, this is exactly what happened to Aukey, Mpow, and other lesser-known electronics retailers last month — except here, Amazon has been a bit more thorough. You can actually still find a couple of Aukey listings on Amazon, while RavPower seems to have none. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lbVUe2"&gt;Another important difference may be that &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravpower.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F16%2F22536976%2Famazon-ravpower-battery-charger-removed-amazon" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;RavPower has its own separate online shop&lt;/a&gt; that ranks high in Google search, so it may not strictly need to depend on Amazon. RavPower didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PL6D6V"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428858/amazon-aukey-mpow-listings-disappearing"&gt;would not tell us last month&lt;/a&gt; if it actually removed Aukey and Mpow, merely giving us a generic statement that suggested it generally suspends sellers that violate “the integrity of our store,” but it confirmed both removals to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; today. At the time, Aukey and Mpow didn’t respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iEEseZ"&gt;Fake, inflated, paid, and other forms of scammy reviews run rampant on Amazon (and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;other online platforms&lt;/a&gt;, to be fair), and I see suspicious-looking cards in my random Amazon purchases all the time. It’s weird to think that RavPower would need to stoop to this behavior, though: we’ve regularly featured good products that the company makes, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2017/10/27/16554680/best-wireless-charger-qi-ravpower-samsung-anker-mophie"&gt;our favorite wireless charging pad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8ctEj"&gt;Amazon is actively trying to clamp down on this kind of fraud, though it’s not always successful. &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/how-amazon-works/creating-a-trustworthy-reviews-experience"&gt;In a Wednesday blog post&lt;/a&gt; that explains some of its enforcement efforts, the company says it “stopped more than 200 million suspected fake reviews before they were ever seen by a customer” in 2020. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The latest teaser for Star Trek: Picard season 2 is noticeably missing some robots</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yeJSwhjFQYKvEhHYTf3FRzFFlRc=/98x0:1316x812/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69463241/picard.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ktJsQ0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHMti7u9TBE"&gt;The latest teaser&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Picard&lt;/em&gt;’s second season has arrived, giving an actual look at the upcoming series (instead of some long shots inside Picard’s house as Patrick Stewart pontificates on the nature of time, as seen in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xk9F90wklRQ"&gt;the first “teaser.”&lt;/a&gt;) And while the new trailer — released in honor of “&lt;a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Captain_Picard_Day"&gt;Captain Picard Day&lt;/a&gt;” — does give a glimpse of what looks like the time-traveling shenanigans the former Starfleet captain and his new crew will be up to when the show returns in 2022, something is missing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZtRoAY"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPOILERS FOR PICARD SEASON 1&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yEOI9M"&gt;Where are the robots? The first season of Picard dealt with the Federation debating whether artificial life and androids should exist, culminating with Picard himself getting his biological body replaced with a cybernetic replacement. But there’s no sign that &lt;em&gt;Picard&lt;/em&gt; will be moving forward with the ramifications of that change in the upcoming season from the new trailer. Admittedly, that’s something that the show all but stated was the intent when it noted that Picard’s new body would be virtually the same as his old one, minus the brain defect that was threatening his life, making his whole “death” a bit of a cop-out. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Zh5CSbFhQ0vGUKx3lgsO4kaZ1gM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22663238/Q.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Paramount Plus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When in doubt, blame Q.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WMGRCf"&gt;But any emphasis on the newly cybernetic Picard isn’t the only strange absence in the trailer: Seven of Nine (Jeri Ryan) also appears in the trailer sans her Borg augmentations, which — when coupled with the strange Starfleet badges and the ominous voiceover that “Time has been broken” — indicates that someone* has probably been mucking around with time travel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GQbtEB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;(*it’s probably Q. It’s a Picard-centric show with wacky timeline stuff, John de Lancie is featured in the trailer as returning to play the omnipotent trickster, so... yeah. Blame Q.) &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOHAFI"&gt;We’ll have a bit of a wait to find out, though, given that &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Picard&lt;/em&gt;’s second season isn’t scheduled to release until 2022 on Paramount Plus. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to activate and use Google Chat</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2RAjBG6BUaHLxhWcMClP6Ky3fw0=/259x0:2158x1266/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69463132/Screen_Shot_2021_06_14_at_9.27.20_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kznv7R"&gt;Real-time collaborative chat, as exemplified by apps such as Slack, has become a common way to communicate between colleagues and friends, especially since last year when so many of us transitioned to working from home. Google has apparently taken note of this and is pitting itself against Slack by taking two of the features from its corporate Workplace app suite — Chat and Rooms — and integrating them into its standard Gmail app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8I4aj7"&gt;Google Chat allows you to hold chat sessions with friends and groups of friends either on an informal or formal basis. The former can be done just between two people or between several in what Google calls a group conversation. The latter is done via a separate space that Google currently calls a Room. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tJR9xO"&gt;What’s the difference? &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chat/answer/7659784?hl=en"&gt;According to Google&lt;/a&gt;, Chat is simply a way for two or more people to chat together without any formalities — for example, if you wanted to quickly talk about where you were going to meet for lunch, you’d create a group conversation among your friends. Once the conversation is done, it’s done. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gliRcM"&gt;A Room, on the other hand, is for more long-term conversations. Each Room has its own name, remains available for people to leave and rejoin, will send out notifications, and can share files. You can even have rooms within rooms. It’s for work projects, party planning, or any other activity where you want to keep the conversation going over the course of days, weeks, or longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vkUrX7"&gt;If this sounds useful to you, then the first thing you need to do is activate Google Chat for your Gmail account. Currently, at least, you need to do it separately on your browser and on your mobile device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gQ7jOG"&gt;Activate Chat on a mobile app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zVHWsU"&gt;Tap the three-line icon at the top-left corner. Scroll down and select “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="s2RMES"&gt;Select your account&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Mmujm6"&gt;Select “General” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lAJF5L"&gt;If you’re using an Android phone, check off “Show the Chat and Rooms tabs.” If you’re using an iPhone or iPad, toggle “Show the chat and rooms tab” on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="1AdW8N"&gt;Note: if you’re using an iPhone / iPad, you’ll have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22429322/ios-14-how-to-close-quite-app-iphone"&gt;close and re-open&lt;/a&gt; Gmail manually to activate the Chat feature&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="wJUlit"&gt;On the bottom of the screen, instead of just Mail and Meet icons, you’ll now also have Chat and Rooms icons. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can activate Chat in the General section of Settings." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0UEUVD8qg_uOfUzI0LWs_pI1P1E=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662468/Screenshot_20210616_104823.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can activate Chat in the General section of Settings.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There will now be four icons at the bottom of your Gmail page." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iwNwwP6oVVY1WNPLHy3adpGb1Hs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662469/Screenshot_20210616_104725.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There will now be four icons at the bottom of your Gmail page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Azi11N"&gt;Activate Chat on a browser&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="oWenT2"&gt;Go to your Gmail account and go to settings (the gear icon in the upper-right corner)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qBQYol"&gt;Select “View all settings”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ade7aX"&gt;In the top menu, select “Chat and Meet”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rXItCy"&gt;You have the choice of selecting “Chat,” “Classic Hangouts,” and “Off.” Assuming you want to try Chat, click on that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="d0w0Fg"&gt;Usually, Chat will appear on the left side of your Gmail screen, but you can choose to have it appear on the right side instead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="D1ZOT9"&gt;By the way, “Chat and Meet” lets you hide the Meet section in Gmail if you want to&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rNj6gp"&gt;Click on “Save Changes”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="On your browser, go into Settings and look for the “Chat and Meet” section." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G-Ybl84pt7-A42oxfhhmAv4nNBs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662472/Screen_Shot_2021_06_14_at_9.26.49_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On your browser, go into Settings and look for the “Chat and Meet” section.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kKO0Wf"&gt;Your Gmail screen will refresh, and you will probably get a pop-up welcoming you to the “new Gmail.” Instead of the Meet and Hangouts boxes that used to be on the left-hand side of your Gmail screen, you’ll now have a Chat box, a Rooms box, and a Meet box. Any contacts with whom you previously had chats with via Hangouts will appear in the new Chat box; click on their names, and a small pop-up window in the lower left will show you those previous chats. (Note that if you blocked anyone in Hangouts previously, that blocking isn’t going to carry over to Chat.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9qyI6"&gt;Before we go into the specifics of how to use Google Chat, you may notice some other small differences after the refresh. To begin, the icon that looked like a quote mark at the bottom of your left column — which referred to Google Hangouts — will now be replaced by a couple of quote bubbles. The previous large “Compose” button on the upper-left corner will be replaced (why, I’m not sure) by an inconveniently small pencil icon. And you now have a button on the right of the search box that lets you choose to be active, away, or undisturbed; you can also type in your own status.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A new button lets you tell people whether you’re active or not." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pd0nAwx_axN8kDHqcBrc6B1FBWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662896/Screen_Shot_2021_06_16_at_1.19.46_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A new button lets you tell people whether you’re active.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qhM2oJ"&gt;Begin a chat on the web&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="NESiN8"&gt;To start a new Chat, you have a choice: you can click on the “Find a chat” link in the Chat box, or you can click on the plus sign in the corners of the Chat or Rooms boxes. Either way, you’ll get a drop-down menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="f6dwYH"&gt;If you want to just chat with a single person, type their name into the top field, and you will be taken into a small chat box. (You can maximize it if you want.) If you want to chat with more than one person, then select “Group conversation.” You’ll then be able to list the people you want to chat with.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qHKk4Z"&gt;The same menu also lets you start a room (more on that later), browse existing rooms, or search for message requests (in other words, search for previous requests for chats from other people).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll now find Chat and Rooms in the left column." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kbUu_TJp5tpAHz02txYiTwQMLeY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662482/Screen_Shot_2021_06_14_at_9.29.17_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll now find Chat and Rooms in the left column. Either can be used to start a chat, a group conversation, or a room.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Eh7Dld"&gt;Begin a chat on a mobile app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="CPJqO8"&gt;Tap on the Chat icon and then on the small “New chat” popup in the lower-right corner &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="693sJQ"&gt;You can type in the name of a person here, or you can create a room or browse existing rooms &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CtshOl"&gt;If you want to create a group conversation (in other words, have a chat with several people), first type in the name of the first person you want to chat with (or choose their name from the drop-down list), then tap on the group icon that will appear in the same field you’re typing in, and add any other names&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="After you click on “New chat” you can create a chat or a room with one or more people." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/44LpVXPjcmZJ-PS6Cw7BmoW0FbI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662491/Screenshot_20210615_153349.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;After you click on “New chat,” you can create a chat or a room with one or more people.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="If you want to add more people to your chat, click on the group icon at top." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MhgC-0RWio0pW55Q3z-ppS4RkMw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662492/Screenshot_20210615_153409.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you want to add more people to your chat, click on the group icon at top.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U4jayJ"&gt;People who are invited to your chat will get an email with a link, and will have the option of joining the conversation or blocking it; if they are on Hangouts or Chat, they will get a notification. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GuXN46"&gt;Whether you’re using the web or a mobile app, to add a new message, type into the field at the bottom of the screen. A series of icons to the side or below the entry field lets you add emoji, upload a file, add a file from Google Drive, start a video meeting (essentially, starting Google Meet), and schedule an event.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A chat can include images and emojis." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VrPLA70exaBCnMd8aqb4BpSTuts=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662506/Screen_Shot_2021_06_16_at_11.07.07_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A chat can include images and emoji.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="pT3Cfi"&gt;Create a Room&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LfBO79"&gt;On the web, go to the Chat box or the Room box on the left of Gmail and click on the plus sign. In the mobile app, tap on the Rooms icon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6KXG1E"&gt;Select “Create room”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When you create a room, you name it and add participants." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I1yT3Un9sAmEz66MqQVt183aVs8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662519/Screen_Shot_2021_06_14_at_11.16.33_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you create a room, you name it and add participants.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="KnBLiM"&gt;Create a room name and add the people you want to include. (If they’re not on your contact list, you can just type in their email address.) Click “Create.” You’ll be taken into the new room. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="0rvt04"&gt;The people who are invited will get an email with a link. When they click on the link, they will be shown the new room and given the opportunity to either join it or block it. (If they haven’t joined Chat yet, they will get notifications from Hangouts.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="YhA8oH"&gt;To add a new message, type into the field at the bottom of the screen. Like Chat, a series of icons on the right of the field lets you add emoji, upload a file, add a file from Google Drive, start a video meeting (which is essentially starting Google Meet), and schedule an event. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A room can include images, emojis and tasks — but it’s not as temporary as a chat." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bKOtaTRDuujv2vMs9OanYECm-Wk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22662530/Screen_Shot_2021_06_16_at_11.16.22_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A room can include images, emoji, and tasks — but it’s not as temporary as a chat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oWymr0"&gt;A couple of notes about rooms: if you’ve created a room using a personal account (as opposed to a business account), anyone in the room can change its name. There are a few other rules as to the use of rooms that can be found on a &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/chat/answer/7659784?hl=en"&gt;Google support page&lt;/a&gt;; it’s a little confusing as to which apply just to business accounts and which to personal accounts, but hopefully Google will fix that in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uG0tpS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Steam Next Fest lets you try hundreds of games</title>
    <content type="html">

  &lt;p id="n2lX1u"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjjvO3i8JzxAhWBnp4KHaTjCToQFjAQegQIAhAE&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F12%2F22531138%2Fe3-2021-summer-game-fest-news-announcements&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw0XBQ-xSNvTeepA3HrCilJY"&gt;E3 2021&lt;/a&gt; is technically over, and without a show floor to demo things, plenty of developers lost an opportunity to spread the word about their games. Xbox has one way around that, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528733/xbox-summer-game-fest-event-40-demos-sable-tunic"&gt;collecting indie game demos&lt;/a&gt; on home consoles, and now Valve is launching its version for PC games.  The latest Steam festival, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest"&gt;Next Fest&lt;/a&gt;, has launched today with hundreds of demos of upcoming games to try and livestreams of playthroughs and interviews with developers if you’d rather watch than play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJSeIH"&gt;Running from June 16th to June 22nd, Next Fest includes a wide swath of games in a variety of genres, some of which weren’t spotlighted during last weekend’s loose collection of E3 livestreams and keynotes. Some notable games included in the fest are &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/757310/Sable/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sable&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1319420/Chasing_Static/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chasing Static&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1118240/Lake/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1307580/TOEM/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Toem&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1221250/NORCO/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Norco&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbDLJ9"&gt;Valve’s been running these online festivals periodically since the pandemic started &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21184319/steam-game-festival-sale-gdc-2020-indie-developers"&gt;as a way to fill the void&lt;/a&gt; of in-person events like the Game Developers Conference. While it might be a bit more hit or miss than the big splashy showcases at E3, Next Fest seems filled to the brim with interesting ideas. Plus all the demos are free, so it doesn’t hurt to give any of them a spin. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Even the Xbox app has stories now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/chD8LcD8lXnShhlG5ZaDVP_x9eI=/3x0:1419x944/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69462995/xboxappstories.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stories inside the Xbox mobile app.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HzuVjn"&gt;Microsoft is now adding a row of stories to its Xbox app on iOS and Android. It’s the same interface that originated in Snapchat and has spread to every single social media app, including Instagram, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21570368/twitter-fleets-disapeating-tweets-stories-launch-available-now"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook Messenger, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22249152/pinterest-story-pins-carousel-home-screen-update"&gt;Pinterest&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/27/21156247/linkedin-testing-instagram-stories-feature-social-network-resumes-why"&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;. Even Slack is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/7/21505519/slack-instagram-stories-push-to-talk-audio-calls-new-features"&gt;adding stories&lt;/a&gt; soon, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4oa6u6"&gt;Now you’ll also see stories from Xbox games in the mobile app, just in case you haven’t had enough stories in your life. While most social media apps have stories content that’s created by your friends or whoever you follow, the Xbox stories will be from game brands instead. So if you play a lot of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Call of Duty&lt;/em&gt;, you’ll see stories from these games and any others you follow on the Xbox network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zqh61A"&gt;Stories in the Xbox app are simply being used as another form of marketing for games to advertise promotions, updates, and more. Thankfully, it’s not all that intrusive in the Xbox app, and Microsoft has placed these stories halfway down the page rather than prominently at the top. They’re simply labeled “official posts from games.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUw4s7"&gt;It’s not clear whether Microsoft will ever allow Xbox network users to create their own stories in the Xbox app, but there’s certainly no way to do that right now. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1405223650148589568"&gt;Microsoft says&lt;/a&gt; it’s adding stories into the Xbox app “because everyone deserves to see that no scope,” but you’ll only see the no scopes from brands and not your talented friends.&lt;/p&gt;
