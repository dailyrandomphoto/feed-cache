    <title>Apple launches new iPad Pro with M1 processor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5nvwSDtMfEfuTStHA95qQC4YhDM=/66x0:1548x988/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157640/lcimg_5b9a9e8b_c6d0_48da_8f7c_ad8d1086a21e.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rquOpZ"&gt;Right on schedule, Apple has launched the next generation of its iPad Pro. As was the case with the recent MacBook Air and MacBook Pro, Apple’s improvements to the iPad Pro are largely on the inside. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELYssq"&gt;The device has a new M1 processor, the same chip that powers the MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini. Apple claims this will deliver “a big jump in performance” over previous generation. The graphics performance is over 1,500 times faster, per the company, and says you can expect all-day battery life from the device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yzNQb8"&gt;The iPad Pro’s USB-C port now supports Thunderbolt, as well as 5G connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6lsYgY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22148310"&gt;&lt;em&gt; Apple “Spring Loaded” live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces thinner iMac with M1 chip and bright colors</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/01Hwl_PP17A1y5ukMWlyzLOqhrk=/168x0:1977x1206/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157337/apple_new_imac_spring21_hero_04202021_Full_Bleed_Image.jpg.medium_2x.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Sq8H0d"&gt;Apple introduced a redesigned iMac today with a slimmer design, an Apple Silicon chip, and a case with bright bold colors that throw back to the classic colorful all-in-one iMacs. Apple said the new iMac was designed from the ground up for the M1 chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KIOw47"&gt;The new iMac has a 24-inch, 4.5K display with narrower borders around most edges. It still has a large chin on the bottom, but the rear of the display is now flat instead of curved — Apple says the volume has been reduced by over 50 percent. The screen also has Apple’s True Tone tech for automatically adjusting the color temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q2UaH0"&gt;Apple is also promising a &lt;em&gt;much-needed&lt;/em&gt; update to the iMac’s camera and mics so that you’ll look better on video calls. It now has a 1080p resolution and a larger sensor.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vBqQtn2TnunAHOFBpmejKafs6jU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457424/138_2021_04_20_138_vlcscreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3TpU4"&gt;The new iMac is 11.5mm thin, but Apple says it should still stay quieter and cooler than the previous model thanks to the M1 chip. The new model has “two small fans” replacing the “bulky thermal system” of the previous generation iMac, the company says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLfmyU"&gt;There’s also a new magnetic power cable — it sounds a lot like the old MagSafe cable — that attaches to the back. Ethernet can be connected to the power brick and delivered through the same cable. The back of the machine four USB-C ports on the higher end model, two of which will support Thunderbolt. The base model has 8GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kyl_EpPGEaCRytGqLTd0JvdFwfQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457431/134_2021_04_20_134_vlcscreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WAJ5wTLC_RgDjCr2RsFxDoM6SVA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457430/133_2021_04_20_133_vlcscreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L8xsXTSL-vxu_sxA3ze71X7TFFg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457429/132_2021_04_20_132_vlcscreen.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Omd2LX"&gt;Alongside the new iMac, Apple is also introducing a new keyboard, mouse, and trackpad with colors to match. The keyboard has a Touch ID button for logging in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzLG3b"&gt;It starts at $1,299, though some of the colors are reserved for the $1,499 model. It’ll be available in the second half of May, with orders starting April 30th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ted Lasso season 2 is coming in July, and it looks as charming as ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_NZXh_xi2CKlWgGGdF1Njz-z7KA=/54x0:1226x781/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157256/ted_lasso.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple TV Plus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="PoY09O"&gt;Apple’s event today was full of hardware and new products, but the company also took some time to have fun by unveiling a new trailer for &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt;’s second season. The show — which stars Jason Sudeikis as a perpetually positive football coach who takes on a gig helming an English soccer team — has been one of the breakout hits on Apple TV Plus, the company’s fledgling streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="beiCR8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I always hear the question: who let the dogs out (who who who who)? With respect to The Baha Men, I prefer WHEN let the dogs out (when when when when)? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;‘Cause guess what, Greyhounds? Our 2nd season starts 7/23! Can I get a Bah Amen!? That’s what I used to think they were called&lt;/p&gt;— Ted Lasso (@TedLasso) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TedLasso/status/1384556102856024073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 20, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k4wX62"&gt;Season 2 follows Lasso as he leads AFC Richmond during a season of turmoil, with the club recently relegated to a lower league. That said, it looks just as charming as season 1, with plenty of folksy expressions and largely the same cast of beloved characters. Season 2 of &lt;em&gt;Ted Lasso&lt;/em&gt; will debut on July 23rd. No word on whether &lt;a href="https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2021/4/19/22391172/european-super-league-announcement-tearing-soccer-apart"&gt;the controversial European Super League&lt;/a&gt; will be a plot point.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple unveils a redesigned remote for its new Apple TV 4K</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ZlNorpb2ByNkPP15vvxDBKbkJE=/121x0:1414x862/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157146/WcGeQVXeT3.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g60avE"&gt;The Apple TV remote is one of the weakest parts of the company’s set-top box, and Apple is, at last, addressing it today. The company just unveiled a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-unveils-the-next-generation-of-apple-tv-4k%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F18277449%2Fapple-tv-remote-new-design-4k-features-price-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;redesigned Siri remote&lt;/a&gt; alongside its new Apple TV 4K. You’ll get the new remote with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22386298/apple-tv-4k-a12-bionic-price-features-release-date"&gt;new $179 4K set-top box&lt;/a&gt;, or it’s available separately for $59. As well as being compatible with the new Apple TV 4K, it also works with the 2017 model, and Apple TV HD. Apple will also sell the remote bundled with the Apple TV HD for $149.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i4OhwO"&gt;The new Siri remote has an iPod-style scroll wheel, a five-way click pad, touch-controls, a mute button, and a power button that can turn your TV on and off. Meanwhile, the Siri button is now on the side of the remote, and Apple says that the voice assistant now works on Apple TV in Austria, Ireland, and New Zealand, in addition to the 13 countries where it was already supported. Finally, the new Siri remote’s enclosure is made out of 100 percent recycled aluminum. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D0bMiw6aqFs4DQELBC2-fnrjS-U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457422/Apple_unveils_the_next_gen_of_AppleTV4K_042021.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new remote alongside the new Apple TV 4K.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QYtvOK"&gt;The new remote was unveiled alongside Apple’s updated Apple TV 4K box, which has a more powerful processor that can support high-frame rate HDR content.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubLEaC"&gt;Although the build quality and looks of the existing set-top box’s remote have never been lacking, people have had no shortage of complaints about its functionality. For one, its size can be too small to be used comfortably, and it’s also super easy to lose. Design-wise, it’s annoyingly symmetrical, so half the time, you’re likely to pick it up the wrong way if you’re not careful. Many of these issues look like they’ve been addressed with the new remote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yypdBY"&gt;Yes, you’ve always been able to replace the Apple TV’s remote with a universal remote or use an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/1/12344908/apple-tv-remote-app-iphone-released"&gt;app on your phone&lt;/a&gt; to control the set-top box. But for those who just want a better first-party remote, here is that solution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M8fzGh"&gt;The new remote will be available alongside the new Apple TV 4K, which can be preordered starting April 30th. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces new Apple TV 4K</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NPFSzjL4R20vNldYJVfuFbVIjUU=/154x0:1807x1102/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157139/Apple_unveils_the_next_gen_of_AppleTV4K_042021.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Apple TV 4K with redesigned remote&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IQ2lHr"&gt;Apple has just announced a new Apple TV streaming box, replacing the Apple TV 4K that came out in 2017. The new model retains the name of the prior model but comes with a more powerful A12 Bionic chip that lets it play HDR video at higher frame rates. It’s also powerful enough to support 60FPS Dolby Vision playback over AirPlay from a compatible iPhone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mNwFG"&gt;The old Apple TV 4K, which has been Apple’s flagship set-top box for four years, supports 4K streaming as well as HDR, including Dolby Vision. It also supports Dolby Atmos sound codecs. But it doesn’t support 120Hz refresh rates, which might be important should you ever want to play serious games on an Apple TV. It also has the most notoriously bad remote control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CreNyM"&gt;Fortunately, Apple has completely redesigned the remote for the new Apple TV 4K with an improved, more ergonomic design and more capabilities. The new remote is thicker than the prior model, has a new five-way touch controller in place of the maligned swipe pad of the original, and a proper power button to turn off your TV. The Siri search button has been moved to the side of the remote, under your right thumb.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3i6vpuVKuIckJS1BlJrUFry77Ww=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457338/Screen_Shot_2021_04_20_at_1.17.25_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ObEznr"&gt;Apple did not redesign the Apple TV box itself — it remains a squircle shaped puck that you have to put on a shelf or entertainment center, unlike the dongle designs that many of Apple’s competitors use now. A new feature allows the Apple TV to optimize the colors of your TV screen using the light sensor on an iPhone. Apple says it is working with a number of content providers to produce high frame rate HDR content for the new Apple TV, including FOX Sports, NBCUniversal, Paramount Plus, Red Bull TV, and Canal Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LLsQ0H"&gt;The new Apple TV 4K starts at $179 for 32GB of storage and will be available to purchase starting on April 30th. A 64GB model will also be available for $199. Apple is also selling the older Apple TV HD, which is limited to 1080p resolution, with the new remote for $149.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11gKdi"&gt;All of those prices are a lot higher than Apple’s competitors, such as Amazon, Google, and Roku. Apple is betting once again that people will pay for performance and ecosystem in a set top box and is charging a hefty premium for it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hQrN7O4IFVm1aj9wteZlwIoAM5c=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457346/image__1_.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="L4QauW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22148310"&gt;&lt;em&gt; Apple “Spring Loaded” live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple announces $29 AirTag, a new Tile-like item tracker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dVKWehDNWYWp3kjdEXvEtfrGWhM=/0x0:2142x1428/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157033/airtag.5.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="j8KDpM"&gt;Apple is officially launching a Tile-like item tracker that will work with the company’s software and services. Dubbed AirTag, the small circular tag will allow you to track items within Apple’s “Find My” app on iOS. Much like Tile, Apple’s AirTags will be useful for tracking items like keys or wallets, and you’ll be provided with notifications when you’re separated from your item.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pFHPxJ"&gt;The AirTag itself is a small puck-like device that includes a built-in speaker, accelerometer, Bluetooth LE, and a user-replaceable battery. Apple says the tracker should last for a year of battery life, and you can use an NFC tap to activate a lost mode. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBClv4"&gt;AirTag will be available for $29 on April 30th, or $99 for a four-pack of the devices. Preorders begin this Friday at 5AM PT / 8AM ET. Apple has also created leather loop and key ring accessories that the AirTag can slot into, and the company is also working with accessory makers to create luggage tag enclosures for the AirTag itself.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Co3luD8e5pkvGFCzcC1RfxhbWE4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457308/yJBAy1w.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirTag accessory.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="nuC1qU"&gt;AirTags will show up in Apple’s Find My app, and the app will play a sound on the tracker when you attempt to locate an item. Each AirTag is also equipped with Apple’s U1 chip that uses Ultra Wideband technology, sound, and haptic feedback to guide people more precisely to where an item is located.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="otjDBc"&gt;AirTags don’t store any location data or location history inside the physical device, and Apple says it’s using end-to-end encryption for the communications between an AirTag and the Find My network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dZrAJy"&gt;Details about AirTags first appeared in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/30/20841204/ios13-code-apple-tile-location-tracking-tag-find-my-app"&gt;copies of the iOS 13 beta&lt;/a&gt; nearly two years ago, and the AirTags name was also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936650/apple-airtag-tile-device-reference-ios-13-2-rumors"&gt;spotted in iOS 13.2&lt;/a&gt;. Apple accidentally &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/2/21205994/apple-airtags-name-confirmed-tile-tracker-rumor-leak"&gt;confirmed the AirTags name&lt;/a&gt; in a deleted support video last year, too. Following the rumors, it has taken Apple a considerable amount of time to make AirTags a reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="rdhx1a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;First rumored in 2019&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XUpJWs"&gt;Apple will clearly be competing with Tile with its AirTags, but the location-tracking company has been attempting to embed its technology directly into Bluetooth chips in recent years. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/1/7/18168760/tile-bluetooth-low-energy-item-tracking-ces-2019"&gt;Tile has previously teamed up with&lt;/a&gt; Qualcomm, Dialog Semiconductor, Silicon Labs, and Toshiba to include Tile compatibility as an option on devices. Tile has also embedded its location-tracking network into gadgets from Boosted and Bose, and is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215381/tile-ultra-wide-band-tracker-apple-airtags-samsung-smartthings"&gt;prepping its own AirTags competitor&lt;/a&gt; that could let you find lost items through walls.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/42-pjBPrigLZ-EV_VW5rwDUSutY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22457331/airtagaccessories.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;AirTag accessories.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3aySXB"&gt;Apple will certainly face some competition from Tile’s broader reach here, but the deeper integration with iOS and iPhones will be a significant challenge for Tile and other competitors like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22227621/samsung-galaxy-smarttag-price-release-date-tile-locator"&gt;Samsung’s $29.99 Galaxy SmartTags&lt;/a&gt;. Apple’s launch of AirTags comes nearly a year after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274709/apple-tile-european-commission-eu-complaint-app-store-iphone-response"&gt;Tile filed a complaint&lt;/a&gt; with the European Commission, accusing Apple of anti-competitive behavior. Tile argues that Apple’s iOS 13.5 update to Bluetooth settings has disadvantaged third-party tracking products in favor of Apple’s own Find My app that doesn’t include the same restrictions by default.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5u240W"&gt;Apple has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/29/21274709/apple-tile-european-commission-eu-complaint-app-store-iphone-response"&gt;strenuously denied the allegations&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22372016/apple-find-my-bluetooth-tracking-iphone-network-third-party-vanmoof-belkin-chipolo-uwb"&gt;opened up its Find My app&lt;/a&gt; to third-party products recently. Devices will need to play by Apple’s Made for iPhone (MFi) accessory rules, so companies will need to apply to get certified and have their products tracked in the Find My app. Apple is also offering a chipset specification for third-parties to integrate with the Ultra-Wideband found in Apple’s latest iPhones.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Podcasts launches in-app subscriptions</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LUkdS-EhgNsYCMxUhIGKAH5uGcw=/200x0:2360x1440/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69157017/download.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="U3LDqi"&gt;A monumental change is coming to Apple Podcasts’ business: the company &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapple-leads-the-next-chapter-of-podcasting-with-apple-podcasts-subscriptions%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F20%2F22381980%2Fapple-podcasts-app-subscriptions-new-design" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is launching subscriptions&lt;/a&gt; within the Apple Podcasts app. During its spring event today, the company announced that people will be able to subscribe to content from the app for extra perks, like ad-free and bonus content, as well as early access. It’ll launch in 170 regions and countries next month. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xfFnbY"&gt;Initial partners include Pushkin Industries, QCODE, and NPR. It appears that content creators will have to pay Apple $19.99 per year in order to offer subscriptions, but Apple doesn’t appear to be taking a cut of their subscription revenue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6yXRzM"&gt;The app is also getting a redesign with channels to help people find new content curated by their favorite creators. These channels will feature artwork, titles, and descriptions unique to Apple Podcasts, and some might promote free content while others are paid. Luminary, a subscription-based podcast app that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/22/18510897/luminary-podcast-app-launch-the-daily-gimlet-media-spotify"&gt;launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, is an initial channel partner. The company said today that people will be able to subscribe to Luminary shows from Apple Podcasts, as well as in the Luminary app. &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/the-athletic-launches-podcast-network-65f115a8-da39-409b-98df-80d74a325966.html"&gt;The Athletic&lt;/a&gt; appears to be offering a similar setup, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SAapUm"&gt;Other new features include a “Smart Play” button that’ll allow listeners to automatically start episodic shows from the newest episode and serialized shows from the beginning of the series. Listeners can also save individual episodes, which are downloaded for offline playback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V1ulR7"&gt;Overall, Apple is seemingly taking a bigger interest in the creators that use its platform to reach listeners. People widely speculated that Apple would launch a subscription service to promote its own original content, which have focused on companion shows for its TV Plus and Books content. Now, it appears that Apple instead sees an opportunity to make money off the podcasters themselves without investing in its own exclusive programming. This could set Apple up to more directly compete with platforms like Patreon, which have courted podcasters. If Apple only charges $19.99 per year, versus Patreon’s up to 9 percent of subscription revenue, it might be worth it for podcasters to switch their main subscription work over to the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="An1u4J"&gt;Apple has, for years, been the de facto app on which people listen to podcasts, partially because of its pre-installation on iPhones. That is, up until Spotify entered the fold in earnest in 2019. Since then, the company has been gunning for Apple’s market share, bolstered by flashy exclusive deals, acquisitions, and the company’s own podcast creation software funnel. The strategy appears to be working. eMarketer reported last month that this year, 28.2 million people will listen to podcasts in the US on Spotify versus Apple Podcasts’ 28 million. A separate report from Voxnest &lt;a href="https://blog.voxnest.com/apple-spotify-podcast-listeners-q1/"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt; also found Spotify gaining ground in the US, specifically in New Jersey and California where it says the player has overtaken Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g7pJv3"&gt;Spotify has voiced an interest in helping creators monetize, as well, so it could end up competing with Apple for creators’ exclusive content, or podcasters will end up having to manage their subscriptions across various apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9pBV8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing… we’re adding more to this post, but you can follow along with our&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22148310"&gt;&lt;em&gt; Apple “Spring Loaded” live blog&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to get the news even faster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FTC warns it could crack down on biased AI</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="federal trade commission ftc SHUTTERSTOCK (Felix Lipov / Shutterstock)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/81U63G4FMG1Z0uA_Il_sZAeygYc=/0x0:1000x667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69156652/shutterstock_229697875.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FefafY"&gt;The US Federal Trade Commission has warned companies against using biased artificial intelligence, saying they may break consumer protection laws. &lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2021/04/aiming-truth-fairness-equity-your-companys-use-ai"&gt;A new blog post&lt;/a&gt; notes that AI tools can reflect “troubling” racial and gender biases. If those tools are applied in areas like housing or employment, falsely advertised as unbiased, or trained on data that is gathered deceptively, the agency says it could intervene.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kt0hwp"&gt;“In a rush to embrace new technology, be careful not to overpromise what your algorithm can deliver,” writes FTC attorney Elisa Jillson — particularly when promising decisions that don’t reflect racial or gender bias. “The result may be deception, discrimination — and an FTC law enforcement action.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sqDLm3"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/ftc-bias-ai"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;, FTC chair Rebecca Slaughter recently called algorithm-based bias “an economic justice issue.” Slaughter and Jillson both mention that companies could be prosecuted under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act or the Fair Credit Reporting Act for biased and unfair AI-powered decisions, and unfair and deceptive practices could also fall under Section 5 of the FTC Act.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5pMliL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s important to hold yourself accountable for your algorithm’s performance.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="knDMvK"&gt;“It’s important to hold yourself accountable for your algorithm’s performance. Our recommendations for transparency and independence can help you do just that. But keep in mind that if you don’t hold yourself accountable, the FTC may do it for you,” writes Jillson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ncf8vv"&gt;Artificial intelligence holds the potential to mitigate human bias in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/30/18202335/ai-artificial-intelligence-recruiting-hiring-hr-bias-prejudice"&gt;processes like hiring&lt;/a&gt;, but it can also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/10/17958784/ai-recruiting-tool-bias-amazon-report"&gt;reproduce or exaggerate that bias&lt;/a&gt;, particularly if it’s trained in data that reflects it. Facial recognition, for instance, produces less accurate results for Black subjects — potentially encouraging &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22382398/robert-williams-detroit-police-department-aclu-lawsuit-facial-recognition-wrongful-arrest"&gt;false identifications and arrests&lt;/a&gt; when police use it. In 2019, researchers found that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20929337/care-algorithm-study-race-bias-health"&gt;a popular health care algorithm&lt;/a&gt; made Black patients less likely to receive important medical care, reflecting preexisting disparities in the system. Automated gender recognition tech can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22381370/automatic-gender-recognition-sexual-orientation-facial-ai-analysis-ban-campaign"&gt;use simplistic methods&lt;/a&gt; that misclassify transgender or nonbinary people. And automated processes — which are frequently proprietary and secret — can create “black boxes” where it’s difficult to understand or challenge faulty results.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZmguRn"&gt;The European Union &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383301/eu-ai-regulation-draft-leak-surveillance-social-credit"&gt;recently indicated&lt;/a&gt; that it may take a stronger stance on some AI applications, potentially banning its use for “indiscriminate surveillance” and social credit scores. With these latest statements, the FTC has signaled that it’s interested in cracking down on specific, harmful uses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsSpCS"&gt;But it’s still in the early days of doing so, and critics have questioned whether it can meaningfully enforce its rules against major tech companies. In a Senate hearing statement today, FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra complained that “time and time again, when large firms flagrantly violate the law, the FTC is unwilling to pursue meaningful accountability measures,” urging Congress and other commissioners to “turn the page on the FTC’s perceived powerlessness.” In the world of AI, that could mean scrutinizing companies like Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and Google — all of which have invested significant resources in powerful systems.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s ‘Spring Loaded’ iPad Pro event live blog</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qAeLIPlj1WB0iNe2iu2C-XBLpJA=/0x197:2040x1557/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69156579/springblack3.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;iPads? AirTags? AirPods? There could be a lot on tap today&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="t9GFfK"&gt;Apple seemingly has a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22385362/apple-event-ipad-airpods-pencil-tv-tags-rumors-spring-loaded"&gt;big backlog of products to announce&lt;/a&gt;. We’ve been anticipating new iPad Pros, AirTags, AirPods, an Apple TV, and just maybe a new iMac with Arm-based Apple Silicon. The tagline for today’s event, “Spring Loaded,” seems to be a hint that today’s live stream will be chock-full of new stuff. All signs, however, point to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22391979/apple-ipad-pro-vs-macbook-air-2021-anouncement"&gt;new iPad Pros being the star of the show&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nuMEtV"&gt;And it might not be just hardware. Apple is increasingly pushing its own services. Perhaps there will be more on tap today to fill out its Apple One bundle. Obvious candidates are some kind of premium podcast option or maybe even an HD option for Apple Music, but the Apple TV Plus service could also stand to get some more premiere content and today’s stream might be a good place to announce it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxVehb"&gt;There are a lot of possibilities, but only Apple knows which of them it’s choosing for this “loaded” live stream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aJVVpE"&gt;We hope to find out ourselves soon. The event kicks off at 10AM PT / 1PM ET, and we’ll be live-blogging all of the announcements from the live stream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XJt1Gk"&gt;&lt;div class="live-center-embed" data-src="https://livecenter.norkon.net/frame/voxmedia/13709/vox"&gt;&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;(function(n){function c(t,i){n[e](h,function(n){var r,u;if(n&amp;&amp;(r=n[n.message?"message":"data"]+"",r&amp;&amp;r.substr&amp;&amp;r.substr(0,3)==="nc:")&amp;&amp;(u=r.split(":"),u[1]===i))switch(u[2]){case"h":t.style.height=u[3]+"px";return;case"scrolltotop":t.scrollIntoView();return}},!1)}for(var t,u,f,i,s,e=n.addEventListener?"addEventListener":"attachEvent",h=e==="attachEvent"?"onmessage":"message",o=n.document.querySelectorAll(".live-center-embed"),r=0;r&lt;o.length;r++)(t=o[r],t.getAttribute("data-rendered"))||(u=t.getAttribute("data-src"),u&amp;&amp;(t.setAttribute("data-rendered","true"),f=n.ncVizCounter||1e3,n.ncVizCounter=f+1,i=f+"",s="nc-frame-c-"+i,t.innerHTML='&lt;div style="position: relative; height: 300px; border: none;" id="'+s+'"&gt;&lt;iframe src="'+u+"?"+i+'" style="position: absolute; left: 0; top: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;',c(t.firstChild,i)))})(window);&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Outlook now lets you end all meetings early to give your brain a rest</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V7qsxvGY3e32LZKx8LwntyXMkME=/156x0:1844x1125/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69155940/OWA_user_level_setting_in_frame.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;New Outlook settings for meetings.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XnnMSX"&gt;Microsoft is updating Outlook to give companies the option to automatically start or end all meetings early to ensure employees have a break between back-to-backs. New settings in Outlook are rolling out to help reduce the digital overload of working remotely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtMD9z"&gt;Companies can set their own scheduling defaults, and they’re fully customizable. That means you could have five minutes blocked off before or after a 30-minute meeting, or 10-15 minutes after hourlong meetings. Individuals can also set their own scheduling defaults, but the company-wide option is the significant change here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cfDQ5C"&gt;Calendar software like Outlook has defaulted to on-the-hour meetings for decades, often inadvertently promoting the idea of back-to-back meetings with default settings that don’t consider the need for a break in between. If you create a new meeting in Outlook today it will default to on the hour and a 30-minute length. Even the drop-down menu doesn’t make it easy to select a custom time without manually entering it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5n0Z7EZffJqbNurz80bYg4sLzVg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22456619/OWA_org_setting_in_device.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Companies can set new defaults for meetings in Outlook.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="BsLuIm"&gt;Microsoft is making these changes after carrying out its &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fworklab%2Fwork-trend-index%2Fbrain-research" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;own research&lt;/a&gt; on digital overload, in response to the millions of people working from home during the pandemic. Video meetings have become a popular way for workers to communicate, but this change to the way we work has its drawbacks. “More remote work is challenging our wellbeing,” says Jared Spataro, corporate vice president of Microsoft 365. “Digital overload is real, and something has to change.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kv8PN9"&gt;Microsoft thinks this small change to Outlook could be a new way to think about meetings for many and promote wellbeing. Whether corporations enable this widely or if it even has an impact is another matter. Meetings often start late or run over because people are busy unmuting themselves or joining late because another meeting ran over its scheduled time slot. New Outlook settings won’t immediately improve that aspect of meetings, but it could plant a seed of change to help employers and employees think a little more about the impact of meetings and the need to give everyone’s brain a much-needed rest.&lt;/p&gt;
