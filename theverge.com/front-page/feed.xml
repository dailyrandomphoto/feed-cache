    <title>Feds indict ‘The Bull’ for selling insider trading info on the dark web</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wPq6Lq"&gt;Nearly four years after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/14/15975140/alphabay-dark-web-drug-marketplace-police-shutdown-silk-road"&gt;the lights went out at AlphaBay&lt;/a&gt;, the feds are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/17/18226718/alphabay-takedown-drug-marketplace-federal-arrest"&gt;still charging people with criminal activities linked to the dark web marketplace&lt;/a&gt;. On Friday the &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/sec-charges-thebull-selling-insider-trading-tips-dark-web"&gt;SEC&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/dark-web-user-known-bull-charged-insider-trading-scheme"&gt;Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt; announced charges against Apostolos Trovias, a Greek national who they allege posted on dark web marketplaces using the nickname “The Bull.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="icUdHF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Trovias is facing charges of securities fraud and money laundering&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IapKZ2"&gt;However, unlike &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/27/17509444/dark-web-drug-market-money-laundering-hsi-dark-gold"&gt;drug dealers targeted in previous actions&lt;/a&gt;, the authorities allege Trovias used dark web forums as a way to troll for people willing to buy or sell insider trading information while hiding behind “anonymizing software, screen names, and bitcoin payments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUIRTg"&gt;On AlphaBay and other dark web sites like Dream Market or Nightmare Market, the indictment alleges Trovias offered and eventually sold stock tips. However, as the &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2021/comp-pr2021-122.pdf"&gt;complaint describes&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) his customers included at least one IRS agent and an FBI agent working undercover. In 2017, the document alleges Trovias gave the IRS agent pre-release info from earnings releases on at least two occasions in exchange for Bitcoin. The information came from quarterly earnings reports for Illumina and Analogic, although the documents indicate Trovias mixed up some of the data on one of the reports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="xWx5M0"&gt;Between in or about December 2016, when he registered for the site, and in or about July 2017, when AlphaBay ceased operations, APOSTOLOS TROVIAS, a/k/a “The Bull,” the defendant, offered for sale, in, among other places, the “Fraud &amp;gt; Other&amp;gt; Other “ category on AlphaBay, stock tips that were based on nonpublic inside information about certain securities issuers and which could be purchased individually, on a weekly basis, or on a monthly basis for prices ranging from approximately $29.95 per tip to approximately $329.95 for a monthly subscription for tips based on non-public inside information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8V4NQb"&gt;6. Between in or about December 2016, when APOSTOLOS TROVIAS, a/k/a “The Bull,” the defendant, registered his account, and in or about July 2017, when AlphaBay ceased operations, TROVIAS completed the sale of dozens of individual tips, approximately three weekly plans, and approximately three monthly plans, for a total of approximately 45 transactions through the AlphaBay marketplace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qXxcf"&gt;7. Also in or about 2017, APOSTOLOS TROVIAS, a/k/a “ The Bull ,” the defendant, offered for sale and did sell, among other confidential information belonging to various securities issuers, for approximately $5,000 in Bitcoin, at least one pre-release earnings report misappropriated from a publicly-traded company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5fv4vj"&gt;As late as 2020, the feds claim Trovias was trying to build his own dark web site, likely because the marketplaces he used kept getting shut down. The SEC and DOJ documents don’t mention taking the man into custody. However,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://PCMag.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PCMag.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out a document from May 27th &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.scribd.com%2Fdocument%2F515111188%2FTrovias&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F10%2F22571732%2Falphabay-dark-web-insider-trading-bitcoin" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pursuing extradition&lt;/a&gt; after he was arrested in Peru. The DOJ has charged him with one count of securities fraud which carries a max penalty of 25 years in jail, as well as one count of money laundering with a max penalty of 20 years in jail.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bo Burnham’s Netflix special Inside will make a one-night-only theater appearance</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Bo Burnham in Bo Burnham: Inside.&amp;amp;nbsp;" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3WyLQfnKSLN6vRbXjpCAzcx4ku8=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69565724/Bo_Burnham__Inside_00_28_48_22.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bo Burnham in Bo Burnham: Inside&lt;/strong&gt; | Photo: Courtesy of Netflix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ncRzgV"&gt;If you can’t get “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/7_EeCkHs-e0"&gt;Bezos I&lt;/a&gt;” out of your head, then you’re in good company as a soundtrack to &lt;a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81289483"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bo Burnham: Inside&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; scored the comedian &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/billboardcharts/status/1406973768568872961"&gt;the first Billboard Top 10 appearance of his career.&lt;/a&gt; But since the musical comedy special was on Netflix and came out during the pandemic that inspired much of its content, you probably watched it alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6ZoYq3"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O0HWxswRuYQ?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HEk5CP"&gt;Now fans of the special can see it in a group setting, as Netflix and Iconic Events have teamed up to present the special in theaters nationwide on July 22nd. Tickets are available at many theaters across the country, but you may want to move fast — at the moment there is only one showing per theater at the locations I checked, and some already show that they’re sold out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ylaJjD"&gt;Check the &lt;a href="http://boBurnhamInside.com"&gt;BoBurnhamInside.com&lt;/a&gt; website for showing and ticket information, assuming you’re ready to see the show in the company of other people.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch Virgin Galactic launch Richard Branson to space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fsdPounPx3ry30hDO6kFF_5QHPk=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69565253/VC01_84.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo spaceplane is carried between the two fuselages of its WhiteKnight carrier aircraft during a 2016 test.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Virgin Galactic&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LlxWMu"&gt;Virgin Galactic will launch Richard Branson and three company employees to the edge of space on the morning of Sunday, July 11th. The company is promising quite a show for the mission: Stephen Colbert will host the mission’s livestream, singer-songwriter Khalid will &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/khalid-new-normal-virgin-galactic-spaceflight-launch-1194780/"&gt;reportedly&lt;/a&gt; perform a new single live onstage following the spaceplane’s landing, and Branson has said he’ll “announce something very exciting” after his spaceflight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TqCJlp"&gt;The flight marks one of the company’s final test missions before it aims to kick off commercial space tourism business next year. The mission, dubbed Unity 22, will mark Virgin Galactic’s fourth flight to space carrying humans, with its largest crew yet. Four people, including Branson, will test the astronaut cabin experience, and two pilots will be in the cockpit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oeheD4"&gt;The action will start when Virgin Galactic’s twin-fuselage WhiteKnight carrier aircraft takes off from Spaceport America, the company’s spaceport in New Mexico on Sunday morning. The WhiteKnight aircraft, VMS Eve, will carry a rocket-powered spaceship called VSS Unity, with Branson and others on board. About 40 minutes after takeoff, Unity will drop from the middle of the mothership and ignite its rocket engine moments later to send Branson and the crew to the edge of space, about 55 miles high, for a few minutes of weightlessness. Unity will return to a landing strip at Spaceport America, much like any normal commercial airplane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwN0Sm"&gt;Early Sunday morning, Virgin Galactic delayed WhiteKnight’s takeoff by 90 minutes due to overnight weather over Spaceport America, pushing the new time to 10:30AM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vdyltS"&gt;Unity 22 is a significant step forward for Virgin Galactic’s ambitions for space tourism, a burgeoning market catered to wealthy adventure-seekers. The company, started in 2004, has already sold roughly 600 tickets, with each ticket going for around $250,000. Branson is just one player in the billionaire-led race to court space tourists. He’s vying with Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, which aims to launch passengers on its suborbital New Shepard rocket, and Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which plans to put tourists in its orbital Crew Dragon capsule for a longer and more expensive experience in space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ipFbKJ"&gt;Sunday’s mission has also been surrounded by an increasingly spicy air of competition with Bezos. Virgin Galactic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22559964/richard-branson-space-before-jeff-bezos-virgin-galactic"&gt;announced Branson’s spaceflight&lt;/a&gt; a few weeks after Blue Origin announced it would send Bezos to space on July 20th. Then, Blue Origin announced it’d also fly Wally Funk on its July 20th mission, an aviator who initially planned to fly on Virgin Galactic’s spaceship first. Branson denies his new flight date was meant to beat Bezos to space; he &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/07/01/branson-bezos-space-race/"&gt;told&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;last week it was just a “wonderful coincidence that we’re going up in the same month.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMlhIq"&gt;Watch Virgin Galactic’s livestream starting at 10:30AM ET on Sunday on its &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/virgingalactic?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor"&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/VirginGalactic/"&gt;Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClcvOr7LV8tlJwJvkNMmnKg"&gt;YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla finally begins shipping ‘Full Self-Driving’ beta version 9 after a long delay </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla will ship a “full self-driving” car in a beta version." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xt2Lj-nWywE3A8JJptm0iYHsC70=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69564916/jbareham_180213_2301_0149.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nAFbCb"&gt;Tesla began sending out over-the-air software updates for its long-awaited “Full Self-Driving” beta version 9, the definitely-not-autonomous-but-certainly-advanced driver assist system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NgEQUy"&gt;As promised by Elon Musk, the software update (&lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/oher5v/tesla_fsd_beta_v9_202141812_initial_release/"&gt;2021.4.18.12&lt;/a&gt;) began uploading after midnight on Friday, giving thousands of Tesla owners who have purchased the FSD option access to the feature, which enables drivers to use many of Autopilot’s advanced driver-assist features on local, non-highway streets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q7kFah"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sc_KZTpp1LU?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jla1G8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Musk has been promising v9 of the software for, well, a while now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mP4dyU"&gt;Musk has been promising v9 of the software for, well, a while now. He said in 2018 that the “long awaited” version of FSD would begin rolling out in August. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/24/18512580/elon-musk-tesla-driverless-cars-lidar-simulation-waymo"&gt;He did it again in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, proclaiming that “a year from now” there would be “over a million cars with full self-driving, software, everything.” Earlier this month, he claimed that “FSD 9 beta is shipping soon.” So to say that Tesla fans have been anticipating this update for a while would be an understatement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GyHgNR"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;New Visualizations. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/fsdbeta?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#fsdbeta&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/DamYuSmlNf"&gt;pic.twitter.com/DamYuSmlNf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Eli Burton (@EliBurton_) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EliBurton_/status/1413767377032933376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a49K9n"&gt;The real question is whether it’s ready for primetime. To that, Musk gave a typical muddled response, tweeting that “Beta 9 addresses most known issues, but there will be unknown issues, so please be paranoid.” He added, “Safety is always top priority at Tesla.” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tesla_raj/status/1413764413165772803"&gt;Release notes&lt;/a&gt; included with the update warn testers that “it may do the wrong thing at the worst time” and to avoid complacence. They also mention improvements to the cabin camera’s driver monitoring to check for attentiveness, along with updated, larger visualizations on the in-car display (as shown above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VrYNNY"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Running preproduction software is both work &amp;amp; fun. Beta list was in stasis, as we had many known issues to fix. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Beta 9 addresses most known issues, but there will be unknown issues, so please be paranoid.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Safety is always top priority at Tesla.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1413306409693892613?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PbqwKA"&gt;There’s no question that Tesla is more willing than its competitors to test beta versions of its Autopilot driver assist feature on its customers in the interest of gathering data and working out any bugs in the system. And Tesla customers are mostly fine with this, routinely flooding Musk’s mentions begging to be admitted into the company’s Early Access Program for beta testers. This has helped contribute to &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2019-tesla-model-3-survey/autopilot.html?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;Tesla’s public reputation&lt;/a&gt; as a leader in autonomous driving, despite its vehicles continuously falling short of what most experts would agree defines a self-driving car.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YnfTPk"&gt;Tesla warns that drivers need to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel at all times, though the automaker famously refuses to include a more robust driver-monitoring system (like infrared eye tracking, for example) to ensure its customers are following safety protocols (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22457430/tesla-in-car-camera-driver-monitoring-system"&gt;although maybe that’s changing&lt;/a&gt;). Autopilot is considered a Level 2 “partially automated” system by the Society of Automotive Engineers’ standards (and by Tesla’s lawyers), which requires that drivers keep their hands on the wheel and eyes on the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C4ciBX"&gt;However, consumer advocates have proven that Tesla’s system can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22397546/tesla-autopilot-consumer-report-test-no-driver"&gt;easily be tricked&lt;/a&gt; into thinking there’s someone in the driver seat, which gained renewed attention in the aftermath of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/18/22390612/two-people-killed-fiery-tesla-crash-no-driver"&gt;a fatal crash in Texas&lt;/a&gt; involving a Tesla, in which authorities said there was no one behind the steering wheel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="s0AjGy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;this hasn’t stopped some Tesla owners from abusing Autopilot&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NrSOgM"&gt;But this hasn’t stopped some Tesla owners from abusing Autopilot — sometimes going so far as to film and publicize the results. Drivers have been caught sleeping in the passenger seat or backseat of their Teslas while the vehicle speeds down a crowded highway. A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/18/21445168/tesla-driver-sleeping-police-charged-canada-autopilot"&gt;Canadian man was charged with reckless driving&lt;/a&gt; last year after being pulled over for sleeping while traveling at speeds of 93mph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x47nWx"&gt;Since Tesla introduced Autopilot in 2015, there have been at least &lt;a href="https://www.tesladeaths.com/"&gt;11 deaths in nine crashes&lt;/a&gt; in the US that involved the driver assistance system. Internationally, there have been at least another nine deaths in seven additional crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lwRuVa"&gt;Meanwhile, the US government is requiring that car companies report crashes involving autonomous vehicles or advanced driver assist systems, often within a day of the incident. It was a major change that signals &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/30/22557135/nhtsa-autonomous-adas-crash-rule-response-tesla"&gt;a tougher stance&lt;/a&gt; on these partially automated systems by regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The search is over: smart trackers from Apple, Samsung, and Tile compared</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;It’s never been easier to keep track of your keys&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Yn4hTB"&gt;This year will go down in history as the year we entered the golden age of Not Losing Your Stuff. Well, in addition to some other historic milestones, somewhere in the top 100 hits of the year will be the introduction of smart tracker tags from two major mobile device manufacturers: Samsung and Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1LL5zg"&gt;Tracking tags have been around for a while now, and Tile has been the best-known brand in the space. With new options from the two most popular US phone manufacturers entering the picture, tracking tags may be poised to go mainstream. If you’re thinking of picking one up but unsure where to start, then you’re in the right place. We tried out three top tracking tags — the Samsung SmartTag Plus, Apple AirTag, and Tile Pro — to see how they compare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xXXOP8"&gt;First, a word about the very real privacy concerns about these tracking devices. Since their introduction, critics have noted that they could all too easily be used as tools for stalkers, since they’re easy to hide in someone’s bag or car. These concerns were amplified when Apple’s AirTags arrived, given how ubiquitous Apple’s Find My network is. Apple built in certain anti-stalking safety measures at launch, but &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-best-thing-about-apples-airtags-is-also-the-scaries-1846786338"&gt;reporters quickly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/05/apple-airtags-stalking/"&gt;identified ways&lt;/a&gt; that these safeguards fell short. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="CXhCa4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With new options from the two most popular US phone manufacturers, tracking tags may be poised to go mainstream&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2AwmYL"&gt;The company has addressed some issues, like shortening the length of time before an AirTag will sound an alert when it’s separated from its owner, and is working on an app that will allow Android users to find unwanted AirTags near them. But some potential for misuse will remain even with more safety measures in place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="au3ILG"&gt;Apple (justifiably) attracts more scrutiny for its safety practices given the size and effectiveness of its tracking network, but it’s hardly alone in its somewhat reactive attitude toward stalking concerns. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22392924/samsung-smartags-tracker-bixby-privacy-smartthings"&gt;Samsung introduced a SmartThings app feature&lt;/a&gt; that scans for unfamiliar SmartTags, and Tile says it’s working on a similar feature. It doesn’t help that these devices more or less live inside their own manufacturer’s walled garden — a unified, cross-platform approach is sorely needed. Anyway, it’s illegal (and highly immoral) to track someone without their knowledge, so don’t do it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ayjCuN"&gt;Per usual, adding new tech to your life involves more terms and conditions to agree to. However, in this case you may have already accepted them when you set up your Apple or Samsung phone. Tile’s app, which you must download to use the Pro, presents its own separate set of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thetileapp.com%2Fen-us%2Fterms-of-service&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22570161%2Fapple-airtag-samsung-smarttag-tile-pro-bluetooth-tracker-review-test-comparison" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;terms of service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pfRRvwHF0x2ZIq0H7G1fIytsSkI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702210/ajohnson_210702_4659_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tile has been the best-known brand in the tracking tag space until now.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="vB8PcA"&gt;Personal trackers are nothing new — GPS and cellular options have been around for quite some time, and offer more precise, real-time location tracking. They also tend to come with a higher price tag, recurring subscription or wireless data fees, and require more battery power. This newer class of Bluetooth trackers are more practical for most people, with battery life measured in months rather than days and smaller, keyring-friendly form factors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhiUx0"&gt;Essentially, the three tags compared here all do the same thing. Pair it to your phone, attach it to something you want to keep track of, and you’re ready to go. When the tracker is within Bluetooth range of your phone, you can have the tag play a sound to help locate it. All three devices support out-of-range finding with their own particular device user networks, and they all include the same kind of user-replaceable CR2032 coin cell battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlEXn2"&gt;Their main difference is whether or not they include AR-assisted finding by way of Ultra Wideband (UWB) connectivity: the Samsung and Apple tags have this and the Tile Pro does not. To take advantage of the AR feature, you’ll need a phone with UWB; on the Apple side that’s an iPhone 11 or newer, and for Samsung it’s a Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, Z Fold 2, S21 Plus, or S21 Ultra. There are also compatibility differences: Apple’s tracker only works with iOS devices and Samsung’s only works with Galaxy devices (no, you can’t register it through the SmartThings iOS app, I tried), whereas Tile works on both iOS and Android.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OMzWKLcxkNQ7oNoAy-D1TFh941U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702209/ajohnson_210702_4659_0005.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirTag is the least expensive of the bunch, but without a built-in keyring hole you may need to buy a holder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KkUjYi"&gt;Apple AirTag&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="K8LyRt"&gt;The AirTag comes in just one flavor: a small, $29 disc shape. It’s the only one of the three to include an official IP67 rating, meaning it can survive a dunk in a bit of water. It also allows you to store your contact information so it can be read by any phone with NFC (near-field communication) — even Android phones. Setup is dead simple — just bring the tag near your iPhone and you’ll be prompted to pair the two. It’s also a little less expensive than the other two, but there’s no hole built in, so if you want to attach it to a set of keys you’ll need to pay a little more to add a holder. (We don’t really recommend drilling a hole into it, though &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FGuide%2FHow%2Bto%2BDrill%2Ba%2BKeyring%2BHole%2Bin%2Ban%2BAirTag%2F143068&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22570161%2Fapple-airtag-samsung-smarttag-tile-pro-bluetooth-tracker-review-test-comparison" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit has a guide&lt;/a&gt; if you insist.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="S0KD9T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10644655"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OP3rsJ"&gt;When it’s outside the Bluetooth range of your phone, the AirTag taps into the massive network of iPhone devices using Find My to provide an approximate location. This is a huge benefit, especially in the US where iPhones abound. As long as your item is in a place with &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;, it will likely be “seen” by an iPhone nearby. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="XmpgHp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;As long as your item is in a place with &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;, it will likely be “seen” by an iPhone nearby&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nkECyk"&gt;In-range, AR-assisted finding does a good job of tracking down an object that’s out of sight. A big, easy-to-follow arrow appears on screen when the signal is strong enough (you’ll be prompted with a vague message to move around if you’re too far for a strong signal) and guides you in the right direction. I had no problem locating a tag under a couch cushion in my house. It would be helpful if the “weak signal” message indicated if the signal got stronger as you move around (Samsung’s AR finding does this) but that’s my only complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0q41aP"&gt;If you’d like to altogether avoid the headache of leaving something behind, Apple is adding a separation alert feature in iOS 15 that may help. Once set up, it will send a notification if it detects that your iPhone (and by extension, you) have gone out of range and left it behind. Tile also offers this feature with its Premium subscription.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7Zu4DCPNye2enQZo0XfHl_FbQL0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702211/ajohnson_210702_4659_0007.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;SmartTag Plus includes AR-assisted finding for objects in close range.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="07bZ8a"&gt;Samsung SmartTag Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="dHJGkw"&gt;The $39 SmartTag Plus is Samsung’s UWB-equipped tag; there’s also a non-UWB version for $10 less. The SmartTag Plus offers broadly similar Bluetooth-range finding and AR-assist as the AirTag, with a few differences. AR finding mode provides a view through the phone’s camera with guiding arrows that appear on the screen, which is a little more helpful than Apple’s arrow-only guide. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="doXMn8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10644672"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vDi1au"&gt;You can also use the button on a SmartTag as a kind of remote starter for smart home automations if you’re invested in Samsung’s SmartThings ecosystem. On the downside, the SmartTag has the shortest battery life rating of the three trackers compared here: up to 165 days (less than six months) compared to about a year for the Tile and Apple options. SmartTags don’t offer separation alerts at the moment either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="QZmIv6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the SmartTag gave me an accurate enough location that I could have driven up I-5 myself and located the tag&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yBoLCQ"&gt;Out-of-range, the SmartTag Plus relies on other Galaxy devices that have chosen to participate in Samsung’s Galaxy Find network — Galaxy phone users aren’t opted in by default, and need to give consent in the SmartThings app. Samsung says that as of April 2021, there were &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1745743505176533597" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;more than 70 million “helper devices” participating globally&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F04%2Fapples-find-my-network-now-offers-new-third-party-finding-experiences%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22570161%2Fapple-airtag-samsung-smarttag-tile-pro-bluetooth-tracker-review-test-comparison" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple counts hundreds of millions of users&lt;/a&gt; in its Find My network. There are simply fewer people in the US with Galaxy phones than iPhones, so it can’t quite compete with the AirTag, but that’s a moot point anyway since nobody is likely to be comparison shopping between the two. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c2tdm2"&gt;Experiences will vary — more so than with an AirTag — but at least in the northern suburbs of Seattle, there were enough Galaxy Find users out and about to track a tag on a cross-town journey with multiple stops. Knowing the actual location of the object, er, spouse who agreed to let me track him, the SmartTag did identify his position accurately at two of three stops. It only returned a location a couple of times when he was on the interstate getting to his destination, but in a fairly busy business park and at a restaurant, the SmartTag gave me an accurate enough location that I could have driven up I-5 myself and located the tag. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eNM85lo7N16YWsKU7QsiGNbEksk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22702206/ajohnson_210702_4659_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tile’s tags work with both iOS and Android devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="quRzYe"&gt;Tile Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="6mesvM"&gt;Tile has been the tracking tag category heavyweight of the last few years — at least until Samsung and Apple showed up. The Pro is the company’s highest-specced model at $34, with a bigger Bluetooth range (400 feet) and a louder maximum ring volume than other current Tile tags. There’s no Ultra Wideband here, and thus no AR-assisted finding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yAgNuq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10644691"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="btTY78"&gt;Separation alerts are available as part of Tile’s $29/year Premium subscription, but all of the essential features are included with your Tile tag purchase, including out-of-range finding. This “community find” feature relies on other Tile users — and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424837/tile-amazon-sidewalk-support-release-date-2021-bluetooth-tracking-airtags" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as of June 14th, Amazon’s Sidewalk network&lt;/a&gt; — the way Samsung and Apple’s trackers rely on other Galaxy phones and iPhones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8WzYkQ"&gt;Even with help from Sidewalk, the Tile Pro’s peer-location network seems to lag behind Samsung and Apple’s. On the same journey up I-5 that the SmartTag Plus took, the Tile Pro returned a location ping less frequently, and only got one of the stops on the trip precisely right (it was close but across the street on another one) where the SmartTag was accurate on two locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mUmqjJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even with help from Sidewalk, the Tile Pro’s peer-location network seems to lag behind Samsung and Apple’s&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8OJlei"&gt;This was honestly a better performance than I was expecting, though Seattle probably has more than its usual share of Sidewalk-supporting Amazon devices for obvious reasons. Even if it’s an atypical result, it’s fair to say that the community find feature would work well enough to tell you that you really &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; lose something, even if it’s less likely that you’ll be able to hunt down its exact location.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xbsdOV"&gt;I do have one minor complaint to lodge against the Tile app: the subscription upsell. A couple of app menus include features that are only available with the Premium plan, and tapping them brings up a page prompting you to start a free trial to access them. I expect to see those kinds of things during setup, or if I’m using a free app like Strava, but it’s a little annoying from something I’ve already paid for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GlbF1T"&gt;Tile also offers its trackers in a couple of different form factors, including a wallet-friendly Slim version and a small adhesive-backed Sticker tag. There are plenty of third-party cases and holders for AirTags in particular if you want to adapt it for different objects, but you can’t buy an AirTag or a SmartTag in a fundamentally different shape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="btAqHr"&gt;AirTag or Tile Pro?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="XqsNHq"&gt;If you have an iPhone, there’s a very simple answer to this question: just get the AirTag. The Apple Find My network is so extensive (at least in the US) that you’ll have the best chance of tracking down something the tag is attached to. Maybe there’s an exception to this recommendation if you really want Tile’s subscription features or mix of form factors, but by and large this is a no-brainer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RWH2Kx"&gt;SmartTag Plus or Tile Pro?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="pbD9SM"&gt;If you have a Samsung phone you’ll probably be better off with the SmartTag Plus. The Galaxy Find network isn’t as robust as Apple’s, but it’s still ahead of Tile’s. If you already use smart home devices in Samsung’s SmartThings network, then there’s even more reason to choose SmartTag since it can act as a remote control for automations. The shorter battery life is a shame and the lack of separation notifications stinks, so if those are sticking points you could consider the Tile Pro. Otherwise, the SmartTag Plus (or non-UWB version, depending on your phone) is the way to go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="YS3j0F"&gt;Tile or… ?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FHfboY"&gt;If you don’t have an iPhone or a Galaxy device, your choice is between the Tile Pro and… everything else. Tile’s out-of-range network can’t compete with the number of devices Samsung and Apple have in our pockets, but it seems to be getting a healthy boost from Sidewalk, and can only get better as more people add Echo and Ring devices to their homes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="7nh3V8"&gt;If community finding features are less important, &lt;a href="https://chipolo.net/en/pages/products" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Chipolo is worth a look&lt;/a&gt;. We didn’t test it in this batch, but it does include separation notifications without an annual fee. Overall, the Tile Pro feels like a good compromise between paying for something more expensive and power-intensive like a cellular tracker, or a more basic, Bluetooth-only tracker. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ebCLRg"&gt;The Monster Hunter franchise has seen resurgent in the West in recent years thanks to blockbuster hits like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/25/16931366/monster-hunter-world-review-ps4-xbox-one-release-date"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22352085/monster-hunter-rise-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. However, the latest Nintendo Switch spin-off, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0939SGP51/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, is less about slaying monsters as it is catching them. The turn-based title is vibrant and a bit cliche, but if you’re looking for a &lt;em&gt;MonHun &lt;/em&gt;game with a lighter tone and tried-and-true JRPG mechanics, &lt;em&gt;Wings of Ruin &lt;/em&gt;is already &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0939SGP51/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon for $50&lt;/a&gt;, nearly 20 percent of the list price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3TaN4R"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10644916"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="c89aFO"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GBZ4Q68/?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=32&amp;amp;imprToken=06bd4661-2452-5d0d-e32&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D22334255%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;One of the most budget-friendly gaming mice is even more affordable at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="4NWuIz"&gt;If you’re a PC gamer who wants to make the most of titles like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Apex Legends&lt;/em&gt;, a competent gaming mouse is a must-have accessory. Thankfully, the Logitech G502 Hero — the wired counterpart to our top pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21252193/best-gaming-mouse"&gt;best wireless gaming mouse&lt;/a&gt; — is an affordable way to go, with 11 customizable buttons, programmable lighting, and a flexible weight system that allows you to adjust the resistance to your liking on the fly. Typically on sale for around $50, Logitech’s G502 is currently &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07GBZ4Q68?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at Amazon for $38&lt;/a&gt;, the steepest price cut we’ve seen on the popular gaming mouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="j5Vchu"&gt;The Acer Swift 3 isn’t our No. 1 pick for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptop&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s one of our go-to recommendations for college students given checks all the right boxes. It’s lightweight and performs well for the price, and &lt;a href="https://www.costco.com/.product.1430179.html"&gt;at Costco&lt;/a&gt;, it’s available with 8GB of RAM, a 512GB SSD, and an AMD Ryzen 5 processor for $490. Like all configurations, Costco’s members-only variant also touts an integrated fingerprint reader, a healthy selection of ports, and a backlit keyboard for after-hours work. We admit that the Swift 3’s sturdy, aluminum build won’t win any design competitions, but it’s also a budget laptop that won’t break the bank, either. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21377208/acer-swift-3-review-2020-14-inch-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo refuses to say if the OLED Switch fixes Joy-Con drift</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G3liC21A-IICAhdzTX58pD5d4PI=/110x0:1330x813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69564804/joy_con_02.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vTJVOB"&gt;Nintendo revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;a new model of the Switch this week&lt;/a&gt; that adds an OLED screen, enhanced speakers, and a much-improved kickstand. One thing it seems the OLED Switch won’t bring, however, is a fix for the Joy-Con drift issues that have plagued Switch owners for years — and frustratingly, Nintendo won’t even confirm that it won’t. A variety of publications including &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;tried to ask the question, but Nintendo won’t tackle it head-on, despite other helpful answers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565118/nintendo-oled-switch-cpu-ram-bluetooth-audio-headphones-dock-no-4k"&gt;like how the new Switch won’t have a new CPU&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWj6Bs"&gt;Switch owners have been reporting Joy-Con drift problems &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21504741/nintendo-switch-joy-con-drift-problem-explained"&gt;for years&lt;/a&gt;, and the problem is bad enough that it’s the subject &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-the-lawsuits-nintendo-is-facing-over-joy-con-drift"&gt;of numerous lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; — though Nintendo will unofficially fix controllers experiencing Joy-Con drift &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/23/20707849/nintendo-will-reportedly-fix-joy-con-drift-for-free-even-out-of-warranty"&gt;for free&lt;/a&gt;, even if you’re out of warranty. One of our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22315790/nintendo-switch-pro-4k-oled-upgraded-what-we-want"&gt;top requests for a revised Switch&lt;/a&gt; was a fix for the drift problems, and we hoped that a Switch revision would have been the moment Nintendo finally addressed this major issue. But it seems likely that Nintendo did not take the opportunity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r4jhef"&gt;In a statement Nintendo provided to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cecianasta/status/1412443261814382595"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22565241/nintendo-switch-new-oled-model-joy-con-drift"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Polygon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oled-nintendo-switch-model-has-the-same-joy-cons-nintendo-confirms/1100-6493614/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GameSpot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, the company said that the “Joy-Con controller configuration and functionality did not change with Nintendo Switch (OLED model).” But we didn’t ask about the “configuration” or “functionality,” as it was pretty clear from Nintendo’s announcement that the controllers would be the same. We asked about drift, which is a reliability issue. And when we asked the question again in an even clearer fashion, we were referred to the same statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XedZYa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Reliability, not configuration or functionality&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6XSrDG"&gt;That seems to suggest there aren’t any changes. An FAQ on the &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Nintendo-Switch-Family/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-model-/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-model%E2%80%942000984.html"&gt;company’s UK website is even more explicit&lt;/a&gt;: “The Joy-Con controllers included with Nintendo Switch (OLED model) are the same as the controllers currently available.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xy5WJu"&gt;Nintendo’s statement does acknowledge that there are problems with Joy-Con controllers — “We are aware of reports that some Joy-Con controllers have not responded correctly,” Nintendo said — but merely suggested that customers visit its support site to deal with any issues. That language isn’t new; Nintendo issued a very similar statement &lt;a href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/nintendo/nintendo-updates-joy-con-drift-policy-will-fix-def/"&gt;nearly two years ago&lt;/a&gt; after &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/8xzzva/internal-nintendo-memo-instructs-customer-service-to-fix-joy-con-drift-for-free"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; published an internal Nintendo memo&lt;/a&gt; instructing customer service reps to fix Joy-Con drift issues for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYLR9v"&gt;And Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said that “we apologize for any inconvenience experienced by consumers” because of Joy-Con problems &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2020/qa2006e.pdf"&gt;in an investor Q&amp;amp;A last year&lt;/a&gt;, but added that “I have no information to share about any specific actions we have taken” to fix issues, suggesting his hands were tied because of a class-action lawsuit in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ty5pOB"&gt;Until somebody can open up a set of Joy-Cons included with the new Switch, we won’t know for sure that there aren’t any unannounced fixes for the drift issues. But based on what Nintendo has said, I wouldn’t hold your breath. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EdQrSM"&gt;While the OLED Switch may not have been the “Pro” upgrade &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22315790/nintendo-switch-pro-4k-oled-upgraded-what-we-want"&gt;we were hoping for&lt;/a&gt;, the improvements &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;still make a big difference&lt;/a&gt;, according to my colleague Dieter Bohn, who got to try out the new Switch. But if you decide to pick up the $350 console when it launches October 8th, you might want to mentally prepare for the possibility that your new Joy-Cons might end up with the drift issue someday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iHazQt"&gt;Here’s Nintendo’s full statement on the matter:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="T0Hwqz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Joy-Con controller configuration and functionality did not change with Nintendo Switch (OLED model). The configuration and functionally is the same as that of the Joy-con controllers for the Nintendo Switch console. At Nintendo, we take great pride in creating quality products and we are continuously making improvements to them. We are aware of reports that some Joy-Con controllers have not responded correctly. We want our consumers to have fun with Nintendo Switch, and if anything falls short of this goal we always encourage them to visit &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__support.nintendo.com&amp;amp;d=DwMFAg&amp;amp;c=Ftw_YSVcGmqQBvrGwAZugGylNRkk-uER0-5bY94tjsc&amp;amp;r=B34I4dJ2bWTOkzssAKywV0DkXMjTumgRTZ1yiaNnNrI&amp;amp;m=4QvkfRn1VuitWeL7Rp7Grf9EQKliv5tf9MSvWb5kkcU&amp;amp;s=rOcfPJLh9r2GqzdUrcaeomr11bHPblC22qpzlS_kMJE&amp;amp;e="&gt;&lt;em&gt;http://support.nintendo.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; so we can help.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

    <title>Samsung quietly launched its free TV service on the web</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JNHLWIZitvROTDYEV5iRNFvJ1NQ=/0x0:845x563/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69563857/TV_Plus_main1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung TV Plus displayed on a screen.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TyGLdg"&gt;Samsung recently launched a web version of its free and ad-supported Smart TV Plus streaming service for live and linear programming as well as added casting support for Chromecast devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wEMhCm"&gt;The streaming product, which was previously limited to Samsung TV and mobile devices, launched as a web service in the second quarter, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/samsung-tv-plus-web-chromecast"&gt;Protocol reported&lt;/a&gt; Friday. It’s a curious new player in the streaming wars and launched with seemingly little fanfare, but the rollout makes an app that was previously limited to Samsung users now widely available to just about anyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QSrfb"&gt;Samsung did not have immediate comment about the launch when reached on Friday. However, a spokesperson confirmed the launch of the web version of the service to Protocol. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pwd1Sp"&gt;Samsung TV Plus has been around for years — it’s been available on Samsung smart TVs since 2016 — but the rollout to additional devices outside of the streaming ecosystem places it more directly in competition with ad-supported streaming services like Peacock, the Roku Channel, or any number of linear-programming freebies like Pluto TV or Plex. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpawAd"&gt;While it’s unclear why the company seems to have decided to soft launch the web version of its streaming service now, Samsung appears to be exploring ways to bring TV Plus to a larger audience. Choice is always great and you can’t beat the price of free (particularly if you can stand to sit through ads), but if Samsung’s ambitions are to dominate the linear streaming space, it’s a bit late to the party. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Biden’s executive order puts net neutrality back in the spotlight</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Biden Delivers Remarks On Promoting American Economy Competition" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EoIfZBozRlhalpVth7GS_OZRTUI=/0x0:4331x2887/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69563803/1233894512.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="0dUIWc"&gt;Earlier today President Biden &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/9/22569869/biden-executive-order-right-to-repair-isps-net-neutrality"&gt;signed the Executive Order on Promoting Competition in the American Economy&lt;/a&gt;, and in it there were several provisions relating to net neutrality. The prior administration’s FCC and FTC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/11/17439456/net-neutrality-dead-ajit-pai-fcc-internet"&gt;rolled back Obama-era rules in those areas&lt;/a&gt;, and now there is a clear agenda to restore them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="6rBq7y"&gt;Directives for the FCC from the order:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="0UwQn6"&gt; (i)   adopting through appropriate rulemaking “Net Neutrality” rules similar to those previously adopted under title II of the Communications Act of 1934 (Public Law 73-416, 48 Stat. 1064, 47 U.S.C. 151 et seq.), as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, in “Protecting and Promoting the Open Internet,” 80 Fed. Reg. 19738 (Apr. 13, 2015);            &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ft4cBs"&gt;(iv)  prohibiting unjust or unreasonable early termination fees for end-user communications contracts, enabling consumers to more easily switch providers;         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhB00s"&gt;(v)   initiating a rulemaking that requires broadband service providers to display a broadband consumer label, such as that as described in the Public Notice of the Commission issued on April 4, 2016 (DA 16–357), so as to give consumers clear, concise, and accurate information regarding provider prices and fees, performance, and network practices;         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="exJ0bQ"&gt;(vi)  initiating a rulemaking to require broadband service providers to regularly report broadband price and subscription rates to the Federal Communications Commission for the purpose of disseminating that information to the public in a useful manner, to improve price transparency and market functioning; and         &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ENQir0"&gt;(vii) initiating a rulemaking to prevent landlords and cable and Internet service providers from inhibiting tenants’ choices among providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ooKJes"&gt;The FCC is now tasked with reviving the “Broadband Nutrition Label” that &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/events/2016/04/consumer-broadband-labels-announcement"&gt;was in development in 2016&lt;/a&gt;. The label would provide a standardized format for providers to display their price, data allowances and details on performance, similar to the labels you currently see on food at the grocery store.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Sample “Broadband Nutrition Label”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EzkNZ9FT5XPi2IJHO1ZMdcHar_k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22709245/Fixed_Consumer_Broadband_Label_Sample_500h.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;FCC&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Sample “Broadband Nutrition Label”&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8BrC3V"&gt;The FCC has also been asked to start the process of requiring ISPs to regularly report their prices to the FCC to help “improve price transparency and market functioning.” As &lt;a href="https://www.nexttv.com/news/biden-launches-potential-broadband-regulatory-blitz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Multichannel News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; points out, implementing these changes will require adding a third commissioner to the FCC who will vote in favor of these measures, breaking the current 2-2 tie. Current acting FCC chair Jessica Rosenworcel &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/acting-chairwoman-rosenworcel-competition-focused-executive-order"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; that “I welcome this effort by the President to enhance competition in the American economy and in the nation’s communications sector.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzKbsL"&gt;Republican FCC commissioner Brendan Carr would be expected to have a no vote on many of these policies, and &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/commissioner-carr-statement-white-house-executive-order"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; that this order “seems to double down on price controls, government-run networks, and monopoly-style regulations—actions that would only make it harder for smaller providers and new entrants to compete.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FutqJz"&gt;While ISPs like Comcast and Verizon have not yet responded to requests for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, cable industry lobbying groups quickly put out their own information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzqcGc"&gt;Speaking for a group that represents “small and medium-sized cable operators,” American Communications Association president Matthew Polka chose to largely ignore everything in the order. Instead his statement takes aim at what he sees as a lack of competitive market for another target, studios and broadcast stations, in a statement that &lt;a href="https://acaconnects.org/aca-connects-statement-on-president-bidens-executive-order-on-competition-in-communications-markets/"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; “Every day our members are unfairly leveraged by large video programmers and broadcast station groups, causing our customers’ video rates to soar...members fear that dominant Internet platforms and powerful streaming services may choose not to make their services available to the subscribers of some smaller ISPs.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hBKKM4"&gt;The NCTA counts Comcast, WarnerMedia, Disney, Charter and Cox among its members and is ostensibly in favor of an “&lt;a href="https://www.ncta.com/positions/open-internet"&gt;open internet&lt;/a&gt;,” as long as no one tries to classify broadband as a utility or passes any rules that would make sure it stays that way. The cable industry group &lt;a href="https://www.ncta.com/media/media-room/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy"&gt;issued a statement&lt;/a&gt; (with no name attached) that says “we are disappointed that the Executive Order rehashes misleading claims about the broadband marketplace, including the tired and disproven assertion that ISPs would block or throttle consumers from accessing the internet content of their choice.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S8b05l"&gt;Similarly, the CTIA represents the interests of its member wireless carriers and is coming out against the order. In its own statement the association &lt;a href="https://www.ctia.org/news/ctia-statement-on-july-2021-white-house-executive-order"&gt;is claiming&lt;/a&gt; “the highly regulatory approach outlined in today’s order unfortunately risks harming consumers by distracting from bipartisan efforts to close the digital divide, inhibiting new competitive choices and innovation, jeopardizing new job creation, and needlessly risking our nation’s future technological leadership.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1eGRg"&gt;On the other side, Free Press VP of policy and general counsel Matt Wood &lt;a href="https://www.freepress.net/news/press-releases/biden-executive-order-urges-fcc-restore-net-neutrality-and-promote-broadband-competition"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt; “the FCC needs to reverse the damage done by the Trump administration, which presided over rising prices and declining investment in broadband while pretending that a do-nothing deregulatory approach would solve these problems... When the Trump FCC abandoned the proper legal framework and policies in 2017, people of every political stripe overwhelmingly opposed that repeal. When we finally have a full and functioning FCC dedicated to promoting the public interest again, the agency can get the job done — taking the kinds of steps outlined in today’s executive order and more.”&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KOFDJA"&gt;A sweeping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22424363/ftc-repair-restrictions-report-nixing-the-fix-smartphones-automakers"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; aimed at promoting economic competition and signed Friday by President Joe Biden called on the Federal Trade Commission to institute rules to curb anticompetitive restrictions that limit consumers’ ability to repair gadgets on their own terms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yh7X5N"&gt;Tucked into the &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/07/09/executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/"&gt;executive order&lt;/a&gt; that covered 72 initiatives to promote competition in the US economy, Biden specifically asked the FTC to crack down on “unfair anticompetitive restrictions on third-party repair or self-repair of items, such as the restrictions imposed by powerful manufacturers that prevent farmers from repairing their own equipment.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jk3en3"&gt;The order is a significant win for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21549129/massachusetts-right-to-repair-question-1-wireless-car-data-passes"&gt;right to repair&lt;/a&gt; advocates who have long championed a consumer’s choice to have their technology fixed either by third parties or on their own, rather than solely by the manufacturer. Right to repair argues that anyone &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/6/21126970/apple-iphone-independent-repair-contract-search-audit"&gt;should have access&lt;/a&gt; to the OEM parts, manuals, and software needed to perform those repairs. Major gadget makers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525542/apple-right-to-repair-bill-california-lobbyist-comptia"&gt;have lobbied&lt;/a&gt; to prevent this kind of repair accessibility, but the right to repair movement has been picking up momentum in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aAIJLz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Proctor said it was “a big day for the right to fix our stuff.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Uqn7ff"&gt;Specifically, Biden &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/07/09/fact-sheet-executive-order-on-promoting-competition-in-the-american-economy/"&gt;took aim&lt;/a&gt; at cell phone makers and other tech companies, including  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22533735/john-deere-cto-hindman-decoder-interview-right-to-repair-tractors"&gt;tractor manufacturers&lt;/a&gt;, that “impose restrictions on self and third-party repairs, making repairs more costly and time-consuming, such as by restricting the distribution of parts, diagnostics, and repair tools.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7tqdiQ"&gt;In a statement, US PIRG’s senior right to repair campaign director Nathan Proctor said it was “a big day for the right to fix our stuff.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ij3n0B"&gt;“More repair choices will protect the environment by cutting down on the amount of new electronics we make and old stuff we toss,” Proctor said. “More choices help save money and cut down-time waiting for the manufacturer’s technician, which is especially important for farmers on tight planting or harvesting schedules. This is a win.”&lt;/p&gt;
