    <title>A hospital algorithm designed to predict a deadly condition misses most cases</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3pzvjq"&gt;The biggest electronic health record company in the United States, Epic Systems, claims it can solve a major problem for hospitals: identifying signs of sepsis, an often deadly complication from infections that can lead to organ failure. It’s a &lt;a href="https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2020/09/who-says-sepsis-causes-20-global-deaths"&gt;leading cause&lt;/a&gt; of death in hospitals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vd2Ebf"&gt;But the algorithm doesn’t work as well as advertised, according to a &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/2781307"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt; published in &lt;em&gt;JAMA Internal Medicine&lt;/em&gt; on Monday. Epic says its alert system can correctly differentiate patients who do and don’t have sepsis 76 percent of the time. The new study found it was only right 63 percent of the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j4qm2V"&gt;An Epic spokesperson disputed the findings in a statement to &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/06/21/epic-sepsis-prediction-tool/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Stat News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, saying that other research showed the algorithm was accurate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALZpQv"&gt;Sepsis is hard to spot early, but starting treatment as soon as possible can improve patients' chances of survival. The Epic system, and other automated warning tools like it, scan patient test results for signals that someone could be developing the condition. Around a &lt;a href="https://www.ehrinpractice.com/largest-ehr-vendors.html"&gt;quarter of US hospitals&lt;/a&gt; use Epic’s electronic medical records, and hundreds of hospitals use its sepsis prediction tool, including the health center at the University of Michigan, where study author Karandeep Singh is an assistant professor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GB1l42"&gt;The study examined data from nearly 40,000 hospitalizations at Michigan Medicine in 2018 and 2019. Patients developed sepsis in 2,552 of those hospitalizations. Epic’s sepsis tool missed 1,709 of those cases, around two-thirds of which were still identified and treated quickly. It only identified 7 percent of sepsis cases that were missed by a physician. The analysis also found a high rate of false positives: when an alert went off for a patient, there was only a 12 percent chance that the&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;patient actually would develop sepsis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UDSDdj"&gt;Part of the problem, Singh told &lt;em&gt;Stat News,&lt;/em&gt; seemed to be in the way the Epic algorithm was developed. It defined sepsis based on when a doctor would submit a bill for treatment, not necessarily when a patient first developed symptoms. That means it’s catching cases where the doctor already thinks there’s an issue. “It’s essentially trying to predict what physicians are already doing,” Singh &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2021/06/21/epic-sepsis-prediction-tool/"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also not the measure of sepsis that researchers would ordinarily use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tWrYnh"&gt;Tools that mine patient data to predict what could happen with their health are common and can be useful for doctors. But they’re only as good as the data they’re developed with, and they &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kdpsinghlab/status/1407218020796317699"&gt;should be&lt;/a&gt; subject to outside evaluation. When researchers scrutinize tools like this one, they sometimes find holes: for example, one algorithm used by major health systems to flag patients who need special attention was biased against Black patients, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/24/20929337/care-algorithm-study-race-bias-health"&gt;2019 study&lt;/a&gt; found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZsoMA"&gt;Epic rolled out another predictive tool, called the Deterioration Index, during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. It was designed to help doctors decide which patients should move into intensive care and which could be fine without it. The pandemic was an emergency, so hospitals around the country started using it &lt;a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/04/24/coronavirus-hospitals-use-ai-to-predict-patient-decline-before-knowing-it-works/"&gt;before&lt;/a&gt; it was subject to any sort of independent evaluation. Even now, there has been limited research on the tool. One small study &lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33357088/"&gt;showed&lt;/a&gt; it could identify high- and low-risk patients but might not be useful to doctors. There could be unforeseen problems or biases in the system that are going unnoticed, Brown University researchers warned &lt;a href="https://undark.org/2021/05/27/health-care-algorithm-promise-peril/"&gt;in &lt;em&gt;Undark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqbBR6"&gt;If digital tools are going to live up to their potential in healthcare, companies like Epic should be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kdpsinghlab/status/1407218012898443266"&gt;transparent&lt;/a&gt; about how they’re made and they should be regularly monitored to make sure they’re working well, Singh &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kdpsinghlab/status/1407218020796317699"&gt;says on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. These tools are becoming more and more common, so these types of issues aren’t going away, Roy Adams, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/algorithm-predicts-deadly-infections-often-flawed/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “We need more independent evaluations of these proprietary systems,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>An electric popemobile is Fisker’s latest leap of faith</title>

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Fisker Inc.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RcoOjN"&gt;On May 21st, vehicle designer Henrik Fisker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447399/fisker-inc-electric-popemobile-vatican-pope-francis-ocean-suv"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt; he had a “private audience” with Pope Francis and that his company, Fisker Inc., would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22447399/fisker-inc-electric-popemobile-vatican-pope-francis-ocean-suv"&gt;make a custom electric SUV&lt;/a&gt; to be used for official papal transport in late 2022. What he didn’t share was that the meeting took on a much different character than described, and that the proposal was something of a surprise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZW3tOM"&gt;An electric popemobile is the latest bold claim from Fisker, who raised nearly $1 billion for his company last year after previously touting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/16/17695866/henrik-fisker-solid-state-batteries-electric-cars"&gt;a revolutionary solid-state battery&lt;/a&gt; and a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/13/21322573/fisker-vw-meb-modular-platform-architecture-ocean-suv-apollo"&gt;manufacturing partnership with Volkswagen&lt;/a&gt; — each &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22279995/fisker-inc-electric-vehicle-interview-solid-state-batteries-ocean-suv-spac"&gt;half-baked&lt;/a&gt; ideas that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349464/fisker-volkswagen-vw-ev-platform-deal-spaq-spac-spartan"&gt;didn’t come to pass&lt;/a&gt;. And it comes at a time when a number of well-funded EV startups are facing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532976/lordstown-motors-ceo-steve-burns-resign-short-seller-investigation"&gt;intense scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22441025/canoo-sec-investigation-spac-merger-projections"&gt;promises they make&lt;/a&gt;, big and small.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGQ7AV"&gt;The day before the announcement, Fisker and his co-founder and wife, Geeta Gupta-Fisker, were among a group of people who briefly met with Pope Francis during &lt;a href="https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2021-05/pope-francis-scholas-occurentes-meeting.html"&gt;an educational event&lt;/a&gt; at Palazzo San Callisto, outside the walls of Vatican City. Other attendees included former Uber board member Shervin Pishevar, who pitched the pope on his health startup, according to a post on his Instagram account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7Or07q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The pitch was more of a Hail Mary than Fisker originally let on&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hZS6cr"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/RWQHBR8hva8?t=849"&gt;video posted by the Vatican’s own news outlet&lt;/a&gt; last month, Gupta-Fisker can be seen asking the pope to bless the EV startup before having his holiness sign a marker-drawn sketch of the Fisker Inc. SUV. Moments later, Henrik Fisker spends roughly one minute talking to Pope Francis and shows him framed computer renderings of the proposed electric popemobile. After Fisker says he plans to deliver the electric SUV to the Vatican next year, an aide moves the CEO’s hands out of the way so the pope can see the next presentation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qrWpDX"&gt;The fleeting interaction was not listed on the Vatican’s&lt;a href="https://press.vatican.va/content/salastampa/en/bollettino/pubblico/2021/05/20/210520a.html"&gt; list of official “audiences” for that day&lt;/a&gt;. But the following day, Fisker Inc. &lt;a href="https://press.fiskerinc.com/q7rv8nKqQZO76TZWwiMs"&gt;put out a press release&lt;/a&gt; saying the company is “set to develop the first all-electric vehicle for the Holy See, Pope Francis, after a historic visit to Vatican City” and that he and Gupta-Fisker “presented a vision for the design of an all-electric papal transport” to His Holiness during a “private audience” — despite the junket-style meeting taking place a mile from Vatican City. The release also didn’t say whether the Vatican actually agreed to use the vehicle. Still, Fisker &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/henrikfisker/status/1395702713942482947"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;: “Looking forward to make [sic] the 1st ALL electric Popemobile.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWxtzu"&gt;Fisker Inc. now tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the Fiskers’ “proposal was accepted” and that employees are working with the Vatican to understand its requirements for the vehicle but declined to offer more information. The Vatican’s press office did not respond to eight emails and two phone calls requesting comment over the past few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nJZ2Bo"&gt;The Vatican has used a wide variety of vehicles over the years to ferry the pope around at public gatherings. Roughly one-third of those came from Mercedes-Benz, according to a 2015 article in &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/local/2015-papal-visit/popemobile-illustrated-history/"&gt;describes a number of the most famous vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. Daimler, Mercedes-Benz’s parent company, declined to comment on its relationship with the Vatican.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="N384NF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What even technically is a “popemobile”?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OH3QyP"&gt;On international trips, the Vatican often tasks local automakers with turning around modified vehicles with the required added safety measures (like bulletproof glass). It has a habit of entering into contracts with these companies for these efforts, though the agreements stay private.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MqtFtQ"&gt;“Popemobile” is a colloquial term that the Vatican does not use, but it generally refers to the vehicles that the pope uses to greet the masses. That’s clearly what Fisker wants to deliver, given his tweet, the press release, and the renderings of an electric SUV with a glass box protruding from the roof.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="f1RI4D"&gt;But the Vatican is also sometimes gifted vehicles that don’t have those safety measures, which disqualifies them for official use and may not require a contract. In 2012, in fact, Renault gave the pope an &lt;a href="https://www.automobilemag.com/news/renault-gives-pope-benedict-xvi-electric-kangoo-popemobile-167939/"&gt;electric Kangoo van&lt;/a&gt; that the Vatican said would only be used to get around the summer palace. So a pope has used an electric vehicle before, though one could argue that this wasn’t an electric popemobile.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="klmrdR"&gt;Whatever Fisker ultimately sends to Italy, making a popemobile isn’t going to shape the future of Fisker Inc. — the startup’s survival depends far more on things like the &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210617005298/en/Fisker-and-Magna-Sign-Long-Term-Manufacturing-Agreement"&gt;manufacturing deal it announced with supplier Magna last week&lt;/a&gt;, or its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22298878/foxconn-fisker-ev-electric-vehicle-wisconsin-deal-fsr-suv"&gt;partnership with Foxconn&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbGgrk"&gt;But there were reasons to be skeptical about the announcement beyond the disconnect between the casual nature of the event where the Fiskers made their pitch and the certainty with which the news was announced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kfv1Ev"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Fiskers have been accused of bending the truth in the past&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WZ4O3s"&gt;Shortly after Fisker Inc. was founded in 2016, &lt;em&gt;The Truth About Cars&lt;/em&gt; discovered what appeared to be an astroturfing campaign that was leaving &lt;a href="https://www.thetruthaboutcars.com/2016/10/fisker-trying-drum-hype-fake-article-comments/"&gt;overwhelmingly positive comments on articles about the company&lt;/a&gt;. The report also claimed to have found a connection between some of the comments and Gupta-Fisker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Feht1Q"&gt;More recently, Fisker Inc. was hit with &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22672595/1798839164_1_11_.pdf"&gt;a previously unreported lawsuit&lt;/a&gt; in Los Angeles Superior Court by someone who briefly served as the startup’s VP of marketing in early 2020 — well before the company raised nearly $1 billion in its SPAC merger, and during a time when it was allegedly low on cash, according to the complaint. One of the claims the former VP makes in the lawsuit is that, while working there, Henrik Fisker and Geeta Gupta-Fisker asked her to “fill up the office” with unpaid interns to “make the company look better to potential investors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QnPEys"&gt;Fisker Inc. has denied both of&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;these claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKKHBt"&gt;Fisker has also made big changes to his company’s plans in just a few short years. He once promoted &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/26/22279995/fisker-inc-electric-vehicle-interview-solid-state-batteries-ocean-suv-spac"&gt;a solid-state battery&lt;/a&gt;, and fundraised for the SPAC merger by promoting a partnership with Volkswagen that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/31/21349464/fisker-volkswagen-vw-ev-platform-deal-spaq-spac-spartan"&gt;would have involved Fisker Inc. using the German automaker’s EV tech&lt;/a&gt;. But neither of those ideas worked out. Broken promises are already becoming a trend among EV startups that merged with SPACs, too. Just look at Lordstown Motors or Nikola.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQGXfw"&gt;So will Fisker actually make an electric popemobile? The company says it will, but the Vatican remains mum. At the very least, Fisker Inc. has more than enough money to put a glass box on one of its SUVs and call it one. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to build a driverless vehicle that doesn’t make you barf</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8g_n-fa62OnbhKmzsW6TTJaerj8=/219x0:2582x1575/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69486548/Zoox_Front_1_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="g305Pr"&gt;Zoox released the second version of its &lt;a href="https://www.zoox.com/safety/"&gt;safety report&lt;/a&gt; today, containing new details about the vehicle that the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/26/21304111/amazon-zoox-acquisition-self-driving-car-autonomous-vehicles-startup-robotaxi-bi-directional-vehicle"&gt;Amazon-owned company&lt;/a&gt; is building from the ground up to be completely autonomous. The vehicle, which looks like an oversized toaster on wheels, lacks typical controls like a steering wheel and pedals and is designed to be bidirectional, meaning it can travel in either direction. And while that could in theory increase the chances of passengers getting sick, Zoox says its specialized design will make it one of the smoothest rides around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fKZZpI"&gt;Zoox is one of the few companies that is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22173971/zoox-amazon-robotaxi-self-driving-autonomous-vehicle-ride-hailing"&gt;building its own autonomous vehicle&lt;/a&gt; rather than retrofitting a car designed for human drivers to then drive itself. This gives the company more leeway to place safety-critical sensors where it matters most and include those features that are specifically tailored to passengers, rather than drivers, says Mark Rosekind, the former administrator of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and current chief safety innovation officer at Zoox. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XxVhOP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Zoox is one of the few companies that is building its own autonomous vehicle&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7xN87O"&gt;Zoox’s vehicle has four lidar sensors, one at each corner providing a 270-degree field of view that overlaps the other sensors, for a total that exceeds 360 degrees, Rosekind said. To Zoox, that’s better than a lidar centrally mounted on the roof with only 360-degree views. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GRIRrJ"&gt;“The real future are purpose-built vehicles,” Rosekind told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Doing this from the ground up means we’ve done optimal placement for those sensors.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s1A18dEtYcWWMZFQZ5wbCRDNY1Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674048/Zoox_Suspension.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="YMR9S2"&gt;Zoox’s vehicle also has an active suspension system with electronically controlled braking that allows for shorter stopping distances. And it will have four-wheel steering, which Rosekind argues doesn’t exist in any production car today. That allows Zoox to control each wheel’s speed, power, and direction independently. If one wheel hits a pothole, for example, the vehicle can compensate for that impact so the passenger barely feels the bump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSvXio"&gt;“Simultaneously, we control both where it’s going and its lateral position, where it is in space,” Rosekind said. “AI will determine the path. And now with precision control over that steering, we can literally keep you on that path down to centimeters of accuracy.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n1iwO9"&gt;Without a steering wheel and a dashboard, Zoox had to “reimagine” its airbag placement, Rosekind said, settling on a system in which a “curtain” of airbags comes down from the ceiling to protect passengers in the event of a crash. In total, the vehicle contains five airbags, which are all connected to an airbag control unit that uses velocity, the direction of the collision, and the number of passengers to determine how they are deployed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sDrTdU8uKteAYZF3z3JzAeaJrrI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674045/Zoox_Airbag_Design.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="U2A2xH"&gt;Zoox is also touting its vehicle’s bidirectional capabilities, meaning it will never have to “back up,” which should improve passenger pickups. “No more U-turns, no more three-point turns,” Rosekind said. “Think about that in a congested city.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rnIB4Z"&gt;Others in the autonomous vehicle industry are skeptical about these types of vehicles, believing they could lead to nauseous passengers. “There’s a debate of whether or not you should make it bi-directional,” Luminar CEO Austin Russell said recently. “That’s a motion sickness problem.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vYihl1"&gt;But Rosekind said that testing conducted by Zoox suggests that it won’t be a problem for the vast majority of passengers. He cited trains and airplanes that have both forward and rear-facing passenger seats as an example. “That’s a question that’s come up,” he said. “The active suspension and our control over these things mean that we’ll be able to control it pretty well.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vPuYts"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That’s a motion sickness problem.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8lWdV3"&gt;Still, he acknowledged that around 12–14 percent of the population experiences motion sickness during transportation. “That’s going to be interesting, right?” Rosekind said. “Who goes for which seat?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U2wDhe"&gt;Zoox, which is testing its vehicles in San Francisco and Las Vegas, has yet to say when it plans to launch a commercial robotaxi service. Right now, there are only a handful of autonomous vehicles in California, Nevada, and Arizona that are available to the public. A lot of the early hype surrounding AVs has yet come to fruition, leading many investors and experts to scale back their expectations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GihVYo"&gt;Rosekind said that reaction is understandable, given the complexity of the challenge that autonomous vehicle companies are attempting to tackle. While there will be more pilot programs and small-scale deployments over the next few years, “we’re still 20 or 30 years from when they’re on your street corner,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZIAtcT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We’re still 20 or 30 years from when they’re on your street corner”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pMIyY2"&gt;Zoox is releasing the latest version of its safety report under the voluntary guidelines established by the US Department of Transportation during the Obama administration, in which Rosekind served as head of NHTSA. The reports serve as a glossy marketing tool for the companies to tout their commitment to safety and transparency, but they generally lack certain relevant statistics, like fleet size, total miles driven, and disengagement rates (or the number of times the vehicle’s software forced a human safety driver to take over operation of the vehicle).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7XgFbm"&gt;To be sure, there is currently no federal rule requiring AV companies to submit information about their testing activities to the government. Instead, a patchwork of state-by-state regulations governs what is and isn’t disclosed. Recently, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/30/21538999/waymo-self-driving-car-data-miles-crashes-phoenix-google"&gt;Waymo bucked that trend&lt;/a&gt;, releasing a detailed report covering over 6 million miles driven, including dozens of crashes and near-misses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cD4Ejn"&gt;Rosekind said Zoox intends to be equally transparent about its testing and safety operations, including releasing crash data and collision information at some point in the near future. “We actually have already planned for a series of reports that will come out,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DEIa0X"&gt;Given the lack of federal standards, there will be questions about how each company defines a collision, but Zoox realizes that these types of disclosures are crucial for building public trust. “If we want trust, it’s data, transparency, and experience,” Rosekind said. “So everyone’s collecting data. At some point, there’s got to be transparency.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Satellite images show just how bad California’s drought is</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="California Copes With Worsening Drought" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aCP_dQ9Qwlt3E_1p2TtxDUbrLFo=/0x1:3407x2272/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69486508/1233455116.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;LAKE ISABELLA, CA - JUNE 14: In an aerial view, cattle graze on June 14, 2021 near Lake Isabella, California. Authorities are bracing for a predicted driest year on record for the Kern River, carrying only about a quarter of its average Sierra snowmelt water to Lake Isabella. The water level of the lake continues to dip below 16 percent capacity and large portion of the west are now in the most extreme drought category, with fire officials warning of another devastating wildfire season in California. | Photo by David McNew/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cGfmTS"&gt;Seen from space, California’s drought is horrifying. To get some perspective on the dire situation, the European Space Agency took a satellite image of Angeles National Forest and the San Gabriel Reservoir in Southern California this month and compared that to an image taken around the same time last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brwEgK"&gt;In 2020, the landscape looks lush and green and the San Gabriel Reservoir is bright blue.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Fast forward to this year, and the same location is so dry it looks like a scene out of a Mars movie. The forest is scarred red, and the San Gabriel Reservoir is almost empty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Cnrpm1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10618355"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wwJUBh"&gt;While 2020 was awful for plenty of other reasons, it did give California a brief break from drought. The Golden State’s longest drought persisted from 2011 to 2019. The relief didn’t last long. This year, Northern California endured&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;one of its driest Februarys, which is usually a wetter month, &lt;a href="https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/02/27/california-drought-nearly-a-quarter-of-california-now-in-drought-feds-say/"&gt;in more than 150 years&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nSW1FA"&gt;The entire western US is in trouble when it comes to water shortages. More than 80 percent of it is parched, with close to half of the region in “extreme” drought. The Hoover Dam reservoir, the largest in the US, hit the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527600/hoover-dam-reservoir-lake-mead-record-low-drought"&gt;lowest water level in its history&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month. It’s a crucial water source for 25 million people across several states, including California.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xj0NJP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The entire western US is in trouble when it comes to water shortages.&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SljT3P"&gt;Soaring temperatures that shattered &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/06/17/heat-wave-southwest-fires-drought/"&gt;hundreds of records&lt;/a&gt; across the US recently are also sucking the west dry. That has essentially turned vegetation into tinder for wildfires. California had its worst fire season on the books last year, when more than twice as many acres burned than the previous state record. Experts say &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538603/2021-fire-season-us-west-forecast-drought-heat-wave"&gt;there’s even more potential for mega blazes this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AxOZkx"&gt;“When we see droughts like this, it really amplifies the fire season,” Brian Fuchs, a climatologist at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln who creates maps for the &lt;a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/CurrentMap.aspx"&gt;US Drought Monitor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22538603/2021-fire-season-us-west-forecast-drought-heat-wave"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; last week&lt;/a&gt;. “This is currently the most exceptional drought that we’ve ever shown on the map in the Western US.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fkhTyr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>New ‘Designed for Xbox’ displays include the best Xbox Series X support</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YrFT_SulPVYRkD_tkqQSS0Zjdqg=/120x0:1416x864/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69486427/559M1_Details_Front_insutu_4k_D4Xbox_color_new_CROP.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DnkEHw"&gt;Microsoft is expanding its Designed for Xbox program to include monitors and displays. Some gaming monitors will now include a new “Gaming Features for Xbox” badge that will indicate they support the latest and greatest HDMI 2.1 technology, with variable refresh rates, HDR, and 4K at 120Hz support all for the Xbox Series X / S consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dzixUf"&gt;At least three HDMI 2.1 displays will get this new badge, including the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.usa.philips.com%2Fc-p%2F559M1RYV_27%2Fmomentum-4k-hdr-display-with-ambiglow&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F22%2F22545193%2Fmicrosoft-designed-for-xbox-displays-monitors-badge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;new 55-inch Philips Momentum display&lt;/a&gt;. The Momentum supports 4K resolution at 120Hz with AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, a dedicated Xbox picture mode, and DisplayHDR 1000 support. Microsoft says it has worked with Philips to validate the display for Xbox Series X / S, and it will launch worldwide for $1,599.99 this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eWg7BIhnPQWMyuf4emv8EgaY8oE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674100/559M1RYV_FTL_image.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 55-inch Philips Momentum is one of the first displays to include Microsoft’s new Xbox badge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qlVU9t"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.asus.com/us/item/202106AM180000001"&gt;Asus has a 43-inch monitor&lt;/a&gt; that includes 4K at 120Hz, AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, and DisplayHDR 1000 support. A special Xbox edition, that also includes an Xbox mode — with custom color, contrast, and hue settings — will be available in October, priced at $1,399. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JvtbzN"&gt;The final monitor in the trio of designed for Xbox displays is a 28-inch Acer Xbox Edition Gaming Monitor. It also supports 4K at 120Hz, with a low 1ms response time, only DisplayHDR 400, and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro support. It even includes a built-in KVM switch to let you quickly switch between multiple PCs with a single keyboard, mouse, and monitor setup. Acer is launching its XV282K KV Xbox gaming monitor this fall priced at $949.99.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1MzW2Bv3v11HpALO1Ae7W5GRx44=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674106/Acer_Nitro_Monitor_XV2_series_XV282K_KV_SE_XBOXlogowp_01_JPG.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer’s new 28-inch monitor is designed for Xbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="va3m7w"&gt;These new displays certainly don’t come cheap, but we haven’t seen any bargain HDMI 2.1 monitors so far. Microsoft says this is just the start of its Xbox badge for displays, and the company says more monitors will join the designed for Xbox program in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Go watch this amazing montage of 100 3D animations reimagining the same moment</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jL_ZU6pP0p47sBDz_6RBh-qsxHs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69486392/Still_001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Animation by Caleb Worcester&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WtwiYD"&gt;A man carries a heavy backpack through a war-ravaged city. A medic pushes a zombified corpse on a stretcher toward an ambulance, as an ominous building with a logo for “Harvest Corp” sits in the background. Then we’re on a bright, vibrantly colored alien world whose surface is a shallow liquid, where an astronaut pulls on a wire dragging a vehicle behind them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6Whzh"&gt;That’s just the first 30 seconds of nearly 11 minutes of strange, beautiful, and imaginative worlds all created based on the same original animation. The video was assembled by Clinton Jones, aka pwnisher, who challenged animators to create their own 3D animated scene based on a bare-bones animation he created. The video rounds up his 100 favorite clips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0aRgHf"&gt;The premise behind the challenge is to take the initial animation by Jones and have as many artists as possible re-envision it. Jones’ animation is a side view of a person walking, leaning forward, taking large (slightly theatrical) steps. The ground extends into the background under a large orb (a planet? Giant hot air balloon? Up to you!). From that, artists are challenged to make something original. &lt;em&gt;What is that large orb in the background? What is causing the character to struggle walking forward? &lt;/em&gt;Each animation has its own explanation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kwgznLbvHqlfY3eWKqUDxSmLZP4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22674032/Animation_sidebyside.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A comparison of the original animation by Clinton Jones (top) and an animation by Kamil Drobek (bottom), one of 2,400 submitted as part of the challenge.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uJiIJm"&gt;The results are simply mesmerizing. Every couple of seconds, we are transported to another artist’s take on a reality based on the original animation. If you’re a fan or familiar with popular 3D rendered art found on Instagram from artists like Beeple or The French Monkey, you might not be surprised to see the amount of alien worlds or remixes of a cyperpunk-bladerunner-akira-like future. That said, they are all beautiful and painfully detailed. So much so that each really feels like a unique world hinting at a backstory that I would love to read or watch more of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UiVFaY"&gt;The real treats, though, are the animations that are truly unexpected. One riffs on the animation style most associated with Studio Ghibli. Another might actually be stop-motion (if it’s actually a 3D render made to look like stop-motion then it’s &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; cool). There’s a really incredibly animated fire-breathing dragon that I rewatched a few times and another surreal behind-the-scenes “green screen” take with a twist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBhwCx"&gt;For those who are curious on what the &lt;em&gt;rest&lt;/em&gt; of the unused 2,300 renders are like, you can watch all 2,400 rendered animations &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkRjihsMdp8"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. But just a warning, it’s two hours 44 minutes and 39 seconds long… Although it’s broken up into themes, fantasy, adventure, video games, and comics, so you can skip to a topic of interest or just sit back and watch them all.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Bose’s Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 are at their cheapest price ever for Prime Day</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A close-up photo of the Bose Noise Canceling Headphones 700, the best noise-canceling headphones for video conferencing and voice calls." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QCm2wE8MNK_kXs9D7vRUPzz9aLU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69486201/cwelch_190605_3471_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f9NH8F"&gt;One of the standout deals of Amazon Prime Day 2021 is a huge discount on Bose’s flagship headphones, the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700. Normally priced at $379, today they’re dropping all the way down to $229. If you’re in the market for a pair of wireless headphones that are up there with the very best at quieting the world around you, you might not find a better moment than this to buy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZqsLeS"&gt;The steep discount only applies to the white / rose gold model of the headphones, but the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B07Q9MJKBV/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;black&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Cancelling-Bluetooth-Headphones/dp/B07Q4QK379/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;silver&lt;/a&gt; headphones are also on sale for $299 — and that’s still a solid deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="iSXU5a"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10612944"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RLNJti"&gt;The Noise Cancelling Headphones 700 have a sleek design that stays comfortable no matter how long you wear them. They also have much better voice call performance than their closest competitor, Sony’s WH-1000XM4 headphones. You can adjust the power of the noise cancellation to your liking, and there’s also a very natural-sounding transparency mode for when you need to maintain awareness of your surroundings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PO5dmq"&gt;These Bose headphones support multipoint, so you can connect to two different devices (like your phone and laptop) at the same time. They last for up to 20 hours of playback on a charge; that falls a bit short of Sony and some other options but should still be plenty to get you through any flight or other travel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KLXnsx"&gt;For more details on the Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;check out my full review&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve also rounded up some of the other &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22303099"&gt;great deals on earbuds and headphones&lt;/a&gt; that are available during Amazon’s Prime Day 2021 event. &lt;/p&gt;
