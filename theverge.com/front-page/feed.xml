    <title>Zoom’s new focus mode could keep students from distracting each other</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S7VKng"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/back-to-school-hybrid-learning/"&gt;Zoom has announced&lt;/a&gt; a new Focus mode, &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360061113751"&gt;which it says&lt;/a&gt; is meant to keep students from getting distracted while in a virtual classroom, while still allowing the teacher to keep an eye on everybody. When activated, Focus mode will make it so that a meeting’s participants won’t be able to see each other’s videos or screen shares, while the host is still able to see everyone’s webcams. It provides some of the control &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/115004834466#h_01EYVHFHQMD1G3YSZB8TNG9E8P"&gt;found in Webinar mode&lt;/a&gt;, without the &lt;a href="https://blog.zoom.us/when-to-use-meetings-vs-webinars/"&gt;complexity and lack of flexibility&lt;/a&gt; that comes with it — for instance, a teacher could turn on Focus mode while presenting, and then turn it off when it’s time for a class discussion. And, while &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fzoom.us%2Fpricing%2Fwebinar&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F11%2F22620822%2Fzoom-virtual-learning-classes-focus-mode-teachers-students" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;hosting a Webinar costs money&lt;/a&gt;, Focus mode appears to be available to free accounts, based on my testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1xRV6"&gt;This feature comes as the new school year approaches in many districts, and as the threat of COVID-19 remains serious. It seems likely that virtual classrooms are going to be sticking around for some, so it’s good that Zoom is adding features to improve tele-learning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="73Epe8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="imageslider:10697320"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SeOgR3"&gt;While focus mode will put the teacher’s video or screen share front-and-center for students, it won’t be the only thing on their screens. For one, participants will still see their own video, as well as any videos or screen shares that are spotlighted by the host. They’ll also be able to see the names of the other participants, as well as any emoji reactions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gtOMkG"&gt;Overall, the feature seems like a decent way to keep students from distracting each other during class, and could even have its uses outside of a learning environment (say, during company presentations, if managers are worried about employees not paying attention to slides). Zoom’s &lt;a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360061113751"&gt;Focus mode support article&lt;/a&gt; says that the feature can be enabled or locked on for accounts, groups, or individual users. After turning it on for your account the feature can be accessed by clicking the More button while in a meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Three more high-profile Blizzard employees are no longer at the company, including Diablo 4’s director</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MjXMsgkIv764ZBXBfVWH6XZo38A=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69712748/acastro_210729_1777_blizzard_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8b7HR2"&gt;Three prominent Blizzard employees have been let go from the company, &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/jesse-mcree-diablo-4-director-no-longer-at-activision-1847469113?rev=1628715951359"&gt;as first reported by &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, marking the latest departures from the studio following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;major sexual harassment lawsuit brought by the state of California&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Diablo 4&lt;/em&gt; game director Luis Barriga, lead designer Jesse McCree, and &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; designer Jonathan LeCraft are not employed at Blizzard anymore, according to &lt;em&gt;Kotaku. &lt;/em&gt;Activision Blizzard confirmed the departures in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; after we published this story, but declined to comment on whether or not Barriga, McCree, and LeCraft were fired.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yAEkZX"&gt;“We have a deep, talented roster of developers already in place and new leaders have been assigned where appropriate,” a Blizzard spokesperson said. “We are confident in our ability to continue progress, deliver amazing experiences to our players, and move forward to ensure a safe, productive work environment for all.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="i8pI2d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;McCree is the inspiration for the name of the McCree character in Overwatch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jdyxvL"&gt;Activision Blizzard has not shared why they are no longer at the company, according to a &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt; source. McCree appears to be one of the people photographed inside Blizzard’s so-called “Cosby Suite,” in a screenshot &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-blizzard-developers-infamous-bill-cosby-suite-1847378762"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and appeared to participate in the “BlizzCon Cosby Crew” chat. McCree is also the inspiration for the name of the McCree character in &lt;em&gt;Overwatch;&lt;/em&gt; Michael Chu, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/3/11/21174947/overwatch-lead-writer-michael-chu-leaves-blizzard"&gt;the game’s former lead writer&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/lPXKBFXS3wk?t=146"&gt;revealed in 2017&lt;/a&gt; that the real-life McCree had to “sign over his name” to the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; team because they liked it for the gunslinging character more than many other ideas. (Some&lt;em&gt; Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League casters have &lt;a href="https://gamerant.com/overwatch-league-casters-mccree-name/"&gt;avoided saying McCree’s name on air&lt;/a&gt;.) LeCraft was also pictured in the Cosby Suite, according to &lt;em&gt;Kotaku’s&lt;/em&gt; new story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xi17ju"&gt;We asked if Blizzard plans to change McCree’s name in &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and the company said it’s checking into it. It’s possible the company might do so: days after the lawsuit hit, Blizzard’s &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; team promised to remove &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597006/blizzard-world-of-warcraft-activision-remove-references-harassment-lawsuit"&gt;“references that are not appropriate for our world,”&lt;/a&gt; and has reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/references-to-alex-afrasiabi-removed-in-world-of-warcraft-323588"&gt;already removed a variety of &lt;em&gt;WoW &lt;/em&gt;in-game references to Alex Afrasiabi.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UsqOZ3"&gt;Afrasiabi was a former &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; senior creative director who was singled out in the lawsuit for his behavior, and Blizzard &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-blizzard-developers-infamous-bill-cosby-suite-1847378762"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Kotaku&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that it fired Afrasiabi for “his misconduct in his treatment of other employees.” He appears to have worked for the company &lt;a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/alex-afrasiabi-whered-he-go-o/749539"&gt;until June 2020&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHjg5a"&gt;The departures of Barriga, McCree, and LeCraft follow the ones by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607356/blizzard-president-leaving-harassment-protest-brack"&gt;former Blizzard president J. Allen Brack&lt;/a&gt;, who was named in the lawsuit, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608320/blizard-jesse-meschuk-leave-company-hr-svp"&gt;former SVP of HR Jesse Meschuk&lt;/a&gt;. Employees walked out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;in late July&lt;/a&gt; to protest the company’s response to the lawsuit, and a shareholder released a letter on Tuesday saying the company’s response doesn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22618776/activision-blizzard-shareholder-letter-soc-investment-group"&gt;“go nearly far enough.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L54Fwh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 11th, 7:35PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement from Blizzard and relevant context about another fired Blizzard executive.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lordstown Motors pivots to renting space at former GM factory</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Lordstown Motors Headquarters Ahead Of Earnings Figures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TozUNnhFg8VJhskK8KZ2yqY2dUA=/0x2:4000x2669/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69713084/1232963726.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7NapJL"&gt;Lordstown Motors is looking to essentially loan out some space at the massive former General Motors factory it owns, as the troubled startup gets closer to building its first production-quality Endurance pickup trucks later this year. Interim CEO Angela Strand shared Wednesday that Lordstown is in “serious discussions... with several potential partners” who may build vehicles or do other types of work at the plant alongside the startup — meaning the startup could act like a sort of WeWork for manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9EI0aA"&gt;“This is a critical strategic pivot for us, a decision that we believe will lead to significant new revenue opportunities for Lordstown at the same time as production of the Endurance is ramping up,” Strand said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vf5LP7"&gt;“Our current footprint utilizes about 30 percent of the plant’s 6.2 million square feet, so we have ample room for potential partners to build vehicles, for us to build vehicles for others, and for additional [Lordstown Motors] vehicle platforms” to be built, president Rich Schmidt added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aNAC0y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is a critical strategic pivot for us”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xxa9FV"&gt;Strand and Schmidt shared the plan on a call with investors where the company discussed its &lt;a href="https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-reports-second-quarter-2021-financial-results"&gt;second quarter financial results&lt;/a&gt;. Lordstown Motors, which said in June that it&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535457/lordstown-motors-electric-van-project-camping-world-work-stopped-endurance"&gt; will run out of cash by May 2022 without additional funding&lt;/a&gt;, lost $108 million in the quarter. The company was recently &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/lordstown-motors-strikes-stock-sale-agreement-with-hedge-fund-271627309034"&gt;buoyed by an equity purchase agreement with a hedge fund&lt;/a&gt; which could allow it to raise up to $400 million. But the startup is still looking to raise more funding as it heads towards an announced September start date for production of the Endurance, and it won’t make money on those vehicles until they start shipping in early 2022 (which is around the same time that Ford’s competing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522488/ford-f-150-lightning-electric-pickup-truck-first-look-photos"&gt;F-150 Lightning&lt;/a&gt; is set to ship).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bsHdD6"&gt;Those funding efforts include the plan to allow other companies to use the factory, as well as finding strategic partners and investors, and raising debt financing. Strand — who struck a five-month, $500,000 deal with Lordstown to captain the ship while it searches for a permanent CEO — said that the startup is in talks with a number of companies and potential lenders but declined to name any. She also said Lordstown Motors is working to get a third-party appraisal of the value of the factory, the equipment inside, and the improvements that the startup has made — which could help increase the amount of money Lordstown can borrow against the plant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DHWz8H"&gt;The former GM factory has played an outsized role in the short but tumultuous story of Lordstown Motors. In fact, the company was essentially founded &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537225/gm-factory-workhorse-ev-electric-vehicle-startup-sale-trump-tweet"&gt;with the intent of buying the factory in early 2019&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="2tylTV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The former GM plant has played an outsized role in Lordstown Motors’ short history &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2613ZN"&gt;At the time, GM had come under tremendous pressure from then-President Donald Trump for closing the plant (where it once produced the Chevy Cruze). So Lordstown Motors founder Steve Burns &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20954956/gm-lordstown-motors-factory-workhorse-electric-vehicles-trump-ev"&gt;struck a deal with his former company&lt;/a&gt;, another EV startup called Workhorse, to license intellectual property for an electric pickup truck that was never put into production. GM assisted with the purchase and handed over some equipment. Trump said the deal was “GREAT NEWS FOR OHIO!” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="crXgxU"&gt;Lordstown Motors, which went public in a merger with a special purpose acquisition company late last year, has since put about $240 million of work into the factory to get it ready to build the electric pickup truck, called Endurance. Workhorse was even considering using Lordstown Motors as &lt;a href="https://www.mahoningmatters.com/local-news/report-us-postal-service-contract-could-mean-800m-for-lordstown-motors-2782744"&gt;a manufacturer&lt;/a&gt; if it won the contract to build the next-generation United States Postal Service mail truck (before the award &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/1/22557764/workhorse-complaint-oshkosh-usps-mail-truck-fight"&gt;went to defense contractor Oshkosh&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="99rBVZ"&gt;But Lordstown Motors stumbled earlier this year after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22327207/general-motors-lordstown-hindenburg-short-electric-truck-orders"&gt;Hindenburg Research published a report&lt;/a&gt; alleging that Burns had misled investors about how many preorders the startup had collected for the truck.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4bTR9f"&gt;Burns has since resigned, along with a number of other executives and employees close to him, and the startup is under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Department of Justice. Lordstown Motors subsequently narrowed its plans for initial production, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535457/lordstown-motors-electric-van-project-camping-world-work-stopped-endurance"&gt;stopped work on a second vehicle&lt;/a&gt; — an electric van — that was supposed to be part of a partnership with Camping World. This week, Workhorse &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616733/workhorse-c1000-electric-van-truck-redesign-wkhs-usps"&gt;sold 72 percent of the stake it acquired&lt;/a&gt; in Lordstown Motors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PVJ16D"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MI8b36"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYUJYf"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch responds to ‘Twitch Do Better’ movement with improved chat filters</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GicjlsVpi3EXBJP1N5O7_Ek5RJE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69712925/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8AY6XC"&gt;Today, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Twitch/status/1425550620887375876?s=20"&gt;Twitch has issued a statement&lt;/a&gt; announcing the steps it’s taking to protect its marginalized streamers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M7hYfx"&gt;“We’ve seen a lot of conversation about botting, hate raids, and other forms of harassment targeting marginalized creators,” Twitch writes. “You’re asking us to do better, and we know we need to do more to address these issues.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GpOKv4"&gt;Twitch says it’s identified “a vulnerability in our proactive filters, and have rolled out an update to close this gap and better detect hate speech in chat.” It also says it will implement more safety features in the coming weeks, including improvements to the account verification process and ban evasion detection tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cSXCck"&gt;This statement is in response to the hashtag &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23twitchdobetter&amp;amp;src=typed_query"&gt;#twitchdobetter&lt;/a&gt;, which was an effort started by &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/rekitraven"&gt;Twitch creator RekItRaven&lt;/a&gt; in order to bring awareness to harassment issues that Black creators were experiencing on the streaming platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMfie6"&gt;“I was hate raided for the 2nd time in a week and I shared both the first and second occurrences [on Twitter] because they were very pointed rather than the normal, ‘You’re fat, black, gay stuff,’” Raven tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; via direct messaging. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TrdQEX"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(Content warning: racism)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ysnG3X"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Guess who got hate raided again tonight?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Keep hating, babes. I'm not going anywhere.&lt;br&gt;And the fact that ya'll made accounts like "ravens_baboon_lips" and "ravencantbreatheofficer" don't mean fuck all to me because I'm still here and I'm still ✨thriving ✨ &lt;a href="https://t.co/fHtgy1Os2W"&gt;pic.twitter.com/fHtgy1Os2W&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ʀᴇᴋ ɪᴛ, ʀᴀᴠᴇɴ! ☠  (@RekItRaven) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RekItRaven/status/1423828534133407747?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NtKZIH"&gt;Raiding is a popular Twitch feature that allows a streamer to send viewers to another streamer at the end of their broadcast. It’s a tool used to boost viewership, grow communities, and foster connections between streamers and their audiences. Hate raids are the polar, toxic opposite. In hate raids, a streamer directs their viewers to another creator — who is often times Black, queer, female, or has an intersection of marginalized identities — in order to bombard that streamer with hate speech and harassment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EEul8m"&gt;Raven believes they became a target for hate raids because they stream using the Black tag, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/22/22448809/transgender-twitch-tags-lgbt-streaming-identity"&gt;a new Twitch feature&lt;/a&gt; that allows users to classify their streams with different markers. The tags are ostensibly used for creators to categorize their streams so interested users can better find the content they’re looking for, but it also creates a beacon trolls use to zero in on vulnerable, marginalized streamers. After their experience with hate raids, Raven noticed other marginalized streamers in their community were having the same experiences. And with no word from Twitch on what was being done to protect its users from that kind of targeted, violent harassment, Raven decided to re-start the conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9X6gFi"&gt;“I started&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TwitchDoBetter?src=hashtag_click"&gt; #TwitchDoBetter&lt;/a&gt; because I’m tired of having to fight to exist on a platform that says they’re diverse and inclusive but remained silent to the pleas of marginalized creators asking for more protections from hate raids,” Raven says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yeYUSW"&gt;Twitch struggles with keeping toxicity off its platform. Last year, streamer CriticalBard was subjected to a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229209/criticalbard-pogchamp-gootecks-hasanabi-twitch-emote-harassment"&gt;wave of racist trolls&lt;/a&gt; when he became the temporary face of the “pogchamp” emote. Twitch also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/4/21280121/twitch-removes-twitchcop-emote-to-prevent-misuse"&gt;removed its TwitchCop&lt;/a&gt; emote amid concerns it might be used to harass creators talking about police violence after George Floyd’s murder. In these situations and now, Twitch has been reactive to the needs of its users rather than proactive, resulting in creator frustration. Better, more proactive moderation tools have been a perennial ask from Twitch’s marginalized creators. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yUfNN"&gt;The tools Twitch is implementing in today’s safety rollout will seemingly only address &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cypheroftyr/status/1425264755380531201?s=20"&gt;trolls using non-Latin characters&lt;/a&gt; to circumvent chat filters. Streamers are asking for more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6orgxp"&gt;“I’d love to see creators having more tools to control their experience like allowing creators to block [recently created] accounts from chatting, [and] allowing mods to approve or decline raids,” Raven says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bU1xJt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nestflix is a Netflix for fake movies and shows from real movies and shows</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AN-3YXiXi_OVHbIVQYgzuckzHDo=/0x0:2478x1652/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69712668/Screen_Shot_2021_08_11_at_1.42.48_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nestflix, Lynn Fisher&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ONa5wb"&gt;It’s been notoriously difficult to watch lost classics like Vincent Chase’s &lt;a href="https://nestflix.fun/aquaman/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Aquaman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://nestflix.fun/the-rural-juror/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Rural Juror&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— in part because they’re not real — but thanks to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lynnandtonic/status/1425481907320483840?s=20"&gt;the launch of Nestflix&lt;/a&gt;, that’s all changing. Those movies are from &lt;em&gt;Entourage&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;30 Rock&lt;/em&gt;, respectively, created as gags or plotlines, but Nestflix, “the platform for your favorite nested films and shows,” will let you browse them anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b2NZTW"&gt;The basic premise behind &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lynnandtonic?s=20"&gt;designer Lynn Fisher’s&lt;/a&gt; Netflix alternative is “what if every fake show or movie featured in a real show or movie lived on a single platform?” The result is something that looks a lot like that red-and-black-colored streaming service you might be familiar with, populated with fake TV show and movie listings for projects that never existed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DQPIp85z7yedbNu763j6sCRSNeE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22776973/Screen_Shot_2021_08_11_at_1.45.07_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nestflix, Lynn Fisher&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nestflix even has room for independent entries, like “Threat Level Midnight.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GLMvKB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lynnandtonic/status/1425482328575340548?s=20"&gt;In a tweet announcing the project&lt;/a&gt;, Fisher describes it as “just a wiki doing some cosplay,” which frankly undersells it. Nestflix is wonderfully detailed, with a working search function, cast lists for each project, and information on what real show or movie the fake shows or movies originally appeared in. That’s perfect for shows like &lt;em&gt;30 Rock&lt;/em&gt;, which basically existed to create throwaway media goofs like &lt;a href="https://nestflix.fun/milf-island/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Milf Island&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;a href="https://nestflix.fun/leap-dave-williams/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Leap Dave Williams&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but even older fakes like &lt;a href="https://nestflix.fun/angels-with-filthy-souls/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Angels with Filthy Souls&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;em&gt;Home Alone &lt;/em&gt;make an appearance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p2Q6S9"&gt;It’s a fascinating look at how self-referential most modern film and TV is (there are a lot of fake sequels), but also how ingrained Netflix’s content strategy and interface are in our culture generally. It’s one thing to cut away to a scene from a fake movie or show during a comedy, but it’s a whole other thing to have it packaged up with stills, art, and metadata like it’s ready to stream. It doesn’t make any of the fake movies or shows feel more real, but it does make them funny all over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EQRIMp"&gt;You can &lt;a href="https://nestflix.fun/"&gt;browse Nestflix right now&lt;/a&gt; and also contribute &lt;a href="https://nestflix.fun/contribute"&gt;any shows or movies it’s missing&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFtajq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to preorder the Galaxy Z Flip 3 and Z Fold 3</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0Mdy1i-SiRAkd-NC5JnmYYiIrqo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69712417/cwelch_210809_4701_0009.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TradUA"&gt;Like in previous years, Samsung used its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22617405/samsung-galaxy-unpacked-biggest-announcements-z-flip-z-fold-3-watch-buds-note"&gt;latest Galaxy Unpacked event&lt;/a&gt; to announce a slew of new devices, including the Galaxy Z Fold 3 and Galaxy Z Flip 3. The two smartphones are already available for preorder starting at $1,799.99 and $999.99, respectively, and will launch alongside the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619305/samsung-galaxy-buds-2-review-specs-price-features"&gt;Galaxy Buds 2&lt;/a&gt; and a handful of other devices on Friday, August 27th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wROhpD"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"How Samsung beefed up its folding phones: metal, tape, and a dab of goo","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="3pJzAG"&gt;How to preorder the Galaxy Z Fold 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="1Hs307"&gt;The Galaxy Z Fold 3 is Samsung’s latest foldable, yet it seems to take a cue directly from the Note, adopting S Pen support as well as an optional flip case designed to hold the stylus when not in use. The forthcoming device appears to be more rugged, too, with IPX8 water resistance, tougher aluminum in the hinge, and a protective film that is supposedly 80 percent stronger than that of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="pmbYg4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 announced with S Pen support and water resistance","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22617206/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-features-specs-price-hands-on"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="rE4vJe"&gt;Specs-wise, the foldable features Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 888 processor and comes in both 256GB and 512GB storage configurations, each of which features a brighter front display that runs at an adaptive 120Hz refresh rate. The Z Fold 3 also sports three 12-megapixel rear cameras — specifically a wide, ultrawide, and telephoto lens — along with a 10-megapixel camera on the cover screen and a 4-megapixel sensor beneath the pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aejTfu"&gt;Both the 256GB and 512GB configurations of the Galaxy Z Fold 3 are &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748811910154262197#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for preorder at Samsung&lt;/a&gt; starting today in one of three colors (silver, green, or black). Whereas the 256GB model will set you back $1,799.99, the 512GB model comes in slightly higher at $1,899.99. If you preorder either configuration between now and August 26th, however, Samsung will issue you a $200 credit that can be used toward another purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ECfqC"&gt;Financing options are available, too, and you can save up to $800 on your Galaxy Z Fold 3 when you trade in an eligible smartphone, smartwatch, or tablet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XEKb1B"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697006"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vrv8Kx"&gt;If you decide you’d rather preorder through your carrier, T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T offer similar pricing to Samsung, regardless of the color. You can buy the 256GB model outright for $1,799.99 (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-fold3-5g%3Fsku%3D610214670342&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617611%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-fold-3-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-14527459?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-fold3-5g-256gb-phantom-black.html%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;) or the 512GB configuration for $1,899 (&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-fold3-5g%3Fsku%3D610214670359&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617611%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-fold-3-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.dpbolvw.net/click-8836598-14527459?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-fold3-5g-512gb-phantom-black.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;), and both carriers offer financing options starting at $50 a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ywZSMg"&gt;The two carriers differ when it comes to promotions, though. Both are currently offering up to $1,000 off the Galaxy Z Fold 3 if you trade in an eligible device, however, AT&amp;amp;T also requires you to sign up for an unlimited plan while T-Mobile requires customers to have at least one existing line with a Magenta Max, Magenta Plus, or T-Mobile One Plus plan. Like Samsung, AT&amp;amp;T is also offering a $200 credit toward select Samsung devices and accessories when you preorder either storage configuration by August 26th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="V27ozw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697052"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="IKCucs"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697054"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Si3AmL"&gt;Verizon customers can also save in a variety of ways or preorder the Galaxy Z Fold 3 for the full retail price ahead of launch. Both the 256GB and 512GB models &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-fold3-5g%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;are available&lt;/a&gt; for $1,799.99 and $1,899.99, respectively, or with financing plans starting at $59.99. You can also save up to $1,000 on either configuration when you trade in an eligible phone and opt for an unlimited plan, as well as an extra $500 if you’re a new customer switching to Verizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Mn9Tsr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697089"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EFUkk1"&gt;How to preorder the Galaxy Z Flip 3&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="C3plMR"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 is nowhere near as expensive as the Galaxy Z Fold 3, however, it still comes at a premium. As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594727/samsung-z-flip-3-fold-water-resistant-ipx8-pen-case" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;previous leaks have indicated&lt;/a&gt;, the successor to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/21/21146465/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-folding-glass-flip-phone-screen-camera-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Galaxy Z Flip&lt;/a&gt; showcases the same IPX8 water resistance and Snapdragon 888 processor found on the Z Fold 3 and other Samsung flagships, along with a 10-megapixel selfie camera and a pair of 12-megapixel shooters on the back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="S13DT7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 announced with much bigger, useful cover display","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22617226/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-features-price-foldable-hands-on"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="8upDK7"&gt;Upon its release, it will be available in seven colors — gold, purple, green, black, white, pink, and gray — and features a cover display that’s four times bigger than the cover screen on its predecessor, allowing for more notifications and making it easier to capture selfies with the main camera. The 6.7-inch interior display also now sports an adaptive 120Hz refresh rate, as opposed to the 60Hz refresh rate of the original Z Flip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EcbTDl"&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 3 will be available in two configurations at launch: a 128GB model and a 256GB variant. Preorders are available starting today at Samsung ahead of the phone’s August 27th release, and pricing for the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748816475529586235#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB model&lt;/a&gt; starts at $999.99. You can also preorder the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1748816552261866427#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB model&lt;/a&gt; for $1,049.99, however, unlike its smaller counterpart, it’s only available in black, gray, white, or pink.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TIlqWO"&gt;If you preorder either device at Samsung, you’ll also receive a $200 credit toward other Samsung devices, and if you go the trade-in route, you can save up to $650.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="bbaUYi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697134"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rIKeFI"&gt;Both T-Mobile and AT&amp;amp;T offer similar pricing for the Galaxy Z Flip 3 as Samsung. The 128GB variant is available for &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-14527459?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip3-5g-128gb-cream.html%3F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorder at AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; for $999.99, or in monthly installments of $27.78. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip3-5g%3Fsku%3D610214670298&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617611%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-fold-3-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt; offers both the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip3-5g%3Fsku%3D610214670298&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617611%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-fold-3-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip3-5g%3Fsku%3D610214670304&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22617611%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-fold-3-preorder-buy-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB configurations&lt;/a&gt; for $999.99 and $1,049.99, respectively, with installment plans starting at $41.67. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0qMEm"&gt;For those looking to save some money on their preorder, both carriers are currently running multiple promotions on the Galaxy Z Flip 3. AT&amp;amp;T is offering a discount of up to $1,000 to those who trade in an eligible phone and sign up for an unlimited plan, as is T-Mobile, though, you’ll need to opt for a Magenta Max, Magenta Plus, or T-Mobile One Plus plan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EqMwB6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697215"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="6Jo25C"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697211"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="im4J7U"&gt;Prices aren’t that different at Verizon, either. You can preorder the &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-flip3-5g%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB version&lt;/a&gt; of the Galaxy Z Flip 3 in one of four colors for $999.99, or as part of a monthly installment plan for $33.33. In terms of promotions, Verizon is offering $1,000 off the foldable when you trade in your old device and sign up for an unlimited plan; new customers can also save an additional $500 to cover the cost of switching carriers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tZaKn0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10697219"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KZOTTi"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X8E8cB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPysvZ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Forget the Note — Samsung’s foldables are coming for the Galaxy S as well</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FsgNylYjeSgwY6EWREDuce7U710=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69712308/cwelch_210809_4701_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="fIwhvQ"&gt;It’s been easy to dismiss folding phones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/14/18088620/samsung-foldable-phone-science-fiction-movies-television-westworld-star-trek"&gt;as the stuff of science fiction&lt;/a&gt;, even after they became a reality two years ago. They were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355018/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-foldable-phones-normal-mainstream"&gt;too expensive&lt;/a&gt;, too large, too compromised to make sense for most. Some flips &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21135809/motorola-razr-review-foldable-flip-phone-verizon-price-camera-display-battery"&gt;instantly flopped&lt;/a&gt;. But in 2021, a folding phone appears to have just killed off Samsung’s long-running Galaxy Note — and I’m starting to wonder if they’ll destroy the flagship Galaxy S as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4AI8Z"&gt;That’s because last month, Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22599306/samsung-q2-2021-earnings-component-shortage-foldables"&gt;promised to make foldables mainstream&lt;/a&gt;. And at $999, with fewer compromises than ever, Samsung’s new Z Flip 3 sounds dangerously close to a complete replacement for Samsung’s $999 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Galaxy S21 Plus&lt;/a&gt;. For the same price, they’ve both got 6.7-inch 120Hz AMOLED screens, the latest Snapdragon 888 processors, the same memory and storage options, the same water resistance, and roughly the same dimensions, just with a slightly lighter frame and smaller battery, and one fewer camera around back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Zraer9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Has the Flip reached parity with flat flagships?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="a2JBVF"&gt;Except &lt;em&gt;one &lt;/em&gt;of these phones awesomely folds down to half its size, and the other one doesn’t. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22619139/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-flip-screen-durability-waterproof-aluminum"&gt;Assuming Samsung’s new durability improvements&lt;/a&gt; aren’t just talk and the plastic-covered screen doesn’t feel weird, I know which one I’d pick! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKtNe5"&gt;Would Samsung really axe its flatscreen Galaxy S in favor of foldables, though? It’s not as far-fetched as you might think — because after two years selling a ridiculous number of “flagship” phones, the Galaxy S handsets are getting hemmed in on all sides. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DTeblN"&gt;In 2019, the company tried to sell as many as 10 different flagship phones around the world, including four different Galaxy S10s and four different Galaxy Notes with largely identical core specs. 2020 brought &lt;em&gt;11 &lt;/em&gt;different flagships, if you count the Galaxy S10 Lite and Note 10 Lite. Five flagship phones may still be too many in 2021, if three of them aren’t selling particularly well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fsQ3B8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10697029"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YjXyaS"&gt;It’s not like Samsung would be killing off its bestselling handsets by ditching the Galaxy S, by the way. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399456/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g-review-camera-screen-specs-price"&gt;The company’s midrange A-series phones&lt;/a&gt; are actually its sales champs, after Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/9/3/17815746/samsung-flagship-features-midrange-phones-strategy-shift"&gt;declared it would prioritize those handsets&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. Meanwhile, sales of Samsung’s Galaxy S phones &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/report_sales_of_samsung_galaxy_s21_series_are_lower_than_s20_s10_sales-news-50385.php"&gt;have reportedly plummeted 47 percent over the past two generations&lt;/a&gt;, with the Galaxy S21 on track to be even more of a disappointment than the Galaxy S20 was the year before.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="keg1W6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fold replaces Note, Flip replaces S?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8enFPZ"&gt;Does Samsung need the Galaxy S any more than it needs the Galaxy Note? For smartphone enthusiasts who want the best of everything — now including the ability to fold out into a tablet — the Z Fold is already taking the place of the Note. Next year, with some camera upgrades, it could theoretically dethrone Samsung’s “Ultra” phones, too. That could leave room for the Flip to become Samsung’s new default flagship, with folding as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/4/1/5571738/samsung-our-next-big-thing-ads-drove-apples-marketing-chief-crazy"&gt;the “Next Big Thing” that Apple doesn’t offer its customers&lt;/a&gt; (at least &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22307677/folding-iphone-rumors-screen-size-kuo"&gt;not yet&lt;/a&gt;). For everyone else, there’s Samsung’s increasingly powerful Galaxy A series, which will likely get even more aggressive  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607248/xiaomi-overtakes-samsung-europe-smartphone-sales-apple"&gt;now that Xiaomi has overtaken Samsung in Europe&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pbXk4i"&gt;If it happens, I’d expect a transition period: the flagship phone category still starts around $700, not the $1,000 that Samsung is asking for the Flip 3, so the company would probably keep around a Galaxy S22 FE at a minimum. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22532816/samsung-galaxy-s21-fe-production-reportedly-halted"&gt;The Galaxy S21 FE is still pending&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esAWSL"&gt;And even if Samsung does decide to deemphasize flatscreen flagships, that doesn’t mean the Galaxy S name will necessarily go away. It might just become what Samsung calls its folding phones someday. Galaxy S is the brand that brought Samsung into the spotlight over the past decade, so there’s value and precedent to transfer the name to a new design: when Samsung first began experimenting with curved glass screens, it started as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/20/9181917/samsung-galaxy-s6-edge-plus-review"&gt;the Galaxy Edge&lt;/a&gt;, but those curves became the norm with the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/18/15328968/samsung-galaxy-s8-review-s8-plus"&gt;Galaxy S8&lt;/a&gt;. If Samsung makes foldables the new normal, we might see the same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2ipVvD"&gt;All I know for sure: Samsung’s bloated lineup of flagships was getting pretty ridiculous — remember &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/5/20852040/samsung-peak-flagship-blockchain-branded-galaxy-note-10-cryptocurrency-kakao-klay-klaytnphone"&gt;the Note 10 specifically for blockchain&lt;/a&gt;? — and it doesn’t need to be that way. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Uber’s latest delivery service partnership has drawn the FTC’s attention</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Uber Japan Couriers As Olympic Games Boost Foot-delivery Operators" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/os5wTLxS-nUFlehS0qI8KFfgLEI=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69711943/1234341481.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Z828O3"&gt;The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is looking into a recent partnership between Uber and grocery delivery service Gopuff, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/ftc-investigating-ubers-gopuff-partnership-alongside-drizly-deal"&gt;a new report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Gopuff agreed to list its collection of grocery and liquor store items &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22419461/uber-gopuff-grocery-delivery-expansion"&gt;on Uber Eats in May&lt;/a&gt;, expanding Uber’s delivery abilities to an even greater degree as it competes with other companies like DoorDash and Instacart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eh2MMS"&gt;The FTC is concerned that the deal “could hamper competition in online sale and delivery of alcohol and convenience-store items,” according to &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;. Gopuff’s been growing on its own recently,&lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/11/05/gopuff-acquires-bevmo/"&gt; acquiring the BevMo liquor store chain&lt;/a&gt; to use as stores and delivery centers, almost like Amazon warehouses for alcohol. The FTC is reportedly also looking in to &lt;a href="https://investor.uber.com/news-events/news/press-release-details/2021/Uber-to-Acquire-Drizly/default.aspx"&gt;Uber’s recent acquisition of Drizly&lt;/a&gt;, an alcohol delivery service that Uber intends to fold into its Uber Eats app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jq24dk"&gt;Uber has been attempting to pivot into delivery for several years now with acquisitions of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21312447/uber-postmates-acquisition-announced-food-delivery"&gt;Postmates&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/11/20909643/uber-grocery-delivery-startup-acquisition-cornershop"&gt;Cornershop&lt;/a&gt; in 2020 and 2019, respectively. As the company’s original ride-hailing business &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22277043/uber-lyft-earnings-q4-2020-profit-loss-covid"&gt;has struggled during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, finding an alternative has been key, but the FTC might get in the way of that now. Uber did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISQ0Vx"&gt;There’s nothing inherently usual about the FTC reviewing an acquisition or partnership, but Uber has a history with the organization, paying fines for mishandling its employees’ &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/8/15/16150902/uber-ftc-complaint-mishandle-privacy-data"&gt;access to private user and driver data&lt;/a&gt;, and for being misleading about how much drivers could &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/19/14330708/uber-ftc-settlement-20-million-driver-mislead-earnings"&gt;actually earn with the company&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hB66lx"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22527709/lina-khan-ftc-commissioner-competition-facebook-amazon-google-apple"&gt;New FTC Commissioner Lina Khan’s&lt;/a&gt; more active stance toward curbing monopolies might also mean that Uber’s rapid expansion to secure its business for whatever happens after ride-hailing might be deemed to be too anti-competitive to fly.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Chromebook for 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Chromebooks 2020: Acer Chromebook Spin 713" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HDV4yWEUjQt1tPQn1vixjNoG1V4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976144/mchin_181029_4126_0011.0.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best Chromebook laptop or two-in-one for every Chrome OS fan&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="oqi8dk"&gt;The best Chromebooks aren’t just laptops that run a few Google apps anymore. Chromebooks can cover a wide variety of computing needs now, and a good Chrome OS laptop or two-in-one can be more useful than a mediocre &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21231636/windows-10-pc-user-guide-how-to-microsoft"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281530/macos-mac-imac-user-guide-how-to-os-tips"&gt;MacOS&lt;/a&gt; laptop. That’s why our pick for the best Chromebook of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;, which does just about everything right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnwyna"&gt;The best Chromebooks are known to deliver good value. The message that many people actually want &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;Chromebooks — rather than just cheap ones — has gotten through to manufacturers. Many are around $500 or $600, though there are good options in the higher and lower ranges as well. The extra money goes a long way toward getting something you’ll be happy with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUTNYw"&gt;For the first time, the quality of the best Chromebooks in this range has been consistent. There are so many similarities between the offerings from Asus, Lenovo, Google, HP, Dell, and Samsung that a conspiracy-minded person might suggest they’re all sourcing their components from the same factory. That’s great news if you’re comparison shopping; the majority of this list would be good buys if you can find them at a discount. They can even rival some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21528540/budget-windows-10-chromebook-systems-acer-lenovo-cheap"&gt;best budget laptops&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptops&lt;/a&gt; on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMCGia"&gt;Our pick for the best Chromebook is the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, and we’ve selected the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; for shoppers on a budget. Other picks for the best Chromebooks of 2021 include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;, the HP Chromebook x360, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22217002/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-price-release-date-hands-on-chrome-os-photos-video"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch4TuU"&gt;What most buyers want in the best Chromebook are likely the same things they want in any laptop: a good keyboard, solid build quality, long battery life, a nice screen, and enough power to do the things you want. More Chromebooks can meet those qualifications than ever before, but these are the ones that rise above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="YECpuA"&gt;Best Chromebook 2021&lt;/h1&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the best Chromebook of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KQRVus"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BfZy92"&gt;Best Chromebook of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LpXHDz"&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is, hands-down, the best Chromebook you can buy. With a gorgeous 3:2 screen that rivals some more expensive competitors, you’ll have a ton of extra vertical space for your work and multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zarhIJ"&gt;The keyboard is excellent with a comfortable, quiet feel, and nice backlighting. There’s even an HDMI port, which you don’t see on a thin Chromebook every day. And (most importantly) the 11th-Gen Intel processors can handle a heavy load of tabs with no problem. The Spin’s speakers aren’t great, and there’s no biometric login, but those are reasonable sacrifices to make for a laptop of this quality at this low of a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GX2USx"&gt;In a market where the main differences between Chromebooks in this price range boil down to their screens and maybe an included stylus, Acer sets itself apart by making an affordable laptop that’s excellent in almost every way.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For students or anyone looking for a small secondary device, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a great affordable pick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RGZEpN"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="P8MGAD"&gt;Best Chromebook on a budget&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xJq778"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable device for on-the-go work, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet delivers excellent value for its low price. It’s an ultra-portable 10.1-inch 2-in-1 device with a detachable keyboard and kickstand cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfnBmb"&gt;The Duet contains a MediaTek Helio P60T processor, 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of storage, and it performs well if you’re just browsing and don’t plan on using a super heavy load. It also uses a version of Chrome OS that’s made for its convertible form factor, including the first version of Chrome that’s optimized for tablet use. When detached from its keyboard, the Duet supports an Android-esque gesture navigation system that makes switching between apps a breeze. But the most impressive feature is battery life; I got close to 11.5 hours of fairly heavy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93jX9I"&gt;Of course, there are drawbacks. The touchpad and keyboard are quite small, there’s no headphone jack (and only one USB-C port), and the 16:10 screen is a bit dim. But those are reasonable trade-offs to make for such an affordable price. It makes a great secondary device for schoolwork or on-the-go browsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zyoOMu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505920"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a larger device with more power, one of the best Chromebooks you can buy is the HP Chromebook x360 14.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C2SoIE"&gt;3. HP Chromebook x360 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rtrWbQ"&gt;Powerful Chromebook with a sleek design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2rGvI"&gt;If you’re looking to get more power and you don’t mind getting a slightly larger laptop, the HP Chromebook x360 14 is a great choice. HP has several configurations that fall under this name, but we suggest the model we tested with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage to go along with the i3 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alUDxQ"&gt;While we picked the Asus because of its elegant design, there isn’t much to complain about on the slightly larger HP. It has the same ports, RAM, and storage. The keyboard is great, and it also sounds slightly better because the speakers are up on the keyboard deck instead of on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;If the Chomebook Duet isn’t enough, the Chromebook Detachable CM3 brings some new perks to the detachable form factor, for an extra cost.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FxguZ6"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526743/asus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CrrPVI"&gt;Best detachable Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="canZPK"&gt;The Chromebook Detachable CM3 is Asus’s attempt to compete with Lenovo’s highly praised Chromebook Duet. Like the Duet, the CM3 is a 10.5-inch, 16:10 Chrome OS tablet with a fabric cover, a kickstand, and a keyboard that pops on and off. It’s a bit more expensive than the Duet, but also has a few extra features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNgQvV"&gt;One unique perk is that the kickstand folds multiple ways: You can fold it the long way to stand the tablet up like a laptop, or fold it the short way and stand the tablet up horizontally. We’re not sure how practical this functionality actually is, but it’s there if you have a use case in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlTu0z"&gt;The CM3 also comes with a built-in USI stylus, and roomy keys with a surprising amount of travel. But the thing we found most impressive was the battery life: We averaged close to 13 hours of continuous work on the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11a1Pz"&gt;The CM3 won’t be the best Chromebook for everyone: It only has two ports (one USB-C and one audio jack) and its MediaTek processor was a bit sluggish compared to more expensive offerings. But if you’re looking for a convertible Chrome OS device and find that the Duet doesn’t quite suit your needs, you’re likely the CM3’s target audience. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 one of the best Chromebooks of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AZSrVU"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yloceu"&gt;Best midrange Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="IqMUru"&gt;Samsung’s first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; shot for the moon, with a $1,000 price tag, an OLED display, a packaged stylus, and a premium build. The Galaxy Chromebook 2 isn’t so much a sequel to that device as it is a pared-down, more affordable alternative. There’s no fingerprint sensor, no stylus, and no OLED — but it’s quite functional, and with a sub-$600 starting price it’s a much more reasonable purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMshkm"&gt;The Chromebook 2’s highlight feature is its finish: It comes in a bright “fiesta red” that will certainly stand out wherever you’re using it. (There’s a gray option as well, if you’d prefer something subtle.) It’s also the first Chromebook ever to feature one of Samsung’s QLED panels. QLED isn’t OLED — it’s just a fancier LED — but it still makes for one of the most gorgeous displays I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91mDFz"&gt;Nice screens sometimes wreck battery life, but that’s not the case here. I averaged about seven hours and 21 minutes of continuous work on the Chromebook 2, which means you shouldn’t need to plug it in &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;too often. And while the Core i3 processor isn’t the most powerful chip you can get in a Chromebook, it’s just fine for everyday work use. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go has a stylish and portable design with a standout keyboard.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SStRnG"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s4tmgA"&gt;Best Google Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WMItcT"&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go is a handsome, no-nonsense 13.3-inch laptop that weighs just 2.3 pounds. It has a sturdy magnesium chassis, and a ridged grip on the bottom to keep itself from slipping on slanted surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M72CDq"&gt;Not only is the Pixelbook Go portable and stylish, but it delivers solid performance, and supports fast charging through either of its USB-C ports. Battery life is also impressive. The Go lasted over eight hours in our testing, and it should get you through a full workday with no problem. But its standout feature is the keyboard, which is quiet with good travel and a springy feel. &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor Dieter Bohn found it to be his “favorite thing to type on by a long shot.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCvQ3C"&gt;The Go is an expensive product, as Chromebooks go, and it doesn’t top our list because the Chromebook Flip C434 offers similar specs and features for a slightly lower price. But we think plenty of shoppers who value long battery life and lightweight build might prefer to spend a bit more on this device instead.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ThinkPad C13 Yoga Chromebook is a premium Chromebook for grown-ups.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="URZefw"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22424783/lenovo-thinkpad-c13-yoga-review-price-specs-features-amd"&gt;Lenovo C13 Yoga Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="U2ykf7"&gt;Best premium Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nT7MLq"&gt;Many modern Chromebooks are oriented towards kids and students, but not this one. The C13 Yoga Chromebook is a sturdy, pricey, convertible Chromebook for grown-ups. It’s part of Lenovo’s renowned ThinkPad business line, and has all kinds of ThinkPad perks including a red Trackpoint, discrete touchpad clickers, a fingerprint sensor, a webcam shutter, and an aluminum design. Put this Chromebook next to any number of Windows ThinkPads, and we might not be able to pick it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLVSSi"&gt;The C13 is also unique in that it’s the first Chromebook to include AMD’s Ryzen 3000 Mobile C-series processors, which are marketed specifically for Chromebooks. The chips run all kinds of programs — even mobile games — quite smoothly. We do wish the battery life was a bit better — we only averaged just over six hours on one charge. We averaged seven and a half hours from our top pick, the Chromebook Spin 713, and plenty of the devices here break eight hours with no problem&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook is the best Chromebook for midrange shoppers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wNILY1"&gt;8. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598860/lenovo-flex-5-chromebook-review"&gt;Lenovo Flex 5 Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sajnTX"&gt;Best Chromebook for midrange shopepers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pvusIr"&gt;The Lenovo Flex 5 looks a lot nicer than its sub-$400 price might indicate. It’s built to withstand all kinds of jolts and jostles in a backpack or briefcase, but also has a smooth soft-touch texture that’s pleasant to hold. Add a sleek backlit keyboard, a physical webcam shutter, and front-facing speakers, and you’ve got a chassis with hallmarks of a much more expensive device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y79cZK"&gt;You get some other perks as well. The Flex 5 has one of the better keyboards I’ve ever used on a Chromebook, let alone a Chromebook at a midrange price point. It also has a useful port selection including a microSD reader and a USB-C port on each side, as well as a crisp 1920 x 1080 touch display. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zD2vyD"&gt;The one caveat is that the Flex 5 has somewhat disappointing battery life, averaging just over five and a half hours in our testing. If you’ll be using the device while you’re out and about, you’ll want to make sure you bring the 45W charger with you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="wECY7h"&gt;9. Dell Inspiron 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ujgaJf"&gt;Premium 2-in-1 with a built-in stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="fBDiBQ"&gt;It’s a bit heavy as Chromebooks go, but the 3.99-pound Inspiron 14 is still a sturdy convertible device with brushed aluminum chassis that gives it a premium look. It has a spacious backlit keyboard and a nice 1920 x 1080 display with accurate colors. With an 8th Gen Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, it delivers snappy performance for streaming, browsing, multitasking, and even more demanding artistic tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kX7aDx"&gt;Speaking of artists, the Inspiron 14 comes with a stylus, which lives in a dedicated socket inside the chassis so you don’t have to worry about losing it. Thanks to electromagnetic resonance technology (EMR), it doesn’t need batteries or any kind of charge. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Criterion Collection’s first run of 4K Blu-rays includes Citizen Kane </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Citizen Kane" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s42Kkw8Ipt3-wsYrnmkEKxi2O7w=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69711855/1311663652.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DvBdvs"&gt;The Criterion Collection &lt;a href="https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/7494-citizen-kane-to-lead-criterion-s-first-4k-slate"&gt;has announced plans&lt;/a&gt; to release a six-film slate of classics on 4K Blu-rays for the first time, including a rerelease of Orson Welles’ American epic &lt;em&gt;Citizen Kane.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cH1kNy"&gt;Besides the perennial film buff favorite, Criterion is also releasing the following films as part of its initial collection of ultra high-definition Blu-rays:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Nc7UqD"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Menace II Society&lt;/em&gt; directed by Allen and Albert Hughes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="rlPrzZ"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Piano &lt;/em&gt;directed by Jane Campion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6YdeSL"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Mulholland Dr.&lt;/em&gt; directed by David Lynch&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Lje2WM"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;The Red Shoes &lt;/em&gt;directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="oniPlH"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;A Hard Day’s Night&lt;/em&gt; directed by Richard Lester&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="NcTjun"&gt;Criterion writes that each release will include the film in 4K UHD along with a traditional 1080p Blu-ray print. Special features, arguably one of the Criterion Collection’s greatest strengths, will also be included on the Blu-ray. Some select films will even support Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="of1CYU"&gt;The company didn’t share when to expect the new Blu-rays but did say it would announce more details next week alongside its November release schedule. In the meantime, if you don’t want to wait for physical media, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/11/16/18099126/criterion-collection-streaming-service-filmstruck-warner-media"&gt;you can stream a whole host of films&lt;/a&gt; on the &lt;a href="https://www.criterionchannel.com/"&gt;Criterion Channel streaming service&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
