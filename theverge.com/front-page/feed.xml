    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LMzy72"&gt;AI research company OpenAI is releasing a new machine learning tool that translates the English language into code. The &lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex/"&gt;software is called Codex&lt;/a&gt; and is designed to speed up the work of professional programmers, as well as help amateurs get started coding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYczzl"&gt;In demos of Codex, OpenAI shows how the software can be used to build simple websites and rudimentary games using natural language, as well as translate between different programming languages and tackle data science queries. Users type English commands into the software, like “create a webpage with a menu on the side and title at the top,” and Codex translates this into code. The software is far from infallible and takes some patience to operate, but could prove invaluable in making coding faster and more accessible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="v62ERC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It takes people who are already programmers and removes the drudge work.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="s7Uli2"&gt;“We see this as a tool to multiply programmers,” OpenAI’s CTO and co-founder Greg Brockman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Programming has two parts to it: you have ‘think hard about a problem and try to understand it,’ and ‘map those small pieces to existing code, whether it’s a library, a function, or an API.’” The second part is tedious, he says, but it’s what Codex is best at. “It takes people who are already programmers and removes the drudge work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnVXx8"&gt;OpenAI used an earlier version of Codex to build a tool called &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555777/github-openai-ai-tool-autocomplete-code"&gt;Copilot&lt;/a&gt; for GitHub, a code repository owned by Microsoft, which is itself a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/22/20703578/microsoft-openai-investment-partnership-1-billion-azure-artificial-general-intelligence-agi"&gt;close partner of OpenAI&lt;/a&gt;. Copilot is similar to the autocomplete tools found in Gmail, offering suggestions on how to finish lines of code as users type them out. OpenAI’s new version of Codex, though, is much more advanced and flexible, not just completing code, but creating it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QfdZLw"&gt;Codex is built on the top of GPT-3, OpenAI’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21346343/gpt-3-explainer-openai-examples-errors-agi-potential"&gt;language generation model&lt;/a&gt;, which was trained on a sizable chunk of the internet, and as a result can generate and parse the written word in impressive ways. One application users found for GPT-3 was generating code, but Codex improves upon its predecessors’ abilities and is trained specifically on open-source code repositories scraped from the web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="vktCLC"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="OpenAI Codex demo: Hello World|103409" data-volume-uuid="b8ffc0647" data-volume-id="103409" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-277" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9rR7xD"&gt;This latter point has led many coders to complain that OpenAI is &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/github-commercial-ai-tool-built-open-source-code/"&gt;profiting unfairly from their work&lt;/a&gt;. OpenAI’s Copilot tool often suggests snippets of code written by others, for example, and the entire knowledge base of the program is ultimately derived from open-source work, shared to benefit individuals, not corporations. The same criticisms will likely be leveled against Codex, though OpenAI says its use of this data is legally protected under fair use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="iouPD0"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The real net effect is a lot of value for the ecosystem”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D9qq0b"&gt;When asked about these complaints, Brockman responds: “New technology is coming, we do need this debate, and there will be things we do that the community has great points on and we will take feedback and do things differently.” He argues, though, that the wider coding community will ultimately benefit from OpenAI’s work. “The real net effect is a lot of value for the ecosystem,” says Brockman. “At the end of the day, these types of technologies, I think, can reshape our economy and create a better world for all of us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sdrjtr"&gt;Codex will also certainly create value for OpenAI and its investors. Although the company started life as a nonprofit lab in 2015, it &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/03/11/openai-shifts-from-nonprofit-to-capped-profit-to-attract-capital/"&gt;switched to a “capped profit” model&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 to attract outside funding, and although Codex is initially being released as free API, OpenAI will start charging for access at some point in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iq4yWw"&gt;OpenAI says it doesn’t want to build its own tools using Codex, as it’s better placed to improve the core model. “We realized if we pursued any one of those, we would cut off any of our other routes,” says Brockman. “You can choose as a startup to be best at one thing. And for us, there’s no question that that’s making better versions of all these models.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="zEb1Dt"&gt;What is Codex actually like to use?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="MyLydu"&gt;Of course, while Codex sounds extremely exciting, it’s difficult to judge the full scope of its capabilities before real programmers have got to grips with it. I’m no coder myself, but I did see Codex in action and have a few thoughts on the software.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="460Qpo"&gt;OpenAI’s Brockman and Codex lead Wojciech Zaremba demonstrated the program to me online, using Codex to first create a simple website and then a rudimentary game. In the game demo, Brockman found a silhouette of a person on Google Images then told Codex to “add this image of a person from the page” before pasting in the URL. The silhouette appeared on-screen and Brockman then modified its size (“make the person a bit bigger”) before making it controllable (“now make it controllable with the left and right arrow keys”). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SaXNaf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Giving Codex the right instructions is as much an art as a science&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fg5DL6"&gt;It all worked very smoothly. The figure started shuffling around the screen, but we soon ran into a problem: it kept disappearing off-screen. To stop this, Brockman gave the computer an additional instruction: “Constantly check if the person is off the page and put it back on the page if so.” This stopped it from moving out of sight, but I was curious how precise these instructions need to be. I suggested we try a different one: “Make sure the person can’t exit the page.” This worked, too, but for reasons neither Brockman nor Zaremba can explain, it also changed the width of the figure, squashing it flat on-screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Yo0i8U"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="OpenAI Codex demo: Game development|103414" data-volume-uuid="e45bc7194" data-volume-id="103414" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-734" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hmLgWd"&gt;“Sometimes it doesn’t quite know exactly what you’re asking,” laughs Brockman. He has a few more tries, then comes up with a command that works without this unwanted change. “So you had to think a little about what’s going on but not super deeply,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7URA6d"&gt;This is fine in our little demo, but it says a lot about the limitations of this sort of program. It’s not a magic genie that can read your brain, turning every command into flawless code — nor does OpenAI claim it is. Instead, it requires thought and a little trial and error to use. Codex won’t turn non-coders into expert programmers overnight, but it’s certainly much more accessible than any other programming language out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Kns7RH"&gt;The future of programming&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="5NEyoW"&gt;OpenAI is bullish about the potential of Codex to change programming and computing more generally. Brockman says it could help solve the programmer shortage in the US, while Zaremba sees it as the next step in the historical evolution of coding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nm1R43"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Codex is bringing computers closer to humans, letting them speak English rather than machine code”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nGXrGv"&gt;“What is happening with Codex has happened before a few times,” he says. In the early days of computing, programming was done by creating physical punch cards that had to be fed into machines, then people invented the first programming languages and began to refine these. “These programming languages, they started to resemble English, using vocabulary like ‘print’ or ‘exit’ and so more people became able to program.” The next part of this trajectory is doing away with specialized coding languages altogether and replacing it with English language commands. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wpEBJP"&gt;“Each of these stages represents programming languages becoming more high level,” says Zaremba. “And we think Codex is bringing computers closer to humans, letting them speak English rather than machine code.” Codex itself can speak more than a dozen coding languages, including JavaScript, Go, Perl, PHP, Ruby, Swift, and TypeScript. It’s most proficient, though, in Python. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AOJuG6"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="OpenAI Codex demo: Talking to your computer|103413" data-volume-uuid="92b8c5f5f" data-volume-id="103413" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-367" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cxcgO5"&gt;Codex also has the ability to control other programs. In one demo, Brockman shows how the software can be used to create a voice interface for Microsoft Word. Because Word has its own API, Codex can feed it instructions in code created from the user’s spoken commands. Brockman copies a poem into a Word document and then tells Word (via Codex) to first remove all the indentations, then number the lines, then count the frequency of certain words, and so on. It’s extremely fluid, though hard to tell how well it would work outside the confines of a pre-arranged demo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QaVije"&gt;If it succeeds, Codex might not only help programmers but become a new interface between users and computers. OpenAI says it’s tested Codex’s ability to control not only Word but other programs like Spotify and Google Calendar. And while the Word demo is just a proof of concept, says Brockman, Microsoft is apparently already interested in exploring the software’s possibility. “They’re very excited about the model in general and you should expect to see lots of Codex applications be created,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>NASA’s new space suits are delayed, making a 2024 Moon landing ‘not feasible’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Artemis Generation Spacesuit Event" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cdOilpqQNokV7z6MfseLZnkzcno=/1413x0:5792x2919/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69705198/1176110120.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qbIPpa"&gt;NASA’s development of new astronaut space suits will be nearly two years late and nix its effort to land humans on the Moon by 2024, an inspector general report released on Tuesday found. Those delays compound a daunting set of schedule challenges NASA already faces — from the development of its new human-rated lunar lander to getting its massive Space Launch System rocket off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="is97ll"&gt;An audit from the agency’s Office of Inspector General said NASA is on track to spend more than $1 billion on space suit development by the time its first two suits are ready, which would be “April 2025 at the earliest,” the &lt;a href="https://oig.nasa.gov/docs/IG-21-025.pdf"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; said. “Given these anticipated delays in spacesuit development, a lunar landing in late 2024 as NASA currently plans is not feasible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="my5pO4"&gt;NASA is trying to return astronauts to the surface of the Moon for the first time since 1972 under its Artemis program that was spawned by the Trump administration in 2019. The program, as set by former Vice President Mike Pence, called for a crewed lunar landing in 2024 — a deadline that President Biden’s transition team &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/12/22323621/trump-moon-program-artemis-biden-nasa-timeline"&gt;deemed unrealistic&lt;/a&gt;. But NASA continues to embrace the date, with administrator Bill Nelson insinuating delays are likely because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/29/8863121/spacex-falcon-9-rocket-explosion-excuses"&gt;“space is hard.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="T8URKN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NASA’s space suit design has changed with shifting space priorities, driving up costs and delays&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zkDD8P"&gt;NASA has already spent $420 million on space suit development since 2007, before the advent of its Artemis program, and it plans to “invest approximately $625.2 million more” through 2025, the report said. The space suit’s design and purpose have changed repeatedly over the years as NASA’s priorities in space teeter between new administrations. A new Artemis-tailored space suit design, called xEMU, was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20916106/nasa-artemis-moon-space-suits-xemu"&gt;unveiled in 2019&lt;/a&gt;. Current suits worn by astronauts on the International Space Station are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20920790/nasa-first-all-female-spacewalk-christina-koch-jessica-meir-spacesuit-design-bias"&gt;restrictive, haven’t been upgraded in decades&lt;/a&gt;, and aren’t designed for long walks on the Moon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZbONs"&gt;The xEMU program anticipated development delays by allotting 12 months of wiggle room on its path to meet the 2024 Artemis deadline. But that schedule margin has already disappeared after NASA ran into funding shortfalls, closures to NASA centers during the COVID-19 pandemic, and more technical challenges, the report found. NASA slashed the space suit program’s planned $209 million budget by $59 million after Congress gave the agency 77 percent of what it requested for its Gateway Program in 2021, under which space suits are developed. That set the program back three months, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;NASA space suit engineer Kristine Davis models a prototype of the agency’s new lunar space suit in 2019.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8cVvB6"&gt;Intermittent closures to NASA’s Johnson Space Center during the pandemic caused at least three more months of delays, the report said. Then there were the hardware problems. Design upgrades and other changes caused production issues with the suit’s Display and Control Unit — the screen astronauts will use to control the suit’s critical functions. Circuit boards within a key part of the suits’ life support system, needed “rework” to ensure communications between the suit and the astronaut — and other astronauts — worked right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="efOehI"&gt;The program was hit with another delay when NASA halted testing for the suit’s assembly process. The team caused an unspecified “component failure” after “staff used the wrong specifications to build a complicated” life support system interface. When auditors interviewed NASA personnel about this flub, they blamed schedule pressure, among other issues. Additional factors included “a communication breakdown among the team” and the team’s rapid growth, “including the addition of inexperienced personnel.” An “unreleased drawing” and old hardware used during tests were also to blame, personnel told auditors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EmvcBB"&gt;Currently, 27 different entities are pitching in to build different parts of the space suit, the report notes. NASA previously contracted with just two companies, Hamilton Standard and ILC Dover, to build the space suits it currently uses on the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="g5K27q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Seems like too many cooks in the kitchen&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1425100378459279370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 10, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pIuoBh"&gt;“Seems like too many cooks in the kitchen,” SpaceX CEO Elon Musk opined on Twitter in response to the news, adding in another tweet: “SpaceX could do it if need be.” It’s unclear whether SpaceX has an active space suit development program; government astronauts who have flown the company’s Crew Dragon capsule wear SpaceX-designed flight suits, not long-duration space suits. Some private companies are already planning to design their own space suits, including Axiom Space, which, this month, posted &lt;a href="https://app.trinethire.com/companies/31021-axiom-space-inc/jobs/41213-senior-space-suit-hardware-engineer"&gt;new jobs for space suit engineers&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mRo0iU"&gt;NASA’s space suit woes aren’t the only threat to its 2024 goal. The agency’s inspector general, Government Accountability Office, and NASA’s aerospace safety panel have all expressed concern that development delays in NASA’s human lunar lander and Space Launch System programs — the core organs of the Artemis program — will make a 2024 landing nearly impossible, with the safety panel raising fears that the hastened landing date could lead to schedule pressure among engineers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFb3dQ"&gt;In response to the report, NASA’s human exploration chief Kathy Lueders said the agency plans to rejig its space suit development schedule and carry out a space suit test on the ISS by June 2022, before the first crewed Artemis mission poised for sometime in 2023. For that mission, astronauts will fly around the Moon in NASA’s Orion capsule without a lunar landing. The next mission, Artemis III, will have the Moon landing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KeRUw8"&gt;“Demonstration and testing of [the space suits] on ISS are a priority,” Lueders said.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senate approves $1 trillion infrastructure package as crypto worries loom</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senators Meet For Weekly Policy Luncheons" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9YQvUcyd1eNLjrH1zh9Vxb1od9Y=/0x2:8192x5463/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69704897/1332193432.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3Luv5h"&gt;After weeks of negotiations, the Senate approved a bipartisan &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605917/senate-negotiators-bipartisan-infrastructure-broadband-electric-vehicles-cryptocurrency"&gt;$1 trillion infrastructure&lt;/a&gt; package Tuesday authorizing over $500 billion in new spending to improve roads, bridges, and other physical infrastructure like broadband and EV charging. It’s the largest domestic spending bill in over a decade. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQqDH8"&gt;“It’s taken quite a while. There have been a lot of bumps in the road,” Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jnecAr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s taken quite a while”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hBVcus"&gt;Aside from more traditional infrastructure spending like roads, the bill seeks to bolster US broadband networks with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598636/white-house-infrastructure-broadband-package-bipartisan"&gt;an additional $65 billion&lt;/a&gt;. It also makes permanent a pandemic-era internet subsidy program called the Emergency Broadband Benefit fund, renaming it the Affordable Connectivity Fund. The fund offers low-income families $30-a-month subsidies to go toward their internet bills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TpMmh4"&gt;The package also includes &lt;a href="http://s"&gt;$7.5 billion to build&lt;/a&gt; over 500 million EV charging stations across the US to help encourage EV adoption. A more reliable charging network could incentivize people to purchase more EVs over the next ten years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ELGfah"&gt;Still, controversial language regarding cryptocurrency tax reporting remains in the bill. Lawmakers sought to set off some of the infrastructure spending by extending cryptocurrency tax reporting requirements, raising an estimated $28 billion in revenue. The digital assets community and lawmakers like Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) argued that the language was too vague and would make wallet developers and miners subject to reporting. After days of negotiations, an amendment aimed at fixing that problem &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22617055/infrastructure-cryptocurrency-deal-reporting-lummis-wyden-schumer"&gt;failed on the floor&lt;/a&gt; after Sen. Richard Shelby (R-AL) objected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nd1tJV"&gt;Now, the House is set to begin debate on the infrastructure bill before it receives final approval and heads to President Biden’s desk. It’s unclear how long the process will take before the language is finalized. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ETrBY4"&gt;In a letter to every House lawmaker, members of the bipartisan &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepTomEmmer/status/1424845416697323522?s=20"&gt;Blockchain Caucus raised concerns&lt;/a&gt; over the Senate’s cryptocurrency provision. “Left unchanged, this provision will have sweeping implications for crypto investors in our country and further regulate innovation out of the United States,” they wrote. The House has an opportunity to amend the bill to fix these issues before it’s moved for a floor vote.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sz6TNb"&gt;Nvidia is launching its new RTX A2000 GPU today, designed for professional workstations. It’s Nvidia’s smallest Ampere-based GPU so far and can easily squeeze into small form factor workstations. Like Nvidia’s old Quadro cards, the RTX A2000 is designed primarily for professionals who want to leverage ray tracing and Nvidia’s AI capabilities, and it’s the latest in a &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fdesign-visualization%2Fdesktop-graphics%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F10%2F22618030%2Fnvidia-rtx-a2000-gpu-workstation-specs-features-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;line of A-series GPUs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T4hvv7"&gt;The RTX A2000 can deliver 8 teraflops of GPU performance, coupled with 3328 CUDA cores, 6GB of GDDR6 memory with ECC, and a memory clock of 6001Mhz. That makes it look more capable on paper than something like Nvidia’s RTX 3050 laptop GPU. It also only consumes 70 watts of power, so it’s very power-efficient.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nvidia’s lineup of A-series GPUs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2gmwY4"&gt;The RTX A2000 is based on Nvidia’s latest Ampere architecture and is designed to boost performance in 3D modeling and rendering software like Blender, Autodesk 3ds Max, and more. It includes second-generation RT cores, third-generation tensor cores for AI tools, and PCIe 4 support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="llI2ak"&gt;Its compact, low-profile design includes a single blower and four DisplayPort 1.4 ports at the rear, making it ideal for workstations with multiple monitors. Nvidia is aiming the RTX A2000 at those working remotely, helping power 3D design, thanks to a form factor that can slot into workstations big and small. It’s just 2.7 inches tall and 6.6 inches long, matching the size of a &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/nvidia/rtx-3060-mini-itx-gpu"&gt;miniature RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt;. Overall, the RTX A2000 is almost half the size of the giant RTX 3090.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cNU0yU"&gt;Nvidia is working with a variety of partners to make the RTX A2000 available in workstations from Asus, Dell, HP, Lenovo, and many more. The RTX A2000 should debut from Nvidia partners in October, priced at around $450.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>COVID-19 misinformation is increasing amid US virus surge </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of several vaccine vials over a pink and purple background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ht9To0KPqyjWMZag6kErnXMTaF8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69704559/acastro_210309_1777_vaccine_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="UyCQXm"&gt;The surge in COVID-19 cases around the United States, driven by the highly contagious and fast-moving delta variant of the coronavirus, is accompanied by a similar surge in virus misinformation, &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/technology/covid-delta-misinformation-surge.html?smid=tw-share"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8AAZfY"&gt;Rates of misinformation about COVID-19 and the COVID-19 vaccines increased dramatically from June to July, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/technology/covid-delta-misinformation-surge.html?smid=tw-share"&gt;according to Zignal Labs&lt;/a&gt;, which tracks mentions of phrases on social media and by news outlets. False claims, including statements saying that the vaccines don’t work, immunity from infections is better than vaccination, and vaccines cause miscarriages, skyrocketed. The falsehood&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;that the vaccines don’t work is up 437 percent, the analysis found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aONVIY"&gt;The spike comes after a lull in misinformation during May and June, when COVID-19 cases were low in most places in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rfjyRY"&gt;Russian-aligned disinformation campaigns are also contributing to the spread of falsehoods, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/05/us/politics/covid-vaccines-russian-disinformation.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; last week. Those actors are spreading false messaging about side effects of the gene-based COVID-19 vaccines made by Pfizer / BioNTech and Moderna, and suggesting that the Biden administration will force people to get vaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EJvB0c"&gt;The uncertainty around the delta variant created an environment for this type of misinformation to take hold. “Disinformation thrives in an information vacuum,” Lisa Kaplan, the chief executive of the Alethea Group, which helps corporations guard against misinformation, told &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;. “Knowing how the Russians typically play those situations, it wouldn’t surprise me they are trying to take advantage of it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Po0Xg0"&gt;The spread of vaccine-related falsehoods comes at a key time in the COVID-19 vaccination campaign. Public health officials are working to convince unvaccinated people to sign up for a shot in order to curb the transmission of the delta variant. Only &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html"&gt;59 percent of people&lt;/a&gt; in the US eligible for the vaccine are fully immunized, which isn’t nearly enough to contain the virus. In states and counties in the Southeast where coverage is low, hospital systems are overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients, the majority of which are unvaccinated. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDqO6r"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="pNTP2g"&gt;Gretchen Howard was sitting outside the Ferry Building in San Francisco when she got a piece of unexpected career advice that would eventually change her whole life. It came from Paul Daversa, CEO of the executive recruiting firm Daversa Partners. “Are you actually good, or are you just lucky?” he asked her&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The question sounded like a neg, but it eventually spurred enough introspection to prompt her to leave her stable job at Google and take a chance on a new career path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7S9URT"&gt;As an executive recruiter, Paul Daversa is masterful at nudging people toward fast-paced startups. Recounting the story on a podcast, he pulled up an email he’d sent Howard in 2010, asking her to take an interview at Zendesk. When she said she couldn’t quite handle the risk, he suggested she take a jumbo mortgage. She didn’t bite, but his words left a lasting impact. In 2019, Howard became the COO of Robinhood — one of many buzzy companies Paul Daversa advises. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z7gjfm"&gt;Daversa Partners is far from a household name outside the tech industry. But for companies looking to grow from collegial side hustle to venture-backed verb, it’s the go-to firm. In tech, many startups are run by ambitious but inexperienced entrepreneurs. Daversa helps bring in executives with industry experience. In short, it puts adults in the room, adding a layer of professionalism and oversight that’s sorely needed in Silicon Valley. To that end, the firm has recruited the chief financial officer of Uber, the chief accounting officer of Instacart, and seemingly the entire engineering leadership team at WeWork.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="L5tOPx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;This same partner apparently got so drunk that he accidentally kneed a female consultant in the head&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QgHSXH"&gt;Behind the scenes, however, Daversa has been struggling with its own alleged lack of oversight. The firm is the subject of a recent lawsuit, brought by a former employee named Vaughn Feighan who says he was repeatedly harassed and assaulted by a man who, at the time, was one of the organization’s most powerful partners. Feighan says the partner drew him in by talking about the opportunity — he, too, could make partner if he just took the older man’s advice. It almost felt like he was one of Daversa’s recruiting targets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xDiEH"&gt;The complaint alleges that the partner, who was in his fifties, told Feighan about his specific sexual desires: that he liked having fingers in his ass when he was having sex and that he’d always dreamed of “going both ways,” but it hadn’t been acceptable when he was growing up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8e6iON"&gt;On three separate occasions, Feighan alleges the partner physically assaulted him. Once, after giving Feighan a ride home, he restrained the younger man in the car and stuck his hands down his pants. “I always imagined you had a massive dick,” he said, according to Feighan’s recollection. The other two alleged assaults occurred on company trips. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vBKkOa"&gt;All the while, the partner was dangling prestigious career opportunities in front of Feighan, telling him he could get a promotion if he just stuck it out a little longer. He said he was mentoring the younger man — teaching him the subtle art of nudging executives to take a chance on a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pKg2i8"&gt;Feighan’s complaint is not the first time Daversa has faced internal tension. The firm hires many people just out of college, making it difficult for some to gauge whether the behavior they’re witnessing falls within the bounds of normal corporate culture. A former employee says that, despite being more than 60 percent women, Daversa felt like a boys’ club. One partner, who has helped build the executive teams at Google, PayPal, Twitter, and Postmates, allegedly made references to sucking dick and getting fucked in front of colleagues at the offices. During a company offsite in 2019, this same partner apparently got so drunk that he accidentally kneed a female consultant in the head. He currently co-runs Daversa’s San Francisco office.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="M5rG5f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The firm tasked with getting adults in the room at some of the most prestigious startups in Silicon Valley had no adults in the room&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aH1LKV"&gt;In response to these allegations, a spokesperson for Daversa said that the firm’s leadership team is majority women, and suggesting that it was a boys’ club “defies logic.” They also said that during a team outing in Napa Valley wine country, “an unfortunate accident occurred” but vehemently denied allegations that this partner made references to “sucking dick” or “getting fucked” in front of colleagues. The spokesperson also sent prepared statements from multiple women who have had overwhelmingly positive experiences at the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wn46sH"&gt;Feighan suspected the alleged behavior was abnormal. It might have been his first job out of college, but he felt like the excessive drinking and sexual references had to breach some code of conduct. Still, he felt he had no one to turn to. According to the complaint, Daversa did not have an internal human resources department, despite being a nearly 30-year-old company. (The firm did have an outside consultant whom Feighan was aware of.) He tried to tell the other partners about the late-night texts and phone calls he was receiving, but, according to the lawsuit, the firm did nothing to protect him. (Daversa denies that any of the other partners knew about the allegations of harassment or assault or were ever told about the late-night phone calls.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7EieyC"&gt;Over time, Feighan began to see himself as part of a group of people, many of them women, people of color, and members of the LGBTQ community, who’ve been targeted by powerful men in the tech industry while their companies turned a blind eye. “It was so alarming to me that the people I was supposed to turn to through all of this just kept turning their heads, and that’s exactly what Silicon Valley has continued to do,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ICBZqO"&gt;When it mattered most to Feighan, the firm tasked with getting adults in the room at some of the most prestigious startups in Silicon Valley had no adults in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="4St50t"&gt;Follow My Lead&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7-p0n8_lAuMod7L36rCy-0oUdO0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773517/VRG_4688_Spot_1_2.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yetDCv"&gt;From the beginning, the partner in the DC office took a keen interest in Vaughn Feighan. A recent college grad, Feighan originally wanted to interview for the Los Angeles office but says he was told that the partner had heard about him and wanted him to interview for a position in DC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Az0exs"&gt;Feighan’s uncle had worked at Daversa years before, so the comment didn’t stand out to him. The firm was known for the long tenure of many of its senior staff — perhaps legacy meant something to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ga7qLw"&gt;He showed up for the interview wearing a suit. “You look so stuck-up right now,” the partner said, according to Feighan’s recollection. He instructed the younger man to take off his jacket. Then the partner asked him if he was a “crier.” Feighan thought he’d misheard. “Do you mean, do I cry?” he asked. “Yeah,” he says the partner responded. “Because we don’t really have time for people in the Washington, DC office who are sensitive and cry a lot.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jV3Y05"&gt;The partner ran the show in the DC office. He’d been at the company for 20 years and had deep relationships with VC firms like Sequoia Capital. According to Daversa’s website, he’d helped build the “senior most leadership teams” at companies like Spotify and Survey Monkey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ON9N0p"&gt;Feighan could see why the partner was so successful. “He could basically get anyone to take a meeting with anyone, regardless of what role it was for,” Feighan says. “His style is very relaxed and very, very effective. He didn’t even talk about roles necessarily. He would just talk.” The partner’s confidence was intimidating — and it worked. His favorite thing to tell candidates was “just follow my lead on this.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5D3hVU"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You passed the test, perfect.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BDRyB2"&gt;This confidence, in many ways, is what executive recruiting is all about. Tech companies that need to expand their boards or leadership teams will often hire outside firms to woo qualified candidates on their behalf and convince them to take a leap of faith. Jana Rich, an executive recruiter who’s worked with Dropbox, Square, and Peloton, says the work is “touchy-feely,” less about finding people with technical expertise than identifying “public-facing leaders in the C-suite,” &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/11/17/ozy-jana-rich-silicon-valley-recruiter/19167107/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;USA Today&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It’s behind-the-scenes work that helps shape the culture of Silicon Valley and reverberates through offices around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYaSJ9"&gt;Two days after Feighan started, he was sitting in a training session when he got a text from the partner telling him to go to a bar near the office “ASAP.” Feighan responded that he was in a meeting. “Come anyway,” the partner said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jn8KNk"&gt;“When I got down there, he was saying, ‘Oh well, you know what? You passed the test, perfect,’” Feighan recalls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nzTwxM"&gt;The off-campus meeting became a pattern. The partner would tell Feighan to leave work, at times even instructing him to lie about his whereabouts to colleagues. He called Feighan late at night and on weekends, often to talk about projects, but at times asking Feighan about his personal life or sharing details of his own. The partner was married but talked about cheating on his wife, according to the lawsuit. He mentioned a desire to sleep with men and speculated about Feighan’s sexual preferences — including fantasizing about whether the younger man was a top or a bottom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H3N0hM"&gt;A month after he started, the partner asked to meet for lunch to go over an assignment. When they sat down, the partner ordered whiskey and told Feighan that drinking wasn’t optional, according to the lawsuit. “Mr. Feighan felt he had no choice other than comply, or else risk angering [the partner] and jeopardizing his job,” the complaint alleges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ss3Hf"&gt;After lunch, the partner texted him: “Great hustle this weekend. Overall B+ and the whiskey/lunch/vision board review puts you @ an A-.” To Feighan, the message was clear: push through your discomfort, and you’ll be professionally rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Pz8r9r"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Dad, I’m staying in the same room as my boss. He’s 55 years old.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EnhB83"&gt;In September, the partner told Feighan that he was taking the young associate on a business trip to California — an unusual perk for an employee of Feighan’s tenure. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rEWtPo"&gt;“Should I act surprised that I am going to SF/should I tell the others or are you going to?” Feighan asked him over text. “Yes act surprised…” the partner said. “I will make the announcement later...for now keep your head down.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JUXGnU"&gt;After Feighan arrived in San Francisco, the partner told him to meet him at a hotel. Feighan assumed the partner had gotten him a room, and he had — but it was a room the two men were meant to share. Feighan felt it was inappropriate. He hadn’t been told ahead of time about the arrangement. “I called my dad and I was like, ‘Dad, I’m staying in the same room as my boss. He’s 55 years old.’” His father confirmed this conversation in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Ge9hI"&gt;On two subsequent trips, the partner booked a single room with just one king bed for the two of them, according to the complaint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkhW9i"&gt;In response to these allegations, a spokesperson for Daversa said, “It is absolutely not typical for any manager and subordinate to share a hotel room and any suggestion to the contrary would be false.” In the firm’s answer to the complaint, however, it wrote that “employees of the same gender who travel together sometimes share a hotel room as a cost-saving measure for the company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BkM0qa"&gt;Later on during the San Francisco trip, a drunk woman began hitting on Feighan at a restaurant in San Jose, even buying him and the partner a bottle of champagne. After the restaurant staff asked her to leave, the partner said that they had just “lived the beginning of a small dream of his” and that he would “love to take that woman in the bathroom, fuck her and pull her hair while she screamed and [Mr. Feighan] watched…if [Mr. Feighan] did not want to join,” according to the complaint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="0K8fyP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Come on...you and I have taken it to the next level...there’s no turning back”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="KHzJ2a"&gt;After the trip, the texts became even more frequent. The partner would mix work questions with jokes, movie suggestions, and heaps of praise. “I can say this w/o being a flag,” he told Feighan once. (According to the complaint, he’d started using the term “flag” ahead of inappropriate comments after going through a sexual harassment training.) “I actually love you and think you’re the next combo of myself and Bryce!!!” He was referring to another high-powered executive recruiter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpYKvv"&gt;In November, the partner took Feighan to dinner at an upscale Italian restaurant, saying he had feedback to give him directly from Paul Daversa. Feighan, hoping to keep things professional, suggested bringing along another of the firm’s directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5YfDBA"&gt;“This is btw you and I,” the partner responded. “Stop being so political...I want to hang with you solo!!! And don’t share.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVzVkr"&gt;According to text messages reviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; the partner picked him up from his house. When they got to the restaurant, the older man ordered a drink and started asking Feighan about his sexuality. He inquired about whether the younger man loved him and found him attractive, according to the lawsuit. Feighan tried to fend off the comments but was feeling pressured to drink as well. Eventually, when the partner got up to use the bathroom, Feighan told the bartender to substitute lime juice and seltzer the next time he ordered a cocktail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QbvyR1"&gt;After dinner, the two men took an elevator down to the parking garage where the partner’s car was parked. According to the complaint, the partner began tickling him. “I don’t think I’ve ever even tickled a significant other,” Feighan says. Then, the partner grabbed his crotch. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dgwB8x"&gt;Feighan pulled out his phone. “I’m going to take an Uber home,” he remembers saying. “I still have your backpack,” the partner responded. Feighan had left it in the car earlier that night. The partner allegedly told Feighan he wouldn’t give it back unless he got in the car. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ZHWTQ"&gt;On the ride home, the partner remarked on the size of Feighan’s dick, according to the complaint. When they got to Feighan’s apartment, the younger man went to unbuckle his seatbelt, only to have the partner throw his arm across his chest to hold him down. “[The partner] unbuckled his seat belt as Mr. Feighan struggled under him, and forced his other hand down Mr. Feighan’s pants, placing several fingers inside Mr. Feighan’s underwear,” the complaint says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EfFVc6"&gt;Around 10PM, after a short exchange about Feighan’s growth at Daversa, the partner wrote: “Come on...you and I have taken it to the next level...there’s no turning back...it’s either you, Reece, or Ava” in reference to a director and senior associate at the firm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Mj7mAv"&gt;Why Men Don’t Report&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hc2OSIvV690210XVaDelzGJ9GIY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773518/VRG_4688_Spot_3_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="TlNnZx"&gt;Research suggests that more than &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf"&gt;24 percent of men in the United States have experienced some form of sexual violence in their lifetime&lt;/a&gt;, yet these incidents are vastly under-reported. According to a &lt;a href="https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/cv19.pdf"&gt;criminal victimization report from the Department of Justice&lt;/a&gt;, roughly 66 percent of sexual assaults aren’t reported to police — and the numbers are likely far higher when talking about male-on-male violence. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4HzE6"&gt;In Silicon Valley, an inclusive ethos collides with a bro-centric culture. While companies say employees will not be retaliated against for reporting sexual harassment or assault, the reality is that many go to great lengths to protect high-powered men at their organizations. The situation can be even more complicated for young gay men who are navigating an environment where they’re expected to be “one of the guys.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVCKjN"&gt;Up until the alleged assault, Feighan wasn’t even sure what he was experiencing. He knew he was overwhelmed by the number of texts and calls he received from the partner, but when Feighan tried to bring it up to another member of the leadership team, he says he was told, “Look, we know he’s very intense, but this is how you become the number one partner in the firm.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEeXDQ"&gt;(In response to this allegation, a spokesperson for Daversa said, “The employee involved in this fictional conversation categorically denies that it ever occurred, and we believe this individual.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mDNS1W"&gt;The partner was also masterful at making Feighan feel like he was perpetually on the verge of a bonus or promotion. “I have your back and will do what it takes to ensure that u crush it!!!” he texted him once. “Close [a candidate] I’m personally buying you 2 pairs of Chelsea boots,” he said on another occasion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLy635"&gt;After the alleged assault, any confusion about what the attention meant evaporated. When his best friend from college got to town shortly after the incident, he told her what had happened. “He explicitly said that he was sexually assaulted by [the partner] the night before,” she says in an interview with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “I remember being in his little bedroom and he was in the bathroom and he started crying as he said it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="4h9sXO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I felt broken by the end, completely broken.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="woMply"&gt;Feighan didn’t know what to do. When he talked to his father about some of the behavior — omitting the details of the assault — he was told to keep his distance from the partner. But how could he? Oftentimes, when he started to pull back, he’d get a notification on his phone that the partner had Venmoed him random sums of money — at times, upwards of $250. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GGQIYX"&gt;“I felt broken by the end, completely broken,” Feighan says. He started having panic attacks and suffering from crippling anxiety — symptoms he says he’d never experienced before the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qM5qFw"&gt;Over time, Feighan had begun to mirror the partner’s casual and inappropriate language. He joked with the older man about doing drugs, called him a bitch, and talked shit on the other partners. “They really turned me into someone that I was not,” he says. “That’s been one of the biggest struggles. My demeanor, my attitude toward work and people, and the language I used totally changed.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eTanQ4"&gt;For victims of sexual assault, this behavior is hardly unusual. “Victims sometimes cope by focusing on their perpetrator’s loving side and shutting out the abuse, maintaining contact to elicit such affirmative behavior from the abuser,” &lt;a href="https://timesupfoundation.org/newsroom/weinstein-trial-why-victims-stay-in-touch-with-perpetrators-and-other-facts/"&gt;wrote the Times Up Foundation in 2020&lt;/a&gt;. “Often, victims may blame themselves for the encounter and convince themselves — or be convinced by the abuser — that an assault was not what they thought it was.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wDjWmv"&gt;Feighan resigned in July 2020, just over a year after he’d started. He knew he’d likely never go back to executive recruiting. When he told the partner he was leaving, the older man at first offered to match the base salary he was getting at his new job. Then he changed his tune and said that Feighan couldn’t stay two weeks — the resignation was going to be effective immediately. “Thank you so much for all your great work, but things have gotten kind of out of control at the firm,” the partner said, according to a recording of the call reviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5550pu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’m not the first person this has happened to, but hopefully I can be the last.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="myBF6q"&gt;When Feighan started opening up to his queer male friends about what had happened, he was shocked at how many gay men said they’d experienced similar kinds of behavior but hadn’t felt able to report it. Feighan realized that he had an obligation to come forward. He was queer, yes, but also white and well-off. He felt he could handle the fight. He decided to file a lawsuit, naming both the partner and Daversa as defendants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vR2zJR"&gt;When the firm received the complaint, it placed the partner on unpaid leave and began to investigate the allegations. Shortly afterward, the partner resigned. He’s now started his own firm, building off of his success at Daversa. “Leveraging his two decades of successfully recruiting top talent around the world, [the partner] is excited to now offer a boutique search experience — taking a hands-on approach from start to finish,” his website reads. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wk60NU"&gt;To Feighan, the move is just further proof of why he needed to come forward. “I’m not the first person this has happened to, but hopefully I can be the last,” he says. “Paul Daversa has had 20 years to fix the culture, and nothing’s happened, until now.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c0jUpE"&gt;Daversa, for its part, categorically denies that there are widespread issues with the company culture. “Daversa Partners has always had strict policies and procedures designed to ensure a harassment free workplace,” a spokesperson said. “In the very small number of instances in which there were complaints about inappropriate behavior, they were immediately investigated, and if warranted by the facts, appropriate action was taken.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1gCJxm"&gt;The company has denied all allegations in the lawsuit as well as any liability with respect to the claims.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="p5WkYl"&gt;The spokesperson also said, “Our firm is committed to providing a workplace that is free of all forms of harassment and has strict policies in place to that effect – we expect everyone at the firm to operate with the same high ethical standards and integrity that we demand of ourselves and that we look for in the c-suite executives, board members and others the firm has recruited for some of the most high-profile and successful businesses in the country.” They called the lawsuit an attempted shakedown with no basis in reality. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google One VPN expands internationally to Canada, Mexico, UK, and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wWCYcNMAlfckDPh_8lLfrDBjNgM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69704275/mdoying_180117_2249_0208stills.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ILtOaQ"&gt;Google is expanding the VPN service that it provides as part of its Google One subscription to seven new countries: Mexico, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/08/09/google-one-vpn-countries/"&gt;as spotted by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UHblK0"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21541032/google-one-vpn-cloud-storage-subscription"&gt;started offering VPN access&lt;/a&gt; to 2TB Google One cloud storage subscribers in the US late last year, as a free addition to the existing $9.99 / month plan. But today’s announcement sees a marked expansion of the service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="JskKOC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Google is bringing its own VPN to desktops and phones with $9.99 Google One subscription","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21541032/google-one-vpn-cloud-storage-subscription"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="upohwC"&gt;There are a few limitations that separate Google One from more comprehensive VPN solutions. First off, you’ll only be able to use the service in one of the supported countries — the company’s support page notes that “you won’t be able to connect to VPN by Google One if you are traveling to an unsupported country.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAhkDJ"&gt;And, much like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22573519/apple-private-relay-icloud-plus-ios-15-ipados-macos-monterey-how-to"&gt;Apple’s upcoming iCloud Plus VPN service&lt;/a&gt;, the Google One VPN won’t enable one of the most popular uses of a VPN: accessing content from a different country or region by assigning an IP address from that area. Rather, Google’s system will “assign you an IP address based on your current country so that websites can show you the right content for your region,” although Google notes that it still will prevent tracking to your specific city or area. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bXp3LM"&gt;The newly expanded Google One VPN is still only available on Android devices, however. Last year, Google said that it would be expanding availability to platforms like iOS, Windows, and Mac “in the coming months,” but there’s no news on that front yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZbPDU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CFpyrt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A NASA scientist explains why the weather is becoming more extreme</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-WEATHER-STORM" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wYt38mNnbOW3nhiPY4_LPl4iHdU=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69704253/840653818.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A view of the Houston skyline after heavy rains broke during the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey August 29, 2017.&amp;nbsp;Harvey, swirling for days off Texas and Louisiana, dumped more than 49 inches (124.5 centimeters) of rain on the region.  | Photo credit should read BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;We’re headed into ‘uncharted territory’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="PDobDZ"&gt;Across China and Western Europe in July, the amount of rain that might typically fall over several months to a year came down within a matter of days, triggering &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22607996/flood-risk-satellite-data-nature-study"&gt;floods&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/07/23/germany-floods-street-night/?utm_campaign=wp_post_most&amp;amp;utm_medium=email&amp;amp;utm_source=newsletter&amp;amp;wpisrc=nl_most&amp;amp;carta-url=https%3A%2F%2Fs2.washingtonpost.com%2Fcar-ln-tr%2F3437bdb%2F60fae7c39d2fda945a13beb7%2F596a4fb9ae7e8a0ef33cf3d7%2F11%2F70%2F60fae7c39d2fda945a13beb7"&gt;swept entire homes&lt;/a&gt; off their foundations. In June, the usually mild regions of Southwest Canada and the US’s Pacific Northwest saw temperatures that &lt;a href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2021/06/the-cool-lush-pacific-northwest-roasts-in-death-valley-like-temperatures/"&gt;rivaled highs in California’s Death Valley&lt;/a&gt; desert. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602208/june-heatwave-most-extreme-summer-record-north-america"&gt;severe heat&lt;/a&gt; was enough to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/5/22559961/heat-roads-washington-oregon-climate-infrastructure"&gt;buckle roads&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/dangerous-heat-wave-is-literally-melting-critical-infra-1847186624"&gt;melt power cables&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="7xyNxF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Humans are fueling more dangerous weather&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eeGg7A"&gt;Yesterday, a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;landmark United Nations report&lt;/a&gt; helped put those kinds of extreme events into context. By burning fossil fuels and releasing planet-heating greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, humans are fueling more dangerous weather. Researchers have been able to connect the dots between greenhouse gas emissions and climate change for decades. But the new report showcases a big leap forward in climate science: being able to tie the climate crisis directly to extreme weather events like the June heatwave, which would have been “virtually impossible” without climate change &lt;a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/"&gt;according to recent studies&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1kgIe"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;spoke with Alex Ruane, one of the authors of the new report and a research physical scientist at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies. He walks us through the phenomena that’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22613531/climate-change-united-nations-report-extreme-weather-ipcc"&gt;supercharging extreme weather events&lt;/a&gt;. And he explains why scientists have gotten so much better at seeing the “human footprint” in each weather disaster. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Et03sx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OZCCv5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The new United Nations report ties many changes in extreme weather to a more intense water cycle. What is the water cycle and how does it affect the weather?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="slIubg"&gt;The water cycle is basically the way that we track moisture moving through the climate system. So it includes everything from the oceans to the atmosphere, the clouds, ice, rivers, lakes, the groundwater, and the way that those things move and transfer moisture and water from place to place. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="China Henan Massive Evacuation" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RiwQ9a5ScPy1c_CzmwsYqtEq1BE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22772269/1234214409.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Feature China / Barcroft Media via Getty Images&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rescuers transfer citizens out of the flooded zone in a massive evacuation effort in Weihui city in central China’s Henan province on July 26th, 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="zOESaB"&gt;So when we’re talking about the intensification of the water cycle, we’re basically saying things are moving faster. Air is pulling the moisture out of the oceans and out of the land faster. It’s moving more moisture from place to place on the planet. And when it rains, it can come down hard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oFUGUy"&gt;The fundamental difference is that there is more energy in the system. There’s more heat. And as the temperature goes up, there is an overall increase in the amount of moisture that the air is trying to hold. So that means when a storm happens, there’s more moisture in the air to tap into for a big, heavy downpour. It also means that when air moves over a region, it has the potential to suck more moisture out of the ground more rapidly. So the same phenomenon is leading both to more intensive rainfalls and floods and precipitation, and also to more stark drought conditions when they do occur. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AI2mCS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How are people affected by those changes?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxYTEF"&gt;So, I personally live in New York City. We are affected by the water cycle, for example, when there’s a heavy downpour it can flood subway stations. It can lead to surface flooding in rivers and streets that can affect transportation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Nckm5j"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Heavy rain inundated New York City yesterday afternoon, partially submerging the 157th St Subway station in Washington Heights, footage shows.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A flash flood watch was in effect for New York City through Thursday night. &lt;a href="https://t.co/VqbyR3hM2q"&gt;pic.twitter.com/VqbyR3hM2q&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NPR (@NPR) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NPR/status/1413523611504218116?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 9, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OwNzj9"&gt;Other parts of the world have different engagements with the water cycle. They may be concerned about the snow fall or river floods that affect broad areas. And then of course huge parts of the world are concerned about drought. When we look at something like drought, it doesn’t just affect agriculture. It also affects ecosystems and urban parks. It affects water resources and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22573648/drought-california-power-grid-electricity-hydro-energy"&gt;infrastructure like power plants&lt;/a&gt; and roads and buildings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3uYyU0"&gt;So in all of these climate factors, we see that more than one sector is affected by these changes. We also see that if you take any specific thing that we care about, like agricultural fields, they are affected by more than just one type of climate change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bSH041"&gt;A specific set of climate conditions can lead to two extremes at the same time. So for example, heat and drought often go together because as conditions become drier, all of that sunshine, all of that energy, all of that heat goes into warming the air. That is a reinforcing cycle that can make hot and dry conditions even more extreme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKShTi"&gt;The big picture, as we’re seeing it, is that climate change is affecting all of the regions on Earth, with multiple types of climate changes already observed. And as the climate changes further, these shifts become more pronounced and widespread.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="78V3IH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I’ve read that “weather whiplash” is becoming more common because of climate change — what is “weather whiplash”?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x2hyqq"&gt;This idea that you can go from extreme to extreme very rapidly is giving society this sensation of a whiplash. This is part of the idea of an intensified water cycle. The water is moving faster, so when a wet condition comes it can be extremely wet. And then behind it could be a dry condition that can quickly get extremely dry. That type of shift from wet to dry conditions is something that we explore and understand in our climate models, but the lived experience of it can be quite jarring — and not just uncomfortable, but a direct challenge for ecosystems and other things that we care about in society. They really are connected in many cases to the same types of phenomenon, and this new report connects the dots between this phenomenon and our human footprint.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lRLTTl"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do scientists study how climate change affects extreme weather events? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftMcR6"&gt;There have been big steps forward in the methodologies and the scientific rigor of detection and attribution studies, which is another way of saying: understanding the human influence on these events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQQv2y"&gt;The basic idea behind the extreme event attribution is that we need to compare the likelihood that an event would have happened without human influences against the likelihood of that event happening, given that we have influenced the climate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxPJkm"&gt;We are able to use observational records and our models to look at what conditions were like before there was strong human influence. We look at what we call a preindustrial condition, before the Industrial Revolution and land use changes led to greenhouse gas emissions and other climate changes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="esuhrt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“A really exciting, cutting-edge field”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tdidUs"&gt;If we can understand how likely events would have been before we had our climate influences, and then compare it against the likelihoods today with those climate change influences factored in, that allows us to identify the increased chance of those events because of our influence. It allows us to attribute a human component of those extreme events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2FQVA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How have researchers gotten so much better at attributing extreme weather events to climate change?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQz0fY"&gt;This is a really exciting, cutting-edge field right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rxKe9"&gt;Methodological advances and several groups that have really taken this on as a major focus of their efforts have, in many ways, increased our ability and the speed at which we can make these types of connections. So that’s a big advantage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nd9vDW"&gt;Every year, the computational power is stronger in terms of what our models can do. We also use remote sensing to have a better set of observations in parts of the world where we don’t have weather stations. And we have models that are designed to integrate multiple types of observations into the same kind of physically coherent system, so that we can understand and fill in the gaps between those observations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="huEtaC"&gt;The other thing, of course, is when you look at any single attribution study, you get a piece of the picture. But what the new report does is bring them all into one place and assesses them together, and draw out larger messages. When you look at them all together, it is a much stronger and more compelling case than any one single event. And this is what the scientific community is showing us, that these things are part of a larger pattern of change that we have influenced.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A farmer walks back to his car between two barren fields once sown with row crops on July 23rd, 2021 in the town of Huron, California in California’s drought-stricken Central Valley. Before the drought, the fields were sown with hemp or garlic crops, but as a result of California’s water restrictions the farm decided not to plant.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="PVVhg9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What should we expect in the future when it comes to extreme weather? And what might we need to do to adapt?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="83S6Nh"&gt;First of all, it’s not like drought is a new phenomenon. There are parts of the world that are dealing with these conditions every day of the year. What we’re seeing, however, is that the overall set of expected conditions is moving into uncharted territory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HlBOVu"&gt;I want to emphasize it’s not just the record levels that we care about. We also care about the frequency by which these extremes occur, how long they last, the seasonal timing of when things like the last frost occurs, and also the spatial extent of extreme events — so where are conditions going to happen in the future that are outside of the observed experience of the last several generations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIoP5G"&gt;It is a set of challenges that we have to face in terms of how do we adapt or manage the risk of these changes. Also, how do we prepare knowing that they may come in combination or in overlapping ways, with more than one extreme event happening at the same time, or in the same season in a sequence, or potentially hitting different parts of the same market or commodities trade exchange or something like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="zoPziC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I still remain optimistic”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="NvfqKz"&gt;We are facing a situation where we have more information about these regional risks, but also know that every increment of climate change that occurs makes these changes more prominent. That sounds scary, but it also gives us agency. It gives us the ability to reduce these changes if we reduce emissions, and if we can eventually limit them to something like net zero — no total carbon emissions into the climate system. And in that sense, I still remain optimistic despite all this information that you’re seeing in the report about the changes that could come. The bottom line is we have the potential to reduce those changes, if we can get emissions under control.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>CyberDog is a new ominous-looking robot from Xiaomi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j1cbKwn1ypedl-5fVhVDapi-bIA=/0x52:2000x1385/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69704204/CyberDog_012.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qDHSVv"&gt;Chinese tech giant Xiaomi has unveiled a quadrupedal robot named CyberDog: an experimental, open-source machine that the firm says “holds unforetold possibilities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEiU8y"&gt;CyberDog is the latest example of tech companies embracing the quadrupedal form factor in robotics. The most notable example of the trend is Spot, a machine built by US firm Boston Dynamics. Spot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21292684/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-on-sale-price"&gt;went on sale last year&lt;/a&gt; for $74,500 and has been put to a range of uses, from &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/GbcDK7E9rVQ"&gt;surveying dangerous mines&lt;/a&gt; to helping doctors &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21231855/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-covid-19-coronavirus-telemedicine"&gt;connect with patients remotely&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also been tested by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299140/nypd-boston-dynamics-spot-robot-dog"&gt;both law enforcement&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22371590/boston-dynamics-spot-robot-military-exercises-french-army"&gt;and the military&lt;/a&gt;, though not as a weapon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="HkUo7e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Xiaomi says CyberDog has a “pet-like nature”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sl2YTv"&gt;It’s not clear what purpose Xiaomi envisions for CyberDog. In a press release, the company stressed the open-source nature of the machine’s design and that it would release only 1,000 units initially for “Xiaomi Fans, engineers, and robotic enthusiasts.” The company says it hopes these first users will “propel the development and potential of quadruped robots” and is pricing the robot to sell. The first 1,000 units will cost just 9,999 Yuan, or roughly $1,540 (though it’s not clear if this price will be the same for any future releases). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F1Tb6J"&gt;The same press release highlights CyberDog’s “pet-like nature,” including its ability to respond to voice commands and follow its owner like a real dog. Looking at pictures of CyberDog, though, it’s clear Xiaomi isn’t pitching the machine as a rival to Aibo, Sony’s own robot canine. While Aibo is small and cute, CyberDog is sleek and futuristic — even a little menacing. Renders of the machine make it look like the protagonist in a sci-fi TV show, pacing up stairs and appearing silhouetted in doorways. Inevitable comparisons to &lt;em&gt;Black Mirror&lt;/em&gt;’s “Metalhead” episode will be made, as they always are. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MRgGwN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10694343"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3PMLry"&gt;Xiaomi says CyberDog is nimble enough to perform backflips, can trot along at speeds of 3.2m/s (compared to Spot’s 3.9m/s), and weights 3kg (compared to Spot’s 5.2kg). CyberDog is powered by Nvidia’s Jetson Xavier AI platform and is equipped with an array of cameras and sensors. These include touch sensors, a GPS module, an ultra-wide-angle fisheye lens, and Intel’s RealSense D450 camera for depth-sensing. These components enable the robot to navigate semi-autonomously. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5yjEh"&gt;“CyberDog can analyze its surroundings in real-time, create navigational maps, plot its destination, and avoid obstacles. Coupled with human posture and face recognition tracking, CyberDog is capable of following its owner and darting around obstructions,” says Xiaomi. The machine can also respond to voice commands, including recognizing wake words and instructions, or it can be controlled using a connected smartphone app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qlTNxN"&gt;CyberDog also has three USB-C ports and one HDMI port, which Xiaomi says can be used to customize its hardware. The company suggests lidar sensors, panoramic cameras, and search lights could all be added to the robot. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s5gkTHk6jHTTN7KQPV3TTBxRQAs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22773144/CyberDog_05.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Xiaomi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Xiaomi’s CyberDog has a very similar design to Boston Dynamic’s Spot robot. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ug70ol"&gt;The release of CyberDog by Xiaomi is very interesting, though not necessarily as a product in its own right. Instead, it says a lot about the current robotics landscape and the accessibility of this tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Kpkt4b"&gt;Boston Dynamics popularized the quadrupedal format for robots, and companies around the world are now exploring exactly how and where such machines can be deployed effectively. The price of this hardware has been falling though, allowing for new use-cases to be explored. Earlier this year, Chinese robotics firm Unitree released a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22527413/tiny-robot-dog-unitree-robotics-go1"&gt;quadrupedal bot that cost just $2,700&lt;/a&gt;, and Xiaomi’s own CyberDog undercuts that again. Obviously, the capability of these machines will not be identical, but broader access to the technology will show whether it’s worth these firms pursuing at all. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gaming companies should avoid predatory designs, lawmakers say</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uXcE5CvGicISOUPBcyOAfzcraP0=/203x0:2405x1468/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69704078/lootbox.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8yqk4y"&gt;Democrats are calling on some of the largest gaming companies to better protect children by extending new UK design rules to children in the US. The regulations could ban companies from selling in-game loot boxes to minors, among other restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zrig6L"&gt;&lt;a href="https://trahan.house.gov/uploadedfiles/final_game_letters_-_combined.pdf"&gt;In letters to a dozen major gaming companies&lt;/a&gt;, including Blizzard, Epic Games, Microsoft, Nintendo, and Riot, Sen. Ed Markey (D-MA), Rep. Kathy Castor (D-FL), and Rep. Lori Trahan (D-MA) pressed executives to extend new UK design regulations to children in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GtOFw"&gt;“It is imperative that Congress acts with urgency to enact a strong privacy law for children and teens in the 21st century,” the lawmakers wrote. “As we work towards that goal, we urge you to extend to American children and teens any privacy enhancements that you implement to comply with the AADC.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zvVsVK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It is imperative that Congress acts with urgency to enact a strong privacy law for children”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BmSPE5"&gt;The new UK rules, called the “Age Appropriate Design Code,” are set to roll out next month, applying to social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram as well as games like &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt;. Specifically, the new rules force companies to design their products in the “best interests” of children, offer stricter privacy settings and policies for different age groups, and restrict “nudging techniques” often used to encourage users to continue using the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wdAClo"&gt;The UK law does not extend to children in the US, but in Tuesday’s letters, lawmakers called on the 12 companies to voluntarily apply these same protections to Americans. Notably, the lawmakers argued that the Entertainment Software Rating Board’s (ESRB) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18226852/loot-boxes-gaming-regulation-gambling-free-to-play"&gt;loot box guidance&lt;/a&gt; does not go far enough in protecting children from “manipulation” associated with these in-game purchases and that the companies should create stricter regulations in compliance with the new UK rules in the US.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G3IWwk"&gt;“The prevalence of micro-transactions—often encouraged through nudging— have led to high credit card bills for parents,” the lawmakers wrote. “Loot boxes go one step further, encouraging purchase before a child knows what the ‘bundle’ contains— akin to gambling.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkZZNV"&gt;The US already has some laws protecting children’s privacy — most notably the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, authored by Markey. But the law only applies to children under the age of 12. The UK rules extend to minors under the age of 18. Earlier this year, Castor reintroduced her &lt;a href="https://castor.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=403677"&gt;“Kids PRIVCY Act”&lt;/a&gt; which includes elements of the UK’s Age Appropriate Design Code. Specifically, the bill would prohibit behavioral ad targeting to children and force companies to design their products in the best interests of young people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q73Z38"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gmj8i7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
