    <title>Elizabeth Holmes admits that she was CEO of Theranos, the company she founded</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Getty&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘The buck stops with you?’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="nXqFyi"&gt;No one was more invested in Theranos than CEO and founder Elizabeth Holmes, she testified today. She owned the most stock. She could even fire the entire board of directors — and basically anyone else at the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xykpPo"&gt;“Is that fair?” Prosecutor Robert Leach asked Holmes in his cross-examination. “The buck stops with you?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nn4Yru"&gt;“I felt that,” Holmes replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gBWopP"&gt;Holmes’ defense has mostly tried to lay blame elsewhere — lab directors, her co-defendant Sunny Balwani (who is being tried separately), marketing firm Chiat Day, and more. Holmes, who is standing trial for 11 counts of wire fraud, portrayed herself as a true believer in Theranos’ technology who was largely unaware of Theranos’ problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZxxFV4"&gt;In order to knock down that testimony, prosecutors got her to admit to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="eBxyWJ"&gt;Knowing Theranos was in a precarious financial situation in late 2013&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="VPELbl"&gt;Altering the text of reports Theranos had written for drug companies, in addition to adding logos to them, before sending them to Walgreens, investors, and journalist Roger Parloff&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2nreYh"&gt;Trying to control &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reporter John Carreyrou’s experience at a Theranos wellness center and attempting to kill his story by emailing the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;’s owner, Rupert Murdoch, who happened to be a Theranos investor&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NqNbWw"&gt;Sending the law firm Boies Schiller Flexner after Carreyrou’s sources&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NDrn9t"&gt;Having lawyers review the language on Theranos’ website, then ignoring their suggestions in slide decks presented to investors afterwards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ubvj9S"&gt;Asking Balwani to leave the company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gPI0mr"&gt;Cash rules everything around me&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="muAv2P"&gt;Today, jurors stared deeply at an Excel sheet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5bgeSn"&gt;In August 2013, Theranos was running out of money. The company had to repay money to Blue Cross Blue Shield because Theranos hadn’t satisfied the conditions of a contract. On the week of September 23, 2013, Theranos had about $14.5 million left in free cash. The company had an intense burn rate and was nearly out of money, prosecutor Leach suggested. “I never thought of it like that,” Holmes replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBeZdN"&gt;A week later, Theranos raised $21.9 million from investors, but the cash crunch hadn’t ended. In December 2013, Balwani texted Holmes to warn her that they were down to $15 million in free cash. “I saw that,” she replied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vF87F"&gt;Motive established: Theranos needed money, fast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QsGXcq"&gt;A little editing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="gEPbaP"&gt;In her direct testimony, Holmes admitted that she’d added &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760601/theranos-pfizer-schering-plough-logo-memo"&gt;logos to the reports&lt;/a&gt; Theranos prepared for drug companies before sending them to Walgreens, investors, and others. Earlier in the trial, we heard testimony that these recipients thought the logos meant that the reports hadn’t been prepared by Theranos. During her direct exam, Holmes said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/23/22799756/elizabeth-holmes-pfizer-logo-confession"&gt;adding those logos was an honest mistake&lt;/a&gt;, and she only wanted to convey the partnership. She said she regretted that people had been fooled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yWReme"&gt;Today, we were shown excerpts of Theranos’ contracts with drug companies that &lt;em&gt;expressly forbid&lt;/em&gt; use of their logos without prior written permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="AjfS0f"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The logos weren’t all that changed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LUfqY7"&gt;But the logos weren’t all that changed. Snippets of text that might have made it easier to figure out the report was made &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; Pfizer instead of &lt;em&gt;by &lt;/em&gt;Pfizer was removed by Holmes. On a memo Holmes added a Schering-Plough logo to, some of the language in its conclusion section was changed to be even more flattering to Theranos. Asked if she regretted it, she was defiant: “I think this was accurately reflecting the data in the document,” Holmes said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QrzNjF"&gt;One document she sent out &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; come from a drug company — it was an analysis from GlaxoSmithKline. It, too, had been altered. The original, sent from GSK to Theranos, was a word document with no logo. Holmes added the logo. Someone also deleted one of the report’s conclusions, a bullet point that said “finger prick/blood draw procedure was difficult (needed larger lancet and better syringe system).”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DbmekI"&gt;Did Holmes make this deletion? She said she didn’t know. She didn’t know who at Theranos might have made those changes to the documents, she said. I found this difficult to believe, particularly since she’d owned some other changes on those documents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ly9BuC"&gt;Bad Blood&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Md4Nz3"&gt;When Theranos got wind of &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reporter John Carreyrou’s &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901"&gt;investigation into the company,&lt;/a&gt; Holmes and Balwani exchanged texts about him. They’d hired a firm, Fusion GPS, to do “oppo.” “Our oppo guy knows him well,” she texted Balwani. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eftXEK"&gt;“We’’ll get [a] killer package for when [we] meet with Carreyrou to turn this into our story,” she texted Balwani later. On the stand, Holmes said she didn’t know if that was a reference to work with Fusion GPS, but I honestly don’t know what else it could be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="78CADp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;She appealed to a major Theranos investor: Rupert Murdoch&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="l1RD0k"&gt;“Need to get ahead of all of it,” Holmes texted Balwani. Holmes was shown this text and asked if she remembered she was trying to get ahead of the story. She said it didn’t refresh her memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XAq4Gf"&gt;The attempts to control Carreyrou’s reporting didn’t stop there. Holmes and Balwani texted about Carreyrou’s plans to visit a Theranos wellness center and debated whether they should intervene to make sure he didn’t get a fingerstick test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O2hH7p"&gt;Then, just for fun, we read some texts where Balwani and Holmes mocked Carreyrou for being French. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4SCH0A"&gt;When Holmes’ attempts to kill Carreyrou’s stories didn’t work, she appealed to a major Theranos investor: Rupert Murdoch. (Murdoch owns the &lt;em&gt;WSJ &lt;/em&gt;and, incidentally, is the inspiration for the menacing patriarch Logan Roy on the excellent television show &lt;em&gt;Succession&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; She emailed him, with a document attached, trying to get him to broker a meeting between a senior &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; staffer and Theranos’ lawyers. “I’ve also attached the material Theranos has shared with &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; (responsive to questions from John Carreryrou) since the materials I gave you in July…. I thought that were I in your shoes I would want to know/be in the loop,” she wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x1qhjp"&gt;Holmes did not succeed in killing Carreyrou’s story. Shortly after it ran, she went on Jim Cramer’s show, &lt;em&gt;Mad Money&lt;/em&gt;, to deny its central claims — so we watched the clip in court. “Every test we run on our laboratory can run on our proprietary devices,” Holmes told Cramer. This was not true — only 12 tests, even fewer than the 15 Carreyrou initially reported, ran on Theranos devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwFtyS"&gt;Holmes was motionless as she watched the video, except for occasionally pressing her lips together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="OgpERH"&gt;Retaliation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Tz7H4o"&gt;In Holmes’ and Balwani’s efforts to get ahead of the story, Balwani tried to figure out who Carreyrou’s sources were. “Down to 5 people. We’ll nail this motherfucker,” Balwani texted Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Cmo367"&gt;“Who do u think,” she replied. “Now we have legal grounds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="L7Soux"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Theranos will consider all appropriate remedies, including filing suit against you.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eLg6ZE"&gt;Asked about this in court, Holmes claimed — not especially convincingly — that she and Balwani were talking about who’d left Theranos some bad reviews on Glassdoor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yo4D9o"&gt;Balwani texted Holmes, correctly, that Carreyrou’s sources were “Tyler [Shultz], Erika [Cheung] and Adam [Rosendorff].” Holmes didn’t &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676789/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-wire-fraud-erika-cheung-whistleblower"&gt;ask who Cheung was,&lt;/a&gt; though they’d barely interacted. In fact,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22674657/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-wire-fraud-financial-witness"&gt; the issues Cheung raised &lt;/a&gt;were the same ones regulators later found in the Theranos lab, Holmes admitted. “I sure as hell wish we treated her differently,” Holmes said of Cheung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ATEcQe"&gt;Cheung was tailed and served with a threatening letter from Theranos’ lawyers, Boies Schiller. The letter instructed her to “cease and desist from these activities…. Theranos will consider all appropriate remedies, including filing suit against you.” Holmes denied that this was threatening and said she was only trying to protect trade secrets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yxSMtn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-whistleblower-shook-the-companyand-his-family-1479335963"&gt;Shultz was surprised at his grandfather’s house&lt;/a&gt; by Boies Schiller lawyers, though Holmes denied she’d meant to “ambush” him. Shultz’s grandfather, George, was also a Holmes mentor and sat on her board of directors. He called her, angrily, about the ambush. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Qs2PNf"&gt;“Better”&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BVNbVR"&gt;In 2013, Holmes hired a lawyer to review Theranos’ marketing materials just before the Walgreens launch. “I haven’t quite worked my way through the whole website, but I’m worried,” the lawyer emailed Holmes. “For example, every time you say ‘better’ without specifying what it is better than, you are making a comparative claim, at least to all market leaders. You must be able to substantiate these claims.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wJ8aHx"&gt;We saw a proposed list of language changes: replacing “highest quality” with “high quality,” “highest levels of accuracy” with “high levels of accuracy,” and “more precise” to “precise.” Lawyers also suggested making sure Holmes substantiated several claims on the site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="WeeLVM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;It seems she ignored the lawyers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pKfvHm"&gt;But when she wanted more money from investors, it seems she ignored the lawyers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzyuBk"&gt;About three months later, Holmes sent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22786461/elizabeth-holmes-theranos-trial-brian-grossman-pfm-investor-testimony"&gt;PFM Management’s Bryan Grossman&lt;/a&gt; a Powerpoint presentation. “Theranos provides the highest level of oversight, automation and standardization,” one slide said. Another said Theranos tests had the  “highest levels of accuracy.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CkHeap"&gt;Around the same time, Lisa Peterson — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22747918/theranos-devos-due-diligence-fraud-trial"&gt;who worked for the DeVos family office&lt;/a&gt; and ultimately led an investment in Theranos— received a Powerpoint said that Theranos’ high-complexity lab “requires the highest level of training.” It also contained information about Theranos’ proficiency testing, but didn’t mention that testing all took place on conventional machines. Holmes said she didn’t remember discussing the slide, but that she didn’t mention modified conventional machines with any investors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="aTIw84"&gt;Balwani texts&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ekDqRV"&gt;We saw a lot of texts between Holmes and Balwani. The least successful use of those texts was to try to cast doubt on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22809049/elizabeth-holmes-sunny-balwani-abuse-fraud"&gt;Holmes’ claims that Balwani abused her&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tcsEM8"&gt;The prosecution delved into Holmes and Balwani’s relationship, bringing Holmes to tears on the stand twice. Though he hadn’t told her to lie to investors or anyone else, she said that his treatment affected “everything about who I was.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="XTVFk7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think I was asking permission to see my friends.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uU7nBf"&gt;That seemed particularly evident when she testified that, despite being Balwani’s boss at Theranos, she had to get his approval to live her life. In one text, she asked him if it would be okay for her to see friends in the morning, as long as she was home by 11AM. “I think I was asking permission to see my friends,” Holmes said. “I often tried to ask him if it would be okay if I could see a friend before going to the office or going to a work meeting.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KfsLHP"&gt;“Do you know how many times the word ‘love’ appears in these texts?” Leach asked. She did not, but said she wasn’t surprised to hear it was 594 times. He then instructed her to read some tender exchanges to the court. Mixed in with the affection was business, as when Balwani texted her that he was “worried about your ‘all fingersticks on our technology comment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuHdUv"&gt;It was hard to tell what the jury made of all this, though I saw a few jurors shifting in their seats during this segment of testimony. It turned my stomach — and gave the defense a serious opening to challenge the prosecution’s overreach. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QkZ27R"&gt;Some of Holmes’ testimony did actually bolster the prosecution’s case. She said she sometimes gave Balwani direction, that he was an at-will employee, and that she could have fired him at any time. As for his exit at Theranos, “I asked him to leave,” Holmes said. She said that her disillusionment with him after a lab audit turned up lots of problems was part of what prompted her to end their relationship.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2hkUfd"&gt;Who is Elizabeth Holmes?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="agDC2w"&gt;The portrait painted on the cross-examination showed a CEO who was in control of her company, and who was actively working to make sure that its presentation to the world was what she wanted it to be. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AFpoXS"&gt;On direct examination, we were told that Holmes was young and naive. She’d made some mistakes, sure, but she’d also delegated to a lot of experts. Besides, those mistakes weren’t really criminal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8rcNRy"&gt;Today we saw someone else — someone who was in firm control of Theranos and wanted to make its story larger than life. We saw memos Holmes doctored to make Theranos more appealing. We read her texts and emails, where she tried to kill an unflattering news story. She also tried to punish the story’s sources when she couldn’t get to the reporter. Despite hiring lawyers to review her language, she ignored their advice when she made investor presentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="7MCmAA"&gt;The jury will soon decide whether Holmes is guilty of fraud. What’s no longer up for debate? She was pulling the strings at Theranos.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is selling ugly Windows sweaters again, and this time, it’s Minesweeper</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/G6MTwvIZyRFLnDl90nToW4trz_w=/0x334:2000x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70212345/Downloads_TeamsBackgrounds.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jSDoGm"&gt;Microsoft has launched a new Windows software-themed ugly sweater on its &lt;a href="https://gear.xbox.com/pages/windows"&gt;Xbox Gear Shop&lt;/a&gt; dedicated to the infamous Windows game &lt;em&gt;Minesweeper.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Sd2Ed1"&gt;It’s well done: not only is the whole &lt;em&gt;Minesweeper&lt;/em&gt; level shaped like a Christmas tree, but it’s also got mines masquerading as snowflakes and “buttons” to minimize the window or exit the game if you so desire, plus the classic wavy Windows logo that hearkens back to Windows 3.1. (If you’re wondering why the sweater has “1990” remaining mines, that’s a reference to the year &lt;em&gt;Minesweeper&lt;/em&gt; first came out.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FCEnxn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Whatchu know about Minesweeper? &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/UglyChristmasSweater?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#UglyChristmasSweater&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WindowsUglySweater?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#WindowsUglySweater&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/nWnn42uyw2"&gt;pic.twitter.com/nWnn42uyw2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/1465452689974861826?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T5GNSb"&gt;This is Microsoft’s second year of Windows-themed ugly sweaters. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21779499/microsoft-windows-ugly-sweater-paint-xp-95-girls-who-code"&gt;Last year&lt;/a&gt;, the company released three ugly sweater designs, including one garment based on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18512247/microsoft-paint-windows-10-app-comments"&gt;timeless&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;MS Paint&lt;/em&gt; application, which humorously looked as if it were designed in that very app. In 2020, Microsoft donated a portion of the proceeds from each sweater to Girls Who Code; this year, the company appears to be giving a lump sum of $100,000 to the &lt;a href="https://ablegamers.networkforgood.com/projects/82475-the-ablegamers-charity"&gt;&lt;em&gt;AbleGamers&lt;/em&gt; charity&lt;/a&gt; for gamers with disabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jiBCW6"&gt;Microsoft is selling the &lt;em&gt;Minesweeper&lt;/em&gt; ugly sweater for the explosive price of $74.99 — $5 more expensive than last year’s designs. The sweaters &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-buy-microsoft-paint-holiday-sweaters-2020-12"&gt;sold out in 24 hours&lt;/a&gt; last year with a late December restock, so if you want to look like a pro at flagging mines this holiday, then &lt;a href="https://gear.xbox.com/products/microsoft-windows-minesweeper-sweater"&gt;get one soon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Edge users aren’t happy about Microsoft’s built-in ‘buy now, pay later’ tool</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C8LbkY2zGtKz8MzRxB44-oL8l_M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70212337/acastro_200207_3900_Edge_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4kB5NU"&gt;Microsoft is tacking on a “buy now, pay later” extension to Edge that prompts users to use short-term financing service &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fzip.co%2Fus&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F11%2F30%2F22810595%2Fmicrosoft-edge-zip-buy-now-pay-later" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Zip&lt;/a&gt; (formerly QuadPay) when making a purchase on the browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SR1VEb"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The option to sign up and use Zip will appear on checkout pages&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M2KKE5"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/introducing-buy-now-pay-later-in-microsoft-edge/m-p/2967030"&gt;company introduced the service&lt;/a&gt; earlier this month, and now some users are reportedly seeing it integrated into their browsers after updating to Edge version 96, as noted by &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/11/microsoft-plans-to-integrate-a-buy-now-pay-later-app-into-edge/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The option to sign up and use Zip will be displayed on checkout pages, appearing in the same area where you’d enter your credit card number on Edge (or access a previously used one), and will sometimes be ingrained in the checkout page itself. Zip will pop up when Edge detects that your purchase costs between $35 and $1,000, the price range that the service can cover.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HVZhY"&gt;While Zip lets you make purchases without spending anything upfront, this comes in exchange for four interest-free payments over a six-week period. Even still, the service technically isn’t free — it charges $1 for every payment you make, meaning you’ll end up spending $4 more on your purchase, no matter the price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OPDNp5"&gt;Edge will give you the option to pay through Zip by default, whether the store even offers the option or not. On a &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/buy-now-pay-later-in-microsoft-edge-4f7db926-7bc8-4a9e-bd2d-d0831bc3038f"&gt;Microsoft support&lt;/a&gt; page, the company indicates that merchants will actually have to contact Microsoft if they don’t want customers using the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CwzTO0"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Microsoft added Buy Now Pay Later into Edge (and so Windows 10 and 11 base OS), a thing which is known to be abused to harm people. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tags on the post on Microsoft’s website say it all. Keep speaking out. &lt;a href="https://t.co/wsujv2VdWN"&gt;pic.twitter.com/wsujv2VdWN&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kevin Beaumont (@GossiTheDog) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1465613506376613894?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2rbmhj"&gt;The feature has come under heavy criticism, with some users upset about the extra bloatware &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/introducing-buy-now-pay-later-in-microsoft-edge/m-p/2980646/highlight/true#M6061"&gt;slowing down their browsing experience&lt;/a&gt; and others concerned about the &lt;a href="https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/articles/introducing-buy-now-pay-later-in-microsoft-edge/m-p/2978607/highlight/true#M6050"&gt;potential financial ramifications&lt;/a&gt; on users, especially for those who struggle to manage their credit. “Buy now, pay later” services have also &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/11/18/criminals-exploit-buy-now-pay-later-services-like-klarna-and-afterpay.html"&gt;been a target for criminals&lt;/a&gt;, who can exploit them to score free goods, as they typically don’t check credit scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AfP5wE"&gt;Plus, Edge already has built-in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575038/microsoft-edge-coupons-promo-codes-feature-pdf-annotation-screenshot-inking"&gt;promo code and coupon alerts&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/8/21507374/microsoft-edge-price-comparisons-screenshot-tool-features"&gt;product price comparisons&lt;/a&gt; that pop up while you’re shopping. Microsoft even goes out of its way to explain that it doesn’t collect a fee for using Zip, so it’s unclear why the company is opting both buyers and sellers into an offer no one asked for.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon faces new pressure over COVID protections in warehouses</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Protesters Strike On Essentials Workers Rights Outside An Amazon Facility" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xECE2lm1DJCU5h7cXklT-9k7H8o=/0x0:6720x4480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70212230/1211474779.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amazon workers protested outside a warehouse last year | Spencer Platt / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DtAefE"&gt;Amazon is facing new questions over failed COVID protections in its fulfillment centers, spurred on by New York Attorney General Letitia James. After more than a year of protests from workers and inquiries from legislators, James is now seeking a court order to require Amazon to appoint a monitor to oversee health and safety measures at its warehouse on Staten Island. As part of the same motion, James asked the company to reinstate fired worker Christian Smalls, who led public protests against Amazon last year, accusing the company of failing to keep employees from contracting the virus at work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fgSbGP"&gt;According to James, Amazon has rolled back many of its health and safety measures at the warehouse, known as JFK8. The Staten Island warehouse, which employs roughly 5,000 people, has been the site of an ongoing tug of war between Amazon and its employees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J18lhp"&gt;“Amazon and its leadership banked billions of dollars during the COVID-19 pandemic, and as the crisis rages on, the health and concerns of the workers continue to be ignored,” James &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-seeks-emergency-relief-protect-rights-and-safety-amazon"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Amazon must guarantee a work environment that promotes safety, transparency, and respect for its hardworking employees, not one that further endangers them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ftQV0Z"&gt;In February, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/12/22279819/amazon-new-york-ag-state-lawsuit-covid-19-warehouse-conditions-pandemic"&gt;Amazon pre-emptively sued the New York AG’s office&lt;/a&gt;, saying the office lacked the legal authority to demand legal remedies for the company’s handling of COVID-19 conditions at JFK8. James’ office &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287204/new-york-amazon-lawsuit-worker-safety-failures"&gt;filed suit against the company&lt;/a&gt; four days later, alleging Amazon failed to protect its warehouse employees in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic and retaliated against workers who raised concerns about what they viewed as insufficient safety measures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FpGYSa"&gt;Workers at Amazon’s JKF8 warehouse said in March 2020 that they didn’t have enough &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199942/amazon-warehouse-coronavirus-covid-new-york-protest-walkout"&gt;protective equipment&lt;/a&gt; and were not informed if their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/26/21194739/amazon-warehouse-workers-coronavirus-covid-19-outraged-informed"&gt;co-workers tested positive&lt;/a&gt; for the coronavirus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="BZmus8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Warehouse workers are forcing Amazon to take COVID-19 seriously","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/10/21216172/amazon-coronavirus-protests-response-safety-jfk8-fired-covid-19"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XJ6PIL"&gt;Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21233891/amazon-coronavirus-protest-sick-out-tech-workers-climate-justice"&gt;fired several workers who protested&lt;/a&gt; the conditions, including Smalls, after the workers staged public protests. &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/technology/amazon-coronavirus-whistleblowers.html"&gt;Amazon said at the time&lt;/a&gt; that Smalls and the other workers were not fired for protesting but for violating social distancing rules. James sought an investigation by the National Labor Relations Board, calling Smalls’ firing “disgraceful.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7gkiXm"&gt;James says in the latest motion, filed in New York’s state Supreme Court, that Amazon “unlawfully fired and disciplined workers who reported their concerns about the company’s compliance with these health and safety mandates, including Christian Smalls.” James is also seeking a court order to reinstate Smalls on an interim basis, pending the outcome of the lawsuit. The suit claims Smalls’ firing served as intimidation to other employees who may be afraid to come forward with additional concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1goff"&gt;James also alleges that Amazon violated state law when it failed to conduct adequate cleaning protocols, according to an investigation by her office, and that its contact tracing program failed to identify workers who had come into contact with others who tested positive for the virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HKyDFS"&gt;The motion asks the court to order Amazon to change how it monitors employees’ productivity to allow time for cleaning and social distancing and require the company to adopt adequate disinfection protocols when an infected worker has been in the facility. The AG’s office also wants the company to institute better COVID-19 contact tracing protocols, which would include notifying close contacts of infected workers. The suit seeks to have a court-appointed monitor oversee these changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kTl1yD"&gt;Amazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the company had incurred more than $15 billion in costs as part of a “comprehensive approach to COVID-19 safety” measures, to support customers and employees. “It’s disappointing that the Attorney General is seeking to politicize the pandemic by asking for ‘emergency’ relief now despite having filed this lawsuit nine months ago,” Nantel continued, adding that the company had “listened to and learned from the experts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RzpCJx"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update: November 30th 7:11 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds statement from Amazon spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip is here to power the Android flagships of 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-FP9dyJyaIVdY_TvNUruvjV_Cx0=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70212202/Snapdragon_8_Gen_1_Mobile_Platform__Key_Visual__Angle_2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SuNSYq"&gt;Qualcomm has a new flagship smartphone processor: the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, announced at the company’s annual Snapdragon Tech Summit, giving an early preview at the brains behind the most powerful smartphones of 2022. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I9IvvH"&gt;The successor to last year’s Snapdragon 888, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is the first chipset to bear Qualcomm’s new naming scheme (which the company had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/22/22796541/qualcomm-snapdragon-branding-naming-scheme-changes-updates"&gt;previously teased last week&lt;/a&gt;), ditching the triple-digit numbering system that Qualcomm has previously used for new, generation-based monikers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cB2M3v"&gt;As is the case every year, Qualcomm is promising some major improvements in the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, with better performance, camera technology, AI capabilities, security, and 5G. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="u2juAI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;20 percent better CPU performance and up to 30 percent CPU power efficiency&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Od6QyN"&gt;Let’s start with the hard specs. As expected, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is the first chip from Qualcomm to use the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22448107/arm-armv9-architecure-cortex-x2-a710-cpu-mali-g710-gpu-android-2022-designs"&gt;latest Armv9 architecture from Arm&lt;/a&gt;. Specifically, the new eight-core Kryo CPU will feature a single prime core based on the Cortex-X2 at 3.0GHz, along with three performance cores based on Cortex-A710 at 2.5GHz, and a quartet of efficiency cores based on the Cortex-A510 design at 1.8GHz. Additionally, the new chip jumps to a 4nm process, from the 5nm process on which the Snapdragon 888 was built. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HJ3LTB"&gt;All told, Qualcomm promises that the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 will offer up to 20 percent better performance and up to 30 percent more power efficiency over last year’s model. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYm24t"&gt;Meanwhile, the new Adreno GPU (much like the Gen 1’s Kryo CPU, Qualcomm didn’t give a specific number for the updated hardware here) promises to offer 30 percent faster graphics rendering, in addition to 25 percent better power efficiency compared to the Snapdragon 888. It’ll also offer a new GPU control panel for fine-tuning how games are running on your phone. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X4juexRZOAnmC4QbR2ZCXAq0eqc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053637/Snapdragon_8_Gen_1_Block_Diagram.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Qualcomm&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OkrJfj"&gt;Making its debut on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274127/qualcomm-x65-5g-modem-10gbps-speeds-ai-tuning-software-updates"&gt;Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X65 modem&lt;/a&gt;, which promises a whole suite of 5G features and firsts. As Qualcomm’s fourth-generation 5G modem, it builds on the existing mmWave and sub-6GHz compatibility that came before, adding support for up to 10Gbps speeds and the latest 3GPP Release 16 specification. As is always the case, you almost certainly won’t actually see that kind of speed in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A5nkUO"&gt;The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 also supports Wi-Fi 6 and Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth LE Audio (a first for Qualcomm), and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22652655/qualcomm-aptx-lossless-announced-snapdragon-sound"&gt;company’s Snapdragon Sound technology&lt;/a&gt; for enabling AptX Lossless wireless audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="wzUiT6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;18-bit RAW photos and 8K HDR video — if your camera can handle it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9bnlut"&gt;As is traditional for Qualcomm’s top-tier processor, the company is putting a big emphasis on its beefed-up camera capabilities, which the company is bundling together for the first time under a new “Snapdragon Sight” brand. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RMw4vp"&gt;While the Spectra ISP is once again a triple ISP system, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 upgrades things up to an 18-bit system (up from 14 bits on the 888). That translates to 4,096 times more camera data and up to four additional stops of dynamic range for very bright or very dark scenarios. The triple ISP (image signal processor) also allows for things like shooting 240 12-megapixel photos in a single second or simultaneously shooting in 8K with HDR while snapping 64-megapixel stills thanks to an increased 3.2-gigapixel per second throughput.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxZitX"&gt;Qualcomm is also offering more high-end camera features out of the box, including support for shooting in 8K video with HDR 10 Plus and shooting in 18-bit RAW (assuming your phone has the camera hardware to actually pull it off). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uxU45a"&gt;The 8 Gen 1 also features a variety of other imaging improvements, including better dark mode pictures that can use data from up to 30 images in a single shot (up from six images on the 888). There’s also a host of better AI processing techniques, with improved auto-exposure, auto-focus, and auto-face detection technology, a dedicated “bokeh engine” for adding portrait effects to 4K video, and an “ultrawide engine” that can de-warp and remove chromatic aberrations from shots. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WcfdqVR73HgJz6eUJCWh9VGLo2Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053641/Snapdragon_8_Gen_1_Chip_Image.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="3IESWU"&gt;Qualcomm is also adding a &lt;em&gt;fourth&lt;/em&gt; ISP, located in the dedicated sensing hub on the SoC: unlike the triple ISP for the primary camera, the new ISP is designed specifically to power an always-on camera that’s active at all times. Qualcomm has some big ambitions for what developers can do with the always-on camera, like automatically shutting off your screen when you put your phone down or if it detects someone trying to read over your shoulder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MR5cbn"&gt;And while the idea of an always-on camera raises some obvious security concerns, Qualcomm argues that the feature is intended to help make using your device &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; secure, with any camera data for the always-on camera staying locally on-device in the chip’s secure enclave. Additionally, customers will be able to opt in to using the always-on camera, much in the same way that they can choose whether to use an always-listening microphone feature for voice assistants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w34JYb"&gt;Still, though, the added capability — and how manufacturers implement it into their devices, if they do at all — will be something to watch when the first chips with the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 roll out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O377mH"&gt;On the AI side of things, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 features Qualcomm’s latest Hexagon processor, with its seventh-generation AI engine, which the company says is four times faster than its predecessor and up to 1.7 times more power efficient. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5wTFjT"&gt;The company showed off a variety of use cases that the boosted AI performance can enable, including the aforementioned camera functionality, a “Leica Leitz Look mode” that emulates Leica lens effects, and improved detection of where you’re holding your phone for optimizing antenna performance. Additionally, Qualcomm is adding AI-powered sampling to offer a DLSS-style effect for improving mobile games, something that it says will happen automatically when gaming on the 8 Gen 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VpVaCh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Four times better AI performance compared to last year’s model&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IyRwV5"&gt;Lastly, there are security improvements. The Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 adds a new hardware-level layer of security with a “dedicated Trust Management Engine,” in addition to offering support for the &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/android/security/android-ready-se"&gt;Android Ready SE standard&lt;/a&gt;, enabling support for digital car keys, driver’s licenses, IDs, and e-money wallets. There’s also built-in iSIM support for directly connecting to cellular networks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T9agPT"&gt;Despite the new branding, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 doesn’t appear to break the mold for Qualcomm’s chips, offering the usual generational upgrades we’ve come to expect from the company’s annual flagships. Still, in a world where bespoke chips like Google’s Tensor or Apple’s A-series processors are becoming increasingly popular, it’s good to see that Qualcomm has no intention of slowing the pace on its own top chips, even as the competition heats up. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ouwCZ"&gt;And with the first Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 smartphones expected before the end of 2021, it won’t be long before we’ll be able to see just how powerful Qualcomm’s latest chip is for ourselves. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch will use machine learning to detect people evading bans</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/16eNsKt54O1UZ9ZhpX00mMGw_BQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70211930/acastro_210115_1777_twitch_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="juAUUW"&gt;Twitch is furthering its efforts to reduce harassment with a new tool that uses machine learning to detect people who may be attempting to evade bans. It’s the company’s latest addition to combat things &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22633874/how-to-stop-a-hate-raid-twitch-safety-tools"&gt;like hate raids&lt;/a&gt;, where streamers’ chats are overrun with trolls sending hateful messages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cnqbPd"&gt;The new tool, called Suspicious User Detection, can identify users as “likely” or “possible” people who have evaded bans from a streamer’s channel. The machine learning model powering the tool identifies potential evaders by evaluating things such as their behavior and characteristics about their account and compares that information against accounts that have been banned from a streamer’s channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="igfhpf"&gt;Messages from “likely” evaders won’t be sent to chat, but streamers and their mods can see them. Streamers and mods can choose to monitor a likely ban evader, which adds that user to a monitoring list and puts a message next to a user’s name noting the monitoring (as shown in the GIF below), or ban them. “Possible” evaders’ messages &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; appear in chat, but streamers / mods can opt to have those messages blocked from chat as well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-SN_bbBfuej_qF3jmpQ8Js_cam4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053645/Untitled.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HWio0w"&gt;Twitch says it will turn Suspicious User Detection on by default, but streamers can tweak or turn off the tool if they want. Streamers and mods can also manually select to monitor users of whom they are suspicious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YlEph8"&gt;“This tool was inspired in large part by community feedback around the need for better ways to curb ban evaders,” Alison Huffman, Twitch’s director of product for community health, said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “When we were speaking with mods about their pain points, we heard that it can be hard to distinguish whether a user who chatted something that violated their channel’s norms was a harmful, repeat harasser or just a newer viewer who hadn’t learned that channel’s customs yet. As such, we designed this tool to give mods and creators more information about potential ban evaders so they could make more efficient and informed decisions within their channel.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7LFFRt"&gt;Suspicious User Detection seems like it could make a difference in silencing hateful individuals, especially if used in tandem with recently introduced controls that let a streamer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700937/twitch-safety-tools-verification-phone-hate-raids"&gt;require phone or email verification&lt;/a&gt; for accounts participating in chat. But it remains to be seen how effective Suspicious User Detection actually will be in practice or if ban evaders can find ways to get around the tool.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vA50ax"&gt;Meta has delivered a new batch of features for Quest headsets &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=43993&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.oculus.com%2Fblog%2Fmixed-reality-made-easy-messenger-calling-cloud-backup-and-more-in-the-newest-oculus-software-update%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;in an update rolling out today&lt;/a&gt;. The changes include cloud backups, a mixed reality camera mode, and other settings that round out the Quest’s already impressive feature set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0QhHtn"&gt;I’m most excited about the cloud backups feature, which gives you a way to restore user-specific data to your apps, including game saves and headset settings, if you need to replace, update, or reset your Quest. This is one of those things that I’m surprised the Quest didn’t support already, and I found out the hard way that it didn’t a few weeks ago. Nevertheless, I’m glad that it’s here now. It can be activated within the “Device” tab in the settings menu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Quest mixed reality camera for Beat Saber" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FNeHizDsPGOHld4n_TnPN2CKSxM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053421/mixedrealitycamera.gif"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nilr6D"&gt;The mixed reality camera also seems really cool. Unlike the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440683/oculus-v29-live-overlay-mixed-reality-capture-mic-files-app"&gt;Live Overlay feature that arrived in v29&lt;/a&gt; that imposed your body over a first-person view of a game or app, the new feature lets you see yourself interacting in the game world from a third-person perspective, as seen through your phone’s camera. The GIF provided by Meta that we’ve embedded shows what the end result can look like. You’ll be able to see yourself in &lt;em&gt;Beat Saber&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;for example,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;striking blocks and dodging obstacles. Meta says that a dozen apps support the feature, including &lt;em&gt;Pistol Whip&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Superhot VR&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Synth Riders&lt;/em&gt;, but a total of just six &lt;a href="https://support.oculus.com/articles/in-vr-experiences/oculus-features/mobile-mixed-reality-camera?intern_source=blog&amp;amp;intern_content=mixed-reality-made-easy-messenger-calling-cloud-backup-and-more-in-the-newest-oculus-software-update"&gt;were listed at this page&lt;/a&gt; at the time of publishing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="i5hu4J"&gt;To use the mobile mixed reality camera feature, you need an iPhone XS or newer, running iOS 11 or higher. Support for Android phones and tablets was erroneously included in Meta’s support page for the feature, but it has since been removed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yDUm7c"&gt;The new software also changes where you’ll enable multiuser support, the feature that lets you add multiple Facebook accounts to the headset, and app sharing, which lets you share paid apps among those profiles. They were previously nested within the “experimental features” settings tab, but both are moving to the “Accounts” section of the settings menu. This new v35 software also lays the groundwork for using Messenger to make voice calls while you have the headset on, as well as adding new cosmetic items that can be used in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22629942/facebook-workrooms-horizon-oculus-vr"&gt;Horizon Workrooms&lt;/a&gt;, Meta’s take on a VR office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kjx3JB"&gt;The last note in Meta’s blog on the latest Quest software is that it now has a public test channel for its upcoming software. &lt;a href="https://support.oculus.com/articles/headsets-and-accessories/using-your-headset/quest-ptc?intern_source=blog&amp;amp;intern_content=mixed-reality-made-easy-messenger-calling-cloud-backup-and-more-in-the-newest-oculus-software-update"&gt;You can sign up for it here&lt;/a&gt; if you want to test new features earlier than the rest of us — although Meta says that you won’t be able to leave it after you join until a new public software update is released.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="QG8AMj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Will the Oculus Quest still require a Facebook account?

We’ve updated our post to reflect the changes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>These transparent Apple prototypes clearly show the greatness of see-through gadgets</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/axwYftqTABRQUzQluiXTwk4WCUs=/0x168:4030x2855/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70211546/FE5CyAvWUAQBTe0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/1nsane_dev/status/1463180368555782152?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;Giulio Zompetti&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Flm7ya"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611234/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-working-prototype"&gt;Apple device collector Giulio Zompetti&lt;/a&gt; has &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/1nsane_dev/status/1463180368555782152"&gt;photographed a prototype 29W Apple charging brick&lt;/a&gt;, and it may be one of the rare instances where the product-in-progress may look better than the final version. What makes it special is that you can literally see Apple’s design process because of the clear plastic shell, unlike the retail version where the internals are hidden by opaque white plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ws2aIQ"&gt;Zompetti also tweeted another clear prototype, a pair of AirPods that live up to the “Air” name. The retro-futuristic look of the densely packed electronics makes me wish Apple would actually sell see-through gadgets again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9kxFUv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="da" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AirPods?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, translucent prototype earbuds &lt;a href="https://t.co/zE4dt47H0J"&gt;pic.twitter.com/zE4dt47H0J&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Giulio Zompetti (@1nsane_dev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/1nsane_dev/status/1465690029611749380?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="QGcrea"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="fr" dir="ltr"&gt;29W Apple Charger prototype. &lt;a href="https://t.co/h2ZoHCMw0F"&gt;pic.twitter.com/h2ZoHCMw0F&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Giulio Zompetti (@1nsane_dev) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/1nsane_dev/status/1463180368555782152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;November 23, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U5WcHC"&gt;Transparent electronics were a (cool) fad in the 90s, with Apple’s own &lt;a href="https://sixcolors.com/post/2020/12/20-macs-for-2020-1-imac-g3/"&gt;iMac G3&lt;/a&gt; often being brought up by those reminiscing about the age of transparent or translucent electronics, &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nostalgia/comments/96k213/seethrough_electronics/"&gt;alongside the Nintendo 64&lt;/a&gt; and that &lt;a href="https://medium.com/slackjaw/gizmodo-product-review-1987s-unisonic-clear-telephone-model-6900-e885927a43f3"&gt;Unisonic clear landline phone&lt;/a&gt;. But the look does seem to be having a sort of revival: you can &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://dbrand.com/shop/special-edition/teardown" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;buy skins&lt;/a&gt; that make it look like you’ve done a transparent mod on your phone (without the risks that come with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEWO68Tegf8"&gt;scraping off the back panel’s paint or plastic&lt;/a&gt;), and companies like Nothing are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22598920/nothing-ear-1-earbuds-review-features-specs"&gt;releasing actually see-through gadgets&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not to mention the variety of after-market mods for consoles like &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/eXtremeRate-Transparent-Replacement-Nintendo-Switch-Controller/dp/B08M3GK34W?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt; that let you replace the device’s opaque plastic with a case that shows off the internals. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Twn0c-dBoERdfppSqd1NX8_jGMA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22746960/DSCF4386_Edited.JPG"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nothing’s Ear 1s look a lot like the prototype AirPods.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/R0FxS8jOPIItIlAZE20E8IbrWIk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23053567/0ry14gzswhl71.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reddit user Odellot posted a massive collection of see-through gadgets, including a PS5 and DualSense controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="q3sfhL"&gt;These days, it feels unlikely that Apple would actually sell whimsical clear devices — we can barely get colors on pro devices, and the Apple logo hasn’t started glowing again, despite the new MacBook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22751921/apple-macbook-pro-14-16-inch-2021-m1-pro-max-review"&gt;including a refreshed design&lt;/a&gt;. But I can hope that Apple will return to its roots if transparent devices start coming back in a big way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UZx7oE"&gt;So come on, Apple; your engineers do impressive work, which you &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tobL8U7dQo"&gt;love to show off in presentations&lt;/a&gt;. Why not let it see the light of day and make us feel like it’s the future again by giving us some transparent accessories? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sQhy9O"&gt;If you love seeing the internals of Apple devices, Zompetti also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611234/apple-airpower-wireless-charger-working-prototype"&gt;posted pictures of an AirPower prototype&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year, showing off some incredible circuitry. You can also check out &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/19/18263844/apple-iphone-prototype-m68-original-development-board-red"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s story on the original iPhone prototype&lt;/a&gt;, which looked more like a breadboard electronics project than the pocketable device it would eventually become. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Android 101: How to stop location tracking</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HQvSX9yTWz03Njmtu8yvH0Vksnc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67293304/acastro_180413_1777_android_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tJmXXh"&gt;Location tracking can be very handy — it’s convenient when an app can tell you, say, where the nearby restaurants or gas stations are — but &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/12/11/18136361/location-tracking-data-ad-targeting-facebook-google-amazon"&gt;it’s also a privacy issue&lt;/a&gt;. Do you want all your wanderings registered by Google? Are you comfortable knowing that Mark Zuckerberg’s minions know where you are at all times? (Well, not that Mark Zuckerberg has minions, but you know what I mean.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bwPknj"&gt;In this article, we’ll take a look at how to stop location tracking on your Android phone (and your Google account) and how to delete your location history from your OS and from some of the more popular apps. As always, note that versions of Android can differ, and many manufacturers use overlays as well, which can change the locations of various commands — but they should be similar enough for you to be able to find your way. For these instructions, I’ve used a Pixel 6 phone running Android 12, but I’ve included some directions for those with earlier versions of Android.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="UdeiEL"&gt;Stop Google from tracking you, period.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="GalrTP"&gt;You probably know that Google can track your location and movements through its Google Maps app. But you may not realize that your Android phone is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/13/17684660/google-turn-off-location-history-data"&gt;also tracking your movements and activities&lt;/a&gt; through several other built-in apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zSpFz7"&gt;If you really don’t want your phone to be tracking &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of your movements and activities, there is a way to turn tracking off for all (well, most) of them. You just need to be aware that you’re probably going to render many of your apps (such as ride-share apps, weather apps, and, of course, mapping apps) less usable — or in some cases, completely unusable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YQV4pE"&gt;Stop Google tracking using a browser&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="f1w8YB"&gt;First, we’re going to stop Google from saving your data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="D6SBL5"&gt;Go to &lt;a href="https://myactivity.google.com/"&gt;https://myactivity.google.com/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Y3tOjV"&gt;Under “My Google Activity” you’ll see the buttons for three types of activity: Web &amp;amp; App Activity, Location History, and YouTube History. You can visit each individually by selecting the appropriate button. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Under “My Google Activity” you’ll see the buttons for three types of activity: Web &amp;amp;amp; App Activity, Location History, and YouTube History." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vNlEIRVdlecEG9hYzOAPLrcWLJ4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23050931/Screen_Shot_2021_11_29_at_11.04.25_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Under “My Google Activity” you’ll see the buttons for three types of activity: Web &amp;amp; App Activity, Location History, and YouTube History.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="2IMZKs"&gt;A more efficient way, though, may be to go to Activity Controls, found in the left-hand menu. This page will show you all three controls on the same page; in addition, you can control ad personalization.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google’s activity controls lets you turn off tracking." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dDbZGFRqz3OJSGr82vH7VMLE43k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21814226/Screen_Shot_2020_08_25_at_10.20.43_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s activity controls let you turn off tracking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="DTFGM5"&gt;“Web &amp;amp; App Activity” covers anything you’ve done on Google apps and services. You can turn tracking off completely, or choose to keep it on but stop it from saving your history or activity when you use your Chrome browser. You can also turn off “Include audio recordings,” which determines if all your audio interactions with Google and / or Google Assistant are saved.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NRGVRM"&gt;The other relevant category is, of course, “Location History,” which saves information about where you’ve gone with your device. Also, look for “Devices on this account” and click the down icon to the right; you’ll get a list of all the devices that you have that are currently following your location — since that may include old phones that you are no longer using, this is a good thing to check.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="h9JK7M"&gt;We might as well mention that you can also disable your “YouTube History,” which includes both your search and watch history, and “Ad personalization,” which uses your history to choose which ads you’ll see. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="SU1Gqk"&gt;Okay — you’ve now prevented any more data from being gathered. But you may want to delete all or some of the information that’s already been collected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Y3nver"&gt;Go back to the My Activity page and click on “Delete activity by” in the left-hand menu. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZWp9Lb"&gt;You’ll get a pop-up window that lets you delete your activity based on time period: the last hour, last day, “All time” (in other words, all dates), or “Custom range” for a specific date range.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="A pop-up window that lets you delete your activity based on time period." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jq021IJ2xWeWo6x7ZTatZDVWECI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21812433/Screen_Shot_2020_08_24_at_1.52.20_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A pop-up window lets you delete your activity based on time period.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="30VGHh"&gt;If you choose “Custom range,” you’ll be able to choose a date range. If you choose “All time,” you can then filter that info depending on services (such as ads, Chrome, Google Play Store, etc.). When you’re ready, click on “Next.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="you can then filter that info depending on services" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0P0QV7y8a4U1yezCpuyKaBmGN28=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21812435/Screen_Shot_2020_08_24_at_1.55.34_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can filter your info depending on services.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="j0CjyY"&gt;You’ll then get a preview of some of the activities that will be deleted. If you’re okay with that, select “Delete.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The last step before you delete your activity." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/42gj2sstwsFo74UtupkqSE-pmfc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21812436/Screen_Shot_2020_08_24_at_1.58.42_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The last step before you delete your activity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OqvN1p"&gt;Incidentally, if you want to make sure that nobody but you can delete your histories, then select the “Manage activity” link under each category in Activity Controls, and look for “Manage My Activity verification.” If you enable that feature, Google will ask for a password any time you want to look at or delete any history in your account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HmJxHR"&gt;And if you don’t want to worry about manually deleting your stuff, you can enable auto-delete in each category (you’ll see the option within each category on the Activity Controls page). You’ll have the option to automatically delete your activity after either three, 18, or 36 months.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can now auto-delete your location history." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N9k7GSAsreCH44MblC3mRkvwkLo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23050934/Screen_Shot_2021_11_29_at_10.28.57_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can now auto-delete your location history.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="uRpyvh"&gt;Stop Google tracking on an Android device&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="GqXlTf"&gt;Go to Settings. In the search box on top, type in “Activity controls” and tap it when it comes up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Succvo"&gt;If you have more than one Google account, select the one you want to manage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lGECdO"&gt;Here, as with the browser version, you can turn off or pause the monitoring of various activities, including setting auto-delete and managing a timeline of your activity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Android’s Activity Controls are very similar to those on the web.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can select an auto-delete option on your mobile device." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tq_CGGD4MYtzg7AuqSl_Wl0ASeA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23051106/Screenshot_20211129_163903.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can select an auto-delete option on your mobile device.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QT0IEK"&gt;Turn location tracking on and off from the Quick Settings tray&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="kFm7jD"&gt;If you want to be able to turn location tracking on or off as you need it, you can do that, too. One way to arrange this is to use the Quick Settings tray (which is what you see when you swipe down from the top of your screen). The tray holds a variety of icons for the most often-used Android features; there is a “Location” icon that lets you toggle the location feature on and off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MqqXCq"&gt;Swipe down from the top of the screen. If you’re using Android 12, you’ll see a series of bubbles for things like Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, flashlight, etc. If you’re using Android 11 or earlier, it will be a line of icons. Either way, that’s your Quick Settings tray. Look for the Location icon (usually, it looks like an upside-down drop of water).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HfSvBy"&gt;Not there? With Android 12, swipe across to see more bubbles; otherwise, swipe down. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="HMusT1"&gt;Still missing? Look for a pencil icon; on a Pixel, it will be on the bottom of the tray, but some Android interfaces will have it on top. Tap on the pencil, and the menu will open further. You can now see all the icons that are available. What you want to do is make sure the Location icon is in the easily visible part of the tray.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="zyNck0"&gt;If your Location icon is in the bottom section, hold and drag it up to the visible group. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="hpM8ic"&gt;You’ll now be able to quickly swipe down from the top of your screen and toggle Location on and off — for example, if you want to use Google Maps for directions, you can toggle Location on, and then turn it back off when you’re finished.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There is a location button in your Quick Settings tray." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gCw6_zZiFhaZIBoX6w6UaEa9HFo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052522/Screenshot_20211130_101011.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;There is a location button in your Quick Settings tray.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="There is a location button in your Quick Settings tray." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q14K5sNVhsY9dS9mKfI3taztNxY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052611/Screenshot_20211130_101104.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If the Location button isn’t immediately visible, you can move it up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nfbCQv"&gt;Stop location tracking on Android devices&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BTiLgC"&gt;If you don’t feel the need to block Google from recording all your activities, and simply want to stop the phone from recording your location, it’s easy to do — as long as you pay attention to the details: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="24De6B"&gt;Swipe down from the top of the screen so that you see your Quick Settings menu, and long-press on the Location icon — or swipe down, tap the Settings icon, and choose “Location.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="K0POTW"&gt;You’re now on the Location page. Find the “Use location” feature at the top and toggle it off. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="7zmSu5"&gt;You’d think that would be it, wouldn’t you? But you’d be wrong. What is meant by “Use location” in Android depends on which sensors are following the location of the device: besides GPS, it could be Wi-Fi, mobile networks, or other sensors. So before you leave this page, look a little further down. If you’re using Android 12, look for the “Location services” button, otherwise, look for the “Advanced” button and tap on that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LduQzU"&gt;Either way, you’ll have several categories that you can toggle on or off. These can be (depending on your Android version and your phone’s manufacturer):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="HMhTYc"&gt;Google Emergency Location Service. This tells emergency services where you are if there’s a problem; for example, if your car goes off the road and the ambulance needs to find you. You can turn this off if you want, but read the fine print: “If ELS is off, your mobile carrier may still send device location during an emergency call.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FztpjJ"&gt;Google Location Accuracy. This uses Wi-Fi and other services to help pinpoint your location. If you want to turn off “Use location,” you need to make sure this is turned off as well. Any app that requires “precise location” (which I’ll explain in a bit) needs this to be turned on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dQUN9h"&gt;Google Location History. This leads you to a page where you can pause your device’s collection of your location history. That doesn’t get rid of what’s already been saved; there are instructions for that a little later in this article.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6E3UDZ"&gt;Google Location Sharing. If you’re sharing your location with family members or friends, you can manage it here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="FEv8CX"&gt;Wi-Fi scanning. This lets apps and services scan for local Wi-Fi networks, even if you have Wi-Fi turned off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KxgYO1"&gt;Bluetooth scanning. This lets apps and services search for Bluetooth devices even if Bluetooth is off. Both this and the Wi-Fi scanning are meant to improve location features.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="qS3jgn"&gt;If you can’t see these last two, go back to the Location page and look for a “Wi-Fi and Bluetooth scanning” link. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="On your Location page, select “Location services” to see additional options." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hUlNPH2J5KSGG6p3NiM7zW0RuoU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052614/Screenshot_20211130_101459.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;On your Location page, select “Location services” to see additional options.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s a good idea to keep your Emergency Location Service turned on." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/naiG39fl5_Ss_z6VdxcWcqBG0qI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052618/Screenshot_20211130_105535.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a good idea to keep your Emergency Location Service turned on.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="E6Jyki"&gt;Disable location tracking for any specific app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ne4HS1"&gt;You can find out which apps actually use location tracking and just disable it for those that you feel don’t need it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WfhZdM"&gt;Go to the Location page (by long-pressing the Location icon in your Quick Settings tray).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TVeNKM"&gt;Tap on “App permission” (or, if you’re using Android 12, look for “App location permissions”).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Xwz29M"&gt;You’ll find here a list of all your current apps that have permission to access your location either all of the time or only while in use. Tap on any to change the permission to either allow all of the time, allow only while in use, ask every time, or deny. You can also decide whether the app will be allowed to use “precise location” — in other words, use more than GPS to determine where you are. For that, “Google Location Accuracy,” also found on the Location page. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="aMt7Eg"&gt;Sometimes when you turn off permissions in the Android Settings, the app itself will continually try to get you to restore that permission. It’s irritating, but unless the app lets you say, “No, leave me alone,” you will either have to live with it or get a different app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="App permissions classifies apps by which permissions you allow them to have." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qz9bV240OL92S3XVji3UOy41PGA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052672/Screenshot_20211130_105745.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;App permissions classify apps by which permissions you allow them to have.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When you click on a specific app, you can change its permission level." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-5ZalaYnEfjpO1-BTLUnVLm7X6o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052671/Screenshot_20211130_105817.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When you click on a specific app, you can change its permission level.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oGKkfA"&gt;Delete your location history &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Wya7YG"&gt;While you can turn off location tracking from your Android phone’s settings, once a service has collected your location info, getting rid of that history takes a little work. If you want to delete your location history, the first place you need to go is Google; after that, apps that collect this information include Facebook and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="fRiTfT"&gt;Delete your Google location history on Android&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="BKWerC"&gt;While you can delete location history collected for your Google timeline in the My Activity area (see above), you can also get rid of it easily in Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="QWW2ri"&gt;Go to your Google Maps app.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="uMSfwi"&gt;Tap on your profile icon in the upper left corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BfjCrt"&gt;Tap on “Your Timeline.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6D8Bzs"&gt;Select the three dots in the upper right corner. Tap on “Settings and Privacy.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sZesK5"&gt;Scroll down to “Delete all Location History.” You’ll get a pop-up window that asks you to check a box saying that you understand that some of your apps may not work properly. Check the box and select “Delete.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="e0XnVK"&gt;You also have the option of deleting your location history within a date range or setting the app to automatically delete your location history after three, 18, or 36 months.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can delete your entire location history, or just within a range of dates." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CNPVWgx823woqApz5f2bCsk2ThE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052750/Screenshot_20211130_112946.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can delete your entire location history or just within a range of dates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Google will always give you a last chance to back out." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AaUOJcg2CvdBScqvHXRKb0xdaPY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052751/Screenshot_20211130_113018.png"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7EXzk4"&gt;Delete your Google location history on a browser&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ArwYdf"&gt;Go to &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/maps"&gt;https://www.google.com/maps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="02JrgK"&gt;Tap on the three parallel lines in the upper left corner of the side panel. (If you don’t see the panel, look for the small arrow in the upper left corner and click on it.) Select “Your timeline.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="q6duPL"&gt;Look for the gear icon on the lower right side of the screen. Click on it, and then on “Delete all Location History.” You can also set the automatic deletion feature here.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Look for the gear in your Timeline to delete your location history." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vtEALs3IpgHvvzO0udDaMEcIjZM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21817536/Screen_Shot_2020_08_25_at_11.47.12_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Look for the gear in your Timeline to delete your location history.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="IZyBXY"&gt;As with the mobile app, you’ll get a pop-up window that asks you to check a box saying that you understand that some of your apps may not work properly. Check the box and select “Delete Location History.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll be asked to confirm the history deletion." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/X_Q7xlG3ScisGSNfYOEp8FjYGpI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21817537/Screen_Shot_2020_08_25_at_11.47.35_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll be asked to confirm the history deletion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="3CJS3B"&gt;Delete your location history on Facebook&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Zgk6ti"&gt;Facebook does keep a separate history of your locations, and if you want to delete that history, you can do it through the mobile app or the browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ponAKZ"&gt;Using the Android app&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="6DV6yB"&gt;In the Facebook app, tap the hamburger (three parallel lines) in the top right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="V4BsHY"&gt;Scroll down and tap on “Settings &amp;amp; Privacy.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="wglR5O"&gt;Tap on “Settings.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="S1YOS1"&gt;Scroll down and tap on “Location” (which is under the “Permissions” subhead). This will take you to the “Location Services” page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="H4uVRV"&gt;You can now choose to let Facebook access your phone’s location all the time, while using the app, or never.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fJBfmO"&gt;If you want to allow Facebook to save a history of your locations (or stop it from doing so), tap on “Location History” to toggle it on or off. It’s here that you can also delete your existing location history.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="In Facebook “Settings &amp;amp;amp; Privacy,” select “Settings.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J05QA-fV2ySpCTSIBHzX4FUCRhs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23052787/Screenshot_20211130_114043.jpg"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="vD2Zs7"&gt;Using a browser&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="5bn7Gs"&gt;In Facebook, click on the small arrow next to the Notifications icon in the upper right corner. Click on “Settings &amp;amp; Privacy” &amp;gt; “Privacy Shortcuts.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="TUXU0S"&gt;Click on “Manage your location settings.”&lt;/li&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Location Settings” page lets you view your history, delete it, and stop recording it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="1voyie"&gt;Then click on the gear in the upper left corner. As with the mobile app, you can now either delete that specific day or delete your entire location history.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id="Qthun7"&gt;Delete your location history on Twitter&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2Ynv6F"&gt;Twitter makes it relatively simple to turn off its location tracking within the Android app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="MTvo6j"&gt;Tap on your personal icon in the upper left of the homescreen. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="S8MLg3"&gt;Tap on “Settings and privacy.”  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9LBQi7"&gt;Tap on “Privacy and safety.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="dK7CAC"&gt;Scroll down until you see “Location information” and tap on it. You can then toggle off the boxes that give Twitter permission to collect your GPS and other location information. And don’t forget to tap on “Explore settings,” which gives Twitter the option to show nearby content.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Why Red Notice was able to beat Bird Box as Netflix’s biggest movie debut ever</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZlXLyR8oBQH1ANOqMcImuiqyxbU=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70211481/RN_20200303_16805r6a.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dterW4"&gt;Netflix’s heist drama &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt; has officially overthrown &lt;em&gt;Bird Box&lt;/em&gt; as the streaming service’s biggest movie debut to date, with over 328 million total hours viewed as of today. That beats out &lt;em&gt;Bird Box&lt;/em&gt;’s prior record — 282 million hours in its first 28 days — by a good margin, and &lt;em&gt;Red Notice &lt;/em&gt;still has ample time to expand its debut-month record.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zfq1Kn"&gt;That might seem like great news for Netflix: a movie it wanted to be a huge hit was in fact a huge hit. It commanded views up against an eight-hour Beatles documentary as well as big theatrical releases like a &lt;em&gt;Ghostbusters&lt;/em&gt; spinoff and multiple titles from Disney. But the film’s success isn’t quite as remarkable as the numbers make it appear. Sure, the hours viewed figure indicates that subscribers are actually watching &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt;. But it’s also the kind of numbers Netflix &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be netting right now and should probably be seeing more of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gZizQI"&gt;As far as celebrity appeal goes, &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt; checks a lot of boxes — it stars Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Deadpool (Ryan Reynolds), and The Rock (Dwayne Johnson), all of whom more or less play themselves — and had a huge $200 million budget to back it all up. But the film hasn’t achieved anywhere near the cultural cachet of &lt;em&gt;Bird Box&lt;/em&gt; or Netflix’s more recent success &lt;em&gt;Squid Game&lt;/em&gt;, which remains its most popular TV series debut to date. To say that&lt;em&gt; Red Notice&lt;/em&gt; lacked the substance of either of the aforementioned titles would frankly be generous. &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt; has some big-boom action fun, but that’s about as far as it gets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPoYbl"&gt;So how on earth did a movie that by many accounts is just, well, &lt;em&gt;fine&lt;/em&gt; eclipse &lt;em&gt;Bird Box&lt;/em&gt; for Netflix’s most-viewed film to date? One answer might be subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xZcrRv"&gt;The problem with comparing two films that debuted on Netflix roughly three years apart — aside from their markedly different tones and inverse genres — is that Netflix has grown substantially in that time. When Netflix shared its fourth-quarter earnings in January 2019, a month after &lt;em&gt;Bird Box&lt;/em&gt;’s premiere, the company reported having around &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/17/media/netflix-earnings-q4/index.html"&gt;139 million subscriptions&lt;/a&gt;. As of its most recently reported subscription figures, it now has around &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/netflix-q3-2021-earnings-1235033272/"&gt;214 million active accounts&lt;/a&gt; — and that’s after the service twice &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/29/21540346/netflix-price-increase-united-states-standard-premium-content-product-features"&gt;raised its prices&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/13/21514661/netflix-free-trial-us-cancel-content-sampling-streaming"&gt;axed its free trial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ojohqm"&gt;Netflix is now reaching more people globally than at any other time in its history, and it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22787426/netflix-cdn-open-connect"&gt;custom-tailors its product&lt;/a&gt; to its various markets across the world. (As of this week’s data, &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt; remained in the top 10 films in 94 countries.) That means that &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; film that the streamer puts on its service now is better positioned to do well over titles that premiered when it had some 75 million fewer active accounts, fewer features, and the world wasn’t living through an ongoing global health crisis that sees many of us turning to streaming services to keep us preoccupied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vQC4S5"&gt;It’s likely that &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt; will continue to topple records during its first 28 days on the service, the window for which Netflix reports the total viewing hours of its most popular titles. It’s almost assured, in fact.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02CZIp"&gt;But streaming data doesn’t and arguably &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611516/scarlett-johansson-disney-lawsuit-streaming-services-transparency"&gt;can’t give a full picture&lt;/a&gt; of success because of how rapidly the space is evolving, for several reasons. Netflix is among the most transparent streaming services, offering a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22785623/netflix-launches-top-10-titles-website"&gt;publicly accessible&lt;/a&gt; and frequently updated dedicated hub for tracking its hits, but even that can be tricky when its past successes are measured against newer ones as the service continues to grow. (Its newer public-facing metric, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697364/netflix-viewing-data-code-2021"&gt;hours viewed&lt;/a&gt;, is to Netflix’s credit far easier to interpret than its former maligned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697364/netflix-viewing-data-code-2021"&gt;two-minute viewing metric&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3oLMQq"&gt;But even more to that point, without data shared by other services, we’re still left in the dark about how Netflix’s successes compare to those of, for example, HBO Max or Prime Video. In an ideal scenario, all of these services would adopt greater transparency and convene around one single way of gauging success. Those numbers should then account for the debut of the title against the growth of the service over time. (This week, for example, the Halle Berry-starring drama &lt;em&gt;Bruised —&lt;/em&gt; which also premiered this month — came in second for English-language films with 47.7 million hours viewed to &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt;’s 50.6 million during the same weeklong period. That context is helpful for understanding &lt;em&gt;Red Notice&lt;/em&gt;’s success.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CyDrLw"&gt;Immediately, those asks seem like a tall order from companies that have been intentionally obtuse about &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/those-hbo-max-numbers-arent-what-they-seem-1846752112"&gt;accurately representing their data&lt;/a&gt; in the past. We’re getting this data from Netflix and in a way that most people can reasonably understand — and that’s great. But because of the rapidly evolving nature of the streaming wars, these numbers are harder to interpret than, say, box office sales. And without everyone playing by the same rules, the data is pretty meaningless for giving us any comparative understanding of how Netflix stacks up against the competition — and what truly makes a hit.&lt;/p&gt;
