    <title>Huawei’s Watch 3 is its first HarmonyOS smartwatch  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5WZ1-h_51CjfAOxicSrxfdcoCcc=/0x2:3424x2285/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69376245/MKT_HUAWEI_WATCH_3_crop_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Huawei Watch 3.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Huawei&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GnKvGW"&gt;Huawei has announced its first smartwatches running its own HarmonyOS operating system, the Huawei Watch 3 and Huawei Watch 3 Pro. In theory it’s the third separate operating system Huawei has used for its smartwatches, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/25/9397931/huawei-watch-review-android-wear"&gt;originally ran Google’s Android Wear&lt;/a&gt; (now Wear OS) before introducing its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/10/16/17967136/huawei-watch-gt-fitness-gps-watch-specs-release-date-price-hands-on"&gt;LiteOS software&lt;/a&gt; with more recent devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DXiI7C"&gt;Despite the new OS, the Watch 3 offers a similar set of features to Huawei’s previous wearables. New additions includes a redesigned home screen that now consists of a watchOS-style grid of apps rather than a list, and there’s also support for video calling through Huawei’s own MeeTime service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VaTaJ9"&gt;Although it’s branded as a HarmonyOS device, the Watch 3’s long battery life suggests its operating system is significantly different from the version of HarmonyOS Huawei is using on its new tablets, and may have more in common with LiteOS on its previous watches. Huawei did not respond to questions about any similarities between HarmonyOS and its existing operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fT05po"&gt;The Watch 3’s design doesn’t deviate much from Huawei’s previous smart watches. It’s got a circular 1.43-inch OLED display with a 60Hz refresh rate and a peak brightness of 1000 nits. The display is edge-to-edge, so there’s no rotating bezel on this smartwatch. Instead you control it via a rotating crown, similar to an Apple Watch. The watch is available in a couple of different styles including an “active” model with a rubber strap, a “classic” model with leather, and an “elite” version with a metal bracelet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UuHKk1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;With a 1.43-inch circular OLED display and a rotating crown&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JHH0JG"&gt;For activity tracking, the watch features many of the same sensors as previous models, including heart rate tracking, an Sp02 sensor, and sleep tracking. But new for this version is a temperature sensor, similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/25/21399307/fitbit-sense-versa-3-smartwatch-inspire-2-fitness-tracker-ecg-eda-stress"&gt;Fitbit’s Sense smartwatch&lt;/a&gt; from last year. Huawei says this sensor can continuously track the temperature of your skin throughout the course of the day. Huawei says the watch supports a hundred different workout modes, ranging from running to climbing, cycling, and swimming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7LMqXl"&gt;eSIM support returns from the Watch 2 Pro, which means the Watch 3 can also be operated independently from a phone with its own 4G LTE connection. The watch supports making voice calls directly, and there’s also support for video calls via Huawei’s MeeTime service (though there wasn’t any confirmation about whether the watch will work with other video calling services like WhatsApp).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MxAc8A"&gt;With 4G turned on, Huawei says you should get around three days of battery life from the Watch 3, but that extends to 14 days if you’re willing to turn off 4G and use the phone in “ultra long lasting mode.” Even in this low-power mode, Huawei says you should still be able to track your activity and workouts, and its watch faces will still be animated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fVKlZQ"&gt;As well as the Watch 3, Huawei is also announcing the Watch 3 Pro today, which offers up to 5 days of battery life with 4G turned on, and up to 21 days in its long battery life mode. Other improvements include a more premium titanium construction, and more accurate GPS tracking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6DQtGD"&gt;Third-party app support is still a big question mark hanging over Huawei’s first HarmonyOS watches. As always, Huawei promises it’s working with developers on bringing their apps to its devices, and showed off a range of app logos including one for the Emirates airline. But beyond that, there weren’t any app logos for services I recognized, and Huawei hasn’t confirmed support from any of the major music streaming services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZkOiIL"&gt;Huawei is yet to confirm pricing or release details for the Huawei Watch 3 and Watch 3 Pro, but said an announcement should be made soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fDQORn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Huawei’s HarmonyOS arrives on tablets with the new MatePad Pro</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gGuGmbKjDF8RbO-QPKN1pBeAyVA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69376236/jporter_20210601_4610_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Huawei’s new 12.6-inch MatePad Pro with stylus and keyboard cover.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3m61Jb"&gt;Huawei has announced a trio of new MatePad tablets; a new 12.6-inch MatePad Pro, a smaller 10.8-inch MatePad Pro, and a new MatePad 11. Not only are they the company’s first tablets running its own HarmonyOS operating system, but the smaller MatePad Pro and MatePad 11 use Snapdragon chips produced by Qualcomm rather than the Huawei-designed Kirin processors found in its previous devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pJa5An"&gt;Between these hardware and software changes, the tablets highlight the challenges that the Chinese technology giant is going through. It’s simultaneously trying to break free of Android, which outside of China is dominated by the Google apps and services that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/19/18631558/google-huawei-android-suspension"&gt;Huawei is unable to preinstall on its phones&lt;/a&gt;. But they also speak to the problems US sanctions are causing for Huawei’s Kirin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/9/21360598/huawei-chips-us-sanctions-trump-china-privacy-smartphone"&gt;processor production&lt;/a&gt;, forcing it to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/14/21565185/us-qualcomm-license-4g-chips-huawei-ban-china-phones"&gt;source chips from competitor Qualcomm&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="FCjDZv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Two of the new tablets use Qualcomm chips&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DOkjwg"&gt;The 10.8-inch MatePad Pro is equipped with a Snapdragon 870, while the 10.95-inch MatePad 11 is powered by a Snapdragon 865. The flagship 12.6-inch MatePad Pro, meanwhile, is still running Huawei’s own Kirin 9000E processor, and it’s the device Huawei has shared the most information about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l5tbEN"&gt;But more interesting than the chips inside is the software these new tablets are running.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u1EloB"&gt;From an end user point of view, the “switch” to HarmonyOS fundamentally doesn’t bring back the missing Google apps and services that have made Huawei’s recent devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/25/21193639/huawei-mate-30-google-apps-services-appgallery-p40-preview"&gt;so difficult to recommend&lt;/a&gt; outside of China. Huawei’s AppGallery store offers an increasing array of native apps, and workarounds for some others, but it’s still a far cry from having Google’s suite of apps and services pre-installed on a device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eNymVE"&gt;There have been big questions surrounding HarmonyOS ever since an &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/harmonyos-hands-on-huaweis-android-killer-is-just-android/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt; investigation&lt;/a&gt; alleged that it’s a glorified open-source Android fork. I can’t speak to its underlying code, but I was able to download &lt;a href="https://www.whatsapp.com/android/"&gt;WhatsApp’s official Android APK&lt;/a&gt; and install it on the new MatePad Pro as though I was using an Android device, which suggests &lt;em&gt;Ars&lt;/em&gt; is correct. Huawei did not respond to my questions about shared code between HarmonyOS and Android.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C9yG3g5B3jEUM0IrmRkSkITTdXY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22552890/jporter_20210601_4610_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 12.6-inch MatePad Pro’s webcam is in the bezel on the tablet’s long side, the right place for video calls.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hutwPr"&gt;With its keyboard cover and M-Pencil stylus, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/24/21145754/huawei-matepad-pro-5g-tablet-wireless-charging-specs-news-features"&gt;last year’s MatePad Pro&lt;/a&gt; invited obvious comparisons to Apple’s iPad Pro, and this year’s HarmonyOS model packs in a few more features that are eerily reminiscent of Apple’s tablets. There’s a new FreeNote feature that lets you use the M-Pencil to write into dialog boxes and see your handwriting automatically turned into typed text (a feature which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21294662/apple-ipados-14-scribble-pencil-handwriting-typed-text-wwdc-2020"&gt;Apple introduced last year&lt;/a&gt;) and the tablet’s homescreen now includes a dock with your most used apps (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/3/18650197/apple-ipad-os-ipados-multitasking-homescreen-features-wwdc-2019"&gt;ahem&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="spXudY"&gt;But with the 12.6-inch MatePad Pro, Huawei deserves some credit for not imitating some of Apple’s less popular design decisions. Its webcam, for example, is built into the bezel on the long edge of the screen, so it’s in the right place for conference calls made in landscape mode, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22442084/ipad-pro-2021-review-features-screen-mini-led-m1-processor#:~:text=I%E2%80%99d,their%20faces"&gt;unlike the iPad Pro’s&lt;/a&gt;. It’s also got a vibrant 1600 x 2560 OLED screen with excellent black levels, while Apple’s lineup is still using variations of LCD panels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bQJ4p8wfn9t16shDTQbTOyBW1Io=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22552891/jporter_20210601_4610_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Also announced today is a new M-Pencil stylus.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ORtlxU"&gt;Huawei’s screen-mirroring technology also returns with the new MatePad Pro. While this previously let you mirror a smartphone’s screen onto the tablet, now you can mirror and interact with the tablet’s screen on compatible Huawei laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IP7cCe"&gt;The 12.6-inch MatePad Pro has a 10,050mAh battery which Huawei claims can playback video for 14 hours on a single charge. It can be fast-charged at up to 40W with a cable, 27W wirelessly, and also offers reverse wireless charging at 10W. Rounding out the specs, there are three rear cameras on the tablet, four mics, eight speakers, and Wi-Fi 6 compatibility. Huawei is yet to detail any 4G or 5G support for its new tablets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fctyhg"&gt;Alongside the new tablets, Huawei is also announcing a second-generation of its M-Pencil stylus. The company says the new stylus is more precise, has lower 9ms latency, and also has a platinum-coated transparent nib.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cpzkPo"&gt;Huawei is yet to confirm pricing or release details for its new tablets, but said it would be releasing more information soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Judge dismisses charges against Apple chief accused of bribing police officers with iPads </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2B6pA47_2BHq9No4prWTG12iMs8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69376086/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q4CY76"&gt;A Californian court has dismissed bribery charges against Apple’s Chief Security Officer Thomas Moyer, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/judge-dismisses-charges-against-apple-security-chief-gun-permit-probe-2021-06-01/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, who was accused of offering iPads as bribes to obtain concealed-weapons permits for Apple employees. Judge Eric S. Geffon dismissed arguments of corrupt intent as “pure speculation” that were “not supported by the evidence presented to the grand jury.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bViO1M"&gt;Moyer was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/23/21611525/apple-ipads-bribes-concealed-gun-permits-security-head-accused-santa-clara"&gt;accused last November&lt;/a&gt; of trying to bribe Santa Clara County officials by offering to donate 200 iPads to two officers in the sheriff’s office following a meeting in 2019. Moyer had indeed made the offer, but evidence suggests he believed the permits were already approved at this time, Judge Geffon wrote. This, combined with the fact that Moyer followed Apple’s rules about donations and was donating the iPads to the Sheriff’s Office rather than the officers themselves, was seen as further evidence against him acting with corrupt intent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YFUwyq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Apple dropped its plans to donate the computers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OjCdg8"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/local/article/Bribery-charge-against-Apple-executive-who-16218024.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;San Francisco Chronicle&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that Apple halted plans to donate the computers to the Sheriff’s Office following media reports about the incident. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3qWX9t"&gt;In a statement reported by &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;, Moyer thanked the court for its decision. “I also want to thank Apple, my friends and family for their unwavering support,” he added. Last November, Apple &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/11/apple-security-chief-maintains-innocence-after-bribery-charges/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Ars Technica&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that an internal investigation had found no wrongdoing. Moyer has reportedly been at Apple for around 15 years, and has served as its global security head since November 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZjjyWL"&gt;Despite the bribery charges being dismissed, Santa Clara District Attorney Jeff Rosen said prosecutors believed Moyer had been “correctly indicted... for bribery.” Rosen said they “stand by the grand jury’s decision and are evaluating our options.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Etsy targets Gen Z shoppers with $1.6 billion Depop acquisition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Depop Space Selfridges Launch Party" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2fkEEvGa9Nvo7kvAkAiS4Nf2Utk=/4x0:4996x3328/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69376020/1165583337.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clothes hangers with Depop’s logo appear in a pop-up shop in Selfridges, London. &lt;/em&gt; | Photo by David M. Benett/Getty Images for Depop&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Oy1IEw"&gt;E-commerce site Etsy, best known for selling handmade and vintage wares, is &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.co.uk/news-releases/etsy-to-acquire-global-fashion-resale-marketplace-depop-865217575.html"&gt;buying up a cooler, younger rival&lt;/a&gt;, UK-based secondhand shopping app Depop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lLy3MU"&gt;The $1.6 billion acquisition lets Etsy access Depop’s young and growing userbase. Etsy says more than 90 percent of Depop’s users are under 26, meaning they mostly belong to Gen Z, while Etsy’s own users are firmly millennial, with a median age for sellers of around 39. Etsy claims that Depop is the 10th most visited shopping site for Gen Z consumer in the US. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BlVBwU"&gt;“We are simply thrilled to be adding Depop — what we believe to be the resale home for Gen Z consumers — to the Etsy family,” Etsy chief executive Josh Silverman said in a press statement. “Depop is a vibrant, two-sided marketplace with a passionate community, a highly-differentiated offering of unique items, and we believe significant potential to further scale.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GISEg2"&gt;Depop, founded in 2011, shares Etsy’s love of secondhand clothing. But while Etsy’s brand leans more towards the vintage and cosy, Depop’s is more fashionable. Depop’s revenues doubled last year to $70 million, with most of this income derived from sales commissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBvZwc"&gt;While Etsy will get access to Depop’s users, Depop itself will be able to draw on Etsy’s experience to scale internationally. “Many of the challenges that we are going through as a business are things that Etsy has gone through before,” Maria Raga, Depop’s chief executive, &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1ca0f193-2b11-42f4-8a35-ff702672e9e8"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Financial Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “Etsy has made massive improvements in terms of search and discovery, and this is something that we can definitely learn from.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhumZD"&gt;The acquisition is the latest sign of activity in the secondhand clothing market, though things are not exactly stable. Depop rivals Poshmark and Thredup, for example, have both seen market caps soar on successful IPOs only to fall again when financial earnings &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/12/poshmark-posh-q1-2021-earnings.html"&gt;revealed widening losses amid sales growth&lt;/a&gt;. And Etsy itself has seen its &lt;a href="https://blog.mywallst.com/etsy-shares-fall-after-sales-drop-from-pandemic-highs/"&gt;shares drop from a pandemic high&lt;/a&gt; as global lockdowns begin to lift and physical retailers reopen. Grabbing Depop seems like a way to reduce that exposure and access a mobile-first userbase.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk blames ‘supply chain price pressure’ for Tesla’s increasing prices</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h-gGqmii2F1C9gGdrUykR8FVdEs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69375917/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tMg0wP"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk has blamed supply chain price pressure for incremental price increases the company has made to its Model 3 and Model Y vehicles over the past several months. “Prices increasing due to major supply chain price pressure industry-wide,” the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1399492488612691973?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1399492488612691973%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.reuters.com%2Fbusiness%2Fautos-transportation%2Fteslas-vehicle-price-increases-due-supply-chain-pressure-musk-says-2021-06-01%2F"&gt;CEO tweeted&lt;/a&gt; in response to a complaint about the changes. “Raw materials especially.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WuloCV"&gt;Today, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1399999219218501633"&gt;the CEO followed up&lt;/a&gt; to say that “microcontroller chips” are a particular challenge right now. But although Musk said that he’s “never seen anything like it,” he added that he doesn’t expect this to be a long-term issue. “Fear of running out is causing every company to overorder – like the toilet paper shortage, but at epic scale.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hAZWV1"&gt;Musk had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22404198/tesla-q1-results-earnings-profit-model-s-x-y-3-bitcoin-delay#:~:text=The%20global,new%20suppliers"&gt;previously indicated&lt;/a&gt; in an April earnings call that Tesla was well placed to weather the global chip shortage by “pivoting extremely quickly to new microcontrollers.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Our biggest challenge is supply chain, especially microcontroller chips. Never seen anything like it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Fear of running out is causing every company to overorder – like the toilet paper shortage, but at epic scale.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That said, it’s obv not a long-term issue.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1399999219218501633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;June 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

The Standard Range Plus version of the Model 3 has increased from $36,990 &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/02/17/tesla-reduces-model-3-y-prices/"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt; to $39,990 &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/05/21/tesla-tsla-increases-model-3-y-prices/"&gt;in late May&lt;/a&gt;, for example, while the Model Y Long Range AWD version has gone from $49,990 to $51,990 over the same period. Tesla has updated its prices almost half a dozen times since February this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gPVw5y"&gt;Tesla is far from unique in seeing its prices affected by the global chip shortage, which has had a wide-reaching impact on the manufacturing of everything &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22368552/global-chip-shortage-end-tsmc-samsung-ps5-supply-demand-intel"&gt;from games consoles&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.ft.com/content/9a497f21-e3e4-4c74-8737-07cd13209475"&gt;toasters&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Amazon Prime Day kicks off on June 21st</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jgJFYaZCE58FCumVsDSTDbLwxd4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69375628/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1lnJmt"&gt;Amazon Prime Day, the company’s annual shopping holiday, will take place on Monday, June 21st through June 22nd, the company officially announced today. The forthcoming summer dates mark a return to form; the retail giant has historically held its shopping extravaganza in mid-July but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332350/amazon-prime-day-delayed-us-india-august-coronavirus"&gt;postponed last year’s event&lt;/a&gt; until October due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In its &lt;a href="https://s2.q4cdn.com/299287126/files/doc_financials/2021/q1/Amazon-Q1-2021-Earnings-Release.pdf"&gt;most recent earnings report&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon previously confirmed this year’s Prime Day would take place in Q2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IFaNVR"&gt;Like previous years, you can expect to find discounts on true wireless earbuds, 4K TVs of all sizes and panel types, video games, and more. Outside of Black Friday and Cyber Monday, Prime Day has become one of the best opportunities to get deals, whether they’re for gifts or yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZbz5j"&gt;Amazon says that this year’s Prime Day “will feature millions of deals from top brands and more than a million deals from small and medium businesses.” The company says it’s investing more than $100 million to help small businesses during Prime Day, and Prime members will get a $10 credit to use during Prime Day if they spend $10 at “select small businesses” on Amazon from June 7th through June 20th. Throughout the event, the company will also spotlight deals on Amazon Live, a streaming platform on which brands and creators highlight various products sold on Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NFUMSs"&gt;Traditionally, the marquee event — which sees exclusive discounts on Amazon devices, clothing, electronics, and a host of other consumer goods — has been a huge revenue boon for Amazon, which, despite the ongoing pandemic, managed to bring in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22404044/amazon-earnings-q1-2021-performance-profit-operating-income"&gt;$108.5 billion in net sales in Q1&lt;/a&gt;. Third-party sellers alone &lt;a href="https://press.aboutamazon.com/news-releases/news-release-details/amazon-prime-day-2020-marked-two-biggest-days-ever-small-medium"&gt;earned more than $3.5 billion&lt;/a&gt; over the two-day event last year, however, the e-commerce giant has not disclosed total sales figures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uB8BJR"&gt;Since its inception in 2015, Amazon has leveraged the global shopping event as a way to retain &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/amazon-prime-day-deals-tech"&gt;Amazon Prime&lt;/a&gt; subscribers, which now top &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385370/amazon-prime-subscription-jeff-bezos-2020-shareholders-letter"&gt;more than 200 million&lt;/a&gt;, and bolster sales during what is often considered a slow period for retailers. Last year’s Prime Day essentially kicked off the holiday shopping season early, though Amazon likely wants to avoid running up against Black Friday and Cyber Monday, two of the biggest shopping days of the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Anx475"&gt;This year’s Prime Day also takes place during a time of momentous change at Amazon. Andy Jassy, the current CEO of Amazon Web Services (AWS), is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455126/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-jeff-bezos-july-5-birthday"&gt;set to become Amazon’s CEO&lt;/a&gt; on July 5th, and the company recently announced its plan to buy &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22441644/amazon-mgm-acquisition-prime-video-subscription-service-james-bond"&gt;MGM for $8.45 billion&lt;/a&gt;, an acquisition that will further bolster the company’s entertainment properties and likely help grow its Amazon Prime Video library. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="acucMo"&gt;As Amazon continues to grow, however, so do the labor disputes. Following a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1"&gt;historic loss&lt;/a&gt; in Bessemer, Alabama, the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) is challenging the results of its recent union drive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/7/22423366/amazon-union-election-appeal-hearing"&gt;in an appeal&lt;/a&gt;. Elsewhere, employees continue to put pressure on Jassy and current CEO Jeff Bezos in regards to a multitude of issues, from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453516/amazon-workers-pollution-petition-letter-demand"&gt;pollution&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453784/amazon-employees-support-palestine-sever-business-contracts"&gt;Palestine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gy7ewR"&gt;Last year, Amazon workers in Germany even went so far as to &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/13/amazon-workers-in-germany-strike-on-prime-day.html"&gt;stage a Prime Day strike&lt;/a&gt; to protest for better working conditions and higher wages, a tactic &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/16/20696154/amazon-prime-day-2019-strike-warehouse-workers-inhumane-conditions-the-rate-productivity"&gt;seen in Minnesota&lt;/a&gt; in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo is turning a factory into a gallery</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qYDUWfWE4ELXhhfn8Rk1TmOpigY=/109x0:1311x801/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69375180/photo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6GgZjm"&gt;Nintendo has announced that its Uji Ogura plant will be turned into a public gallery to “showcase the many products Nintendo has launched over its history.” The factory, located in the Ogura district of Uji, a city just outside Kyoto, was built in 1969 and was mainly used for manufacturing playing cards and hanafuda cards, which is how Nintendo got started as a business in the 19th century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MHDggt"&gt;“Nintendo has been discussing the possibility of building a gallery, as a way to share Nintendo’s product development history and philosophy with the public,” the company says in a &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/corporate/release/en/2021/210602.html"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. “To this end, the Nintendo Uji Ogura Plant will be renovated to accommodate the gallery, a decision reached after taking consideration of The City of Uji’s plan of re-developing the nearby Ogura Station area.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XHVeoF"&gt;Nintendo expects the gallery to be completed in its fiscal year from April 1st, 2023 to March 31st, 2024. Right now the working title is “Nintendo Gallery.” The facility will no doubt be popular with tourists visiting Kyoto, many of whom make the pilgrimage to Nintendo’s headquarters even though it’s a nondescript office block that’s closed to the public. And of course, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan"&gt;the new Super Nintendo World area&lt;/a&gt; at Universal Studios Japan is located fairly close in neighboring Osaka.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The government’s been worried about DJI drones — the Pentagon now says they’re safe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T-VIqtyzzEElicY--QTI7jQBVeY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69375023/vpavic_042029_4003_0162.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VViqYH"&gt;After months of government bans on DJI drones, with lawmakers questioning whether the company was sending information to the Chinese government, the Pentagon has now admitted that the drones being used might actually be safe (&lt;a href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/556370-pentagon-report-clears-use-of-drones-made-by-top-chinese-manufacturer?rl=1"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;The Hill&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), releasing a report saying that &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-technology-government-and-politics-business-5854cf8b5eccd03f85d5eba2aef10a22"&gt;two “Government Edition” DJI drones&lt;/a&gt; are “recommended for use by government entities.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2I7cC"&gt;Last year, the Department of the Interior &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/29/21113533/us-interior-department-chinese-drone-ban-grounding-security-dji"&gt;grounded all its drones&lt;/a&gt;, citing concerns of potential spying by the Chinese government, and the Department of Commerce &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188789/dji-ban-commerce-entity-list-drone-china-transaction-blocked"&gt;put DJI on its Entity List&lt;/a&gt; after the company allegedly provided the Chinese government with surveillance tech for its Uyghur Muslim detention camps. That second claim isn’t being addressed at all today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Qo7cn4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The report isn’t necessarily an all-clear for DJI’s relationship with the government&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WZK8gA"&gt;But, according to &lt;em&gt;The Hill&lt;/em&gt;, the Pentagon said that it didn’t find any malicious code when it analyzed two drone models. The Department of Homeland Security previously &lt;a href="https://www.auvsi.org/sites/default/files/DHS%20report.pdf"&gt;ran tests on the DJI Mavic Pro and Matrice 600 Pro in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, and didn’t find evidence of data being sent places it shouldn’t, and a new administration has seemingly come to a similar conclusion today. Another report &lt;a href="https://www.precisionhawk.com/blog/unmanned-aerial-intelligence-technology-center-of-excellence-conducts-risk-assessment-of-drone-technology"&gt;that looked at three DJI drones&lt;/a&gt;, including the Government Editions of the aforementioned drones, came to the same conclusion in early 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nApNCS"&gt;The Pentagon’s report isn’t necessarily an all-clear for DJI’s relationship with the US government. As of &lt;a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/06/01/2021-11304/addition-of-entities-revision-of-entries-and-removal-of-entity-from-the-entity-list-and-revision-of"&gt;today’s revision&lt;/a&gt;, DJI is still on the Entity List, which prevents US companies from selling any of their technology for DJI to use, and the Pentagon’s report comes as Congress is &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-technology-government-and-politics-business-5854cf8b5eccd03f85d5eba2aef10a22"&gt;considering a law&lt;/a&gt; that would ban the government from buying Chinese drones for five whole years, starting in 2023. They’d have to rely on other approved drones from companies in the US and France instead; as restrictions have been placed on DJI, others have made drones &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/20/21376917/drone-us-government-approved-dod-diu-uas-blue-china"&gt;with hefty price tags&lt;/a&gt; to fill the government’s needs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8EmAFe"&gt;We’re also talking about pretty old DJI drones that have gotten the all-clear; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/4/13508560/dji-mavic-pro-drone-review-price"&gt;we reviewed the consumer model of DJI’s Mavic Pro in 2016&lt;/a&gt;, and the company’s offered many &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22384692/dji-mavic-air-2s-drone-2021-review"&gt;far more competitive models&lt;/a&gt; since then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DSFRAr"&gt;None of the government scrutiny keeps you from buying a DJI drone. Despite all the accusations, DJI has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22193660/us-government-dji-drone-entity-list-export-ban-effects"&gt;still been able&lt;/a&gt; to continue creating and selling its consumer products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TEQVE7"&gt;Lawmakers are still trying to decide what to do about other Chinese products perceived to be a security risk as well: while the Department of Defense &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454292/xiaomi-blacklist-removed-communist-chinese-military-company"&gt;has rolled back the designation&lt;/a&gt; of Xiaomi as a “Communist Chinese military company”, the Biden administration &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22274575/huawei-fcc-lawsuit-national-security-ban-broadband-rollout"&gt;seems like it still intends&lt;/a&gt; to keep a ban on Huawei products from being used in US infrastructure. The government has been so worried about equipment from Chinese companies like ZTE and Huawei acting as part of its network infrastructure that it’s even considered removing the parts already in use. Last September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/4/21422939/huawei-zte-us-phone-networks-fcc-congress-reimbursement-cost"&gt;the FCC estimated it would cost $1.8 billion&lt;/a&gt; to “rip and replace” Chinese telecom equipment currently embedded in US networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vOd3mr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dell has discontinued the Alienware Graphics Amplifier, its external GPU</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0At8coQWAnATTi-CGE73BJpueFs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69374949/alienware-dell-11_2040.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZG4To8"&gt;We recently noticed that Alienware’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22440352/alienware-x15-x17-gaming-laptop-intel-h-series-nvidia-rtx-3080-price-release-date-features-specs"&gt;just-announced X15 and X17 thin and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;vaguely light  gaming laptops&lt;/a&gt; are conspicuously missing a port — and it’s not because they’re thin-and-light, it turns out. Alienware has just confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it has discontinued the Alienware Graphics Amplifier external GPU, and so these laptops won’t need that proprietary port anymore. The company isn’t saying whether it’ll offer a future eGPU, but pointed us to off-the-shelf Thunderbolt ones instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oPSyxA"&gt;The Alienware Graphics Amp &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/27/7079879/alienware-new-graphics-amplifier-laptop"&gt;was first introduced in 2014 for $299&lt;/a&gt; and designed to be a companion to the company’s midrange Alienware 13, giving it the vast majority of the power of a desktop graphics card plus four extra full-size USB ports when docked. &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/alienware-13-review-the-first-futureproof-gaming-lapto-1651514489"&gt;I liked the combo well enough&lt;/a&gt;. But over the years, Alienware added the port to practically every laptop (and some of its more compact desktops, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/8/27/9214017/alienware-x51-13-15-17-18-refresh"&gt;like the Alienware X51&lt;/a&gt; mini-tower and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/13/11924092/alienware-oled-laptop-alpha-r2-aurora-announced-pricing-release-date-e3-2016"&gt;Alienware Alpha R2&lt;/a&gt; console-sized PC) it released, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/4/18294631/alienware-area-51m-review-gaming-laptop-specs-price-features"&gt;the company’s flagship Area-51M&lt;/a&gt; which was designed to have built-in upgrades of its own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="v3dMs8"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-cQfy-j1Ssw?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zul4Ph"&gt;With an included 460W power supply devoted entirely to the GPU, and a price that dipped to $199 and occasionally $150, the Amp managed to stay competitive for quite a while &lt;a href="https://egpu.io/best-egpu-buyers-guide/"&gt;in the fairly niche market of eGPUs&lt;/a&gt;, which generally use manufacturer-agnostic Thunderbolt 3 ports instead of proprietary cables (and can often charge your laptop as well).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4x3Owz"&gt;It’s not clear when Alienware discontinued the Amp. &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201108140000/https://www.dell.com/content/products/productdetails.aspx/alienware-graphics-amplifier"&gt;The Wayback Machine shows&lt;/a&gt; it was still live as of November 2020, and Dell last updated &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/en-us/000178406/alienware-graphics-amplifier-supported-graphics-card-list" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;its support page&lt;/a&gt; in April 2021 — without adding compatibility for the latest wave of Nvidia and AMD graphics cards. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SnkLc9"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/7/22367807/alienware-m15-r5-15-inch-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-edition-specs-features-price-release-date"&gt;new Alienware M15 R5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22429412/intel-11th-gen-h-series-laptops"&gt;M15 R6&lt;/a&gt; also omit the Graphics Amplifier port. It’ll be interesting to see if this is the end for Alienware’s dreams of upgradable laptops; certainly the Amp lasted a lot longer than &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256845/alienware-area-51m-r1-r2-specs-upgradable-parts-gpu-dgff-limited"&gt;the idea of offering new chips for the giant Area-51m laptop.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea’s Sonos-powered picture frame speaker is on its website right now</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9AfEGC"&gt;Confirming what &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/6/22370130/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-2021-lamp-wall-art-artwork-speaker"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; reported back in April,&lt;/a&gt; Ikea tonight listed a new Symfonisk “picture frame with Wi-Fi speaker” product on its website. The device, which is listed for $199, has not yet been announced — but it’s one of two new collaborations between Ikea and Sonos set for release in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GPKkcf"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ikea.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fp%2Fsymfonisk-picture-frame-with-wi-fi-speaker-white-50487329%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F1%2F22464111%2Fikea-sonos-symfonisk-picture-frame-speaker-leak" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the likely-to-be-removed website&lt;/a&gt;, the Symfonisk picture frame measures 22 inches high, 16 inches wide, and 2 inches deep. Ikea says customers will be able to choose between “various interchangeable fronts,” and the frame will be offered in either black or white finishes. Like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726409/ikea-sonos-symfonisk-table-lamp-bookshelf-speaker-review-sound"&gt;the previous two Symfonisk products&lt;/a&gt;, the picture frame is designed to blend into your home decor and not stick out as an obvious tech gadget.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wAwwDVf4sjPMFnyaXhgL_wvAZiU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22553758/CBC65B12_8E41_4A54_9B83_C8D83CC6089B.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UBoNDk"&gt;“You can choose to hang it on its own on the wall as an eye-catcher, match it with your other pictures on a wall, place it on the floor, or lean it against a wall,” Ikea’s site says of the picture frame. Despite the name “picture frame,” it seems that you won’t be able to put your own photos into this frame; it’s more of an art piece. The front material is likely specially designed to help sound pass through. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qeFtnE"&gt;Ikea’s site confirms the Symfonisk picture frame will support Apple’s AirPlay 2, allow for stereo pairing — including as rear surrounds for a Sonos Arc or Beam soundbar — and can be controlled through the Sonos app just like previous Symfonisk products. It also has this quote from Sonos product manager Sara Morris: “By working together with the designers we were able to keep the thin edge of the picture frame while hiding a deeper acoustic volume behind it. Together with a waveguide, this let us make big room filling sound from what looks like a thin speaker.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GmFWuc"&gt;The other 2021 Symfonisk joint effort between Ikea and Sonos will be a redesigned table lamp speaker. June 14th is the latest rumored date for when the two companies will officially announce both products — even if Ikea got a little ahead of itself this evening. &lt;/p&gt;
