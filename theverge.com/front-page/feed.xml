    <title>How Android 12 lets you customize your phone’s color palette</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x49FhDfAF3VBtXRsh9ayn-VSvto=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69813043/VRG_1777_Android_12_005.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="lx6SOs"&gt;One of the new features in Android 12 is the ability to automatically fit your phone’s color palette to that of your wallpaper. If you’ve been able to upgrade to Android 12, you may want to give it a try, especially if you’re into styling and colors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="utJkHB"&gt;I tried it out on a Pixel 3 using Android 12 beta, and the results were interesting. When I used the sample wallpapers supplied by Google and enabled the “themed icons” feature (which is supposed to let your icons match the style of your wallpaper), I was treated to a new background color which appeared on the search field at the bottom of the screen, the Quick Tiles (the buttons you get when you swipe down from the top), and other elements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wgkqvj"&gt;I was not all that impressed by the “themed icons” feature — it basically changed some, but not all, of the icons on my home page into black designs against a hued background. Quite honestly, I think the normal multi-colored icons look much better, but it’s nice to have the choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eddw8V"&gt;Want to try it out yourself? Easy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="72152t"&gt;Long press on an empty part of your home screen until you see the pop-up menu.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lxz3vf"&gt;Select “Wallpaper &amp;amp; style.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ru2FHO"&gt;Select “Change wallpaper.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Long-press for a pop-up menu." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Y2KiZaJrP0AEqi6sci2B3-Bf3KQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823528/Screenshot_20210902_153520.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Long-press for a pop-up menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Select “Change wallpaper.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5ttZAMqp-omqKrZOvKhbw9NwErk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823529/Screenshot_20210902_103222.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Select “Change wallpaper.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ZBNNiT"&gt;Tap on one of the categories presented on the Wallpaper screen, and then select a specific image. Or tap on the top button called “My photos” to select one of your own photos.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="pH9uwe"&gt;Once you select your image, you’ll be shown a preview of what it will look like on your home screen and lock screen. (Two buttons below the preview image let you toggle between the two.) If you’re satisfied, tap the check mark in the bottom right corner.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jZxm5h"&gt;A pop-up menu will give you the choice of using the wallpaper on the home screen, your lock screen, or both. And you’re done! You’ll find yourself back on your home page — with your new wallpaper. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Choose a supplied image or pull one from your photos." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cxM793QG-qTB9ufCq7mN3EtI0Uc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823531/Screenshot_20210902_110943.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose a supplied image or pull one from your photos.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can use see what it will look like on your home screen and lock screen." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6I3TjicpqpVVRZPpzWQDvaJdPW8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823536/Screenshot_20210902_111910.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can use see what it will look like on your home screen and lock screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MdwB8a"&gt;If you want to try the themed icons, or use a dark theme, go back to the “Wallpaper &amp;amp; style” page, scroll down a bit and toggle on either or both. Here’s what the Mandalorian wallpaper looks like, both with normal app icons and with the themed icons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The home screen with normal icons." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Gt1dczzUbijEujVJDDjycFgr6O0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823565/Screenshot_20210902_111952.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The home screen with normal icons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The home screen with themed icons." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ejiUj9Fd-wtcxVN6I0ZhVG7dpOM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823574/Screenshot_20210902_155009.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The home screen with themed icons.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="80vCy8"&gt;I also tried the new color palette feature with one of my own photos as wallpaper: a green lawn with a few purple flowers. It worked perfectly there as well. The quick tiles and themed icons were all assigned a pale green, as were the lock screen numerals and other elements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When I used a personal photo, it chose a matching theme color." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q2pG36yTq8ZtVly_mpzx2QHH-II=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823577/Screenshot_20210902_142221.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;When I used a personal photo, it chose a matching theme color.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The theme color is reflected in a number of places, including the Quick Tiles." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9W_ZhjLre8QKlqYicbeWBLdTOIs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823578/Screenshot_20210902_142249.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The theme color is reflected in a number of places, including the Quick Tiles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8sikH0"&gt;You can also choose the a different color combination for your theme, depending on your wallpaper photo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="NHFQMq"&gt;On the “Wallpaper &amp;amp; style” page, select “Wallpaper colors” and choose one of the color combinations shown. You can also tap on “Basic colors” if you want something, well, basic.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can tweak your theme colors." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0ZC55r11SYL6rp4xQ3m_osZVXX0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823585/Screenshot_20210902_155334.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can tweak your theme colors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can tweak your theme colors." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kgRLiJzPQBkaeEmERh3pj2qkg64=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823584/Screenshot_20210902_155404.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Or choose something basic.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kkMy5a"&gt;While these style combinations won’t affect your phone’s efficiency or performance, the idea that you can tweak the look of your screen to suit your taste — or your mood — is rather nice. If you have access to Android 12, I’d try it out — it may make a real difference in how you view your Android phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cwMu6Z"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Shang-Chi could suffer because Marvel can’t push pause on its big story</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Actor Simu Liu in a fighting pose." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HtqyP_4uTkJuPIkcWSon5ieMvPU=/761x0:3335x1716/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69812796/BUS3520_cmp_lum_v0045.1069_R.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Courtesy of Marvel Studios&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6D2KhR"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22634609/marvel-shang-chi-ten-rings-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is an important film for Marvel for lots of reasons. It’s the studio’s first return to theatrical exclusive release after over a year and a half of delays due to COVID-19 (which included shifting &lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; to Disney Plus as well as theaters). It’s the studio’s first film with an Asian lead, a long-awaited milestone that took over a decade for the company to actually accomplish. And it marks the “real” start of its Phase 4 films, advancing the future of the MCU with fresh stories post-&lt;em&gt;Endgame&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8z584A"&gt;But &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; — and its less-than-ideal release timing, coming as theaters are seeing smaller turnouts as the delta variant continues to spike in the US — also highlights the MCU’s biggest problem: its films and shows are too interconnected for Marvel to shift around or delay releases.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SI0z0T"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some spoilers ahead for current and future MCU projects&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dH4gJB"&gt;This isn’t a new issue. The past year and its series of cascading delays have shown just how difficult it can be to schedule films. But Marvel’s movies have an additional challenge — not only do they have to avoid interfering with other major studio releases from across Disney’s slate, but they also have to thread the delicate balance of the other theatrical and streaming Marvel releases. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="qmElEj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Marvel couldn’t wait any longer to kick off its next phase of movies and shows","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22348084/marvel-black-widow-streaming-disney-plus-theaters-strategy-wandavision"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Xialing, Shang, and Katy look at something awkwardly in the distance." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eMNQxO1LlwvK9mbrT4L1t9qGPDo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22800322/SBT_24518_R.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Jasin Boland&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tf3LJd"&gt;Take &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt;, for example. The following factors are all true:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="cTfqvx"&gt;In an ideal world, Disney would prefer to release Marvel movies in theaters, where they can rake in hundreds of millions — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/5/18529601/avengers-endgame-marvel-disney-box-office-2-billion-worldwide"&gt;or even billions&lt;/a&gt; — of dollars in box office revenue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nYqpXI"&gt;This is not an ideal world, and even if &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; defies expectations, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/07/black-widow-mcu-record-second-weekend-box-office-drop-disney-piracy-1234795325/"&gt;it won’t make the kind of money&lt;/a&gt; it could have in more normal times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gosBgf"&gt;Given the surge in COVID cases in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/delta-variant-disrupts-moviegoing-comfort-levels-1234992378/"&gt;this coming weekend is an especially bad time&lt;/a&gt; to be releasing a movie in theaters.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="5mKphR"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shang-chi-debut-theatres-despite-covid"&gt;Disney has already made distribution agreements with theaters&lt;/a&gt; to release &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt;, which it can’t (or is unwilling to) change.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="xhLT6F"&gt;Disney needs to work with theaters in the future for those $1 billion-plus releases when things do get back to normal. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PIXoCd"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; has to come out where it does in Marvel’s release order, given its place in the overall MCU storyline.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="bDEngI"&gt;Disney &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21437889/black-widow-delayed-release-date-marvel-cinematic-universe-disney-streaming-mulan"&gt;can’t delay major MCU releases&lt;/a&gt; without having to rework much (if not all) of its Disney Plus and theatrical schedule. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="vINlhu"&gt;The end result: Disney is stuck with the worst-case scenario. It has to release &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; in theaters, it can’t use it to (immediately) boost Disney Plus subscriptions or get more data on hybrid releases, and it’ll probably take a hit on the box office numbers just to keep things on track. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n2Lrbc"&gt;But the issue isn’t going away, either. Consider what we &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; know about Marvel’s upcoming movies and shows. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lXcRqA26xdQdMtzFXUQuIqtNpAs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22708798/9b242b6fdd726ace32e612d5a40e6028_4096x2727_1c974df6.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Disney&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="l2g0IP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow&lt;/em&gt; had to be released before &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; hit Disney Plus, which it’s scheduled to do in November. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/23/22638877/spider-man-no-way-home-first-trailer"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: No Way Home&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; has to be before &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness&lt;/em&gt;, and it has the added complication that Sony, not Marvel, is in charge of release — if Sony delays it, it’ll throw &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22417115/marvel-eternals-chloe-zhao-oscar-winner-teaser-footage-black-panther-captain-marvel-sequels"&gt;Marvel’s next wave of films in disarray&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZSHPfL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Thor: Love and Thunder&lt;/em&gt; has to be before the &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special&lt;/em&gt; (which is a Disney Plus release and has the time constraint of being released near December 2022), which in turn has to be out before &lt;em&gt;Guardians of the Galaxy, Vol. 3&lt;/em&gt;. The upcoming &lt;em&gt;Ms. Marvel &lt;/em&gt;TV show has to be out before &lt;em&gt;Captain Marvel&lt;/em&gt; sequel &lt;em&gt;The Marvels&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Loki’&lt;/em&gt;s second season will presumably set up events for &lt;em&gt;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania&lt;/em&gt; (which is already confirmed to feature the return of Kang the Conqueror, who was first introduced in &lt;em&gt;Loki&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IzgTKK"&gt;And that’s not even going into reports that &lt;em&gt;Black Panther: Wakanda Forever&lt;/em&gt; will somehow &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/ironheart-black-panther-wakanda-forever-1235045088/"&gt;tie into the upcoming &lt;em&gt;Ironheart&lt;/em&gt; show&lt;/a&gt;, or whatever the plans are with an upcoming fourth &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22631179/marvel-captain-america-4-release-date-anthony-mackie-avengers"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Captain America&lt;/em&gt; movie&lt;/a&gt; starring Anthony Mackie’s Sam Wilson (which could impact future Disney Plus shows). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Loki" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Cg4q7hsqP3d3Jm371jnQBNXcmsc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22717284/tra8660_105_trl_comp_v004_7f1c1cb3.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo: Marvel Studios&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="u6GDGD"&gt;Marvel is stuck in a problematic cycle of its own making. The Disney Plus shows have to wait for the movies, the movies are the big money-makers and have to wait for theaters, so they get delayed, but Marvel can’t afford to delay the Disney Plus shows since they’re among the biggest draws for keeping &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22320332/disney-plus-100-million-subscribers-marvel-star-wars-wandavision"&gt;paying subscribers to the service&lt;/a&gt;, which is an increasingly important part of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21247794/disney-plus-subscribers-earnings-q2-theatrical-parks-streaming-movies-delays"&gt;business strategy&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q1UrmU"&gt;And while box office billions are good, the company also has to consider keeping Disney Plus releases consistent. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22617245/what-if-marvel-disney-plus-streaming-interview-multiverse"&gt;&lt;em&gt;What If…?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;— the current Marvel show — ends in October, and &lt;em&gt;Hawkeye&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22558074/hawkeye-disney-plus-marvel-november-24th-release-date-announcement"&gt;cued up for November&lt;/a&gt; already. Since MCU shows started airing on Disney Plus, there’s only been a single month (May 2020) when there wasn’t at least one new episode of a Marvel show on the service, a streak that the company looks like it’ll continue through the end of 2021 and beyond. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VaPXP8"&gt;Ultimately, something has to give: do you release things in theaters early, sacrificing some box office to keep Disney Plus on track? Or delay everything, giving subscribers a chance to skip a few months of Disney Plus in hopes that you might get a bigger box office payout in a more normal theatrical environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1H6nca"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The MCU’s must-watch nature is a double-edged sword&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OdTAjZ"&gt;There’s also the possibility that there is no right answer. Disney may see the numbers from &lt;em&gt;Shang-Chi&lt;/em&gt; and decide to shift &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451091/eternals-marvel-trailer-chloe-zhao"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eternals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to a hybrid release or a full streaming exclusive through Premiere Access if it thinks the numbers don’t work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXxw8A"&gt;The MCU’s interconnected storytelling has been one of its biggest boons, drawing on a comic book-style strategy to make every installment a must-watch, as essential to getting the full story as each issue in a long-running series. But in 2021’s complex web of streaming, theatrical releases, and ever-shifting release dates, that connected nature is increasingly becoming a problem that not even the most popular heroes can solve. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Eight things Apple could do to prove it actually cares about App Store users</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Like hire more than 500 people to police an entire platform&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4uBPJE"&gt;When you spend money in Apple’s App Store, the company generally takes a 30 percent cut — one that adds up to an estimated $19 billion per year. Apple’s currently in the fight of its life to prove to judges, government regulators, and its own developers that it deserves those dollars, but not everyone’s buying it anymore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NXvz2X"&gt;Over the past seven days alone, South Korea declared its disbelief on the global stage, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22643800/apple-google-south-korea-app-store-payment-legislation-passes"&gt;passing a landmark bill&lt;/a&gt; that could keep Apple and Google from directly collecting their 30 percent cut, and may inspire other governments to do the same. Developers also expressed their rage at an Apple press release, where the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;spun its agreement to settle a lawsuit for $100 million as a $100 million fund for developers&lt;/a&gt; — while quietly promising 30 million of those dollars to the lawyers and enacting no truly significant changes. The CEO of Hopscotch &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SamJ0hn/status/1431001795904561160"&gt;shared her story&lt;/a&gt; of how Apple’s App Store review team repeatedly gaslit her, insisting there was an issue with the well-liked kids coding app that didn’t actually exist. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dBidQy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;What does Apple’s 30 percent buy you?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="56x8wm"&gt;On Wednesday, Apple made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22653264/apple-reader-app-exception-anti-steering-signup-page"&gt;a slightly more significant concession for (big) developers&lt;/a&gt;, and as Nick Heer writes, &lt;a href="https://pxlnv.com/linklog/reader-apps-external-subscriptions/"&gt;the company seems to have momentarily dropped its smug tone&lt;/a&gt;. But we don’t need to get into complex developer negotiations to point out the head-bangingly obvious ways Apple is falling down on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcpu9e"&gt;While the company claims the App Store is “curated by experts,” that it is “a safe and trusted place to discover and download apps,” and that it holds apps to “the highest standards for privacy, security, and content,” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;the company’s own emails&lt;/a&gt; paint a different picture. They show that Apple &lt;em&gt;knew&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;for years&lt;/em&gt; about the exact kind of egregious scams that bilk iPhone users out of millions of dollars, long before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;our report&lt;/a&gt;, and yet they keep failing to stop them from invading the App Store. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Usc0zv"&gt;It bears repeating: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22639629/tim-cook-apple-ten-years-decade-steve-jobs-legacy"&gt;Apple is the most valuable and profitable company in the world&lt;/a&gt;. The company currently makes $10,000 &lt;em&gt;every second&lt;/em&gt; on average, $3,600 of which is profit, a large portion of which comes from the App Store itself. (The App Store alone has been a bigger business than the Mac or iPad since 2016, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;see #10 here&lt;/a&gt;.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Te03HY"&gt;If Apple wanted to change this system, it could. But I expect Apple will only be dragged kicking and screaming into a world with a more functional App Store, because it seems incapable of taking the blindingly obvious steps that might better protect its users — again, despite being the most valuable and profitable company in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="240ykh"&gt;Here are eight to start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ltL8Vo"&gt;1. Hire an App Review team big enough to actually do the job&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VJ8UlH"&gt;Apple has 500 app reviewers. Just 500 against the entire world; 500 human beings expected to process 100,000 apps per week with some help from automated tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8qGlTN"&gt;Even if you were to give Apple the benefit of the doubt and assume that every one of them is a skilled, savvy surveyor sussing out scams in a snap, the math barely makes sense. Even though App Store reviewers typically work 10-hour days (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;#68&lt;/a&gt;), the sheer volume of apps means each reviewer would only get 15 minutes to evaluate each app — and only then if they worked without taking any breaks. (Documents also suggest they may work quite a bit of overtime.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8b5o8o"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a wetware rate limiting service and nothing more”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BnM9pK"&gt;Emails from the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial suggest App Review isn’t necessarily that savvy either, with Apple head of fraud Eric Friedman calling the department “a wetware rate limiting service and nothing more” (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;#60&lt;/a&gt;), and suggesting its goal is simply to get apps through the pipe. Other documents from the trial seem to back up that idea, repeatedly showing how the App Review team continually pushed for a faster “SLA” (service level agreement, a guarantee that it would review apps in a certain period of time) and sometimes made mistakes when they were working too quickly (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;#65&lt;/a&gt;), letting bad apps into the store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kLUdjJ"&gt;How big should Apple’s App Review team actually be? Hard to say, but Facebook says it has upwards of 15,000 content moderators, Google tells us it has over 20,000 reviewers across its many services, and even Twitter has 2,200 checkers, the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="020x4v"&gt;These other platforms admittedly have far more messages than Apple to review — but then again, none of them claim to offer “the highest standards for privacy, security and content” while testing entire programs that run on a pocket computer. Apple could likely do a better job with more reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHxgy5"&gt;And again, Apple is &lt;em&gt;the most valuable and profitable company in the world&lt;/em&gt;, unlike, say, Twitter. It’s pretty easy to argue that the number of moderators should be higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NygPZk"&gt;2. Police its most profitable apps for fraud&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sJVeyR"&gt;This isn’t rocket science. Anyone can do it. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;I did it&lt;/a&gt;. You can too. Just look for the apps on the App Store that are making the most money, find ones with suspicious user reviews, and inspect them for stupidly high subscription prices — say, $9.99 every single week for a wallpaper app that just repackages wallpapers you can download for free online. Congrats, you’ve found a scam!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfPJDp"&gt;The head of Apple’s App Review program wrote in January 2018 that “We need to think about how to stop this from happening,” referencing an entire 32-page presentation about how to trick users into paying for recurring subscriptions using apps that harvest wallpaper, horoscopes, and ringtones off the internet for free. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;#64&lt;/a&gt;) Yet we saw those same exact scams &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;still running three years later&lt;/a&gt;. When I asked Apple whether it ever goes back to check its top grossing apps for fraud, the company wouldn’t give me a straight answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2pGChJ"&gt;3. Automatic scam refunds&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Yv245B"&gt;A dark thought crossed my mind while reporting on App Store scams: maybe Apple doesn’t stop them because it’s more profitable to look the other way. There’s no evidence of that, but you know what Apple could do to eliminate that ugly idea entirely? Universal automatic scam refunds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BK3eq"&gt;When Apple retroactively removes scammy apps from the App Store — as it sometimes does when journalists and developers call them out — it should automatically give people back their money, and warn them to stop using those apps. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6f26b"&gt;That clearly isn’t what Apple does today. The company told me it has to review fraud on a case-by-case basis (read: not automatically) even when I specifically pointed out that Apple VP Kyle Andreer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1385062598178078723"&gt;told Congress under oath that it makes scammed customers whole again&lt;/a&gt;. Customers have the &lt;em&gt;option&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;ask&lt;/em&gt; for refunds, but how would they even know to do that, or even stop getting scammed, if Apple doesn’t tell them about the fraud? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="df7JEC"&gt;4. Stop auto-renewing subscriptions by default&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="INrgep"&gt;People hate pop-up messages. You know what kind of pop-up messages I &lt;em&gt;wouldn’t&lt;/em&gt; hate? Ones that ask me if I’d genuinely like to keep subscribing to an app or service before I get charged for another month. Every single time, I’d know the App Store was looking out for me, instead of looking out for the company that’s secretly hoping I’m the kind of customer who never bothers to check my credit card bill. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oGPBjL"&gt;I don’t expect Apple to actually do this, because I expect it would be losing out on an immense amount of profit, and might drive some of the most lucrative developers away from the platform — the kind that were leaving because they thought Apple already made it too easy to quit their service. But it would immediately fix the problems of so many people who, when they realized they’d been scammed, went to the reviews section of the App Store to complain that they didn’t know how to cancel their subscription. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="llAFmC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;If Apple truly cared, they’d take the same stance with people’s money as they do with privacy: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“Ask them. Ask them every time. Make them tell you to stop asking them if they get tired of your asking them.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Don’t auto-renew subscriptions by default.&lt;a href="https://t.co/DVOViWOtzu"&gt;https://t.co/DVOViWOtzu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382430603270778890?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 14, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5ehIAe"&gt;I think scam hunter Kosta Eleftheriou &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1382430603270778890"&gt;has it exactly right&lt;/a&gt;: “If Apple truly cared, they’d take the same stance with people’s money as they do with privacy,” the same stance that Apple CEO Steve Jobs himself articulated so clearly in 2010. “Ask them every time. Make them tell you to stop asking them if they get tired of your asking them,” Jobs said about privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="jSOniO"&gt;5. Stop selling ads atop App Store search results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="swDlkO"&gt;While it’s hard for me to be entirely sympathetic with Epic Games’ fight to secure more &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; profits, I believe CEO Tim Sweeney got one thing very right years before he sued. It is &lt;em&gt;ridiculous&lt;/em&gt; that the top App Store search result is almost never what you’re searching for — because another developer can pay Apple to take it away from you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tYBexY"&gt;Thread:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jZb3cG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Really, how did we get to this state? The store prioritizes ad revenue above user intent, so now developers buy ads in front of each others’ products so that exactly nobody’s search results lead to the actual thing they typed. Who in this cycle isn’t crazy?&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1019859186224594944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 19, 2018&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B0BPE7"&gt;It seems some developers have gotten wise to this, and by “wise” I mean given into Apple’s greed: Walmart and &lt;em&gt;PUBG Mobile&lt;/em&gt; appear to be paying for the ad slots above their own apps, so searching for them hilariously gives you the same exact app twice in a row. Can you believe Apple’s original plan to give 15 percent back to small developers (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;#11&lt;/a&gt;) was to give them store credit for these search ads? “We’ll let you have a portion of the advantage we give to richer companies who pay us” doesn’t sound that generous to me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2et1Bg"&gt;These search ads are plainly user-hostile, even if other search providers do it too — and Apple could make a serious statement about its commitment to users by eliminating them from the App Store.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="J08H7N"&gt;6. Lock underage users out of adult apps&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="E0UotH"&gt;In April, we wrote how Apple had unwittingly invited &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22395907/apple-match-three-game-gambling-marina-misko-vegas-pirates-lucky-stars%5D"&gt;secret gambling dens into the App Store that masqueraded as games for kids&lt;/a&gt;. Bait-and-switch apps aren’t an easy thing for Apple to protect against, so I can’t call that an egregious failure — though maybe they’d catch more of them if they had more reviewers, yeah?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7IvNAk"&gt;Anyway, the Tech Transparency Project recently discovered that minors don’t even have to stumble upon a secret gambling den to access illicit content — &lt;a href="https://www.techtransparencyproject.org/articles/apples-app-store-loopholes-put-children-risk"&gt;the App Store will serve up blatantly adult apps&lt;/a&gt; even if Apple already knows that a user is underage. Creating an Apple ID for a simulated 14-year-old, the Project found 37 adult apps that allowed them to sign up, including dating apps that showed explicit adult content and a casino game, and saw advertisements pop up for additional casino apps that were rated for the 17+ age group. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XQdwlj"&gt;According to trial documents, Apple’s head of fraud mentioned in February 2020 that the App Store had a problem with child predators, calling it an “under-resourced challenge” and also an “active threat.” (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22611236/epic-v-apple-emails-project-liberty-app-store-schiller-sweeney-cook-jobs"&gt;#71&lt;/a&gt;). Stopping minors from accessing certain apps wouldn’t be a silver bullet, but it feels like an obvious patch for an embarrassing hole: otherwise, why does Apple bother to collect our ages at all?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ZMdKR9"&gt;7. Bring back the “Report a problem” button&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="bJqzgW"&gt;And while we’re on the topic of people who actually identify scammy apps in the App Store and leave their unanswered pleas for help there: did you know the App Store &lt;a href="https://www.dummies.com/consumer-electronics/smartphones/iphone/how-to-report-an-app-problem-from-your-iphone/"&gt;used to have an actual “Report a problem” button&lt;/a&gt; on every single app? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OSaoMk"&gt;When I asked Apple about this, the company told me &lt;a href="http://reportaproblem.apple.com/"&gt;it still exists&lt;/a&gt;, but it feels like a joke by comparison. Here’s why:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="5n5jj9"&gt;The only way to naturally discover the new link is for users to scroll &lt;em&gt;all the way down&lt;/em&gt; to the bottom of the Apps or Games tab. You can’t even access it from your purchases tab.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="2IdYDw"&gt;It doesn’t actually open in the App Store itself; it launches a web browser, where you need to log in again. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BuSUQB"&gt;If you pick “Report suspicious activity,” the site redirects you to contact Apple Support instead of actually submitting a report.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZEDCrt"&gt;If you pick “Report a quality issue,” free-to-download apps are greyed out, with no way to click on them. Apple won’t let you report a scam unless you’ve already fallen for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="gDqQ8J"&gt;The only other options are “Request a refund” and “Find my content.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NzYVrn"&gt;If you pick “Request a refund,” none of the drop-down options allow you to report a scam.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="0Hb0Kz"&gt;It’s possible, even likely, that if Apple allowed &lt;em&gt;just anyone&lt;/em&gt; to report scams it would be inundated by false reports from rival developers. But Apple already fosters an environment where bad actors can game the system: buying up hundreds or thousands of fake star scores.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wlADW9"&gt;8. Kill off star ratings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MRtYYE"&gt;Star scores make platforms look &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt;. They allow people who like a product to quickly and easily give it a good “review” with a minimum of effort — unlike traditional reviews where many people only bother to write something when they’re frustrated and angry. Star scores can theoretically even out the bias towards negative reviews, making every product on a storefront look better than it would otherwise seem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="j3be36"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Stars let scams flourish&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BiHLwq"&gt;But they &lt;em&gt;also &lt;/em&gt;allow bad actors to destroy the integrity of the system, because it’s impossible for most people to tell whether an actual user, a robot, or a paid stooge added that 5-star rating. There’s no name to check, no language requirement, no meaningful accountability. So it’s no surprise that some of the most egregious App Store scams &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/21/22385859/apple-app-store-scams-fraud-review-enforcement-top-grossing-kosta-eleftheriou"&gt;we described in April&lt;/a&gt; had seemingly thousands of fake 5-star reviews propping them up — to the point that an app with a 4.5-star rating in the App Store would have actually been rated a 1.7 if you looked at the written reviews.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JYX4SZ"&gt;So far, Apple’s solution has been to purge fake ratings, and seemingly after the fact. But it could also just purge star scores to begin with, and find a better way — like, say, only allowing positive reviews from people who’ve used an app for a certain length of time. Other platforms like Amazon and Google have similar star score problems; this is an opportunity for Apple to lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="viGJxT"&gt;
&lt;p id="pctceP"&gt;In May, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fnewsroom%2F2021%2F05%2Fapp-store-stopped-over-1-5-billion-in-suspect-transactions-in-2020%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F3%2F22654197%2Fapple-app-store-editorial-scams-refunds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple reported&lt;/a&gt; that it stopped $1.5 billion in potentially fraudulent transactions before they went through, permanently banned a million accounts, terminated hundreds of thousands of developer accounts, and rejected nearly a million risky apps in 2020 alone. It clarified to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that that $1.5 billion was directly attributable to Apple, too, not just payment processors automatically doing their job. They sound like impressive numbers for a single year on the job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wR4iQ2"&gt;But the App Store still contains obvious issues that anyone can see. If the company wants to justify a 30 percent cut in the name of keeping customers safe, it should embrace some obvious solutions too; ones that vividly show Apple puts people &lt;em&gt;ahead&lt;/em&gt; of profits, instead of the other way around. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iSxLqX"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

The new lineup originates from Signify’s 2019 acquisition of &lt;a href="https://www.wizconnected.com/en/consumer/"&gt;Wiz&lt;/a&gt;, and carries the “Wiz Connected” logo on its blue packaging to differentiate it from Hue products. A similar collection of bulbs &lt;a href="https://www.signify.com/en-us/our-company/news/press-releases/2020/20200827-wiz-launches-a-brand-new-generation-of-products"&gt;launched in the US at Home Depot stores&lt;/a&gt; at this time last year, only under a slightly tweaked “Philips WiFi LED” name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dv8LPb"&gt;Signify assured &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; during a press briefing that they’ve tested the multitude of Philips smart LED brands with consumers and they weren’t confused. That’s good, because Zigbee-based Philips Hue smart LED bulbs and Wi-Fi-based Philips Smart LED bulbs are not compatible.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of the many new Philips Smart LED bulbs now available.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="y5jVUW"&gt;At launch there are 36 products (individual bulbs and multi-packs) launching under the Philips Smart LED brand in Europe that undercut comparable Hue bulbs on price. These include basics like the 60W E27 warm white dimmable bulb for €9.99, a 50W GH10 tunable white frosted spot for €13.99, a 2-pack of 50W GU10 color frosted spots for €29.99, and a gold 25W E27 decorative white filament bulb for €54.99. Signify says that Philips Smart LED bulbs should be available to buy today from most retailers that already sell regular LED bulbs. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LYO0RxsOWrseNKZFFbcJLJDNADc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22823537/Wiz_range_of_bulbs.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A selection of Wiz-branded bulbs which also includes ceiling and table lights, and more.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5dyVtH"&gt;Signify also sells dozens upon dozens of &lt;a href="https://www.wizconnected.com/en/consumer/products/"&gt;Wiz-branded lights and accessories&lt;/a&gt; that differ in availability by region. The Wiz lighting collection includes temperature- and color-changing bulbs of all sizes, spots, ceiling lights, decorative filaments, lightstrips, and luminaries. Wiz accessories include smart plugs, remotes, motion sensors, and in-wall dimmers. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wiz Hero Gen 2 table lamp is available today in the US and Europe.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="98vQaj"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.signify.com/global/our-company/news/press-releases/2021/20210903-a-home-filled-with-smart-light-signify-unveils-new-easy-to-use-wiz-smart-lighting-products"&gt;added a few new items today&lt;/a&gt; including the Wiz Hero Gen 2 (€49.99 / $49.99) and Squire (€54.99 / $59.99) table lamps, a slim ceiling light, and its first smart plug with an embedded power meter (€19.99) that will let you monitor energy consumption within the Wiz app when it launches on October 1st in Europe and the US.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Signify&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Walmart is also getting in on the Wiz Connected action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IJOg3Y"&gt;Wiz Connected bulbs can also be found from a number of partners. Notably, Walmart Canada sells Wiz Connected bulbs under the “&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.ca%2Fsearch%3Fq%3Dwiz&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F9%2F3%2F22654576%2Fphilips-smart-led-bulbs-price-sizes-signify" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Great Value&lt;/a&gt;” brand. &lt;a href="https://www.liteline.com/page/OnCloud"&gt;Liteline&lt;/a&gt; and the UK’s &lt;a href="https://www.4liteuk.com/products/wiz"&gt;4Lite&lt;/a&gt; are also signed on as a partners.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5h60qS"&gt;As mentioned earlier, the collections are incompatible despite sharing the Philips name: Philips Smart LED bulbs can’t be controlled by the Philips Hue app, and Philips Hue bulbs can’t be controlled by the WiZ app. Fortunately, the Wiz / Philips Smart LED collections, like Philips Hue, supports Alexa and Google Assistant voice assistants, IFTTT, and SmartThings to help mask the incompatibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vEeJpY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Matter could improve compatibility&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CrNPD9"&gt;Compatibility across Philips brands could change in the future since both Wiz and Philips Hue have committed to supporting the interoperable Matter smart home protocol when it launches in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/13/22623275/matter-interoperable-smart-home-standard-delay-2022-project-chip-csa"&gt;first half of 2022&lt;/a&gt;. However, Signify has committed to &lt;a href="https://www.signify.com/global/our-company/news/press-releases/2021/20210512-complete-philips-hue-range-to-be-compatible-with-new-smart-home-connectivity-standard-matter"&gt;updating the complete range of Hue devices to Matter&lt;/a&gt;, while only &lt;a href="https://www.signify.com/en-ca/our-company/news/press-releases/2021/20210515-wiz-among-first-smart-lighting-players-to-adopt-industry-unifying-technology-matter"&gt;committing to new devices for Wiz&lt;/a&gt;. That’s likely because all Hue devices will support Matter after updating the Hue Bridge in homes, whereas hub-less Wiz devices must be updated individually since each product is fitted with its own &lt;a href="https://www.wizconnected.com/en/oem/"&gt;WiZ module&lt;/a&gt;. Signify is looking into my query about future interoperability under Matter but didn’t have an answer in time for publication.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nightslink is an uncanny slice of retro-game horror</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Nightslink screenshot of a man in a suit smoking in a hallway." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rEgiTsTPb2jjWpFNUiWXc1b4gDI=/300x0:1919x1079/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69812500/ss_6ab182c7b51275b56d4b379ac4a9709b1b310482.1920x1080.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Noiseminded&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="57Wnpk"&gt;In 1982, Giallo master Dario Argento directed a slasher film called &lt;em&gt;Tenebrae&lt;/em&gt;, or “darkness.” &lt;em&gt;Tenebrae &lt;/em&gt;unfolds like many other Italian horror movies of the period, but in the years after, Argento told interviewers that it actually took place in a near-future where the human race has been depopulated by an unspoken tragedy. It’s a weird and arguably irrelevant addition to the film’s concrete plot — but one that recasts it as part of something bigger and stranger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kGLMZm"&gt;I remembered this bit of trivia after finishing &lt;em&gt;Nightslink,&lt;/em&gt; an enigmatic little game that was released in late August. &lt;em&gt;Nightslink&lt;/em&gt; is about the nocturnal life of an anonymous man referred to as a “nightslink,” which might be a job title, a social role, or an epithet. The nightslink’s job is to visit a seemingly normal apartment building and deliver mysterious audiotapes that are both highly sought and slightly feared. If you read the game’s summary, this is also apparently all taking place after the apocalypse. But &lt;em&gt;Nightslink’s &lt;/em&gt;strength is its delicate, evocative ambiguity — its ability to hint at a story that’s more complex than its half-hour of gameplay could possibly hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SjFroF"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nightslink&lt;/em&gt;, developed almost entirely by a Portuguese developer known as Noiseminded, is a first-person walking game that’s essentially about knocking on doors. It’s part of a horror subgenre that mimics the &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/overview-of-49375996?l=it"&gt;grimy low-poly look&lt;/a&gt; of early PlayStation titles, evoking the 2018 game &lt;em&gt;Paratopic&lt;/em&gt;. (To add to the similarities, &lt;em&gt;Paratopic&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Nightslink&lt;/em&gt; are also both about delivering creepy tapes, although the former is longer and more narratively complicated.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hy9PV6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;‘Nightslink’ plays with the ambiguity of its retro aesthetic&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="y1WYbP"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://leafthief.itch.io/turnpike-north/devlog/212145/setting-up-the-hpsxrp"&gt;“haunted PS1”&lt;/a&gt; style has an inherent unreality. Even if a game takes place in the mundane world, its buildings are often flattened into blocky dystopian abstractions, while people and props are pared to their &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt;-functional essence. &lt;em&gt;Nightslink&lt;/em&gt; plays with that uncanniness. Nearly the whole game is set in an empty hallway that seems frozen in the 1980s, its windows looking out onto a fog-wreathed wall of unremarkable tower blocks. But something is deeply wrong with all of this, and it will slowly consume the occupants’ lives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wU4ew"&gt;Over four evenings (apparently, since we never see the daylight), your nightslink appears with a stack of tapes and a list of apartment numbers. The building’s residents hold cryptic, one-sided conversations from behind their doors, hinting at conflicts and aspirations somehow bound up with the tapes. The game is linear, but you can find optional conversations that slightly reshape the story. Its hidden pieces are just visible enough that they’ve drawn me back to &lt;em&gt;Nightslink’s&lt;/em&gt; tiny world several times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ehj29F"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nightslink&lt;/em&gt; doesn’t feel like it’s meant to be totally unraveled. Your conversations reference details that only add to the mystery of how people function in this world. (Who does the man in one apartment work for? Why does the nightslink make these deliveries for free? What kind of apocalypse, exactly, is it post?) Instead, &lt;em&gt;Nightslink&lt;/em&gt; combines game-like exploration with the feel of a short story or film — delivering a narrative that pays off thematically without severing its many loose ends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMPykB"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Nightslink&lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; is available for Windows on &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1612920/NIGHTSLINK/?ltclid=a5660113-4460-439b-94d1-fc9c594b2e06"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Steam&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt; and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;a href="https://noiseminded.itch.io/nightslink?ltclid=c9e06641-cc45-4b9b-a09d-f5bf3d971d71"&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Itch.io&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Loot is a viral social network that looks like nothing you’ve ever seen</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LH2AofbedMnUhPBBKHwHWg780Ow=/0x0:2900x1933/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69812418/E_EPLqiVIAMuvBv.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/supergremplin/status/1432443098974461956" target="_blank"&gt;@supergremplin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Vine creator Dom Hofmann’s new project, explained&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="l9JDio"&gt;Today, let’s talk about the latest project from a co-founder of Vine and what it tells us about how the tech industry is evolving. This is a rare tech story where basically every fact of it has surprised me on some level. And while some of the ideas here are &lt;em&gt;way&lt;/em&gt; out there — to the point that I’m imagining many of you slamming your laptops closed to avoid hearing any more — the far frontier they represent appears to be inching closer to the mainstream every day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="kyFOcW"&gt;The road to Loot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hV3HCn"&gt;When &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/the-tiny-tokens-challenging-platform"&gt;I wrote in March about non-fungible tokens&lt;/a&gt;, or NFTs, I tried to dazzle you by rattling off some of the more impressive sales numbers from the time: $600,000 for the Nyan Cat meme, $5.8 million for artwork by Grimes, $230 million in lifetime sales for&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/28/230-million-dollars-spent-on-nba-top-shot.html"&gt; NBA Top Shot&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XJc6gT"&gt;What has happened since then has been enough to make some of those numbers look minuscule by comparison. On Thursday, the owners of an NFT associated with the original&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doge_(meme)"&gt; doge meme&lt;/a&gt;, which had been purchased for $4 million in June, sold partial ownership in the piece via tokens. (Coindesk&lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2021/09/02/record-doge-nft-sale-highlights-growing-demand-for-fractionalization/"&gt; has a great explanation of how this works&lt;/a&gt;.) Buyers snapped up the token, and now that single NFT is valued at &lt;em&gt;$225 million&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R94KHT"&gt;Even as NFTs slipped out of the headlines in the mainstream press, then, the number of people creating, acquiring and trading them continued to grow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4VmSHt"&gt;That brings us to Dom Hofmann. Hofmann is best known as the co-creator of Vine, which helped to establish the short-form video format on mobile devices and became an incredible engine of meme culture along the way. Later he created &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/1/8/10739010/peach-cool-social-network"&gt;Peach&lt;/a&gt;, a pop-up social network that remained beloved by its users far after its brief moment in the spotlight faded. More recently he worked on an effort to revive Vine as an app called Byte; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/26/22250926/clash-buys-byte-vine-successor-dom-hofmann"&gt;it sold earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QEpr7k"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even as NFTs slipped out of the headlines, they’ve continued to grow&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RMdX1B"&gt;Like a lot of software engineers, Hofmann had kept tabs on the world of cryptocurrencies as they evolved over the past decade, occasionally buying coins to better understand how they work. In the last decade, most of the focus on the blockchain was related to the original project: Bitcoin. More recently, though, developers have grown fond of an alternative blockchain, Ethereum, which is designed to let them create decentralized applications through more sophisticated smart contracts than Bitcoin enables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xClgEn"&gt;For the first few years after Ethereum was invited, nothing much materialized that would be of great interest to the mainstream. But then&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cdixon/status/1427452459635548164"&gt; a bunch of companies&lt;/a&gt; started growing really quickly last year by building decentralized finance apps on its blockchain, over a handful of months that came to be known as “DeFi summer.” (The worst part of writing about blockchain technologies is every single name involved.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QSjjlz"&gt;After that happened, Ethereum became like any other platform that had suddenly proven itself capable of generating huge amounts of money: it started to attract developers in droves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9gt85l"&gt;Hofmann was one of them. In December, he began to teach himself Solidity, the programming language for creating&lt;a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp"&gt; smart contracts&lt;/a&gt; on Ethereum. He also sold an art piece he had created as an NFT and enjoyed the process. As he created, he became more and more interested in using NFTs to inspire decentralized creative projects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNjo3i"&gt;In March, he created&lt;a href="https://www.blitmap.com/"&gt; Blitmap&lt;/a&gt;, which he described as a “community-created fantasy universe.” It wound up serving as a kind of blueprint for what Loot would become.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y882eT"&gt;Working with 16 other artists, Hofmann created 100 32-by-32 pixel images combining elements of science fiction and fantasy; those were then “remixed” into 1,600 “siblings.” The idea was to use the Blitmaps as the basis for a kind of blockchain version of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, turning characters into merchandise, games. The project was a modest hit — the cheapest Blitmap today&lt;a href="https://market.blitmap.com/"&gt; costs about $98,000&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y52sNN"&gt;More importantly, it set the stage for what was to come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Mv5aF6"&gt;Loot drops&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="2bNlPe"&gt;One of Hofmann’s other side projects in recent years was to create a text-based adventure of the sort that served as the basis for some of the original video games. As part of the development process, he wrote a random item generator: a piece of software that would return names for various weapons, pieces of armor, and accessories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qBxbIi"&gt;Since Blitmap’s launch, Hofmann had been thinking about other novel ways to promote the creation of blockchain-based art and communities to surround them. One idea he had was to let people create (or “mint,” in blockchain-speak) NFTs based on his random-item generator for free — essentially just to see what would happen. He would not provide any art work or any instructions on what to do with them. And he would give these “bags” of items away for free, minus the transaction fees required by the Ethereum network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E19wnQ"&gt;“A lot of people have been wanting some sort of game that takes place in a fantasy realm, or a science-fiction realm,” he told me. “They want it to be compatible with with other realms. They want to be able to build on top of that. They want to know that the items that they have will always be with them. [I was] just kind of building in that direction. It was an experiment.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQKZhO"&gt;His only real goal, he said, was that people would choose to mint all the bags he made available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dvUoS1"&gt;Last Friday night, Hofmann announced Loot in a tweet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VTkMrm"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;LOOT&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- randomized adventurer gear&lt;br&gt;- no images or stats. intentionally omitted for others to interpret&lt;br&gt;- no fee, just gas&lt;br&gt;- 8000 bags total&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;opensea: &lt;a href="https://t.co/qSnRJ1FD0n"&gt;https://t.co/qSnRJ1FD0n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;etherscan: &lt;a href="https://t.co/bF9p0RSHX2"&gt;https://t.co/bF9p0RSHX2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;available via contract only. not audited. mint at your own risk &lt;a href="https://t.co/uLukzFayUK"&gt;pic.twitter.com/uLukzFayUK&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— dom (@dhof) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1431316631934967815?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OYz8mZ"&gt;An uncharitable way of describing all this is to say that Hofmann created a way to let people pay the Ethereum network to return a list of useless names to them. But Hofmann’s fans saw it very differently, and quickly turned Loot into a phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fe9Bcg"&gt;The 7,777 bags that Hofmann offered up for minting were all snapped up more or less instantly. In the next five days, &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/01/the-latest-nft-fad-is-a-text-based-fantasy-game-building-block/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coindesk&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;, Loot bags were resold for $46 million, and had a market cap of $180 million. On Wednesday, the cheapest Loot bag could be had for about $20,000. That price more than doubled overnight, and would now cost more than $46,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="olPWni"&gt;So far, this seems like any other NFT story: &lt;em&gt;weird artwork is released, price goes up quickly&lt;/em&gt;. What makes Loot different is the number and variety of projects that have spun up around it at a staggering speed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QC0b5Q"&gt;First, of course, people started drawing pictures of the Loot bags: &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/supergremplin/status/1432443098974461956?s=20"&gt;some by hand&lt;/a&gt;, and some by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/moesalih_/status/1433141553443352576"&gt;artificial intelligence-generated pixel art&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;sorry can't stop thinking about Loot - this is a real quick take on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hype_eth?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@hype_eth&lt;/a&gt; 's #1 rarity bag in a Derbler style stash &lt;a href="https://t.co/G6IvnQYfU7"&gt;pic.twitter.com/G6IvnQYfU7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— gremplin (@supergremplin) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/supergremplin/status/1432443098974461956?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P6D65G"&gt;Then they began to create&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/divineroles"&gt; guilds&lt;/a&gt; based on the items found in their bags. Owners of ”divine robes,” of which there are only 396 in Loot, &lt;a href="https://divineroles.com/"&gt;set up their own community&lt;/a&gt; — along with a&lt;a href="https://robes.market/"&gt; storefront for robe purchase&lt;/a&gt; (cheapest price: $169,142).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0BoL5H"&gt;Then, they used smart contracts to let people sell individual items from within their Loot bags to, as the creator put it, “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonjyan/status/1433205141029761026"&gt;upgrade your adventurer&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6eF245"&gt;At this point I feel it necessary to point out that there are no adventurers in Loot. There is no &lt;em&gt;game&lt;/em&gt; in Loot. There are just items, and pictures of those items, and tens of millions of dollars betting that it will all somehow turn into something much more. As one tweet put it: “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/redefined_life/status/1433068152443834373"&gt;Loot is NFT improv.&lt;/a&gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="G96kiZ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Introducing Lootmart™ a collab with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rvorias?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@rvorias&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/lootproject?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@lootproject&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="obuoZw"&gt;Now the question is whether Loot will somehow evolve backwards from a set of in-game items to an actual, playable experience. If so, who will develop it? And how? For the moment, no one really knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1ei7KC"&gt;“Obviously, games are very involved,” said Hofmann, who has been monitoring all these developments as a moderator of Loot’s thriving Discord server. “It remains to be seen what’s done with that, but it’s definitely a possibility. I think it would be really cool.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tc1Esi"&gt;One thing that interests him is seeing whether Loot items can span different games built by different people — a concept which is key to what tech leaders this summer &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22588022/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-ceo-metaverse-interview"&gt;have taken to calling the metaverse&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d9qGB1"&gt;A key aspect of making that happen is to make Loot more accessible — the vast majority of people being unwilling to spend thousands of dollars to participate. On Wednesday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1433110412187287560"&gt;Hofmann announced “synthetic Loot”&lt;/a&gt; — essentially, a replica Loot bag that can be claimed by anyone who sets up an Ethereum wallet for free.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGbJlQ"&gt;“Creators building on top of Loot can choose to recognize Synthetic Loot as a way to allow a wider range of adventurers to participate in the ecosystem, while still being able to easily differentiate between ‘original’ Loot and Synthetic Loot,” he&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dhof/status/1433110413827317762"&gt; tweeted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="g1EzBN"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Future games&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mgFb1Q"&gt;So what next? Hofmann says he has no plans to shift full time to working on Loot. Due to the decentralized nature of the project, he’s not sure he could truly steer the community, even if he wanted to. (He remains the biggest shareholder in the project, due to the hundreds of bags he has yet to release for minting.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5BWpA8"&gt;“I’m not leading the project,” he said. “I’m providing guidance, when wanted.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mn6ZCI"&gt;Mostly, he says, he’s just interested to see what the community does next.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6JE9Ac"&gt;&lt;q&gt;How much will these folks ultimately be willing to contribute to building a world?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Aj3CKv"&gt;One question I had is whether you can build giant fictional worlds this way. Right now the NFT market is full of speculators hoping to flip their acquisitions for a quick profit. There is more than a little of the mania that fueled this winter’s meme stock enthusiasm to be found on the crypto Discords. (More than a little cynicism among the investors, too.) How much will these folks ultimately be willing to contribute to building a world?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1Wuq4i"&gt;But it’s also true that plenty of people get deeply involved in fictional worlds without owning the underlying intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCZgdR"&gt;“At the end of the day, these are just items on a list,” Hofmann said. “It’s just what people do with it and how they ascribe value to it. And value doesn’t have to be a dollar amount. It can be many things.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3SYLJT"&gt;Of course, it’s also possible that the bottom falls out: that the frothy Loot market won’t be able to sustain itself. Perhaps owning these artificially scarce goods won’t prove as attractive over the long run as they have been to collectors in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8KiVP"&gt;But this has always been the bear case for the blockchain: that eventually enthusiasm for it would fizzle out, and everyone would lose their money. I’ve never been quite that bearish myself, but I get it: to the average person, it’s still not clear what anybody needs a blockchain for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lo5fdq"&gt;The thing that has always stopped me from being a blockchain bear is that each year, the number of smart people I know who are developing on it goes up. With every month that goes by, a bet on the failure of Ethereum means betting against a growing number of talented people. The odds on that bet don’t feel great to me today — and they’re getting worse all the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CxbSAA"&gt;With projects with Loot, we can begin to see something new coming into focus: an open-source … &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; with potentially broad appeal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybrQAr"&gt;On his blog, gaming company founder Kyle Russell&lt;a href="https://collisions.substack.com/p/gimme-the-loot"&gt; envisioned a successor to Marvel’s cinematic universe popping up on a project like Loot&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HubNRG"&gt;Assuming the project’s originators went with the direction of the Loot zeitgeist, all of this would be [intellectual property] that could be re-used and remixed by anyone. That might sounds crazy — isn’t the point to own it, and the point of owning it is to control how it’s used?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AqQECe"&gt;That’s the Disney status quo. In a world of projects like Loot, you want to reinforce the value of the NFT you own — and that value reflects that NFT’s renown and reputation. Echoing the phrase “all press is good press”: any remix is a good remix. To be referenced is to still be culturally relevant. So if you own an NFT describing Arachnid Person, you want to contribute to an environment where as many people want to include Arachnid Person in their works as possible so that Arachnid Man #1 becomes something worth owning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mXu4S3"&gt;In the meantime, for the couple thousand people who managed to acquire them, Loot has been life-changing. Jackson Dame, who is the content and community manager at the cryptocurrency wallet&lt;a href="https://rainbow.me/"&gt; Rainbow&lt;/a&gt;, told me he had only started paying attention to cryptocurrencies eight months ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sk88Kk"&gt;Dame, 28, followed Hofmann’s work closely — he loved Blitmap — and was able to secure some Loot bags as part of the initial release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mv6WTH"&gt;“He was doing something very different with a lot of creative depth in comparison to most NFT projects,” Dame said. “So I sensed it had longer-lasting potential.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vY8Q9U"&gt;After the price spiked, Dame sold part of his collection for six figures — he landed two divine robes, among other things — and was able to pay off his debts and contribute to his family members’ retirement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXfPY0"&gt;As for Hofmann, he continues to work on multiple projects. There’s a Blitmap release coming up soon, he said. And &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/supdrive?lang=en"&gt;he’s working on Supdrive&lt;/a&gt;, an effort to build a fantasy gaming console on the blockchain. In the meantime, he says he’ll work on Loot “as just another builder” — “finding new ways to iterate on it and expand it,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FW7psd"&gt;What he’s not doing is raising a bunch of venture capital and doing a traditional startup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="EE85QH"&gt;“Companies are difficult,” he said. “I’m enjoying having a respite from that.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s rumored AR/VR headset might rely on a nearby iPhone or Mac for processing </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XZaGgOuMpBo3Q_YXEmxhCMfAvUs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69811742/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OJUD22"&gt;Apple’s rumored AR/VR headset is designed to rely on another device, and may have to offload more processor-heavy tasks to a connected iPhone or Mac, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apples-ar-vr-headset-will-need-connection-to-other-device-such-as-iphone"&gt;a report from &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Apple is reportedly working on a custom chip for the headset, an SoC that’s intentionally missing capabilities found in Apple’s other processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LX3luT"&gt;While the new chip reportedly doesn’t have Apple’s neural engine, which handles AI and machine learning, it’s reportedly designed to be &lt;em&gt;better&lt;/em&gt; at wirelessly sending and receiving data, and compressing/decompressing video than traditional chips, which makes sense if the headset is designed to stream data from another device rather than doing the heavy processing itself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZFa7pg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A stripped-down SoC for augmented battery&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="difQ8f"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;’s sources say it’s designed to be as power-efficient as possible for maximum battery life, something that both removing unused parts of the chip and streaming data from another device might help with. For wearable technology, like a watch or set of glasses, there’s always been a delicate balance between battery life and performance/capability. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/a/apple-watch-review"&gt;original Apple Watch&lt;/a&gt; handed off many tasks to a connected iPhone, though Apple was eventually able to make its onboard processor powerful enough to handle many of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jq6vJ0"&gt;If the idea of Apple’s headset relying on a separate device sounds familiar, it might be because of &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-19/apple-team-working-on-vr-and-ar-headset-and-ar-glasses?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;this 2020 &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt;, which mentioned that earlier versions of the headset were meant to work with a separate “stationary hub, which in prototype form resembled a small Mac,” until Jony Ive stepped in to say that it should be self-contained and Tim Cook sided with his design chief. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pEF5Cc"&gt;Ive no longer works for Apple, but that doesn’t necessarily mean Apple’s going back to a bulky or stationary hub: &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; reports the AR/VR headset still has its own CPU and GPU inside, and suggests it might be able to communicate with a phone or tablet or even work in a basic stand-alone mode. Some of Apple’s devices, like the Apple Watch, can still perform basic tasks in low battery mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="H2Ab96"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Think big picture&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="suzp5N"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; also reports that the device will have an “unusually large” image sensor, as big as one of the headset’s lenses, which has apparently been difficult to manufacture. It hasn’t shown up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22318239/apple-mixed-reality-headset-2022-analyst-kuo"&gt;in previous leaks&lt;/a&gt;, but the publication says it’s designed to “capture high-resolution image data from a user’s surroundings for AR”.  That might come in handy considering the headset is reportedly both an AR and VR device — since it’s difficult to do VR without completely obscuring the user’s view, and difficult to do AR without the user being able to see the outside world, the image sensor could be meant to provide a view of the user’s surroundings from inside the headset — similar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/23/22590794/oculus-mixed-reality-api-quest-2-development-kit-unity"&gt;Oculus’ passthrough view&lt;/a&gt;, but perhaps at higher quality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRKW00"&gt;While rumors about Apple working on an augmented reality device have been around for years, the idea is still coming into focus. Noted analyst Ming-Chi Kuo &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/7/22318239/apple-mixed-reality-headset-2022-analyst-kuo"&gt;has predicted&lt;/a&gt; that we’d see a “helmet-type” headset in 2022, but &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; says that the custom chips for the headset won’t be ready for mass production for at least a year. If that’s correct, even the best-case scenario would be an extremely tight turnaround to get a product out the door by the end of 2022, though that might still be possible if the first version is aimed at developers or a very limited number of early adopters. &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt; says that the sleeker glasses model could come out as soon as 2023, while Kuo predicts mid-2025. Unlike the “helmet-type” headset, the glasses device is rumored to be exclusively for AR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rWxWOP"&gt;As for what the headset will actually do, Apple CEO Tim Cook has long enthused about AR and how it will “&lt;a href="https://www.patentlyapple.com/patently-apple/2017/11/the-transcript-of-todays-opening-statement-from-apples-ceo-on-fiscal-q4-2017-is-now-available.html"&gt;transform the way you work, play, connect and learn&lt;/a&gt;,” and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vX9xBB_vBsc&amp;amp;t=433s"&gt;let people have “enhanced” conversations&lt;/a&gt;. Beyond that, we don’t really have a clear picture of what kind of AR/VR features or interface the company wants to implement. Without that, it’s hard to guess whether the device having to offload processing onto something else is destined to be just a quirk of early models, or a design decision that will stick around for years. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Roblox is getting voice chat, starting first with ‘Spatial Voice’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nkVsZu65YCUCM5UZNXIMjUHZ9Tc=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69811684/VRG_ILLO_4472_RobloxExplainer.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Grayson Blackmon / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9ARDJI"&gt;Roblox is taking its first steps to introduce voice chat by opening up a feature it’s calling “Spatial Voice” to select developers in an invitation-only beta, the company announced Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqoyN8"&gt;“With Spatial Voice, Roblox creators will begin to test developing experiences where conversations can happen in a realistic way, mirroring how we listen and respond to the world around us each day,” Roblox’s chief product officer Manuel Bronstein &lt;a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2021/09/future-communication-metaverse/"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. Based on this limited description, it sounds like Spatial Voice will attempt to reflect the way voices carry in the real world and require you to be close proximity to another player to speak to them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="aUVevY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Adding voice chat raises concerns about moderation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="68WCaA"&gt;Adding voice chat of any kind into &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; immediately raises concerns about how the company will moderate conversations, especially given &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21333431/roblox-over-half-of-us-kids-playing-virtual-parties-fortnite"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roblox’s&lt;/em&gt; massive popularity with children&lt;/a&gt;. But Roblox plans to roll out the feature slowly, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/02/roblox-voice-chat-spatial-audio/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, giving access first to 5,000 developers and all of them will be 13 or older. And in an interview with &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;, Bronstein suggested that the company may never give access to kids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RrngUx"&gt;“I think we want to take it slowly and we want to learn as we go through it,” Bronstein said. “We may start, as I mentioned, with the developers. It is likely that right after that, we may go to an audience that is 13 plus and park there for a while until we understand exactly if all the pieces are falling into place before deciding if we ever open it to a younger audience.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JwdnCy"&gt;As for moderation, Roblox will let users self-report issues. “Our community will be able to self-regulate and flag a user that is not adhering to community standards, and that user may be removed from an experience or lose speaking privileges,” Bronstein said in his blog. That could be a helpful tool to root out bad people, but it puts the onus of reporting on the users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9JKVc"&gt;Roblox is also planning a voice chat experience that will allow you to chat with your friends wherever they are in &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt; reports. That experience sounds more like what you might be used to if you’re hanging out with your buddies on Discord, where you can be playing different games but still hang out in the same voice channel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DGayUt"&gt;This broader voice chat will be apparently be bolstered by Roblox’s acquisition of the chat platform Guilded, &lt;a href="https://ir.roblox.com/news/news-details/2021/Roblox-Acquires-Guilded-a-Platform-to-Connect-Gaming-Communities/default.aspx"&gt;which it acquired in August&lt;/a&gt;. “Though Roblox’s work on voice pre-dates the acquisition, Guilded will lay the groundwork for Roblox’s future voice plans,” according to &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPu3U1"&gt;The addition of voice chat could make &lt;em&gt;Roblox&lt;/em&gt; an even more popular place to hang out and help it better compete with other metaverse-y games like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;. But in taking this slow approach, Roblox seems to trying to get ahead of challenges voice chat could bring the to platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2zAY88"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Roblox, explained","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22457264/roblox-explainer-game-app-faq"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Amazon is reportedly planning to release an Amazon-branded TV as soon as October</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/roAyLzrOELZFJ7jj7MxY9C3TJXE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69811531/acastro_190920_1777_amazon_0002.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2PqnnB"&gt;Amazon is set to release Amazon-branded TVs as soon as October in the US, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-close-to-launching-its-own-tv-in-the-us-2021-9?utmSource=twitter&amp;amp;utmContent=referral&amp;amp;utmTerm=topbar&amp;amp;referrer=twitter"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The TVs will have Alexa, screen sizes “in the range of 55 to 75 inches,” and will be designed and manufactured by third parties such as TCL, &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; reports. The company is also developing a TV designed in-house, &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; says, but it’s unclear when that might be released. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zpz2RO"&gt;Amazon already has many irons in the fire with TVs — it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607331/amazon-best-buy-toshiba-insignia-fire-tv-f50"&gt;partners with Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; to sell Toshiba and Insignia TVs that run Amazon’s Fire TV software, offers &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.in/AmazonBasics-139cm-inch-Ultra-Smart/dp/B087JYBBSR/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;amp;keywords=amazonbasics%2Btv&amp;amp;qid=1609453677&amp;amp;s=electronics&amp;amp;sr=1-2&amp;amp;th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;an AmazonBasics-branded TV in India&lt;/a&gt;, and has the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289197/amazon-fire-tv-stick-2020-review-features-specs-price"&gt;Amazon Fire TV Stick&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/21/17484412/amazon-fire-tv-cube-review-alexa-echo"&gt;Amazon Fire TV Cube&lt;/a&gt;, which you can hook up to your TV. But this rumored new Amazon-branded TV could indicate that the company is stepping up its television efforts to take on TV stalwarts like LG and Samsung more directly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybWQlH"&gt;Amazon didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Last year’s M1 MacBook Air is just one of many items on sale this Labor Day weekend.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2LBXuy"&gt;Labor Day deals are finally getting into full swing, with a slew of notable discounts going live on some major hardware and accessories across the tech spectrum. Whether you’re picking up some last-minute gear for school or preparing to hunker down for the fall TV season with your favorite streaming device, this weekend might be the last real opportunity for you to save some serious money on TVs, headphones, and other gadgets until Black Friday and Cyber Monday roll around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MzRWwT"&gt;To make sorting through the abundance of deals easier, we’ve curated a selection of the best Labor Day sales and deals available, the bulk of which should last through the long weekend. We’ve also rounded up the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/9/2/22653796/best-labor-day-2021-tv-sales-4k-led-qled-oled-deal"&gt;best Labor Day TV deals&lt;/a&gt;, whether you’re in need of an OLED, midrange QLED, or a cheaper LED TV.&lt;/p&gt;
