    <title>Google Pixel Stand (2nd gen) review: nice but not a must-have</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Fast wireless charging speeds and a few extras&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="X3CTvo"&gt;The latest Google Pixel Stand is less of a “must-have” accessory if you’re a Pixel phone owner and more of a “nice to have.” For $79, its primary job is fast wireless charging, and it does that well. But unless you’re a Pixel 6 or 6 Pro owner and you’re really sold on one of the stand’s handful of extra features supported by your phone, then you’d be better off saving your money and getting an inexpensive third-party charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EhDlH0"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10989360"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Yb6sUW"&gt;The aptly named Pixel Stand (2nd gen) is Google’s second take on a fast wireless charger built to complement its Pixel phones. You don’t have to own a Pixel phone to use it since it works with Qi-compatible gadgets, but you will need a 6 or a 6 Pro to get the fastest charging speeds. You’ll also need the January 2022 security update or later, which, if you’re a Pixel 6 owner, you’ll want to download &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22884219/google-january-2022-pixel-6-pro-update"&gt;for a whole bunch of reasons anyway&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OlOExJ"&gt;Like the original Pixel Stand, it does some multi-tasking while charging your phone. While your Pixel phone is docked on the stand, it can display images from your Google Photos albums to act as a kind of digital picture frame. During setup the first time you put your phone on the charger, you can specify which albums you’d like it to pull images from, and photos are displayed in batches of five to 10 at a time, slideshow style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wD-Yl8LoR0HDV4HqQbT8FrohMXE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23179777/ajohnson_220118_4974_0001.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel Stand setup enables extras like a digital picture frame feature.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kk0qEo"&gt;Other features are geared toward bedside use. There’s an option to automatically turn on “do not disturb” when the phone is placed on the charger, and you can have the display automatically turn off in a dark room. There’s also a “sunrise” alarm that gradually brightens your display in the 15 minutes before your alarm goes off. You can specify a window of time for this feature, so it isn’t applied to other alarms throughout the day — just your wake-up call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfsXCD"&gt;As for its main job — charging your phone — it does this effectively. I noticed some false starts here and there when I’d set the phone on the stand, and it would start charging, only to stop momentarily before picking it up again. This didn’t cause any problems; it just gave me a few moments of concern as I tried to figure out if it was mounted on the stand correctly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ye4F54"&gt;The Pixel Stand 2 offers 23W charging with the Pixel 6 Pro and 21W for the Pixel 6 — quite speedy for wireless charging on a phone that isn’t made by OnePlus. It took a totally depleted Pixel 6 Pro battery from zero to 100 percent in almost exactly two hours, which is impressive. My more typical day-to-day use case was topping off the battery on a Pixel 6, taking it from 70–80 percent back to 100 percent, which took around 30 minutes using the fastest charging mode. The Stand offers a slightly slower 15W charging for other Qi-compatible phones and devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GXOFatK4yyIffKIgqGvkhkZBTzM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23179780/ajohnson_220118_4974_0004.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stand displays images from the Google Photos albums that you specify.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ex0zMy"&gt;As for the extras, I like the photo frame feature more than I thought I would. I’m not sure I want to commit to owning and curating images for a dedicated digital picture frame, but I do happen to have dozens (okay, hundreds) of photos of my four-month-old on Google Photos that I like looking through. Having them displayed at my desk on my phone is kind of a nice middle ground — I get to actually see and appreciate the many, many photos I take without hassling with another device. I’m sure that my colleagues who review smart home tech could direct me to a number of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review"&gt;smart displays that do this kind of thing already&lt;/a&gt;, but I digress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vHnAFp"&gt;If I have one complaint about this feature, it’s that it tends to pick favorites and show those over and over. This might be because it favors portrait orientation photos, and I tend to shoot more landscape. In any case, you can tap the screen to end the current slideshow and swipe the lock screen to shuffle the selection and start a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/icgE98r_-WdagqtIglUJ6N49ZXg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23179783/ajohnson_220118_4974_0006.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Features like the option to automatically enable “do not disturb” when the phone is docked make the Stand a good bedside companion.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wvoTZZ"&gt;The Stand’s nightstand-oriented features work well, too. The sunrise alarm is a pleasant way to wake up, and the ability to detect a dark room and turn off the screen accordingly makes it a good bedside companion. But these features feel a little at odds with the Stand’s main draw: fast wireless charging. If I’m charging my phone overnight, then I don’t need the absolute fastest speeds. I wouldn’t see the photo frame feature much either since my phone doesn’t spend much time on the bedside dock during the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IroSZX"&gt;I also encountered a couple of problems with Google Assistant while using the stand. After I tap the Assistant icon on the lock screen while docked, the phone will register my voice commands but will unhelpfully ignore everything it just heard me say and display “How can I help?” text on the screen. Accessing the assistant by saying, “Hey Google,” on the lock screen works just fine, though, and that’s not a Stand feature — just something you can enable on any Pixel phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MeVIRlybIoUgasfTZbHji52Pnmk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23179779/ajohnson_220118_4974_0003.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The second-gen Stand includes a built-in fan.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cTaFVJ"&gt;Then there’s the built-in fan; it’s fairly quiet, but if the fan is running at full speed, the assistant struggles to hear me at all. You can choose a quiet charging mode to avoid this, but then you’re missing out on those super-fast charging speeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="gcyAv4"&gt;The Pixel Stand 2 isn’t inexpensive: at $79, it’s well more than the $30-ish standard Qi charging stands you can find on Amazon. If you own a Pixel 6 or 6 Pro, really want fast wireless charging, and think you’d particularly like any of the extras that the Stand (2nd gen) offers, then you’ll probably find its 80 bucks well spent. But if you’re only mildly interested in the bedside or photo frame features and fast wireless charging isn’t essential, save yourself some money and go for a standard Qi charger. You could even add a digital picture frame to your cart for the same cost, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here are the best AirPods deals you can get right now</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xuyyq2uKdLAhw_sX1Ij4bBYJxio=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/67012056/cwelch_191031_3763_0003.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s AirPods Pro wireless earbuds are a go-to pick that’s often on sale.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EMp8N7"&gt;Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and the holidays may have come and gone, but there are still some great discounts available on Apple’s AirPods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SziSp1"&gt;Since Apple launched the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22671344/apple-new-airpods-3-spacial-audio-specs-price-release-date-features"&gt;third-gen AirPods&lt;/a&gt; in October and unveiled its new AirPods lineup, we’ve seen the starting price of the second-gen, entry-level model drop from $159 to $129. Even better, we’ve seen many retailers starting to heavily discount the second-gen AirPods as well as the more expensive AirPods Pro and Max, which offer noise cancellation and better sound quality than the standard model. We’ve even recently seen some significant discounts on the third-gen AirPods, despite how recently they launched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ0Ffb"&gt;Here, we’ll run through the best deals available on each model, including the entry-level AirPods, the AirPods Pro, the third-gen AirPods, and the AirPods Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Si36Ca"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here are the best Apple Watch deals right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals"},{"title":"The best deals on MacBooks right now","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"},{"title":"Which AirPods should you buy?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733797/airpods-2-3-pro-max-which-to-buy"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="VFDHZw"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10742787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ej2msf"&gt;The best entry-level &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/29/18286012/apple-airpods-2-new-2nd-gen-review-price-specs-features"&gt;AirPods&lt;/a&gt; (second-gen) deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="eg29V6"&gt;Once $159, Apple recently lowered the list price of the second-gen AirPods — now the entry-level model — to $129. It only sells the model with a wired charging case, however, which charges via a standard Lightning cable. Despite their age, we found these easy-to-use earbuds offer great wireless performance and reliable battery life, making them a great pick if you can live without a wireless charging case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtXs0h"&gt;Although we’ve seen Apple’s most affordable pair of AirPods drop to $90 — their lowest price to date — the second-gen earbuds are currently only &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-AirPods-Charging-Latest-Model/dp/B07PXGQC1Q/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1155135/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals123021&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-2nd-generation%2F-%2FA-84852693"&gt;Target for $109.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is just $20 less than their typical asking price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Evae3q"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9502973"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eG2fnz"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22744686/apple-airpods-third-gen-review"&gt;AirPods (third-gen)&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="d2yjBK"&gt;The newest pair of wireless earbuds support Apple’s MagSafe technology. The short stems yield a more subtle design, while improved sound and features like sweat and water resistance, support for spatial audio with dynamic head tracking, and improved battery life render them a nice improvement over the last-gen model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QiPrKN"&gt;Deals were once hard to come by on the third-gen model, but we finally started seeing some significant deals starting around Black Friday and Cyber Monday. Sadly, like the second-gen AirPods, they’re currently only available for slightly less than MSRP. At the moment, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1668152-REG%2Fapple_mme73am_a_airpods_with_charging_case.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F21302051%2Fbest-apple-airpods-deals" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MME73AM-A-AirPods-3rd-Generation/dp/B09JQL3NWT/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon are selling them for $169&lt;/a&gt;, while &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1230713/2092?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals010422&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-true-wireless-bluetooth-headphones-3rd-generation%2F-%2FA-77603772"&gt;Target has them for $169.99&lt;/a&gt;, just $10 shy of their full retail price and a far cry from their all-time low of $139.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Q2OXRZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10744075"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Iewbkw"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20942472/apple-airpods-pro-review-design-price-specs-features-noise-cancellation"&gt;AirPods Pro&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="S8o5q4"&gt;We think Apple’s premium true wireless earbuds, the AirPods Pro, are the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21309820/best-wireless-earbuds"&gt;best wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; an iPhone owner can buy, regardless of the price. They have better sound quality than the models above, offer active noise cancellation, and come with a wireless charging case. The earbuds also support &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498931/apple-spatial-audio-airpods-pro-surround-sound-quick-auto-switching"&gt;Apple’s spatial audio&lt;/a&gt; feature, which adds an immersive surround sound effect to select content, and come with swappable silicone tips.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bM8uVd"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/18/22733183/apple-magsafe-charging-case-airpods-pro-qi"&gt;recently launched a new version&lt;/a&gt; of the AirPods Pro with a wireless charging case that supports Apple’s MagSafe technology, just like the third-gen AirPods. These retail for $249, but you can buy them right now for $189.99 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JQMJHXY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fapple-airpods-pro-with-magsafe%2F-%2FA-77603773&amp;amp;subid1=Verge"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/612734/9383?subId1=VergeBestAirPodsDeals123021&amp;amp;sourceid=imp_000011112222333344&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-AirPods-Pro-with-MagSafe-Charging-Case%2F975690481&amp;amp;veh=aff" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. That’s not nearly as low as the $159 price we saw this model drop to during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but it’s still $59 off what you’d pay if you were to purchase the earbuds directly from Apple. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="THtgJp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="gxlsti"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"AirPods Pro 2 may come with lossless audio support and a charging case that makes sound","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/2/22863442/airpods-pro-2-lossless-audio-charging-case-sound"},{"title":"Apple selling new AirPods Pro coinciding with the Year of the Tiger in certain markets","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/3/22864887/apple-new-airpods-pro-year-of-the-tiger"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="x5NHYH"&gt;The best &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features"&gt;AirPods Max&lt;/a&gt; deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="ESUeUd"&gt;The AirPods Max aren’t the iconic in-ear style that has become synonymous with the AirPods name. They’re large and luxurious, comprised of aluminum, steel, and mesh fabric that remains comfortable during extended listening sessions. They also sport excellent noise cancellation, Apple’s spatial audio feature, and a wide, balanced sound, even if they lag behind some of their peers when it comes to bass response. They’re not the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt; for most people — blame the $550 sticker price — but it’s hard to find a pair of Bluetooth headphones that sound better and feature more intuitive controls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KBAAwB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10361602"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="irGZgJ"&gt;Although the AirPods Max were discounted to $429 on Amazon during Black Friday and Cyber Monday, prices have since increased. Still, the Max are &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Space/dp/B08PZJN7BD?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on sale in blue at Amazon for $449&lt;/a&gt; — just $20 shy of their best price ever — and in most other colorways for $479. You can also &lt;a href="https://www.microcenter.com/search/search_results.aspx?Ntt=airpods+max"&gt;buy them in various colors at Micro Center for $449.99&lt;/a&gt;, though they’re only available for in-store pickup in select states.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Mpx47T"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0mvFWM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Digital cash gets a look from the Fed  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the United States of America flag seen on a phone with dollar bills behind it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4hrZYJ6xvWFnUYSrhd3t38xJTjw=/0x15:5000x3348/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70419080/1232471340.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;It goes over the pros of a federally-backed digital currency. | Photo Illustration by Budrul Chukrut/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xi87gQ"&gt;A digital dollar backed by the US government might lead to faster money transfers, and be more accessible than the current banking system, according to &lt;a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/money-and-payments-discussion-paper.htm"&gt;a new paper from the Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/20/fed-releases-long-awaited-study-on-a-digital-dollar-but-doesnt-take-a-position-yet-on-creating-one.html"&gt;via CNBC&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FWPcp"&gt;The paper is meant to act as “the first step in a discussion,” and doesn’t advocate for actually creating a “central bank digital currency” (or CBDC). Still, the creation of a digital dollar would be a massive shift in how big a role the government would play in our finances. Potential downsides could include making commercial banks less attractive to consumers, and affect the Fed’s ability to influence the financial system. &lt;a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/forms/cbdc"&gt;The Fed is now inviting comments&lt;/a&gt;, including on anything the paper may have missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nSOAHd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are many other countries and tech firms working in the space the US is considering entering&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nwHVpK"&gt;The paper, a step toward the existence of a digital dollar, comes at a time when around 90 other countries are considering their own digital currencies, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/fed-lays-out-risks-benefits-cbdc-paper-takes-no-policy-stance-2022-01-20/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The European Central Bank is investigating the creation of a digital Euro, and China has been testing a digital yuan, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866757/china-digital-currency-yuan-iphone-android-apps"&gt;which it’s been working on since 2014&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile in the cryptocurrency world, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22757899/us-treasury-stablecoins-regulated-banks-cryptocurrency-yellen-congress"&gt;stablecoins&lt;/a&gt;, some of which tie their value to the US dollar, have been rising in prominence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zdr0w6"&gt;The government is also looking to keep supporting “the dominant international role of the U.S. dollar,” as the paper puts it. Doing its research in public could help the government make it easier for other companies to design systems compatible with the US’s, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-20/fed-takes-key-step-forward-in-deciding-on-digital-coin-issuance"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="63XZ6W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"US Treasury says stablecoins should be regulated like banks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22757899/us-treasury-stablecoins-regulated-banks-cryptocurrency-yellen-congress"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pPwC9T"&gt;A digital currency from the central bank could combine some of the benefits of federally-backed cash and privately-controlled digital money, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FbqP7R"&gt;Fast and easy transfers between people and businesses (even across borders)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nbA79x"&gt;More accessibility for people without bank accounts, who may have difficulties opening accounts at private financial institutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nKXJlr"&gt;More safety and consumer confidence — banks can fail or run into liquidity issues, which is less likely with the US government&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="p0Yf2V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A federal digital currency could massively change the role of the government in our financial lives, depending on its design&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LOHA3t"&gt;There’s also the potential downsides: the government would have to navigate the market’s reaction to the US taking over a role traditionally served by commercial banks. It would also require citizens to trust the government directly with all their financial info, though the paper does vaguely say this concern could be mitigated by allowing “intermediaries” to address privacy concerns “by leveraging existing tools.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KhES6T"&gt;A digital currency doesn’t have to be blockchain-based. The Fed, in its paper, makes clear that no specific design or technology has been proposed yet, saying it “will continue to explore a wide range of design options.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rbj1eT"&gt;If the central bank were to create a digital currency, it would have to be “privacy-protected, intermediated, widely transferable, and identity-verified,” according to the paper. The reserve is currently experimenting with and exploring centralized, blockchain, and distributed methods of making a currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OKB74w"&gt;If you’re interested in the future of money, the paper is well worth a read. And if you’ve got expertise or strong opinions about it, you’ll have plenty of room to express them while &lt;a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/forms/cbdc"&gt;going through the 22-point questionnaire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6VMwDr75Sm_0F9dPNdugxlOlu6w=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/switcholedmodel.11.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nintendo Switch OLED model boasts a vibrant, 7-inch display and slate of minor upgrades.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch was, like most consoles during the pandemic, once in short supply. Thankfully, retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart now routinely stock the Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite in multiple color configurations and models, giving those who struck out ample opportunity to purchase Nintendo’s versatile console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DW6Flb"&gt;We’re keeping an eye across the web to find where you can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;Nintendo Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt; (the portable-only version of the console), and the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;Nintendo Switch OLED model&lt;/a&gt;, as well as any bundles that seem like good deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ToUhxJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo 64 games on Nintendo Switch are not too up to snuff","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746897/nintendo-switch-online-n64-emulation-quality-bad"},{"title":"Nintendo says its next ‘gaming system’ will release in the year 20XX","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765498/nintendo-next-gaming-system-console-release-year-switch-oled"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="armnCG"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qcOiY9"&gt;Over at Amazon, you can buy an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YMM3RHZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;updated Nintendo Switch model with gray Joy-Cons&lt;/a&gt;, plus a 64GB SanDisk microSD card, for $312.49 ($7.49 off). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CuDXeZ"&gt;If you’re looking for more storage, Amazon is offering two additional bundles, one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YBVJRD7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $319.95&lt;/a&gt;, a $15 discount, and one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YMJ4XBP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $340.74&lt;/a&gt;, a $10 discount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ueoxw3"&gt;If you prefer to pick up the standalone console, you can purchase the updated Nintendo Switch with red and blue Joy-Cons for around $299 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07VGRJDFY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgsDUQOgC4Y" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/768290/2092?subId1=VergeNintendoSwitch072321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-with-neon-blue-and-neon-red-joy-con%2F-%2FA-77464001" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="feP6W8"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons/dp/B084DDDNRP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; Edition&lt;/a&gt; of the Nintendo Switch is also available for purchase from Amazon for $299.99.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fiSvia"&gt;If you’re not against buying a preowned or refurbished console, you’ll want to check out &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21021684%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;murl=https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/switch/consoles/products/nintendo-switch-with-gray-joy-con/206007.html?gclid=CjwKCAiAt9z-BRBCEiwA_bWv-HzeKt4-dsaWdi9G9SGmxFTUUEAxrCA4NxZS0xEWCkIacwTZ_cUKPRoCEYUQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo’s online store&lt;/a&gt;, where you can often find deals on refurbished Switch consoles. Right now, for instance, GameStop is selling first and second-gen models for up to $20 off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="MZwBhp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10988261"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch Lite right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6ustqv"&gt;The Nintendo Switch Lite has a lot in common with the standard Switch, aside from a few key differences. The Lite only functions as a handheld console — meaning you can’t hook it up to your TV — and it’s smaller, lighter, and sturdier than its dockable counterpart. It also features a D-pad and can play all the same games, except those that require detachable Joy-Con controllers (which are very few). Regardless, it's a great handheld system for those who prefer to game on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ZaaYGt"&gt;Best Buy is currently the only retailer carrying the Nintendo Switch Lite as a standalone console. Right now, you can pick it up in &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1732099797003183412" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pink for $199.99&lt;/a&gt;, its standard retail price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LipduJ"&gt;If you don’t mind paying for a bundle, Adorama is selling the turquoise &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/1181395/1036?subId1=TheVergeWhereToFindNintendoSwitch1202022&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fnihdhsbazaak.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo Switch Lite with &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; and a 128GB microSD card for $289.99&lt;/a&gt;. If you prefer a title, the &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/107512/1036?subId1=VergeBestNintendoSwitchDeals012122&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fnihdhsbazaae.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;same bundle is available with &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;for $293.97.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="WRh9AR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10616596"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nintendo Switch with OLED screen" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YzjT6iua8IRxp8FH9VRp8hphoeg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701274/newswitch_kickstand.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tL1zU6"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch OLED right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FefR8R"&gt;The Nintendo Switch OLED &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;officially went on sale in October&lt;/a&gt; for $349.99, and offers a slew of improvements, most notably a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22566479/oled-nintendo-switch-vs-lite-screen-size" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;vibrant 7-inch OLED display&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564942/nintendo-switch-oled-screen-new-kickstand" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;improved kickstand&lt;/a&gt; that offers far greater stability. The speakers get a bit louder and offer a touch more clarity, too, and there’s a wired ethernet port built directly into the dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ThJrec"&gt;While the supply is starting to catch up with demand, no major retailer is currently selling the Nintendo Switch OLED model at the time of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="iPj5B1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo Switch OLED review: screentime","url":"https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"},{"title":"10 great games for your new Switch OLED","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22785298/nintendo-switch-best-games-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="8hV7z9"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Nintendo Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hgAR00"&gt;Frankly, the Switch comes with everything that you need to get started and have fun. However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jnXhNd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556339"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9sHCpf"&gt;First off, a microSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage, especially with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes. At Amazon, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GYG5SVQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;400GB microSD card will currently cost you around $43.49&lt;/a&gt;, which is nearly 40 percent off the typical price retail price. SanDisk’s microSD cards are also on sale in other size configurations, including a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HCHS64Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;200GB model for $24.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is still large enough that you should have little trouble storing several titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Agp45r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10397609"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdvLy"&gt;Let’s talk quickly about controllers. The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some Super Mario Party titles require the Joy-Cons to play. If you are looking for a Switch Pro Controller, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-black-wireless-pro-controller%2F141756.html%3Fgclid%3DCj0KCQjw0emHBhC1ARIsAL1QGNchiWTVbB56sBuEbLjc76K169WZpHUSFCnyWf2W_sbAwyKf3XbqzX0aAiS9EALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgdocaWxzJq" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; all currently have the controller available for around $69, which is basically the full MSRP.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2BZPIqmUqpLcZoV5GVxdxMULT3I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9537475/akrales_171025_2091_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UODwlY"&gt;Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon. Right now, for example, you can pick up &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Orzly-Screen-Protectors-compatible-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B01N9RG3XS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two Orzly glass screen protectors for $9.61.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cx5X9k"&gt;If you want to play online with friends, ensure your data is backed up to the cloud, and get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era, you’ll want to get a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $19.99 per year for a single user&lt;/a&gt; on a console or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KY69YFM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$34.99 a year for up to eight users on different consoles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="naXpZC"&gt;For those looking for more retro gaming, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728113/nintendo-switch-online-plus-expansion-pack-price-n64-genesis-animal-crossing" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo recently introduced&lt;/a&gt; the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription tier, which provides access to classic Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis games for an annual fee. An &lt;a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/US/en/membership" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;individual subscription will run you $49.99 a year&lt;/a&gt;, while a &lt;a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/US/en/membership" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;shared family plan will cost you $79.99 a year&lt;/a&gt;. The list of available games is continually growing, but it currently includes the likes of &lt;em&gt;Golden Axe&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Banjo-Kazooie,&lt;/em&gt; and a host of other popular titles from the heyday of both consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon facing formal complaint from labor board over worker firing</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wTsouvl5csw_m2wrgDZPUpJRcp4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70418829/acastro_181114_1777_amazon_hq2_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The NLRB will issue a formal complaint against Amazon unless it settles a case with a fired worker | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3sFsEV"&gt;The National Labor Relations Board is preparing to issue a complaint against Amazon alleging the company illegally fired a worker at one of its New York warehouses, unless the company settles the case first. At issue is whether Daequan Smith, an organizer with the newly-formed Amazon Labor Union (ALU), was fired for trying to organize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NRStdr"&gt;As first reported by&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-21/amazon-activist-s-firing-deemed-illegal-by-labor-board-officials?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, NLRB spokesperson Kayla Blado confirmed Friday that the agency’s regional director Kathy Drew King determined allegations by the ALU that Smith was fired illegally had merit and would issue a complaint if the case doesn’t settle. “The complaint would allege a discharge because of union and other protected concerted activities, among other allegations,” Blado said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j23qu2"&gt;Amazon didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bq97n0"&gt;The ALU Is awaiting a hearing on its petition to hold a union election at four of Amazon’s warehouses in Staten Island. Smith was a worker at one of the Staten Island warehouses, and the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazonlabor/status/1484638708867514371?s=20"&gt;ALU tweeted Friday &lt;/a&gt;that since his firing, Smith has been left homeless. The NLRB has the authority to reinstate workers fired for organizing, but it’s not yet clear whether it would do so in this case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qN9VNi"&gt;The NLRB ordered Amazon to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive"&gt;redo a union election&lt;/a&gt; at its warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, after finding the company interfered in the first election in April 2021. That redo, which will be carried out by mail and supervised by the NLRB, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878457/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-election-redo-february-fourth"&gt;begins February 4th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>American Airlines suing The Points Guy over app that syncs frequent flyer data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bhiueg"&gt;American Airlines has filed a lawsuit against travel tips site The Points Guy, claiming the site has violated the terms of use of its frequent flyer program by offering an app that lets users track airline miles from multiple airlines in one place. It’s seeking an order blocking The Points Guy from accessing or using American Airlines customer data and from allowing its users to access their own accounts through the TPG app or site. American is also seeking to block The Points Guy from displaying the American Airlines logo and other trademarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="piDCfi"&gt;The TPG app, released in September 2021, purports to “&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-newswire/lifestyle-technology-travel-media-d1458a6ca22c62f0946c1767f1a884ed"&gt;help users learn about points, miles, and loyalty programs&lt;/a&gt;, while maximizing their earning potential, and discovering how to efficiently burn those earned points and miles to see the world.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypStN8"&gt;The app allows users to link together different frequent flyer accounts. In the case of American Airlines, the TPG app prompts you in-app to enter your AAdvantage number, your password, and your last name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0TVr4"&gt;The lawsuit filed by American Airlines alleges that the TPG app encourages members of its AAdvantage program to breach its terms of use en masse by handing over their user logins to an unauthorized third party. The airline says the logins allow The Points Guy to “invade American’s servers, access users’ accounts, and collect and expropriate the proprietary data” in violation of American’s terms and conditions. The complaint accuses The Points Guy of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, an anti-hacking statute, by doing so. In addition, the suit trots out a litany of other offenses, such as breach of contract, trespass, trademark infringement, and copyright infringement (for displaying the American Airlines logo). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sqaz7D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The airline says the logins allow The Points Guy to “invade American’s servers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MZfxSr"&gt;American Airlines representative Amanda Koos said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that The Points Guy parent company Red Ventures “is accessing AA.com and AAdvantage customer account data in a way that does not comply with our standards for use of confidential information.” She added that American Airlines takes “customer data and proprietary information incredibly seriously, and want to make sure it is protected and secure.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6QFvO"&gt;The Points Guy preemptively sued American Airlines in Delaware after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from the airline, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-points-guy-fights-back-against-american-airlines-to-bring-cost-and-time-saving-tool-to-consumers-301464841.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, claiming the airline was “attempting to block the media platform from providing the cost and time-saving benefits of The Points Guy App to consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRx097"&gt;“Consumers are always in control of their own data on The Points Guy App — they decide which loyalty programs and credit cards are accessible for the purpose of making their points-and-miles journey easier,” The Points Guy founder Brian Kelly said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The site is “choosing to fight back against American Airlines on behalf of travelers to protect their rights to access their points and miles so they can travel smarter,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgGPzZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asked The Points Guy in an email whether the TPG app stores AAdvantage passwords and have not yet received a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdaa855a892c74b6e00091c92b957a14"&gt;American Airlines is asking the courts to enjoin The Points Guy from allowing users to log in to AAdvantage through the TPG app or website and also from storing AAdvantage passwords and other member information. It is also seeking to legally block The Points Guy from displaying American’s “copyrighted material” — that is to say, the American Airlines logo. The lawsuit requests statutory damages for the trademark and copyright violations and additional unspecified damages to include any “‘ill-gotten revenues and benefits” that The Points Guy may have gained from American’s customers and their data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWMSjj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We’re happy to inform you that Apple isn’t requiring verification for education discounts anymore</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/50TLf-UapZYpyPMwke4yaxsqkbw=/0x0:1768x1179/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70415567/billboard_202101_intro.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GIASYa"&gt;At &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220108032348/https://www.apple.com/us-edu/store"&gt;some point in the last month&lt;/a&gt;, Apple introduced a new verification process in the US that tried to ensure customers who want to benefit from its discounted education pricing are actually involved in education. Now Apple has removed the verification process, as confirmed in tests by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and backed up by reports from &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/21/apple-no-education-verification-requirement/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/21/apple-education-store-verification-removed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When it was in place, customers had to verify that they actually qualified for an education discount using Unidays’ third-party verification service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y55hu8"&gt;It’s possible that the verification requirement, which was &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/s7g5t6/apple_education_store_now_requires_unidays_and/"&gt;spotted by Reddit users&lt;/a&gt;, will return. Apple already has verification processes in place in other countries, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/education-pricing?afid=p238%7Cs5Jg5FlGg-dc_mtid_187079nc38483_pcrid_349151339418_pgrid_15144757333_&amp;amp;cid=aos-uk-kwgo-edu%E2%80%94slid%E2%80%94bran-product-"&gt;like the UK&lt;/a&gt;. The company didn’t immediately respond to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment on whether the verification requirement’s removal was temporary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VQhQZD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Matching a similar policy in the UK&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MOJnNg"&gt;Customers have also noticed Apple placing new limits on how many items you can buy with an educational discount. &lt;a href="https://appletrack.com/apple-tightens-education-discounts-with-account-verification-and-purchase-limits/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Track&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that users are limited to one desktop computer, one Mac mini, one laptop, two iPads, and two accessories per year. (These limits are &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/browse/open/salespolicies/edu"&gt;still listed on Apple’s site&lt;/a&gt;, despite verification being gone.) Given that it’s more than any student, teacher, or educational staff member is likely to purchase for themselves in a given year, the limit seems to be in place to stop them from acting as a discount broker for all their non-education friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZrydR"&gt;Although the change (potentially temporarily) removed a loophole that was previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/27/17169108/apple-education-discount-how-to-new-ipad"&gt;ridiculously easy&lt;/a&gt; to exploit — apparently Apple didn’t even require customers to have a .edu email address — there was surprisingly little outcry over on Reddit, with some pointing out that Apple’s first-party discounts are often beaten by third-party retailers during back to school season. Meanwhile, if you’re looking for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"&gt;good deal on a MacBook&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve got a page dedicated to that exact purpose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvMGC0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 21st, 4:58PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect that the Unidays’ verification seems to have been removed from Apple’s US education store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ozzy Osbourne’s NFT project shared a scam link, and followers lost thousands of dollars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IxRQSsGElGfFuha6INqOMfs2eos=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70417902/acastro_210329_1777_nft_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3r0BJf"&gt;When a pop-cultural icon like Ozzy Osbourne announces an NFT collection, you can count on the project getting publicity. The launch of the “CryptoBatz” collection, a series of 9,666 digital bats, received coverage in outlets like &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/ozzy-osbourne-nfts-cryptobatz-collection-1235014292/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/exclusive-ozzy-osbourne-announces-nfts-cryptobatz-collection-1276535/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ozzy-osbourne-nft-cryptobatz-collection-preview-video-watch-3135108"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NME&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://hypebeast.com/2021/12/ozzy-ozbourne-cryptobatz-nft-project-info"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypebeast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/ozzy-osbourne-nft-collection-cryptobatz-market-concert-1982-tokens-crypto-2021-12"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6l8Q7"&gt;But just two days after the tokens were minted, supporters are being targeted by a phishing scam that drains cryptocurrency from their wallets, playing off a bad link shared by the project’s official Twitter account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORQRMp"&gt;Like the majority of NFT projects, CryptoBatz uses Discord as a place to organize its community. The official CryptoBatz Discord is now accessed through the short link &lt;a href="https://t.co/c8bUinn1LN"&gt;discord.gg/cryptobatz&lt;/a&gt;. But previously, the project used a slightly different vanity URL at discord.gg/cryptobatznft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYLOl9"&gt;When the project switched to the new URL, scammers set up a fake Discord server at the old one. But neither CryptoBatz nor Ozzy Osbourne took the precaution of deleting tweets referencing the previous URL, meaning that old tweets from Osbourne himself were left directing followers to a server now controlled by scammers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ozzy Osbourne tweet containing link to a scam Discord" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9DS7fG2QgZjZ94QWRwxRv2EbybY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23185024/Osbourne_tweet.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HgCmeA"&gt;One tweet from CryptoBatz, posted on December 31st, 2021, received more than 4,000 retweets and hundreds of replies. The tweet was only removed on January 21st after CryptoBatz was contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Cryptobatz tweet containing link to a scam Discord" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5rKGTUmjVGiOa0t8kQqpJ8xia0k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23185029/cryptobatz_tweet.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tOnZFC"&gt;On clicking the scam link, the invite panel for the fake Discord showed the total number of members as 1,330, an indication of the number of people who could potentially have been fooled by the scam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LF6C35"&gt;Inside the server, a bot spoofing community management service Collab Land asked users to verify their crypto assets to participate in the server — but directed users to a phishing site where they were prompted to connect their cryptocurrency wallets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tY91Ky"&gt;A representative of Collab Land declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Fake Collab Land bot" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LB5IFndoKg55MIA9Rmt9dMY24Ms=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23185140/scam_bot.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D2rK2G"&gt;Tim Silman, a nonprofit employee, is one person who lost money through the scam. Silman estimates that around $300–400 in ETH was drained from his wallet after he visited the fake Discord server through a link posted on the CryptoBatz website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGv7by"&gt;“I’ve seen at least a dozen people on Twitter voicing this same issue,” Silman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If you look at the transactions on Etherscan, others lost a lot more than me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hj6mgB"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xdfbd08a29967f13cc2c143f0e8b71aea6dec3ecb"&gt;Ethereum wallet address&lt;/a&gt; Silman indicated was linked to the scammers had received a series of incoming transactions totaling 14.6 ETH ($40,895) on January 20th and sent it onwards to a wallet containing more than $150,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T34cji"&gt;The project had been slow to remove the bad links, even when informed, Silman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lQCBk"&gt;“I tagged them a few times in various tweets, as have a few other people, but no response,” he said. “This is an expensive lesson, I suppose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pilF2B"&gt;Even as the fake link remained present in a prominent tweet, the CryptoBatz project continued to hype the public token mint. As of January 21st, CryptoBatz NFTs were being &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/collection/cryptobatz-by-ozzy-osbourne"&gt;resold on OpenSea&lt;/a&gt; for around 1.8 ETH ($5,046).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K0XNWu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is an expensive lesson I suppose”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ivFQfY"&gt;Asked whether the project should accept responsibility for leaving the old link online, Sutter Systems, developers of the CryptoBatz NFT, laid blame for the scam squarely with Discord. In an email statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Sutter Systems co-founder “Jepeggi” emphasized that the compromise was only possible because of the easy setup and maintenance of the scam Discord instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuiRPa"&gt;“Although we feel very sorry for the people that have fallen prey to these scams, we cannot take responsibility for the actions of scammers exploiting Discord — a platform that we have absolutely no control over,” Jepeggi said. “In our opinion this situation and hundreds of others that have taken place across other projects in the NFT space could have easily been prevented if Discord just had a better response/support/fraud team in place to help big projects like ours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1ocR8"&gt;Discord said that it was aware of the incident and in contact with the affected team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GatYgw"&gt;“Our Trust &amp;amp; Safety team is in touch with the server owners and are investigating the incident,” said Peter Day, senior manager for corporate communications at Discord. “Our team takes action when we become aware of attacks like this one, including banning users and shutting down servers.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Picard’s first season 2 trailer has Guinan going for it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Whoopi Goldberg as Guinan and Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dDq8XxZn54V1_RVPIgDS5ruKG1w=/126x0:1799x1115/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70417593/e183b15c7b0688ce905e81597631bc6e.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Paramount Plus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dNRwAo"&gt;Just when it seemed like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/4/17651884/patrick-stewart-jean-luc-picard-star-trek-cbs-all-access-new-series"&gt;Patrick Stewart’s Jean-Luc Picard&lt;/a&gt; might have been ready to bid the galaxy farewell, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/23/21079004/star-trek-picard-review-cbs-all-access-patrick-stewart"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Picard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;gave the legendary space explorer a second shot at life that raised some questions about just who and what he is now. While first trailer for &lt;a href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/482924/175360/3065?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2Fshows%2Fstar-trek-picard%2F&amp;amp;subid1=VergePicard012122"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Picard&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;/a&gt;second season doesn’t directly answer any of them, it brings back one of the few characters perfectly suited to help guide Picard and his allies through this next chapter of their journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GznznJ"&gt;Beyond getting the recently resurrected Jean-Luc and his fellow explorers back aboard &lt;em&gt;La Sirena &lt;/em&gt;and in the depths of space they long for&lt;em&gt;, Star Trek: Picard&lt;/em&gt;’s second season is also about to send its heroes into the existential deep in as they embark upon a journey spanning across time and space, and seemingly multiple realities that have all been fractured somehow. As disorienting as Picard is when he wakes up in what appears to be the past, it’s the sort of turn of events that Whoopi Goldberg’s Guinan likely sees coming long before her old friend even thinks to come looking for her El-Aurian wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uP0HXF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OyuddrlFajs"&gt;https://youtu.be/OyuddrlFajs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTdUtO"&gt;Along with Guinan, &lt;em&gt;Picard&lt;/em&gt;’s second season will also see John Delancie’s Q and Annie Wersching as the Borg Queen in the mix, and the show’s decision to lean heavily on familiar characters from &lt;em&gt;Next Generation &lt;/em&gt;makes sense given how this arc’s poised to focus on key moments from the franchise’s history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5EfXa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Picard’s &lt;/em&gt;second season hits Paramount+ on March 3th, and premieres internationally on Prime Video from March 4th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to protect your PC from ransomware using Windows’ built-in protection</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of a laptop with three locks, a key, an at sign, a key and colorful pixels all randomly placed around the image." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RRgsb9jYPOE44pbnwQhmerfLH3M=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70417398/VRG_4614_0_Overview.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8nHoix"&gt;Ransomware — malware that prevents you from accessing your files unless you pay the hacker that infected your computer — has been an issue plaguing computer users and businesses for years. Given its prevalence and the fact that a ransomware infection can lead to the loss of valuable files like documents or family pictures, it’s a good idea to make sure you’re protected. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/29/15892658/microsoft-windows-10-controlled-folders-feature"&gt;Starting with Windows 10&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft has added features to its built-in Windows Security software that can help keep your computer safe from ransomware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQQe5e"&gt;As far as ransomware is concerned, there are two levels to Windows Security. The first consists of malware scans, which are on by default, and which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22705042/how-to-scan-microsoft-windows-pc-malware-security-antivirus-defender"&gt;you can learn more about here&lt;/a&gt;. While this will work to keep ransomware from being installed on your computer, if a piece of malware &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; manage to slip by, the scans won’t be able to protect your files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wazhbC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Winning the war on ransomware","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22822884/us-government-department-of-justice-ransomware-digital-extortion-task-force-report-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wCROiA"&gt;The second level is Windows’ ransomware protection, which you have to turn on manually. However, before you do, it is worth noting that this feature is not on by default for a reason. It works by only letting approved apps make changes to your files — which, in theory, prevents ransomware from encrypting them and locking them away. This, however, can cause some problems with apps that aren’t expecting it, so you may have to do some occasional trouble-shooting if you’ve got ransomware protection turned on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUMYBk"&gt;As a result, as we go over how to enable ransomware protection, it’s worth keeping in mind that there will probably be some tinkering involved with this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uRvozJ"&gt;How to turn on ransomware protection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="seP7Wy"&gt;Windows’ built-in ransomware protection is included in its security app. To get to it, either search “Windows Security” from the start menu or go to “Settings”&amp;gt; “Privacy &amp;amp; Security”&amp;gt; “Windows Security.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uM00HoGU4fWrH_-TH8GyEfuRRS0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183213/2022_01_20_14_46_12_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once you’re in Windows Security, go to “Virus &amp;amp; threat protection,” either by clicking the tile or the button in the sidebar on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SU4BmU"&gt;To turn on ransomware protection, go to “Virus and threat protection” and click “Manage ransomware protection.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kWN32CnI5bDMNJzsz_NPOTOb8-0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183233/2022_01_20_14_46_43_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on the “Manage ransomware protection” link to get to the Ransomware protection page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hgyq7f"&gt;From there, you can turn on a feature called “Controlled folder access,” which will make it so that unapproved apps won’t be able to make changes to your documents, pictures, videos, or music folders. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6aMHrlKuOUyaEKG4eQLVOXfN6Ok=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183270/2022_01_20_14_47_08_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Switching on the “Controlled folder access” feature ensures that unauthorized apps can’t make changes to files in certain protected folders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cOgUmu"&gt;How to adjust Controlled folder access&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mYSkkj"&gt;Once you switch Controlled folder access on, you’ll see three more control panes: “Block history,” “Protected folders,” and “Allow an app through Controlled folder access.” By default, Controlled folder access will only allow a list of approved apps to make any changes to files in the Documents, Pictures, Videos, and Music folders on your computer. These apps let you tweak how the system works.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIcTcT"&gt;You can, for example, add other folders that you want to protect using the “Protected folders” screen and manage which apps are allowed to make changes to protected folders using the “Allow an app through Controlled folder access” screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMKZ3M"&gt;Here’s what you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tPcZ-qfAise9-fFDNVrLywsFb4o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183278/2022_01_20_15_31_53_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Ransomware protection” panel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="21K0lk"&gt;Block history&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Kzaqlv"&gt;According to a statement in one Windows security page, apps “determined by Microsoft as friendly” will always be allowed to make changes to your protected folders, but that doesn’t mean that every app you’ll want to use will be allowed by default. If you see a weird error popping up after turning on Controlled folder access (one common error I found during testing was getting a “This file cannot be found” message when trying to save a file), you may want to check “Block history” to see if Windows Security has been keeping that app from making changes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nfoVqfNGHmV3gKhoJUya9qlBqKM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183194/2022_01_20_15_16_01_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The block history screen shows you which apps have tried to write to protected folders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uTuaMr"&gt;“Block history” lets you see what app was blocked and what folder it was trying to write to. If it’s the app you’ve been having issues with, you’ll want to add it to the list of programs that can make changes. (We’ll go over how to do that in a moment.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ek20dpfNBcGQuFNUauZiDGLyxls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183170/2022_01_20_15_02_19_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the types of errors you may encounter: FireFox’s download screen said the file I was trying to save could not be found.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8UoKgI"&gt;Protected folders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zBTAaq"&gt;If you want to protect additional folders from ransomware, like your Desktop folder (which isn’t protected by default), you can select “Protected folders” and click the “Add a protected folder” button.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BQemG2EBYG3oDRjm5HvML6AAV-Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183203/2022_01_20_14_50_14_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adding a folder to the protected folder list will keep apps from writing to it without permission.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sJg4HO"&gt;From there, you can navigate to the folder you want to protect and click the “Select Folder” button.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pSQR6cMoAPb8vFDtD2ClB6185JU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183202/2022_01_20_14_51_33_Greenshot.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chose the folder you want to protect, then click the “Select Folder” button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tIciSK"&gt;You can remove protection from custom-added folders (but not the default ones) by going back to the “Protected folders” screen, clicking on the folder you added, and clicking the Remove button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="D47dzS"&gt;Allow an app through controlled folder access&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9GxWct"&gt;If you’re having problems using an app and want to add it to the allowed list of apps, go back to the “Ransomware protection” page and select “Allow an app through Controlled folder access.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FiljGU"&gt;After clicking on the “Add an allowed app” button, you can click “Recently blocked apps” to see a list of the apps that have recently tried to write to your protected folders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AXqikyVWbjyt9C5UHjfDC8WUxvQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183172/2022_01_20_15_03_28_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clicking “Recently blocked apps” gets you a list of the apps that have tried and failed to make changes to your files.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pQ7ihV"&gt;You then click on the plus button next to its name to unblock it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kG7UweNSg8kyhgQXj4soRDMWSB0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183173/2022_01_20_15_03_37_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clicking the plus button next to an app’s name will let it make changes to files in your protected folders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="82QKwA"&gt;While you should only have to do this process once per app, it can be frustrating. You can turn off Ransomware Protection at any time, but if you believe that you’re at high risk for infection and don’t have backups, you should think carefully before doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TMLbUS"&gt;Additional ways to protect yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ar09rE"&gt;While Windows’ ransomware protection is a powerful built-in tool, it’s probably not a good idea to rely on it as your only defense — as with all anti-malware systems, it should be treated as a safety net rather than your first line of defense. Here are some of the things you can do to avoid getting a ransomware infection in the first place and to make sure that your data is safe even if the worst were to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="l7FgvZ"&gt;Be careful online&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="F9pzxb"&gt;As with any malware, ransomware can spread through a variety of ways, such as being attached to phishing emails, exploiting security holes in out-of-date software, or masquerading as an actually useful program. When you’re online, it’s important to stay vigilant — if someone is trying to get you to download a program from an untrusted source that seems too good to be true, proceed with extreme caution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyeTkr"&gt;It’s also important to check the extensions of files you’re sent. If someone claims an attachment is a document, but it has a .exe or .msi extension, that file is likely dangerous. If you can’t already see the file’s extension, you can right-click on it, then click “Properties.” Windows will tell you what kind of file it is next to the “Type of file” heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srMlkU"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/protect-your-pc-from-ransomware-08ed68a7-939f-726c-7e84-a72ba92c01c3"&gt;guide to protecting yourself from ransomware&lt;/a&gt; lists some of the things that can lead to your computer being infected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="11tTnG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• &lt;/strong&gt;Visiting unsafe, suspicious, or fake websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o9Nc9q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• &lt;/strong&gt;Opening file attachments that you weren’t expecting or from people you don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h4oBIQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• &lt;/strong&gt;Opening malicious or bad links in emails, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media posts, or in instant messenger or SMS chats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="z8b33C"&gt;Keep your software updated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Br8z5b"&gt;It’s also important to make sure that your operating system and any software you use regularly have the latest security patches. Most browsers will update themselves automatically, and Windows usually also installs updates as they become available. To manually check for updates, go to “Settings”&amp;gt; “Windows Update” and click the “Check for updates” button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAjqsC"&gt;You can update any apps installed through Windows’ built-in store by going to the Microsoft Store app, clicking the “Library” button in the lower left-hand corner, and then clicking the “Get Updates” button to find any available updates. You can also click the “Update” button on individual apps or the “Update all” button at the top of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="1Fnfyx"&gt;Make sure to have backups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="82qIPA"&gt;While using ransomware protection and having safe browsing habits can help keep you safe, no system is perfect. It’s important to have a backup of your computer’s files so that if you do end up infected by ransomware, you don’t lose your most valuable photos, videos, or documents. Backups can also keep you from losing data if your computer is physically damaged, lost, or stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npwd50"&gt;You can read our guide on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/1/16240630/how-to-back-up-your-computer-time-machine-file-history-windows-mac-external-drive"&gt;how to back up your computer here&lt;/a&gt;. If possible, it’s best to have two different forms of backup: one local and one in the cloud. However, having any kind of backup is much better than not having anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fm3B6W"&gt;What to do if your computer is infected with ransomware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="W48q9L"&gt;If all your protections have failed, and you discover that your computer is infected with ransomware, there are three important steps to take:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="8XvaKN"&gt;Disconnect your computer from Wi-Fi or ethernet — some ransomware can spread to other computers connected to your network, and it’s important to limit the damage. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="deJhOH"&gt;Don’t pay the ransom — doing so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685930/treasury-sanctions-cryptocurrency-exchange-ransomware-colonial-pipeline"&gt;could be illegal&lt;/a&gt;, depending on where the hackers trying to extort you are located, and paying does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; guarantee that you’ll actually get access to your files back. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DuGULa"&gt;Don’t plug in your backups if you have them — the ransomware will very likely attempt to destroy those files as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="jVCZsC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/protect-your-pc-from-ransomware-08ed68a7-939f-726c-7e84-a72ba92c01c3"&gt;Microsoft recommends&lt;/a&gt; attempting to do &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/virus-threat-protection-in-windows-security-1362f4cd-d71a-b52a-0b66-c2820032b65e"&gt;a full scan of your computer using Windows Security&lt;/a&gt;. (Another good app to try is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.malwarebytes.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22889631%2Fwindows-10-11-ransomware-defense-security-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Malwarebytes&lt;/a&gt;, which is well-known for its ability to scrub a computer of malware and is free for personal use.) If neither of those work, you may need to &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/recovery-options-in-windows-31ce2444-7de3-818c-d626-e3b5a3024da5#bkmk_win11_reset_pc"&gt;fully reset your PC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMoB6p"&gt;Finally, if you don’t feel confident that you can remove the ransomware yourself, take your computer to a professional — it’s best to make sure that it’s fully clean before trying to recover your backups. &lt;/p&gt;
