    <title>Eve is rolling out Thread support to more of its smart home lineup</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VIuqUowAQbDHjW3LT8hcR-7rikM=/497x0:5476x3319/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68910245/Eve_Weather_Lifestyle_05_Fahrenheit.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Eve Weather outdoor weather monitor&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Eve&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DKD04N"&gt;Eve Systems, a maker of smart home products that work with Apple’s HomeKit platform, is announcing an expanded range of devices that support the Thread smart protocol. The news consists of updated versions of its existing smart plug, a forthcoming firmware update for the company’s smart sprinkler, and a new outdoor weather station.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9XGzaL"&gt;Thread is a wireless communication standard that was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/7/15/5900893/wireless-protocol-standard-nest-thread-group"&gt;developed from the ground up&lt;/a&gt; for smart home purposes and is designed to replace legacy technologies such as Z-Wave and Zigbee. Benefits of Thread include more reliable connections between devices, faster response times, and longer battery life. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qcxIB7"&gt;Though Thread support has existed in a handful of devices for quite some time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21561589/apple-homepod-mini-review"&gt;Apple’s HomePod mini&lt;/a&gt; is the first one to really make Thread a viable option in the smart home. It can act as a bridge between Thread-enabled accessories and connect them to the internet, which they can’t do on their own. Thread is also one of the pillar technologies of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/18/21027890/apple-google-amazon-smart-home-standard-zigbee-connected-ip-project"&gt;Connected Home over IP (CHIP) project&lt;/a&gt;, a cooperation between all the major smart home platform and device providers to standardize around an interoperable wireless protocol.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PlUlFu"&gt;It’s with that in mind that Eve is updating and expanding its device portfolio. The new Eve Energy, which will be available in either US or UK versions, is an updated version of Eve’s smart plug. It will support both Thread and Bluetooth and will be available in the US starting on April 6th and the UK starting on May 4th. The Energy is unique in that it can act as a repeater for the Thread network, letting it extend the signal to devices even if they are out of reach of a HomePod mini. In the US, the Energy will cost $39.95.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Xxm9Ef9DkEmi4Nh_1G9Hu_cch6U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341451/Eve_Energy_NA_Lifestyle_02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eve&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The latest version of the Eve Energy smart plug adds Thread support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="88btS2"&gt;A forthcoming firmware update will add Thread support to the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eve-Aqua-Controller-Sprinkler-Irrigation/dp/B08FBHCPPF?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$99.95 Eve Aqua&lt;/a&gt;, the company’s smart sprinkler system. Thanks to Thread’s greater range, the updated Aqua can maintain its connection to the network better than it could with just Bluetooth. Eve says support for Thread will be released in April.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3vcdI"&gt;Lastly, the all-new Eve Weather is a wireless outdoor weather station that allows you to track the exact outdoor temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure at your home. It is a replacement for the Eve Degree, a similar product that relied solely on Bluetooth for its connectivity. The Eve Weather has a monochrome display that shows the current temperature, humidity, and weather conditions; the Eve app provides access to trends over time and more specific data. The Weather also has Siri integration for voice queries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uS4Mwp"&gt;Eve claims the Weather is IPX3 water resistant and is specifically designed for outdoor use. It runs on a coin cell battery which should last between six and 12 months before needing to be replaced. The Eve Weather will be available starting March 25th for $69.95.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7_WUk-FSQSWCgtP-pS7A2OyRq4A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22341455/NA_Eve_Weather_Display.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Eve&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Eve Weather shows current temperature, humidity, and weather trends on its monochrome display.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UquTwr"&gt;These aren’t the only products in Eve’s portfolio that support Thread. The company has already issued firmware updates with Thread support for its &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eve-Door-Window-Automatically-Notifications/dp/B08BDM47S2?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;door and window sensors&lt;/a&gt; and European-spec Energy smart plug, and it says everything it has released since June 2020 has the hardware necessary to work with Thread. It is one of the first companies to really throw its hat into the Thread ring in a meaningful way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DR1DIU"&gt;Eve is a unique company in the smart home market as its products only work with Apple’s HomeKit platform and don’t support Amazon Alexa, Google Home, or any of the other platforms out there. That’s different from most other smart home companies, which try to reach the broadest possible audience by supporting the most popular platforms, which often means Amazon Alexa and Google Home. The HomeKit device ecosystem is much smaller in comparison, largely thanks to an onerous hardware certification that Apple used to require and has since rolled back. HomeKit is also completely inaccessible from outside of Apple’s ecosystem, so if you have an Android phone, you can’t control Eve devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KVbEWl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Eve is the first company to broadly support Thread across its lineup&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TJudZE"&gt;Eve System’s CEO Jerome Gackel told me the company’s goal isn’t just to be a HomeKit accessory maker. It’s just that Apple’s platform is the only one that allows Eve to focus its efforts on its devices and apps without having to also maintain a cloud service to allow them to connect to the internet. All of the processing for Eve devices happens locally on your home network or between your own devices, without sending data to the cloud, which helps the company achieve its goal of a privacy-first smart home. (You can still remotely control Eve devices through Apple’s Home app, provided you have a HomeKit hub, such as an Apple TV, HomePod, or iPad running in your home.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MSnn1J"&gt;Gackel hopes that support for Thread and its key role in the CHIP project will open the door to working with the other smart home platforms in the future. But Eve won’t work with Alexa or Google Home so long as they continue to require a cloud connection to their platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xQwXPW"&gt;Eve’s bet on HomeKit has been successful so far — the company already has 18 products in its lineup and claims sales of over 1 million units by 2019, with two-thirds of its customer base in Germany and the rest in the US. Its lineup for 2021 will make it the largest provider of HomeKit accessories, with Thread support being a recurring theme throughout.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elgato’s new Light Strip can make your setup look more chill</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elgato Light Strip" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u6QrXZX4DPpnSZXfEMeDewkErHQ=/0x18:2355x1588/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68910194/elgatolightstrip.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Who has an entertainment center this big? Wait — no, don’t tell me.&lt;/em&gt; | Elgato&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="06YJpC"&gt;Elgato, the Corsair-owned company known for its gaming and creator-focused streaming tech, is expanding into smart lighting. It has introduced &lt;a href="http://elgato.com/light-strip"&gt;the Light Strip&lt;/a&gt;, a thin strip packed with 108 dimmable LEDs that can be mounted via sticky adhesive, bent, and trimmed to fit wherever you’d like them to go. These can be controlled over Wi-Fi (2.4GHz only) through a free app on macOS, Windows 10, iOS, or Android, or from Elgato’s Stream Deck hardware, which apparently will offer deeper integration. Elgato is charging $59.99 for two meters (about 79 inches) of lights, including the controller the lights plug into and a power adapter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Elgato Light Strip" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rKY4_kAkFJ_mCs1wJmFvXuWfJ0I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343751/lightstrip2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Elgato&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Stream Deck isn’t included, for the record.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e5LsWe"&gt;These are similar in execution to most connected light strips including Philips Hue’s, which ironically has tight Stream Deck integration via plug-ins. Not to be confused with the capabilities of something like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/3/21418861/philips-hue-play-gradient-lightstrip-tv-mount"&gt;Philips Hue Play gradient light strip&lt;/a&gt; that can sync the light to what’s on your screen (only after purchasing some pricey additional hardware), Elgato’s more affordable solution is just for looks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bRzj5x"&gt;If you’re a streamer who appears on-camera, Elgato says the LEDs within the Light Strip are flicker-free. It says some other options appear fine to the naked eye but can create a flickering effect when you’re on-camera. In terms of other specs, these are RGBWW LEDs that offer both cool and warm white support, in addition to millions of colors. These have a 2,000-lumen maximum output.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Elgato Light Strip" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e36SwR4hCe_dzgbarJLiSa_aPtU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343757/wavepanels.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Elgato&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coming in multiple colors.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oF6noJ"&gt;Elgato, keenly aware of its target audience, is also announcing &lt;a href="http://elgato.com/wave-panels"&gt;Wave Panels&lt;/a&gt;. These are glorified foam pieces can be mounted (either by adhesive or with a wall anchor) in your space to improve the acoustics. They’ll likely be particularly useful if you’re recording your voice. They have an edgy look, and Elgato is releasing them in multiple colors. No price has been shared at the time of publishing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vA2nbQ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZwhZR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Halo fitness tracker is getting Alexa integration</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VUXo7a3KX8JUbTN0Pl27auTy_sM=/45x0:3795x2500/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68910189/Halo_App_and_Halo_Band.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Amazon Halo and its companion app&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vO5jlE"&gt;Amazon has announced a new feature for its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;Halo fitness-tracking gadget&lt;/a&gt;: Alexa integration. With this new feature, Halo owners will be able to ask Alexa devices for various health stats, such as their sleep score or activity points obtained during the day. The integration will be off by default and owners will need the latest firmware on their Halo bands and the latest version of the iOS or Android app to enable it. Amazon says the feature rollout is starting today, March 4th, and will be continuing over the next week or so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CehWnZ"&gt;The Halo band is Amazon’s first fitness-focused product and it’s had a less than stellar reception since it was announced last fall. Aside from the standard fitness things of tracking your movement and sleep patterns, the $99.99 Halo also has the ability to police the tone of your voice and tell you when you’re being dismissive or condescending with your words. The companion Halo app also has a feature to 3D scan your body through your phone’s camera and measure your fat composition. These two unconventional features have been criticized by reviewers at publications like &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/technology/personaltech/amazon-halo-review.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/12/10/amazon-halo-band-review/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (which is actually owned by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos) for both their invasiveness and inconsistency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sJEvXiFdLtAZHmDMGibaO3sweSg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22343977/Connect_Alexa_to_Halo_Screenshot.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alexa integration options in the Halo app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JDyaJO"&gt;Weirdly, even though the Halo has been available for purchase &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22174145/amazon-halo-fitness-tracker-voice-buy"&gt;since the middle of December&lt;/a&gt; (it first launched with a limited, invite-only rollout), it is out of stock in all sizes and colors on Amazon right now, with no information on when it might return. I’ve asked Amazon about this and the company declined to comment, though other retailers such as Best Buy &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733949121805689498" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;appear to have plenty of stock&lt;/a&gt;. As of this writing, the Halo has a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07QJ6YL4T/ref=twister_B088TNNLSG?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;3.7-star rating from Amazon customers&lt;/a&gt;, compared to the 4.6-star rating the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Inspire-Fitness-Tracker-Included/dp/B08DFDP1TR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;similarly sized and priced Fitbit Inspire 2 holds&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dCEGvF"&gt;Amazon notes that the Alexa integration only allows for Alexa to provide information related to health data captured by the Halo — Alexa will not be able to do the tone analysis itself. It also will not store the Halo data as part of its responses. There is an option to set a voice PIN to protect access to the Halo data and you’ll be able to opt for a five-minute timeout window after the PIN is entered for easier access to the Halo data in subsequent requests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GypMs6"&gt;Though the Halo integration works with all Alexa-enabled devices, including smart displays, it doesn’t have any special optimization for those that have screens. If you want to see any charts or graphs of your fitness data, you’ll have to go to the Halo smartphone app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8UG1vv"&gt;Amazon says Halo owners will be able to disable the integration at any time from the Halo app should they decide they no longer want it, and they can manage and delete voice recordings from their Halo requests in the privacy hub of the Alexa app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jack Dorsey’s Square, Inc. is buying a majority stake in Jay-Z’s streaming service Tidal</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pr4UhGH8C4OaZ6FMsIGzxtprt5k=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68910014/akrales_170802_1743_0229.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Zy2bKC"&gt;Square, Inc., the financial services company founded by Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsquareup.com%2Fus%2Fen%2Fpress%2Ftidal&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F3%2F4%2F22313108%2Fsquare-inc-tidal-majority-stake-jack-dorsey-jay-z" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;acquiring a majority stake&lt;/a&gt; in Tidal, the high-fidelity audio and video streaming service led by Jay-Z. Square is paying $297 million in cash and stock for a “significant majority ownership stake” and says Tidal will operate independently alongside Square’s other ventures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gXO1E9"&gt;Asking the obvious question in a thread on Twitter, Dorsey &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1367460907958243328"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: “Why would a music streaming company and a financial services company join forces?!” His answer: to find “new ways for artists to support their work.” Just as Square gave sellers new tools to make money, Dorsey says the company’s stake in Tidal will help artists find similar support in the new digital ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="crex6a"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Square is acquiring a majority ownership stake in TIDAL through a new joint venture, with the original artists becoming the second largest group of shareholders, and JAY-Z joining the Square board. Why would a music streaming company and a financial services company join forces?!&lt;/p&gt;— jack (@jack) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1367460907958243328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lJnJFO"&gt;“Given what Square has been able to do for sellers of all sizes and individuals through Cash App, we believe we can now work for artists to see the same success for them, and us,” tweeted Dorsey. “Square created ecosystems of tools for sellers &amp;amp; individuals, and we’ll do the same for artists. We’ll work on entirely new listening experiences to bring fans closer together, simple integrations for merch sales, modern collaboration tools, and new complementary revenue streams.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ecQfm3"&gt;Tidal was founded in Norway in 2014 before being bought by a consortium of artists led by Jay-Z the following year for $56 million. Artist-owners included Coldplay, Rihanna, Daft Punk, and Madonna. The new owners positioned Tidal in opposition to big tech’s streaming services, promising fans high-quality audio and exclusive content. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dBVK2F"&gt;Tidal quickly ran into problems, though, failing to secure exclusive content over the long term or attract subscribers to rival the likes of Spotify. In 2017, the company secured a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/23/14357462/tidal-sprint-investment-future-tmobile"&gt;$200 million investment&lt;/a&gt; from Sprint (now merged with T-Mobile) but reports the following year said &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/28/17510390/tidal-streaming-service-subscribers-spotify-apple-music"&gt;subscriber growth had stalled&lt;/a&gt;. At that time, the service was said to have roughly 3 million paying customers, compared to Spotify’s 20 million that same year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1Gyim"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9534646/square-tidal-acquisition-majority-stake-jay-z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that as of 2020, Tidal was still behind on payments to rights holders, a problem Square’s cash injection might solve. The company’s revenue reportedly grew 13 percent to $166.9 million in 2019 according to financial documents filed in the UK by parent company Project Panther Bidco, but losses also rose from $36 million to $55.19 million in that same period. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="6OsVKh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Tidal will continue to offer its streaming service alongside new tools for artists&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NquHPb"&gt;Now, Tidal has another chance to reinvent itself. &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9534646/square-tidal-acquisition-majority-stake-jay-z"&gt;Speaking to &lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Square’s hardware lead Jesse Dorogusker, who will serve as interim head of Tidal, said the company would build out new tools for artists while continuing to offer its streaming service to consumers. “We think the streaming service is an important part of it, and it is growing and will continue to grow,” Dorogusker told the publication. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qf18HQ"&gt;As part of the deal, Jay-Z will join Square’s board of directors. “I said from the beginning that Tidal was about more than just streaming music, and six years later, it has remained a platform that supports artists at every point in their careers,” said Jay-Z in a press statement. “Artists deserve better tools to assist them in their creative journey. Jack and I have had many discussions about Tidal’s endless possibilities that have made me even more inspired about its future. This shared vision makes me even more excited to join the Square board. This partnership will be a game-changer for many. I look forward to all this new chapter has to offer!”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Senators call on FCC to quadruple base high-speed internet speeds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Janet Yellen Confirmation Hearing For Treasury Secretary Before Senate Finance Committee" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vxcU2F0IVLZoMntp4hEn5oqPCt0=/0x0:5374x3583/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68909919/1230675894.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="6A0XFv"&gt;The federal government’s definition of high-speed broadband has remained stagnant over the last six years, sitting at 25Mbps down and 3Mbps up since 2015. But faced with pandemic-fueled network loads and a new push for infrastructure spending, lawmakers are getting ready to upgrade that definition. &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344741/2021_0304_Bipartisan_Broadband_Speed_Letter_FINAL__1___1_.pdf"&gt;In a letter to government leaders&lt;/a&gt; Thursday, a bipartisan group of senators called for a quadrupling of base high-speed broadband delivery speeds making 100Mbps down and 100Mbps up the new base for high-speed broadband. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GUMUQu"&gt;“Going forward, we should make every effort to spend limited federal dollars on broadband networks capable of providing sufficient download and upload speeds and quality,”  Sens. Michael Bennet (D-CO), Joe Manchin (D-WV), Angus King (I-ME), and Rob Portman (R-OH) &lt;a href="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344741/2021_0304_Bipartisan_Broadband_Speed_Letter_FINAL__1___1_.pdf"&gt;wrote to the FCC&lt;/a&gt; and other agencies. “There is no reason federal funding to rural areas should not support the type of speeds used by households in typical well-served urban and suburban areas.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rR7OeW"&gt;The letter calls on the FCC and other agencies to change their definitions of “high speed broadband” to anything above 100Mbps down and 100Mbps up — a shift that would prohibit the FCC from identifying an area as being served with broadband unless it met those speed criteria. It’s a complete change of pace from the FCC under former Chairman Ajit Pai’s leadership, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242635/fcc-ajit-pai-internet-speed-advanced-telecommunications-3mbps"&gt;which established&lt;/a&gt; the previous 25 / 3Mbps standard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dv6jGE"&gt;“We find that the current speed benchmark of 25/3 Mbps remains an appropriate measure by which to assess whether a fixed service is providing advanced telecommunications capability,” the FCC’s report said earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zXhF1C"&gt;The current base speeds for high-speed broadband aren’t nearly enough for a moderately sized family working from home. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242635/fcc-ajit-pai-internet-speed-advanced-telecommunications-3mbps"&gt;Zoom recommends&lt;/a&gt; 3.8Mbps upload speeds for just one 1080p video, and the shift to remote schooling and work has forced many families to run multiple simultaneous streams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mmEMFX"&gt;“Ask any senior who connects with their physician via telemedicine, any farmer hoping to unlock the benefits of precision agriculture, or any student who receives livestreamed instruction, or any family where both parents telework and multiple children are remote learning, and they will tell you that many networks fail to come close to ‘high speed’ in the year 2021,” the senators wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HyqIxM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated 3/4/21 at 8:15AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated quotes to reflect final text of the letter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xiaomi’s $260 Redmi Note 10 Pro has a 120Hz screen and a 108-megapixel camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jltKGHYnQkYNli9YcfnYVoHLGc0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68909890/DSCF7567.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gL9v7g"&gt;Xiaomi has announced its Redmi Note 10 line, the latest in its phone series that’s titanically popular in India and beyond. As is tradition for the Redmi Note phones, the 10 series brings some high-end features to much lower price points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4ShkYe"&gt;The Redmi Note 10 Pro is the main attraction here, with several variants including the Note 10S, Note 10, and Note 10 5G adjusting various specs to meet different price points. The Note 10 Pro’s standout feature is its 6.67-inch 1080p OLED display with a 120Hz refresh rate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rVULZW"&gt;The Note 10 Pro also has a 108-megapixel primary camera alongside an 8-megapixel ultrawide, a 5-megapixel “telemacro”, and a 2-megapixel depth sensor. On paper, that puts its camera setup in reach of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310843/xiaomi-mi-11-review-samsung"&gt;Xiaomi’s new Mi 11 flagship&lt;/a&gt;, though the Note 10 Pro’s 1.55-inch 108-megapixel sensor is a little smaller. The holepunch selfie camera, meanwhile, is 16 megapixels.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Is_OcSDViqMD2ts3YzIE2xsXkd4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344632/DSCF7564.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DxgQOC"&gt;Other specs include a Snapdragon 732 processor, 6GB or 8GB of RAM, 64GB or 128GB of storage, a 5,020mAh battery, 33W fast charging, a microSD card slot plus two separate SIM card slots, stereo speakers, a fingerprint sensor in the power button, and a headphone jack. The biggest omission is wireless charging, but that’s not a surprise for a device in this price range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPmWz8"&gt;Xiaomi wouldn’t provide full international pricing details ahead of the launch, but the Indian variant of the Redmi Note 10 Pro is called the Redmi Note 10 Pro Max and starts at Rs. 18,999 (~$260) for a model with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. The non-Max Indian Note 10 Pro is identical but has a 64-megapixel main camera instead and starts at 15,999 (~$220) for the 6GB/64GB model.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s new Alexa app for Xbox brings visual assistant features to your TV</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-FHeu6JZrp7AeYyOlHUA2oC6C5Y=/1x0:1618x1078/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68909765/alexaxbox.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amazon’s new Alexa app on Xbox.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QTQuJu"&gt;Amazon is launching a new Alexa app for Xbox consoles this week. While you’ve been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/6/17826718/microsoft-xbox-one-alexa-features-support-voice-control"&gt;able to control Alexa from an Xbox&lt;/a&gt; for a couple of years now, this dedicated app will provide access to more of the visual parts of Amazon’s digital assistant. That includes being able to see your doorbell camera, reading emails and checking your calendar, and even seeing weather forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WwwarG"&gt;It essentially turns your Xbox into more of an Echo Show-like experience for Alexa. All of the usual Xbox controls are still supported with this new app, including the ability to turn on an Xbox console using a compatible Alexa device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dfkFGs"&gt;Amazon is gradually rolling out this new Alexa app for Xbox in the coming days, and it will be available across all Xbox One and Xbox Series X / S consoles. You should be able to &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fp%2Falexa-for-xbox%2F9ngdjk7chn45%3Fwa%3Dwsignin1.0%26activetab%3Dpivot%3Aoverviewtab" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;download the Alexa app from the Microsoft Store&lt;/a&gt; right now, but we’ve tried to get it to work with a couple of Xbox consoles and it doesn’t appear to be fully live just yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ALfnZX"&gt;Here are some of the new commands available with the visual version of Alexa on Xbox:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="WhVbyh"&gt;Alexa, play &amp;lt;artist name&amp;gt; on Xbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8syrRC"&gt;Alexa, show me the front door camera&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="hoGq73"&gt;Alexa, show me my email&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PSdMLz"&gt;Alexa, show me my calendar&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PWoU3H"&gt;Alexa, show me the weather&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <title>Skydio drones reportedly owned by more than 20 US police agencies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/cEhPeojzvt8pF63bnU10JGKZDnU=/57x0:1557x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68909699/Skydio_X2_commercial_drone.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Skydio’s X2 drone, which is aimed at enterprise and military customers.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Skydio&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xyFTwa"&gt;More than 20 police agencies around the US own drones from US manufacturer Skydio, according to &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2021/03/03/drones-with-most-advanced-ai-ever-coming-soon-to-your-local-police-department/?sh=619d88073f0b"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which calculated the figure based on a combination of freedom of information requests and public announcements. The report follows news that Skydio is the first US dronemaker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/1/22306876/skydio-1-billion-valuation-enterprise-military-customers-chinese-drones-grounded"&gt;to be valued at over $1 billion&lt;/a&gt; following a recent funding round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aal5uj"&gt;Working with police departments is thought to be part of Skydio’s attempt to make inroads against dominant player DJI, which is &lt;a href="https://droneii.com/the-drone-manufacturer-ranking-2020"&gt;said to command&lt;/a&gt; between 70 and 80 percent of the commercial drone market. Skydio started offering its drones to government agencies for free last year, and over 30 public agencies reportedly took them up on the offer. America’s Custom and Border Protection is also testing using the company’s drones this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="lgtcMP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Steering away from that just because it’s controversial or polarizing would be the wrong thing to do”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YqXNyS"&gt;Skydio’s prospects have been helped by the US government’s recent decision to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22188789/dji-ban-commerce-entity-list-drone-china-transaction-blocked"&gt;add DJI to the Department of Commerce’s Entity List&lt;/a&gt;. Although DJI’s consumer business hasn’t seen a significant impact, with customers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/18/22190097/dji-blacklist-ban-xinjiang-entity-list-trump"&gt;still able to buy and use its drones&lt;/a&gt;, the move has reportedly caused some police departments to explore ditching its devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lcw1Nt"&gt;The selling point of Skydio’s drones is their self-flying technology, and &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt; notes that police forces find this helpful for having the drones fly inside buildings or through forests. Last year, one of the company’s drones was used to help a SWAT team during a standoff with armed suspects in Burlington, Massachusetts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lq2RWs"&gt;Although Skydio’s CEO Adam Bry admits that working with government agencies may mean its drones are used in “potentially polarizing and charged situations,” he tells &lt;em&gt;Forbes,&lt;/em&gt; “steering away from that just because it’s controversial or polarizing would be the wrong thing to do.” In comments &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/26/technology/anduril-military-palmer-luckey.html"&gt;given to the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO has come out strongly against Skydio’s drones being used with weapons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="slCPfx"&gt;“We are not putting weapons on the drone,” Bry said. “Weaponization is the one thing where you want less automation, not more.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s Windows 10 UI overhaul continues with new system icons</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ORL0hmH3Mp9m216ciRqw0xvwwHM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68909695/wjoel_200601_1777_windows10_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by William Joel / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ds0o2Y"&gt;Microsoft is starting to modernize some of the basic parts of Windows 10 by improving the system icons that are available in the operating system. A &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/03/03/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-21327/"&gt;new preview build&lt;/a&gt; of Windows 10 is rolling out to testers this week, and it includes system icons that now adhere to Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/11/15615812/microsoft-fluent-design-system-project-neon-features"&gt;Fluent Design style&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="da8rAF"&gt;The new icons include a more rounded and simplified look, and are available as a new font — Segoe Fluent Icons. Microsoft has also updated its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217153/microsoft-windows-10-taskbar-weather-news-widget-feature"&gt;new taskbar widget&lt;/a&gt; with the new icons, providing a good look at how basic icon changes can modernize even the smallest parts of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8rj1f1eC2qyCNxI0NWpYemsD8n8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344675/windows10systemicons.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Some of the new system icons for Windows 10.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UybnYc"&gt;It’s a small change to Windows 10 that will appear later this year for most, but it’s part of a broader push by Microsoft to overhaul Windows 10. Microsoft updated some of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/20/21145157/microsoft-windows-10-new-icons-modern-release-update-apps"&gt;Windows 10 icons&lt;/a&gt; last year with colorful versions, and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/1/21310597/microsoft-windows-10-start-menu-design-new-alt-tab-features"&gt;tweaked the Start menu&lt;/a&gt; to make it a little more streamlined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LfH67u"&gt;Microsoft is also planning a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212817/microsoft-windows-10-visual-changes-update-sun-valley-2021"&gt;sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows&lt;/a&gt;,” codenamed Sun Valley. It might seem like Microsoft has been promising visual overhauls of Windows 10 for years with its Fluent Design push, but even bigger UI changes look set to appear later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RrxUJe"&gt;The Windows Start menu, File Explorer, and built-in apps are all expected to be overhauled as part of this UI refresh. Even basic things like buttons, controls, and sliders in apps should get some design love. This should mean Windows will look a lot more consistent, and hopefully a lot of the ancient icons and Windows 95-era prompts start to disappear. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C8sBYIWNa8rWlyPt9CwJMaSz8_A=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22344679/News_and_interests_redesign.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new system icons in action.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GtjpMN"&gt;Microsoft has put a lot of work into improving its UI consistency in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22230554/microsoft-windows-10x-leak-chrome-os-chromebooks-hands-on"&gt;Windows 10X&lt;/a&gt;, an upcoming version of Windows that will be designed for Chromebook-like devices. Windows 10X includes a new Start menu, and lots of changes to basic controls like Wi-Fi, the notification center, and more. It feels like a stripped back, more simplified version of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BxAIdI"&gt;How Microsoft markets Windows 10X could be a hint at where it sees Windows heading in the future. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/_h0x0d_/status/1365150436366241797"&gt;Rumors suggest&lt;/a&gt; the company is gearing up to use “the new Windows” as a marketing term, and we’re expecting Microsoft to have a lot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/2/22261997/microsoft-news-events-gaming-cloud-windows"&gt;more Windows news soon&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft is planning events in the coming weeks to detail its future plans for gaming, Windows, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hK01YD"&gt;While Microsoft held its Ignite conference this week, the company had very little to say about Windows. Microsoft’s head of Windows and devices, Panos Panay, acknowledged that news is on the way, though. “I haven’t talked about the next generation of Windows, and what’s coming next,” said Panay during an &lt;a href="https://myignite.microsoft.com/sessions/b3da6f4e-1f60-45fb-b58a-35a9dfe8f062?source=schedule"&gt;Ignite session&lt;/a&gt; earlier this week. “I’m so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2015/10/6/9465373/microsoft-surface-panos-panay-pumped"&gt;pumped&lt;/a&gt;. The future of Windows is incredible, but we’re here today to talk about Windows 10.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oWT5iU"&gt;It’s unusual to hear Microsoft talk about its “next generation of Windows,” particularly as the company has stuck to the Windows 10 branding since its debut nearly six years ago. I don’t think that means we’re about to see a Windows 11, but how Microsoft separates out Windows 10 and Windows 10X will be key to avoiding any confusion (hello, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/13/4833408/surface-rt-naming-caused-some-confusion"&gt;Windows RT&lt;/a&gt;). That’s especially true if Windows 10X doesn’t support legacy desktop apps at launch, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/11/21132826/microsoft-windows-10x-features-dual-screen-foldable-hands-on-developers"&gt;our recent look at the OS suggests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="T3xet7"&gt;In the weeks before and after the 2020 US election, Facebook content from far-right sources of news and misinformation received more engagement than other sources elsewhere on the political spectrum, a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/cybersecurity-for-democracy/far-right-news-sources-on-facebook-more-engaging-e04a01efae90"&gt;new study from New York University&lt;/a&gt; has revealed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKcxK2"&gt;The findings suggest that far-right pages have an advantage energizing followers on the world’s biggest social network. “My takeaway is that, one way or another, far-right misinformation sources are able to engage on Facebook with their audiences much, much more than any other category,” Laura Edelson, a researcher at NYU’s Cybersecurity for Democracy initiative who helped compile the report, &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2021/03/03/tech/facebook-right-wing-misinformation/index.html"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;CNN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “That’s probably pretty dangerous on a system that uses engagement to determine what content to promote.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KH661j"&gt;Researchers looked at some 8.6 million public posts shared by 2,973 “news and information sources” from August 10th, 2020 to January 11th, 2021, categorizing the political slant and verisimilitude of their output based on evaluations by independent outlets like &lt;a href="https://www.newsguardtech.com/"&gt;NewsGuard&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/"&gt;Media Bias/Fact Check&lt;/a&gt;. The study measured how often Facebook users engaged with this content — sharing, commenting, or responding with reactions.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Data from NYU’s study shows far-right sources of news and misinformation outperforming other parts of the political spectrum. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="GTIXya"&gt;Their findings showed that far-right sources generated the highest average number of interactions per post, followed by far-left sources, then more centrist pages. Looking specifically at far-right sources, they found that pages spreading misinformation performed best. “Far-right sources designated as spreaders of misinformation had an average of 426 interactions per thousand followers per week, while non-misinformation sources had an average of 259 weekly interactions per thousand followers,” write the researchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QYqqXN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Being a consistent spreader of far-right misinformation appears to confer a significant advantage”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tyMv0z"&gt;Notably, the study showed that while spreading misinformation meant less engagement for sources on the far-left, left, center, and right wing of the political spectrum, it actually seemed to be an advantage for sources on the far-right. “Being a consistent spreader of far-right misinformation appears to confer a significant advantage,” said the authors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BnEICQ"&gt;The study is yet more evidence against the claim made by conservative politicians that Facebook is biased against right-wing sources. It also casts doubts on the efficacy of Facebook’s efforts to limit the spread of misinformation in the run-up to the US 2020 election. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PvpZtc"&gt;The researchers behind the study note that their findings are limited, too. Although they were able to measure and compare engagement from different sources on Facebook, they couldn’t check how many people actually saw a piece of content or how long they spent reading it. Facebook simply doesn’t provide this data, leaving an incomplete picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ijE6Y9"&gt;“Such information would help researchers better analyze &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; far-right content is more engaging,” write the researchers. “Further research is needed to determine to what extent Facebook algorithms feed into this trend, for example, and to conduct analysis across other popular platforms, such as YouTube, Twitter, and TikTok. Without greater transparency and access to data, such research questions are out of reach.” &lt;/p&gt;
