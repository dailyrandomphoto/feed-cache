    <title>FCC filing shows Verizon has built a smart display powered by Amazon’s Alexa </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UWjuB7hdClKKJ9M-IahFNqXbg5I=/126x0:1248x748/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69508856/verizon_display_2.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;An image of a smart display device from a patent application Verizon filed with the FCC | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://fccid.io/NKR-LVD1-IDU" target="_blank"&gt;FCC&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mzMYwW"&gt;According to a Friday filing with the Federal Communications Commission (first &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/verizon-smart-display-alexa"&gt;discovered by &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), Verizon is preparing to launch a smart display device based on the Alexa voice assistant. &lt;a href="https://fccid.io/NKR-LVD1-IDU"&gt;The FCC filing shows&lt;/a&gt; a basic-looking device that resembles an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22529891/amazon-echo-show-5-2nd-gen-alexa-smart-display-review"&gt;Amazon Echo&lt;/a&gt;, with an 8-inch display and front-facing camera, and the specs show it has 4GB of RAM, 16GB of internal storage, Bluetooth, wi-fi and 4G connectivity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAXnhT"&gt;It’s not clear from the filing what the user interface will look like on its screen but the device, referred to as LVD1, will “wake” when users speak the phrase “Hi Verizon” to it. That would seem to confirm, as &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; notes, that the device is part of Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231336/amazon-alexa-auto-ai-custom-digital-assistants-car-makers"&gt;Alexa Custom Assistant program&lt;/a&gt;, which allows companies to build their own versions of Alexa for their branded devices. building Alexa skills specific to certain devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3Zvd4"&gt;A user manual included in the FCC filing indicates the device supports the BlueJeans videoconferencing platform that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/16/21223454/verizon-bluejeans-video-zoom-conferencing-rivals"&gt;Verizon acquired last April&lt;/a&gt;, which would be a logical use for it. At the time of the acquisition, Verizon said in a statement that “BlueJeans will be deeply integrated into Verizon’s 5G product roadmap, providing secure and real-time engagement solutions for high growth areas such as telemedicine, distance learning and field service work.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pe3mo"&gt;Verizon didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GbHHE2"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volkswagen plans to stop selling combustion engine vehicles in Europe by 2035</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tYpBVgWDxjXIUPCNOHg6gZet4DQ=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69508669/acastro_200406_1777_volkswagen_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="innDt7"&gt;Volkswagen plans to stop selling combustion engines in Europe by 2035, a board member told German newspaper &lt;em&gt;Muenchner Merkur  &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/sustainable-business/vw-end-sales-combustion-engines-europe-by-2035-2021-06-26/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Lnb90"&gt;Klaus Zellmer, Volkswagen’s board member for sales, told the newspaper that the company would “exit the business with internal combustion engine cars in Europe between 2033 and 2035.” But, he added, it would take longer to stop selling combustion engines in the US and China— that will come “somewhate later,” he said— and in South America and Africa, where he said “it will take a good deal longer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCpK1a"&gt;Zellmer said the automaker’s entire fleet will be carbon neutral by 2050 at the latest. He wants to see electric vehicles to account for 70 percent of the company’s total sales in Europe by 2030. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HHgy1V"&gt;Volkswagen’s carbon-neutral targets are close to several competitors; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287284/ford-electric-vehicles-ev-europe-2030"&gt;Ford said earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; will only sell electric vehicles in Europe by 2030, and plans to spend $1 billion to convert its factory in Cologne, Germany, into an EV production line. And in April &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399212/honda-gas-car-phase-out-2040-electric-vehicle"&gt;Honda said it plans&lt;/a&gt; to phase out gas-powered cars by 2040. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="td3AC3"&gt;Several European countries have their own targets for banning traditional gas-powered vehicles, with Norway aiming for 2025 and France looking at 2040, and the UK planning on 2050. In the US, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452825/california-ban-combustion-gas-vehicles-cars-2035"&gt;California plans&lt;/a&gt; to ban the sale of gas-powered vehicles by 2035, with several other states adopting California’s model. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Johnson &amp; Johnson settles opioid case with New York for $230 million</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration Johnson &amp;amp;amp; Johnson logo seen..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pJ3hZO6Ri4Qq_KmEvKxwchF5JLU=/0x209:5000x3542/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69508384/1233004651.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo Illustration by Igor Golovniov/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5XARA0"&gt;Pharmaceutical company Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson will pay $230 million to settle an opioid lawsuit with the state of New York, the state’s attorney general said Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZyu5f"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2021/attorney-general-james-reaches-230-million-settlement-treatment-and-prevention"&gt;release from New York AG Letitia James&lt;/a&gt;, Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson “has committed to ending the manufacture and sale of all opioids and opioid products for distribution in the state of New York, as well as to no longer ship these products anywhere within the United States.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6mC6i"&gt;The company &lt;a href="https://www.jnj.com/johnson-johnson-reaches-opioid-settlement-agreement-with-new-york-state-consistent-with-terms-of-previously-announced-broader-settlement-agreement-in-principle"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt; Saturday that it “made the business decision in 2020 to discontinue all of its prescription pain medications in the United States.” The settlement removes Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson from a trial &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/johnson-johnson-settles-new-york-opioid-case-for-230-million-11624716067?mod=hp_lead_pos1"&gt;scheduled to begin in New York on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, but not from other cases across the US, where local governments, states, and Native American tribes have sued pharmaceutical companies over the flow of opioids into their communities.  &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/johnson-johnsons-oklahoma-opioid-penalty-reduced-to-465-million-11573854343?mod=article_inline"&gt;Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson was ordered to pay $465 million&lt;/a&gt; in an opioid case in Oklahoma in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NZ78bm"&gt; “Johnson &amp;amp; Johnson helped fuel this fire, but today they’re committing to leaving the opioid business — not only in New York, but across the entire country,” James said in a statement. “Opioids will no longer be manufactured or sold in the United States by J&amp;amp;J.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAqswQ"&gt;The drugmaker said in its statement Saturday that the settlement was not an admission of liability or wrongdoing, and is “consistent with the terms of the &lt;a href="https://www.jnj.com/statement-on-opioid-resolution"&gt;previously announced&lt;/a&gt; $5 billion all-in settlement agreement in principle for the resolution of opioid lawsuits and claims by states, cities, counties and tribal governments.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hsAp0a"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qr1mEM"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dune release date has been delayed yet again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nDDxOlU8K9y3bSKGxSlV4WQYVc0=/288x0:1574x857/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69508062/chalamet.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9xhJrPXop4&amp;amp;ab_channel=WarnerBros.Pictures" target="_blank"&gt;WarnerBros&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zwgNNr"&gt;Denis Villeneuve’s &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;was among the big 2020 movies that saw its release date delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. After being moved to October 1st, Dune’s release has been pushed back yet again, this time to October 22nd, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2021/film/news/dune-delayed-warner-bros-1235005456/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;reports. The move was one of several releases Warner Bros. rescheduled, with the Clint Eastwood-directed &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1924245/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cry Macho&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; moved to September 17th, and &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8110232/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Many Saints of Newark&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; a prequel to &lt;em&gt;The Sopranos&lt;/em&gt;, moved to October 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lHrZsV"&gt;The adaptation of the 1965 Frank Herbert sci-fi classic has an all-star cast that includes Timothée Chalamet, Rebecca Ferguson, Oscar Isaac, Stellan Skarsgård, Zendaya, Jason Momoa, Josh Brolin, Dave Bautista, and Javier Bardem. &lt;em&gt;Dune &lt;/em&gt;is slated to be the first of two movies based on the book. The movie coming out in October (at this point, anyway) will cover the massive novel’s first half, while a second as-yet-unnamed movie is planned to cover the rest. There was also an &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2019/6/10/18660412/dune-villenueve-dune-movie-streaming-show-sisterhood"&gt;HBO Max prequel series&lt;/a&gt; in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="7OWyQi"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n9xhJrPXop4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mTD8H6"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; is among the upcoming Warner Bros. movies slated to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;debut on HBO Max&lt;/a&gt; at the same time it hits theaters. That controversial decision &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150605/hbo-max-warner-bros-movies-2021-simultaneous-release-matrix-godzilla-suicide-squad-space-jam"&gt;announced by Warner Bros. in December&lt;/a&gt;, didn’t sit well with many in the industry including Villenueve. He blasted the studio’s then-parent company AT&amp;amp;T, saying in a &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/film/news/dune-denis-villeneuve-blasts-warner-bros-1234851270/#article-comments"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Variety &lt;/em&gt;op-ed&lt;/a&gt; that it had “hijacked one of the most respectable and important studios in film history.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22439964/at-t-warnermedia-discovery-merger-spin-off"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T announced in May&lt;/a&gt; that it would spin off its WarnerMedia business to merge it with TV company Discovery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jXBIwa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dune&lt;/em&gt; is still scheduled to have its world premiere at the Venice International Film Festival in September.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Start your weekend off right with eBay’s early Independence Day deals</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N2rKS-f2EsH5xFZQS9Lz4n6TTkI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69508012/akrales_190716_3546_0161.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Bose 700 offer some of the best noise cancellation you can get, especially for shy of $250. | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RWUXw6"&gt;Prime Day is officially behind us — well, sort of. The annual two-day shopping blitz saw an abundance of terrific discounts, from noise-canceling headphones to brilliant OLED TVs, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/6/23/22546806/prime-day-leftover-deals-apple-headphones-video-games-sale"&gt;some of which have stuck around&lt;/a&gt; for the remainder of the week. Retailers are already moving on, however, and we’re already seeing an influx of deals ahead of Independence Day, including a sizable discount on one of our favorite pairs of noise-canceling headphones, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/19/20700627/bose-noise-cancelling-headphones-700-redesigned-microphones-review"&gt;Bose 700&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NQDyer"&gt;But eBay isn’t the only one offering discounts this weekend. Right now, you can also save on Apple’s luxe Magic Keyboard for the iPad Pro, the perfect summer speaker, and the white whale that is Microsoft’s Xbox Series S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6fqE1h"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fe%2F_electronics%2Ffourth-of-july-certified-refurbished-coupon%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkevt%3D1%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26campid%3D5336757017%26toolid%3D10001%26customid%3D66960X1514734Xee175627ef5fb0ed8783debb55597fa3&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F6%2F26%2F22550441%2Frefurbished-headphones-bose-700-apple-magic-keyboard-bluetooth-speaker-xbox-series-s-deal-ebay-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Save 15 percent on refurbished headphones and more at eBay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="MgAvcX"&gt;While we don’t always recommend picking up pre-owned gear, it’s hard to ignore a 15 percent discount on products that are already discounted and certified refurbished. In preparation for the 4th of July, eBay is offering exactly that, slashing prices (up to $150) on some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21345733/best-noise-canceling-headphones"&gt;best noise-canceling headphones&lt;/a&gt;, along with chargers, smart thermostats, and a range of other popular items.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jcuekx"&gt;To take advantage of the limited-time offer, just use coupon code &lt;strong&gt;JULY4SAVINGS&lt;/strong&gt; on any of the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fe%2F_electronics%2Ffourth-of-july-certified-refurbished-coupon%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkevt%3D1%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26campid%3D5336757017%26toolid%3D10001%26customid%3D66960X1514734Xee175627ef5fb0ed8783debb55597fa3&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2021%2F6%2F26%2F22550441%2Frefurbished-headphones-bose-700-apple-magic-keyboard-bluetooth-speaker-xbox-series-s-deal-ebay-sale" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;eligible items listed here&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p id="7T1V3M"&gt;Apple’s Magic Keyboards are easily the best way to turn Apple’s iconic tablet into a laptop, or at least something that resembles one. They offer USB-C connectivity, a trackpad, and a sturdy, clamshell design that makes for a terrific typing experience, so long as you don’t mind a little heft. Normally on sale for upwards of $300, Best Buy is currently offering the  &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1744442736410767329#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Magic Keyboard for $199&lt;/a&gt;, more than 40 percent off the initial list price. Keep in mind that this model is only compatible with the third- and fourth-gen, 12-9-inch iPad Pro. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/20/21227345/magic-keyboard-ipad-pro-tablet-laptop-review-price-specs-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="rqIAGT"&gt;Summer’s arrival marks many things, including the opportunity to get outside. And if you’re looking to hit the pool or your backyard for an outdoor hang, a little Bluetooth speaker can go a long way in kicking out the jams. Like most speakers in the Ultimate Ears lineup, the Wonderboom 2 offers clear, dependable sound, but does so within a pint-sized waterproof package that also floats and can take a bit of a beating. Temporarily on clearance, the Wonderboom 2 is &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/___vg__p_22314050__t_w__r_theverge.com__d_D/https://www.att.com/buy/accessories/speakers/ultimate-ears-wonderboom-2-speaker-black.html?source=ECAuAT10600aff12A&amp;amp;wtExtndSource=5513721&amp;amp;CI=CJ_AFFILIATE&amp;amp;RI=CJ1&amp;amp;RD=37922269&amp;amp;tfn=aff&amp;amp;cjevent=6a0b300fd57611eb802016ad0a1c0e12" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available at AT&amp;amp;T for $65&lt;/a&gt;, the best price we’ve seen on the portable speaker this year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/6/4/18647361/ultimate-ears-wonderboom-2-bluetooth-speaker-update-waterproof-stereo-battery-99" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read our review&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="qSjvHO"&gt;Like the Series X, Microsoft’s Xbox Series S hasn’t exactly been easy to find, with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260564/microsoft-xbox-series-x-stock-june-supply-constraints" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;shortages likely to continue&lt;/a&gt; into the second half of the year.

    <title>Telegram adds group video calling at last</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9Y6DRZ95wiWqIFOnBffjJ7olZsY=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69507830/acastro_180417_1777_telegram_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jhZcmr"&gt;Messaging chat app &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/group-video-calls"&gt;Telegram has added&lt;/a&gt; group video chat to its mobile and desktop apps at last, something it promised was coming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/24/21234254/telegram-messaging-app-group-video-calling-security-usability"&gt;back in April 2020&lt;/a&gt;. Voice chats in any group on the platform can be turned into video calls by tapping the camera icon to turn on your device’s video. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OmrKBr"&gt;Telegram says an unlimited number of users can participate in an audio call, but group video calls will be limited to the first 30 people who join a voice chat. The company plans to increase that limit “soon,” it said in its announcement. Users can also share their screens during a video call. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fxzp3CS0er15Ow9eJ4VGZQoJjOE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22683167/telegram_gif_video_calls.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://telegram.org/blog/group-video-calls" target="_blank"&gt;Telegram&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Fc4J8B"&gt;Telegram CEO &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/telegram/status/1349014065931284480?s=20"&gt;Pavel Durov said in January&lt;/a&gt; that the company had reached 500 million active users, many of whom came to the platform after the Facebook-owned rival chat platform &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22233257/whatsapp-privacy-policy-update-delayed-three-months"&gt;WhatsApp bungled the introduction&lt;/a&gt; of a new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/28/22458805/whatsapp-privacy-policy-no-plans-limit-functionality"&gt;privacy policy&lt;/a&gt;. Still, Telegram’s introduction of group video calls lags the competition; WhatsApp, which had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/12/21134652/whatsapp-2-billion-monthly-active-users-encryption-facebook"&gt;2 billion users&lt;/a&gt; as of February,  &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/30/17632650/whatsapp-group-video-calling-feature-now-live"&gt;added group video and voice calling&lt;/a&gt; in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqVe3u"&gt;Along with the long-awaited group video calls, Telegram added several other new features, including improved noise suppression, and animated backgrounds. Users on Telegram’s iOS or Android apps can choose from several default options or &lt;a href="https://telegram.org/blog/animated-backgrounds"&gt;create their own&lt;/a&gt; animated backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y7GHcd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla ‘recalls’ more than 285,000 vehicles in China over cruise control safety concerns </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tDe45_IiRa1tKXB34h_1OpN37fc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69507693/acastro_180430_1777_tesla_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uoDnLm"&gt;Tesla has had a run of bad publicity in China so far this year, with officials raising &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22454369/tesla-china-datacenter-process-locally-spying-fears"&gt;concerns over security risks&lt;/a&gt;, and protests about how the US automaker &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/20/22394638/tesla-shanghai-auto-show-protest-brake-failure"&gt;handles customer complaints&lt;/a&gt; in the country. On Saturday the stretch of bad news continued, as &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-recalls-285-000-vehicles-in-china-most-of-them-locally-made-11624698587"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Tesla is recalling more than 285,000 vehicles in China—most of which were made locally— over a safety risk with the vehicles’ cruise control, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7GVtPF"&gt;China’s State Administration for Market Regulation said Saturday that the recall includes 249,855 Model 3 and Model Y vehicles that were made in Tesla’s Gigafactory in Shanghai, and 35,655 Model 3 vehicles which were imported, all produced between December 2019 and June 2021, the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; reported. According to the regulator the vehicles’ cruise control systems could be activated by accident, causing them to speed up unexpectedly. Owners can upgrade their vehicles’ cruise control systems software remotely. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oJHobN"&gt;Tesla didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment sent to its press email  on Saturday; the company disbanded its press office and doesn’t usually respond to media requests. The &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; reported that Tesla posted an apology to its page on Weibo, a social media platform in China. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xiHcI"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/10/17553094/tesla-china-gigafactory-cars-deal-agreement"&gt;Tesla signed an agreement&lt;/a&gt; to build a facility in China in 2018, and began delivering cars produced at its Shanghai Gigafactory in December 2019. The company said its goal was to produce 500,000 vehicles per year in China, the &lt;a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2021/02/electric-vehicle-market-global/"&gt;largest electric vehicle market&lt;/a&gt; in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly sends warning letter to Chinese leaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IjOarRV2oNTOUTQIzC-b_KTdAOw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69506761/vpavic_042020_3980_0055.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bH10md"&gt;Despite Apple’s efforts to keep anyone from finding out what it’s working on, leaks have continued to give the world early previews of new iPhones, Macs and more. Its campaign to plug the holes is apparently extending to threats of legal action, as the leaker known as “Kang” &lt;a href="https://weibo.com/1694917363/KlE4Ozlsd?from=page_1005051694917363_profile&amp;amp;wvr=6&amp;amp;mod=weibotime&amp;amp;ssl_rnd=1624542267.3793&amp;amp;type=comment"&gt;posted to Weibo&lt;/a&gt; this week about a notice he received from the company (via &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/06/24/reliable-leaker-kang-hit-with-warning/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEq4Ok"&gt;Kang currently holds the &lt;a href="https://appletrack.com/kang/"&gt;number one spot on the AppleTrack leaderboard&lt;/a&gt;, which attempts to compare the reliability of the information various leakers share, and &lt;a href="https://appletrack.com/apple-targets-leakers-and-collaborators-in-new-offensive-to-stop-rumors/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=ReviveOldPost"&gt;AppleTrack indicates&lt;/a&gt; that other leakers have received similar messages. Prior to the iPhone 12 launch, Kang posted about all four models that Apple had prepared, revealing their prices, colors and planned release dates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="WelwFO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"iPhone 12: everything we think we know about Apple’s 2020 5G iPhones, which could be announced on October 13th ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21423811/apple-iphone-12-max-pro-leaks-rumors-specs-design-2020"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="FLVL0Q"&gt;According to Kang, the letter from a law firm claimed that his actions could share information with Apple’s competitors, or mislead consumers about devices that aren’t coming. It also included screenshots of his Weibo page, showing posts beyond the leaks, like ones where he talked about problems he’s had with Apple products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GKPO8n"&gt;For his part, Kang claims to have never signed an NDA, published undisclosed pictures or profited from his information. Still, the tracker shows his information has revealed details about everything from the iPhone SE to the HomePod mini. Content creator Ben Geskin &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BenGeskin/status/1408121541150269446"&gt;mentioned receiving&lt;/a&gt; a similar notice last year, while fellow leaker L0vetodream (number five on the source ranking list) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/L0vetodream/status/1408018049102356484"&gt;said they had not received anything&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dnVfPT"&gt;Apple did not respond to a request for comment about the letters or how many were sent. As for Kang, the post indicates he won’t post “riddles” or “dreams” about upcoming devices, so while the weight of the threat is unclear, it may have had Apple’s intended effect.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="dIqS0m"&gt;&lt;a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/06/25/new-nobelium-activity/"&gt;Microsoft says&lt;/a&gt; some of its customer support tools were accessed by &lt;a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2020/12/21/december-21st-2020-solorigate-resource-center/"&gt;the hacking group Nobelium&lt;/a&gt;, which was also connected to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22288961/solarwinds-hack-100-companies-9-federal-agencies"&gt;the separate SolarWinds attack&lt;/a&gt;, due to a Microsoft customer service agent’s computer being compromised. Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-says-new-breach-discovered-probe-suspected-solarwinds-hackers-2021-06-25/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the agent had limited access, and was able to see things like what services customers used, and their billing contact information. According to Microsoft, the hackers used the info gleaned from the tools to start “highly targeted” attacks on specific Microsoft customers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8QeLAA"&gt;The attack, Microsoft says, was part of a larger Nobelium campaign largely focused on IT companies and governments throughout the world. The company says it’s reached out to the customers who were affected by the hacking group’s use of the tools, and that Nobelium no longer has access to the customer support agent’s device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jn2Cd"&gt;Microsoft has talked about security a lot today, especially in relation to its upcoming Windows 11, as the company tries to make the case for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550376/microsoft-windows-11-tpm-chips-requirement-security"&gt;requiring users to have specific hardware&lt;/a&gt; in order to upgrade. Incidents like these, where one compromised computer could give hackers a head start on future attacks, are illustrative of the cat-and-mouse game that Microsoft plays with those looking to breach its security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PE8IfW"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 26th 12:47PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Clarifies that the incident was separate from the SolarWinds attack&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Everything you need to know about the Pentagon’s UFO report</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JGjUQ6Q1lGKJM1OZDqPTf7C6PMo=/0x251:1454x1220/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69504421/Screen_Shot_2021_06_25_at_7.57.35_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Department of Defense/US Navy&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;For those who feel abducted by the recent UFO hype, this one’s for you &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Jz1cto"&gt;A highly anticipated report on the Pentagon’s research into Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), aka UFOs, was released today. It contains some very limited information from the Pentagon’s new UAP task force, which examines unknown objects through a national security lens. The Defense Department said last year it takes “any incursions by unauthorized aircraft into our training ranges or designated airspace very seriously...” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMQQlN"&gt;The government’s UAP program and the report have spawned a news cycle that has shot UFO conspiracies back into the mainstream. Despite the hype, the report absolutely does not contain proof of aliens. Here’s what we know so far. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="9roQWH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When will this Pentagon UFO report come out? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Sg1oZr"&gt;The Senate Intelligence Committee squeezed in a comment within last year’s massive COVID-19 relief bill that &lt;a href="https://www.intelligence.senate.gov/publications/intelligence-authorization-act-fiscal-year-2021"&gt;asked the Pentagon&lt;/a&gt; to cough up classified and unclassified versions of a UAP report in 180 days, or no later than Friday, June 25th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okuJcb"&gt;The nine-page report &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/25/22550575/pentagon-ufo-uap-unclassified-report-congress"&gt;is now available online&lt;/a&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="F4tL0R"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UAP? Why not say UFO?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="tFPuor"&gt;They’re basically the same thing. UAP stands for unidentified aerial phenomena, which is a new fancy way of saying unidentified flying objects. Naming a Pentagon program after UFOs would be far too silly for a big, very serious government intelligence program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B7bg1E"&gt;More seriously, putting “objects” in the name could be too limiting of a word for a program that deals with the unknown. Can we really consider them “objects” if we’re only seeing strange shapes through fuzzy camera footage from military aircraft? “Phenomena” would be a bit more accurate. It’s defined as “a fact or situation that is observed to exist or happen, especially one whose cause or explanation is in question.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="G8TULb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did this start?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cwgFOk"&gt;Depends on how far back you want to go. The US has dabbled in UFO research for decades, and various documents have been made public over the years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R0j299"&gt;The Air Force had &lt;a href="https://www.archives.gov/research/military/air-force/ufos"&gt;Project Blue Book&lt;/a&gt;, which closed in 1969 after investigating more than 12,500 UFO sightings. The CIA &lt;a href="https://www.theblackvault.com/documentarchive/ufos-the-central-intelligence-agency-cia-collection/"&gt;dumped a trove&lt;/a&gt; of historical UFO records in January, &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkdqjy/you-can-now-easily-download-all-cia-ufo-documents-to-date"&gt;revealing&lt;/a&gt; more government attempts to explain unidentified aerial phenomena in the years following Project Blue Book’s end. None of these historical records link any unexplained phenomena to extraterrestrial activity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="hqSxxI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Pentagon takes UAP “incursions... very seriously”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="m9Tjnn"&gt;The government says it’s generally interested in UAPs / UFOs out of national security concerns. In one statement from August last year, the Defense Department said it takes “any incursions by unauthorized aircraft into our training ranges or designated airspace very seriously and examine each report. This includes examinations of incursions that are initially reported as UAP when the observer cannot immediately identify what he or she is observing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v5l4Vw"&gt;Public fascination with UFOs generally &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/the-man-who-introduced-the-world-to-flying-saucers/372732/"&gt;dates back to 1947&lt;/a&gt;, when an amateur pilot flying his plane near Mount Rainier in Washington state reported sights of nine “saucer-like” objects darting across the sky. His recollection of what he saw spawned &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080413203646/http://www.mimufon.org/historical_folders/nicap_pages/ReportOnWaveOf1947.pdf"&gt;a wave of press attention&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ckR4Fi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But how did the most recent round of UFO... sorry — UAP — discourse start? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="HA6AJt"&gt;It started in 2017, when stories published by &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/16/us/politics/pentagon-program-ufo-harry-reid.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/12/16/pentagon-ufo-search-harry-reid-216111/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; confirmed the existence of the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP), a classified Pentagon project that began in 2007 to investigate unidentified phenomena and ended in 2012. Formally established under the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) and later transferred to the Defense Department’s headquarters, it was reportedly run primarily by former military intelligence official Luis Elizondo, who has said he resigned in 2017 over what he considered internal opposition to government-funded UAP research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lhmAh3"&gt;(It’s worth noting that both the &lt;em&gt;NYT&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; reports have been criticized as being credulous toward &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2019/06/01/ufo-unidentified-history-channel-luis-elizondo-pentagon/"&gt;Elizondo’s claims&lt;/a&gt; and overly accepting of the remote possibility that UAPs can be attributed to alien activity. A recent &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22463659/ufo-videos-navy-alien-drone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vox&lt;/em&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; does a good job of laying out some of the surrounding context and is worth a read.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PxFtKJ"&gt;AATIP also gathered studies on wild ideas straight out of science fiction, from nuclear propulsion to invisibility cloaking, warp drives, metallic glasses, programmable matter, etc., &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/29/18187178/pentagon-research-documents-invisibility-cloaking-wormholes-warp-drive-department-of-defense"&gt;according to a list&lt;/a&gt; of AATIP research products that was sent to Congress in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Former US Sen. Harry Reid&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UYY26K"&gt;According to the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Politico&lt;/em&gt; reports, AATIP’s initial “black” budget of $22 million — a minuscule amount compared to other Pentagon budgets — was pushed by former Nevada senator and space phenomena enthusiast Harry Reid. Most of that funding reportedly went to a Las Vegas-based space company owned by hotel chain magnate and UFO enthusiast Robert Bigelow, a &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/22463659/ufo-videos-navy-alien-drone"&gt;campaign donor&lt;/a&gt; to and longtime friend of Reid. Bigelow told the&lt;em&gt; Times &lt;/em&gt;that his company, Bigelow Aerospace, modified storage buildings at its headquarters to make room for mysterious “metal alloys” that were recovered during work on the AATIP contract. Though the&lt;em&gt; Times&lt;/em&gt; never attributed the alloys’ origins to aliens, &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-truth-about-those-alien-alloys-in-the-new-york-times-ufo-story/"&gt;the claim also received criticism&lt;/a&gt;. Nothing on these alloys has been revealed since. Bigelow hasn’t talked publicly about them since his interview with the&lt;em&gt; Times, &lt;/em&gt;and a Freedom of Information Act request filed to the DIA in early 2018 remains open with no records turned over (yet).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Jt9sQX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Detect, analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IwTIZf"&gt;While AATIP is now defunct, it has a successor. In June 2020, the Senate Intelligence Committee &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/jgx573/senate-intelligence-committee-confirms-the-us-navy-has-a-ufo-task-force"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; the existence of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force, situated within the Office of Naval Intelligence. The Pentagon &lt;a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2314065/establishment-of-unidentified-aerial-phenomena-task-force/"&gt;confirmed and announced&lt;/a&gt; the task force a few months later, describing in a statement the body’s mission “to detect, analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security.” Last December, the intelligence committee gave the Pentagon six months to produce a report detailing the task force’s findings on UAPs. That’s the one released on June 25th. A more detailed, classified version of the report was delivered to Congress on June 2nd, per a person familiar with it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="xVWbdV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does the report include? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="IMbhJT"&gt;It has always been very unlikely that the Pentagon report would tell us what the objects are, and it still doesn’t sound like US intelligence officials know much about them. It’s as much a mystery as it is a national security concern, it indicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q8ytnX"&gt;The report was only able to confidently confirm the identity of a single UAP out of 144 reports. “In that case,” the report says, “we identified the object as a large, deflating balloon. The others remain unexplained.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vvPLc3"&gt;The task force focused on reports from military aviators made between 2004 and 2021, the majority coming out within the past two years, after a new reporting system was put in place. 18 incidents seemed to feature unusual flight patterns. 11 reports from aviators documented “near misses” with a UAP. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ks0uIH"&gt;From the report: “Some UAP appeared to remain stationary in winds aloft, move against the wind, maneuver abruptly, or move at considerable speed, without discernable means of propulsion. In a small number of cases, military aircraft systems processed radio frequency (RF) energy associated with UAP sightings.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nd3ZEX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there any videos of the UFOs?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Z3Zjhw"&gt;Yep, there are four videos — three were declassified and released via the Freedom of Information Act by the Navy in 2020 after being leaked in 2007 and 2017, and one was leaked and later authenticated by the Defense Department in 2019. The videos show four separate incidents. Reid, the former senator and UAP hawk, said disclosure of the three videos “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SenatorReid/status/1254836730546384897?s=20"&gt;only scratches the surface&lt;/a&gt; of research and materials available” to the Pentagon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2UnIVS"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Pentagon UFO videos: FLIR, GIMBAL, and GOFAST|102729" data-volume-uuid="4089203ee" data-volume-id="102729" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-596" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="k6E6AJ"&gt;The three declassified black-and-white videos, titled FLIR, GOFAST, and GIMBAL, are the most tantalizing. Captured by instrument cameras aboard Navy fighter aircraft in 2004, 2014, and 2015, they appear to show tiny, pill-shaped objects whizzing through the air. One of them appears to rotate midflight. Two videos show the objects speeding over ocean waters, coming with commentary from the pilots: “Look at that thing, dude!” one pilot yells. “It’s rotating,” says another. “There’s a whole fleet of them... They’re all going against the wind.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NMCv05"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What could the UFOs be?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="BIhWE9"&gt;We don’t know yet, and there’s probably not a single explanation for all of them. The report lists five possibilities for what the UAPs could be: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="c1OHHH"&gt;Something extremely benign like UAVs, flocks of birds or other “airborne clutter,” like plastic bags, the UAP report said. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tZgSbc"&gt;Top-secret US technology that the Navy and other agencies don’t know about.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ifQ5qn"&gt;Foreign technology from US adversaries like Russia or China&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="qI5Uha"&gt;Some kind of natural phenomena — atmospheric conditions that get picked up on instruments or cause weird illusions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="KkOja2"&gt;Other — the catch-all term for ‘yeah, we have no idea.’&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="EgET50"&gt;Intelligence officials ruled out the possibility that the UAPs were glimpses of secret US technology in action, according to the &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;report. The unclassified report published Friday said officials were “unable to confirm” that any reported UAPs originated from secret government programs. And it’s worth noting that the UAPs can be any number of those five theories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="0OmoQP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But what about aliens? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OoxoTn"&gt;Aliens would fall pretty firmly into the ‘other’ category, and while the theory has captured the popular imagination, this is the most controversial idea out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="22g8zA"&gt;Mick West, a pseudoscience debunker, told CNN that characteristics of the Naval aircraft videos make the objects appear more interesting than they should be. “It never really does anything interesting, and it might simply be a distant plane,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MickWest/status/1396136405349269511"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r119JWI04Ls&amp;amp;ab_channel=MickWest"&gt;In a YouTube video&lt;/a&gt;, West rebutted the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt;’ use of the term “Glowing Auras” in the headline of its 2017 story to describe UAPs recorded on thermal video cameras, which sometimes makes objects look like they’re glowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="k3ya1I"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“All options have to be on the table.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aBsgwe"&gt;Elizondo, the very vocal former AATIP director, would beg to differ with West’s assessment. He hasn’t claimed UAPs represent alien technology, but his colorful descriptions to the press continue to hype up that prospect: “We’re dealing with a technology that could be 50-1,000 years ahead of us,” he &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/washington-post-live/2021/06/08/ufos-national-security-with-luis-elizondo-former-director-advanced-aerospace-threat-identification-program-aatip/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;The Washington Post &lt;/em&gt;in a live interview&lt;/a&gt; last week. “At the end of the day, we don’t know what we’re dealing with. All options have to be on the table.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mh98GO"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is the US struggling to understand these sightings?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="NAL3rh"&gt;The report starts with a caveat: a lack of quality information “hampers our ability to draw firm conclusions about the nature or intent of UAP.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OEjhuJ"&gt;Stigmas around UFOs have had a chilling effect on legitimate discussions about unidentified phenomena in the US military, the report indicated, citing “sociocultural stigmas” and rifts between analysts and aviators. “Narratives from aviators in the operational community and analysts from the military and IC [intelligence community] describe disparagement associated with observing UAP, reporting it, or attempting to discuss it with colleagues,” the report said. Reporting unidentifiable phenomena is a “reputational risk”  that “may keep many observers silent, complicating scientific pursuit of the topic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BbafXK"&gt;The report also noted that cameras aboard military aircraft are specialized for tactical operations and aren’t suited for capturing the unidentifiable phenomena, hampering analysts’ ability to study sightings after-the-fact. Having multiple sensors and cameras have their perks, especially when working together during a run-in with something unknown — radio-frequency sensors are good at capturing the velocity of an object, while cameras can reveal an object’s size, the report said. But absent those capabilities, analysis of UAP is difficult. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="1wEdCA"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is Blink-182 involved?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="8VPUnK"&gt;Not exactly. But Blink-182’s former lead singer, Tom DeLonge, is. DeLonge is obsessed with UFOs. Don’t even get him started on UFOs, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heUCtu_fq18&amp;amp;ab_channel=MrSnrub"&gt;he warns in this undated interview on UFOs&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iOy9Ab"&gt;DeLonge is so obsessed with unidentified phenomena that he left his punk-rock band bank in 2015 to start an organization in 2017 called To the Stars Academy of Arts &amp;amp; Sciences (TTSA), a research and media company based in Las Vegas — yes, the same city as Bigelow’s space company. TTSA is relevant because it’s where Elizondo and Chris Mellon, former Democratic staff director of the Senate Intelligence Committee and former deputy assistant secretary of defense for intelligence, wound up after leaving their government posts. The company pushed for and promoted the release of the three Navy videos and actually worked with Bigelow and various government agencies to investigate UAP. The organization signed an agreement with the US Army in 2019 to study “exotic metals” recovered under the program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Fl6Rrz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“TTSA has decided to restructure its operations”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NxiESw"&gt;But TTSA ran into problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, and Elizondo and Mellon left the company earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1710274/000149315221004131/form1-u.htm"&gt;according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing&lt;/a&gt; from February. “TTSA has decided to restructure its operations to scale back its initiatives in science and tech commercialization and to place a greater emphasis on the operations of its entertainment business,” the filing said. It’s unclear what came of the Army agreement after TTSA’s shift away from UAP research.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4zhXHT"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But come on... it’s aliens, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mP2VPR"&gt;Probably not. The slow drip of news from the Pentagon on UAPs has allowed a ton of &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/pentagon-s-ufo-footage-obama-s-curiosity-ratchet-expectations-big-ncna1268222"&gt;alien hype&lt;/a&gt; to fester. Does that mean aliens don’t exist anywhere in the universe? No. There are multiple ongoing projects to look for alien life, or signs of past alien life, well beyond UFOs. To name a few: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;NASA’s Perseverance rover&lt;/a&gt; on Mars, a &lt;a href="https://pweb.cfa.harvard.edu/news/cfa-scientists-collaborate-new-study-search-universe-signs-technological-civilizations"&gt;joint academic hunt for technosignatures&lt;/a&gt; coming from distant corners of the universe, or any of the hundreds of research programs &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22545453/alien-planets-view-earth-astronomers-journal-nature"&gt;examining exoplanets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dQEeLN"&gt;While an outcome involving aliens might be fun, it’s still hasn’t happened in today’s UAP saga.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="EIajH7"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 6:11 PM 6/25: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story has been updated with details from the unclassified UAP report.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
