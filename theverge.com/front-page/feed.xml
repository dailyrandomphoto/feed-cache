    <title>The Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro will arrive with a day-one update</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KAHsOx"&gt;Assuming you managed to order a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Pixel 6 or Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, then you should know that once the phone is in your possession, you’ll need a little extra time to get everything set up and working. That’s because, &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/132599975/update-your-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro-to-the-latest-software-to-get-all-the-features"&gt;as a post on the Google support forums points out&lt;/a&gt; (via &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/26/pixel-6-day-one-update/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), there is a software update to install. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rqmypE"&gt;The post indicates you’ll need it to get all of the features, although it’s unclear what would be missing if you simply started using the phone without it other than the November security update. According to Google, the build number is the same for both phones, and it should display SD1A.210817.036 or SD1A.210817.036.A8 for Verizon customers. If your phone arrives early, then the update might not available at first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oBbf5b"&gt;According to our team, all the review units are running the same build present after the device installs its day-one update, so any impressions you see here or elsewhere are using the same software. For a device that must be connected to a network, this approach isn’t surprising — it allows production to ramp up even as the launch software is finalized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ikbi0b"&gt;The day-one update installs after you complete your device setup, and Google says it can take about 25 - 50 minutes to download and install in the background. The Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are scheduled to start shipping on October 28th, so first-hand experiences with the update (and our reviews of both phones) aren’t far away.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Theranos FOMO kept the DeVos family from doing its investment homework</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Theranos Founder Elizabeth Holmes Attends Criminal Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pg_h7SRn4TWLtv5gHu6SpNMuuw8=/1x0:4000x2666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70050146/1235841569.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The family office took Elizabeth Holmes at her word&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="0rZcRt"&gt;Theranos said a lot of things to Lisa Peterson that made the company seem credible when she evaluated it on behalf of the crazy-wealthy DeVos family. One of the things that stood out as a reason to trust Theranos and Elizabeth Holmes? Its devices didn’t need FDA approval. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfHrWj"&gt;That made it seem more credible that the machines worked, said Peterson, who works on investments for the DeVos clan (including former secretary of education Betsy DeVos), and who testified today during &lt;em&gt;US v. Elizabeth Holmes.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="F9pVVG"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The DeVos’ approach to Theranos seemed to be more about shiny things and FOMO&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X19IrU"&gt;Okay, some background: it’s true that Theranos didn’t need FDA approval to start using its tests and devices. That’s because they were considered “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/17/9750048/ldt-loophole-fda-hearing-theranos-lab-tests"&gt;lab-developed tests&lt;/a&gt;” — a category of tests developed and used within a single lab, which means they don’t have to go through the typical FDA process. Just because something is a lab-developed test isn’t necessarily a reason &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;to trust that it works as well as advertised. But it’s definitely not a reason to have &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; trust that a test is reliable. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vDIHQP"&gt;Treating the lack of FDA approval as a reason to bet on Theranos was a small aside in Peterson’s testimony; it was just one reason she thought Theranos seemed like a good investment. (A skepticism of the regulatory process is also one of the reasons &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22689083/elizabeth-holmes-trial-james-mattis-testimony-theranos-fraud"&gt;Theranos board member General James Mattis&lt;/a&gt; wasn’t concerned with some of the company’s actions — something the powerful conservatives seem to have in common). But it set the tone for a day of testimony about the DeVos family’s approach to its $100 million investment in Theranos — which seemed to be more about shiny things and FOMO than about the science behind the blood testing devices Holmes promised would change the world. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FUS4jv"&gt;Peterson volunteered to take the lead on assessing Theranos after hearing about the company (and Holmes) from Jerry Tubergen, the CEO of the DeVos’ family office, which is called the RDV Corporation. The company sent her two large binders with information on the blood testing tech, and she sat on a call with Holmes in early October. Then she took a trip with members of the family out to Palo Alto, where they spent five hours at Theranos headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4TVpbs"&gt;There was a lot to bolster the case for Theranos. Peterson said the documents and conversations with Holmes gave the impression that the company could perform hundreds of tests using just a finger stick of blood. A document with the Pfizer logo seemed to show that the Theranos tech was used and validated by major pharmaceutical companies. The company had major contracts with Walgreens. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="qHW7VZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The documents looked science-y and apparently that was good enough&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="J4Ocx5"&gt;Nothing about any of those materials raised red flags with Peterson. But Peterson didn’t look that closely. The relatively poor due diligence was a theme that Lance Wade, Holmes’ attorney, hammered during cross-examination. Wade showed her charts from the Pfizer-branded report, asking if she understood the types of scientific tests the document showed. She said she didn’t. He asked if she scrutinized Theranos’ list of patent filings. She hadn’t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DQLFVL"&gt;“I’m not a scientist,” Peterson said. “I can’t figure out if those things were lending credibility to what they’re saying.” The documents looked science-y, and apparently, that was good enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aOxl2"&gt;The DeVos family didn’t hire any scientists to review the materials, either, Wade pointed out. They didn’t bring in regulatory experts or lawyers. They didn’t go visit one of the Walgreens stores in Arizona that were supposedly using Theranos devices. Peterson didn’t even call Walgreens, even though she said she knew the chief information officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uP4BWS"&gt;Peterson said that was partly because she was afraid of upsetting Holmes. Holmes was vetting investors at the same time as investors were vetting her, and the family didn’t want to miss out on the opportunity to throw their money into the pot. “We felt if we circumvented the process we would be uninvited to participate,” Peterson said. “We were very careful not to circumvent things and upset Elizabeth.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="HRebzS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“They were telling us that it worked.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NM1cz8"&gt;Wade dug in harder. Holmes wouldn’t have necessarily found out if they had made calls to Walgreens or asked a scientist about the data from Theranos, he said. So why didn’t Peterson do more than the bare minimum? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSQvtW"&gt;Her answer was that she didn’t think she needed to. “They were telling us that it worked,” Peterson said. “We were relying on what we were told.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oIqfTB"&gt;Peterson — and the DeVos family office — didn’t come off here looking like the most thoughtful stewards of billions of dollars. During the site visit, they were more interested in top-level takeaways than the actual details of how the Theranos tests worked. Holmes’ and Theranos’ assurances that everything worked great were enough for Peterson and the DeVos family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hgzOtE"&gt;But treating that credulousness as a problem also seems like a risky strategy for the defense team. After all, their argument is that Holmes didn’t mislead investors. If she &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; misleading investors, why would the DeVos family need to do extensive independent evaluation? In the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22663723/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-trial-opening-arguments-day-one"&gt;defense’s opening statement&lt;/a&gt;, Wade made a case that the people who invested in Theranos were sophisticated and knew what they were getting into. Peterson’s testimony seems to suggest otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="go50nu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Whatever it was Theranos was selling — outright lies, or smoke and mirrors — the DeVos family fell for it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wklkGG"&gt;The defense posited that Peterson and the DeVos family just misunderstood Theranos’ capabilities as described by Holmes. Wade showed a slide in the Theranos documents that didn’t specify that all its tests were done using finger sticks. He pointed to articles where Theranos didn’t &lt;em&gt;directly &lt;/em&gt;claim its testing devices were used in military helicopters, just that it might happen in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gRdMLj"&gt;But whatever it was Theranos was selling — outright lies, or smoke and mirrors — the DeVos family fell for it. And they were left scrambling when John Carreyrou published his first articles in the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;questioning the Theranos technology. In August 2016, Peterson even took a trip to the annual meeting of the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, where Holmes was &lt;a href="https://www.aacc.org/meetings-and-events/resources-from-past-meetings/theranos-presentation"&gt;presenting&lt;/a&gt; on the Theranos tech. Belatedly, she had started asking some questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MtLOdk"&gt;“The whole point was to figure out if the technology worked or not,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Stadia tries something new: a free 30-minute game trial</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_Cl1mUMKhDjym7ai2Zy9mpGJ_j0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70050003/akrales_191113_3779_0163.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5WW5LY"&gt;Google’s Stadia cloud gaming service is still coming up with new ways to attract gamers, and it’s finally trying one that we’ve suggested for years: free time-limited trials of entire games, so you can see whether it’s for you. &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/26/stadia-free-trial-games/"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;, you can now hop on over to Stadia, sign in with your Google account, and be playing a 30-minute free trial of &lt;em&gt;Hello Engineer&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://stadia.google.com/u/1/store/details/e85d550899de407e996a8a2d9dfbc7efrcp1/sku/4db0c5af19c74032beb90d083dfb9431p?"&gt;just by following this link&lt;/a&gt; and scrolling down to the “Free trial” button you see below.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TjUfE3GL2MXP9g9tQPcMs3yhi5I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22958321/stadia_free_trial_30_minutes.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xGSkxx"&gt;Google also has &lt;a href="https://stadia.google.com/u/1/store/list/47"&gt;this dedicated webpage&lt;/a&gt; for other free trials that it might offer in the future, though it only appears to include &lt;em&gt;Hello Engineer &lt;/em&gt;for now. Google previously tried some &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/20/21525074/google-stadia-free-game-demos-cloud-gaming"&gt;limited demos&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXhMvA"&gt;Honestly, it’s still not as seamless as it could be. You still do have to sign in with that Google account (even if you’re &lt;em&gt;already&lt;/em&gt; signed into your Google account for Gmail, Drive, etc), you still have to click through a health and safety screen, and another screen to verify access, and then wait a tad for the game to load. We’re still not at the magical “click an ad for a game to instantly be playing that game” quite yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzFzE8"&gt;But it’s a step in the right direction, particularly if this becomes a standard feature of Stadia titles. And why not? From a game developer or publisher’s standpoint, there’s no work needed to create a demo, and the fact that it’s a cloud game should alleviate any privacy concerns. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/5/20993828/sony-playstation-now-cloud-gaming-gaikai-onlive-google-stadia-25th-anniversary"&gt;When Gaikai arrived on the cloud gaming scene over a decade ago&lt;/a&gt;, it demonstrated the your-game-ad-can-be-a-game concept right from the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MW1HV1"&gt;If you enjoy &lt;em&gt;Hello Engineer&lt;/em&gt;, you can buy it for $19.99 on Stadia, or sign up for a Stadia Pro subscription that includes it for free. Other completely free options on Stadia include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/17/21571699/google-stadia-destiny-2-free-to-play-game-chromebook-phone"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Destiny 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21757835/google-stadia-super-bomberman-r-online-free"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Bomberman R Online&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, so there’s no point in wondering whether cloud gaming technology actually works for you: you can just try it right now with three different games, no strings attached, to find out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNDKYl"&gt;Just don’t necessarily expect Google to put its full weight behind Stadia anymore. I wrote &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738550/arkham-knight-google-stadia-att"&gt;how Google seemed more interested in its whitelabel potential&lt;/a&gt; in February, and last week we learned &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738550/arkham-knight-google-stadia-att"&gt;how AT&amp;amp;T has taken Google up on the offer&lt;/a&gt; with its own free trial of &lt;em&gt;Batman: Arkham Knight.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eRJvET"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp’s iPhone-to-Android chat transfer is now available on Pixels and new phones</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0eokNaSp9B-H9bsj4lLIBmWdnKU=/193x0:1246x702/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70049386/Screen_Shot_2021_10_26_at_13.51.42.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hphf2u"&gt;Google &lt;a href="https://blog.google/products/android/whatsapp-chat-history/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that WhatsApp’s chat history migration feature to bring your messages from iPhones to Android is now available on “all Pixel phones” and that it’ll “become available on new smartphones that launch with Android 12.” The feature was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/11/22619664/whatsapp-android-ios-chat-history-transfer-cross-platform"&gt;already available for Samsung phones&lt;/a&gt; but will make the experience of switching from iOS to Android easier, as you won’t have to give up your messaging history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RwYNJK"&gt;The process should be relatively simple, as long as you’ve got WhatsApp up to date on both your iPhone and Android phone, and you’ve got a USB-C to Lightning cable handy. Google says that while setting up your Android phone, you’ll be prompted to scan a QR code with your iPhone, which will let you start the transfer process.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VsnZRcl9RuhTCPdNKO3gbNGB6OQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957797/WhatsAppBlogAsset_LightTheme.max_1000x1000.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A wired connection and QR code scan are all that’s required to start the process.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XZ4fwZ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655753/migrate-iphone-whatsapp-data-chat-history-samsung-phone"&gt;Check out our how-to&lt;/a&gt; for more detailed instructions (they’re written for Samsung, but the process should be similar) and to read into the few caveats with the transfer. Google says that your iPhone won’t receive any WhatsApp messages while your messages are moving, so you shouldn’t lose anything in the switch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdlIkh"&gt;Google says that phone OEMs can add support for the feature when updating their phones to Android 12, so it’s possible those with existing phones will gain access to it at some point. The company says that it’s working with phone makers to ensure that phones that ship with Android 12 support the transfers out of the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aN3V75"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Updated October 26th, 8:34PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added information from Google about support for the feature on existing phones.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Niantic’s Pikmin Bloom is rolling out globally starting today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AQ9A-Y9OwlL9N6mUrzrPVwT0gp4=/0x171:1024x854/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70049845/PikminBloom_AppIcon_iOS.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="a5je6p"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt;, the next game from &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; creator Niantic, is starting its global rollout today. The developer says that the app — which is billed as a joint project with Nintendo — “will be available on the App Store and Google Play over the coming days.” The rollout will start with Australia and Singapore before gradually hitting the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bgNCxE"&gt;The new &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345472/niantic-nintendo-pikmin-partnership-collaboration-ar-mobile-game"&gt;first announced in March&lt;/a&gt; as part of a new collaboration between Niantic and Nintendo. Like &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, the game is designed to get people outdoors and walking. In &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom,&lt;/em&gt; players can collect the titular plant creatures by gathering and planting seeds; in order for them to grow, you have to walk a certain distance, sort of like hatching an egg in &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;. Players can feed their pikmin to make them bloom and then collect the petals, which let you create a trailer of flowers as you walk for other players to see. (Among other Nintendo-like touches, your in-game avatar is a Mii.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qVCbW8"&gt;One of the more interesting features in &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; is a sort of daily journal. The game saves information about how much you’ve walked, the pikmin you’ve collected, and places you’ve visited and then shows you a little video at the end of the day. You can even add notes and photos to make it more personal. There’s also, of course, an AR mode so that you can see the cute little guys crawling around the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gqJePB"&gt;While Pokémon Go was and remains a big hit, Niantic has struggled to replicate that success with other properties. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/25/18716146/harry-potter-wizards-unite-pokemon-go-review-ar-augmented-reality-game-foundable"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Harry Potter: Wizards Unite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; never really took off, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/17/22680166/niantic-catan-world-explorers-shutdown-early-access"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catan: World Explorers&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; only lasted around a year. (It’s not just Niantic that’s struggling to replicate that success, either; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/5/22215253/minecraft-earth-closing-down-june-2021-microsoft"&gt;Microsoft also shut down its real-world &lt;em&gt;Minecraft&lt;/em&gt; game earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;.) The studio is also making &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22529378/transformers-heavy-metal-niantic-pokemon-go-location-game-ar"&gt;an AR take on Transformers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FKNdlS"&gt;All of this is to say that &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; will be a big test for the ongoing viability of real-world AR games beyond just &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; — and players around the world should be able to check it out in the coming days.

    <title>Pikmin Bloom hands-on: a cute app that tries to make walking a little more magical</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9SPesFWSpuqNOO8lYLcVCD_R92k=/0x0:4500x3000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70049857/Key_art_with_English_logo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xr19bh"&gt;There’s something strangely satisfying about leaving a trail of colorful flowers in your wake as you explore a neighborhood. It’s also one of the main hooks of &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt;, the next release from the creator of &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, and another app designed to get you moving in the real world. I’ve been able to play the game for the past few days, and while it’s less of a game than &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, it definitely adds some magic and fun to a daily walk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oEIWDj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22510468"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; is starting its gradual rollout today&lt;/a&gt;, and it’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345472/niantic-nintendo-pikmin-partnership-collaboration-ar-mobile-game"&gt;part of a new partnership between Nintendo and Niantic&lt;/a&gt;. The game is billed as a collaboration between Nintendo and Niantic’s Tokyo studio, and Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto even appears in the launch trailer. &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; isn’t necessarily the most obvious choice to kick off the partnership, as it’s one of Nintendo’s more obscure franchises. But in a meeting with reporters, Niantic CEO John Hanke said that it’s also a fictional world that fit well with the type of game the studio wanted to make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="we17In"&gt;“We experimented with a variety of different gameplay types and different characters with Nintendo,” he explains. “And after a lot of experimentation and discussion, we settled on &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; as the perfect vehicle to express what Nintendo does well and what Niantic does well in a single game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jyli99"&gt;For the uninitiated, pikmin are sentient plant creatures that work well in groups and have unique abilities depending on their color. In the main games, players control large groups of them to solve puzzles. It’s sort of a mix between a puzzle game and real-time strategy. In &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; — at least early on — the goal is primarily to collect and grow new creatures. You do this, of course, by walking. You can gather new seeds to plant in your backpack (for some reason), and each requires a certain number of steps to grow into a full-on pikmin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="8M6hLz"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10828821"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SFZGt1"&gt;You can also feed your pikmin nectar, which causes them to bloom, netting you petals, which can then be used to plant flowers on your walks. This has two benefits. From a gameplay perspective, your little pikmin seedlings will grow faster while you’re also leaving a flower trail. But they also just make things look pretty. Just like in &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;, the main in-game view is a cartoon-ish map of the world around you. It’s mostly empty aside from some pikmin sprouts you can collect at specific locations. But you’re able to spruce things up with those trails of flowers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="XbLT0l"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The perfect vehicle to express what Nintendo does well and what Niantic does well in a single game.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QyESp7"&gt;From what I’ve played, &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; is much less of a traditional game than &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt;. (This is especially true if you look at the current version of &lt;em&gt;Go&lt;/em&gt;, which has changed a lot since its debut in 2016.) It’s a more passive experience. So far, I’ve mostly left it on in the background as I’ve gone about my day, checking in periodically to see if any pikmin have bloomed or to turn on the flower trail when I go outside. To go along with this, &lt;em&gt;Bloom&lt;/em&gt; has an interesting journal-like feature that sums up your activities for each day. At the end of the day, you’ll get to see what you did and how much you walked in a little video, and you can access that info from a calendar. There’s even the option to add photos or notes to personalize things further, so you can go back and see what you really did on a particular day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7JX4Kq"&gt;So while there are some obvious similarities between &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; — that includes an AR feature so you can see the cute plant creatures walking around in the real world — philosophically, they seem to be going in slightly different directions. Whereas &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Go&lt;/em&gt; was an attempt to turn a beloved fictional world into an IRL experience, &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt; instead uses a cute Nintendo franchise as a way to gamify walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vbytXK"&gt;That said, I’m still very early in the game, and there’s also a very good chance it will be regularly updated with new features in the coming weeks and months. In fact, it sounds like more game-like elements are already in the works. During a call with reporters, Madoka Katayama — UX director at Niantic’s Tokyo studio — mentioned more perilous elements that could potentially put your pikmin in danger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pZD5RC"&gt;“Most of the time, it’s pretty safe, but there will be certain gameplay where some of them may not return,” she says. “But it’s something that rarely happens in the game, and it happens a little bit further into the gameplay.” Which raises a very important question: &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/22407549/pikmin-gamecube-nintendo-switch-miyamoto"&gt;death has always been a part of the &lt;em&gt;Pikmin&lt;/em&gt; experience&lt;/a&gt; — so will it be present in &lt;em&gt;Pikmin Bloom&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9UtoXR"&gt;“We don’t use the term death,” Katayama says. “They never actually die conceptually.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T 5G Plus expansion plan highlights how much its mid-band coverage trails T-Mobile</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JFEkF5TRi-tYKnit7lVEJt_rsSo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70048196/acastro_180322_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VXRhNn"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s new 5G Plus expansion gives T-Mobile the perfect “I told you so” moment. AT&amp;amp;T currently offers two “flavors” of 5G: 5G Plus over the high-band mmWave spectrum and regular 5G, which is comparable to 4G LTE. Now, &lt;a href="https://about.att.com/innovationblog/2021/c-band-5G.html"&gt;a blog post&lt;/a&gt; details AT&amp;amp;T’s plan to roll the mid-band spectrum it owns into 5G Plus, conflating its fastest but hard-to-find 5G with a new variant that has a better chance of both range and speed — the kind of 5G that T-Mobile has been focused on from the beginning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZeC7jf"&gt;Former &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/26/8930691/tmobile-ceo-trashes-verizon-att-5g-plans"&gt;T-Mobile CEO John Legere slammed AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; for not having a mid-band spectrum in 2019, stating that 5G needs a low-band, mid-band, and high-band spectrum to work efficiently. This is because that high-band mmWave 5G offers the fastest speeds over shorter distances, making it best for highly concentrated areas. Conversely, low-band 5G provides the bare minimum for speed over wider areas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DPfrcQ"&gt;Offering 5G service with no in-between isn’t ideal — a mid-band range serves as the median between both spectrums. Until this year, T-Mobile was the only major carrier with access to the entire range of spectrums. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299903/fcc-cband-auction-results-verizon-att-tmobile"&gt;Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T invested nearly $70 billion&lt;/a&gt; combined to gain access to the C-band spectrum in February, making both companies two years behind T-Mobile. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="SSTPo9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Dear wireless carriers: the 5G hype needs to stop","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409675/verizon-att-tmobile-5g-mmwave-c-band"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="cs5mIe"&gt;Testing performed earlier this year by &lt;a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/fastest-mobile-networks-2021"&gt;&lt;em&gt;PC Mag&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; shows the difference so far in the carrier’s approaches. In one year, T-Mobile saw its average download speed, as tested, skyrocket past the average speeds from Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T, even though Verizon’s maximum speed was much higher. According to &lt;em&gt;PC Mag&lt;/em&gt;, testers could consistently reach speeds between 150Mbps and 500Mbps on T-Mobile’s network using the mid-band spectrum, providing a sharp difference from the capabilities of 4G wireless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r6zg4o"&gt;As AT&amp;amp;T’s blog post explains, the carrier estimates that by the end of 2022 its US rollout will cover 70 to 75 million people, and by the end of 2023, it will cover over 200 million. T-Mobile managed to reach some 125 million people with its C-band spectrum last June, says it will reach 200 million people by the end of this year, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fnews%2Fnetwork%2Fneville-ray-future-of-5g&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F26%2F22746708%2Fatt-5g-plus-expansion-tmobile" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;claims that it can cover 300 million by the end of 2023&lt;/a&gt;. How will the speeds match up once coverage is available more evenly? It could take a long time before we find out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yYvCx6"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T’s post also clearly explains its plan to lump together mmWave and C-band under 5G Plus, and it doesn’t appear that it’s giving you a way to distinguish between the two bands. T-Mobile operates similarly, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675255/tmobile-5g-uc-icon-iphone"&gt;it displays a “5G UC” icon&lt;/a&gt; when you’re connected to either its mid-band or high-band spectrums, while Verizon collectively calls the connections 5G UW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C6BWd7"&gt;All this relabeling by mobile carriers isn’t making the transition to 5G any less confusing. With each service introducing its own nicknames for their fastest 5G speeds and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/20/21265048/att-5g-e-misleading-advertising-recommendation-narb"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T mislabeling its old 4G service as “5Ge,”&lt;/a&gt;  the 5G mess becomes less and less appealing by the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dg94zu"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 7:25 PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Updated headline and text clarifying that AT&amp;amp;T is continuing its existing 5G strategy as planned with the C-band rollout starting in December, and how that compares with T-Mobile’s existing coverage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Cowboy Bebop’s first proper trailer has slick noir action and an adorable corgi</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LdyDJnHF5xJjaL7zJqQE2PxVBsE=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70049713/COWBOYBEB_Unit_08114RC4.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;GEOFFREY SHORT/NETFLIX&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pD3tkP"&gt;The official trailer for Netflix’s live-action &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; series is finally here. Released during a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EfotYPJ7pZw"&gt;live countdown event&lt;/a&gt; featuring appearances from stars John Cho, Daniella Pineda, and Mustafa Shakir, the trailer is another peek into what we can expect from the highly anticipated adaptation of the legendary anime series.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dcFZqv"&gt;The trailer starts with John Cho as Spike Spiegel standing on the deck of the eponymous Bebop as we hear him talking to his old friend Anna about what he’s up to these days. We’re treated to scenes of Spike’s old life as a mobster, his new partner Jet, and a moody shot of a reflection in a puddle that should send &lt;em&gt;Bebop&lt;/em&gt; fans into a frenzy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="agCvOF"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; trailer features the same highly-stylized action Netflix showed off in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22733237/netflix-cowboy-bebop-teaser-live-action-john-cho-spike"&gt;teaser video last week&lt;/a&gt; with more scenes that seem to be almost perfect recreations from the anime. We got a glimpse of Pierrot Le Fou, Spike’s infamous clown enemy, very short glimpses of Spike’s other mortal enemy Vicious, and several funny moments between Spike, Jet, and Faye (with Ein’s first official appearance!) that do a good job of highlighting their contentious relationship. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5jHN9aTf-VHr7zHeFPCnMaxwIWc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22958192/Screen_Shot_2021_10_26_at_7.22.32_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rtrtXi"&gt;More than anything, I’m glad we got to hear more songs than just “Tank!”. One of the biggest and most delightful surprises to come out of the live-action &lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; announcement, was that the anime’s original composer, Yoko Kanno, would be back to provide &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22463620/netflix-live-action-cowboy-bebop-release-date-john-cho"&gt;new music for the show&lt;/a&gt;. The trailer started with a muted horn song that sounded like it could have been a new arrangement of “&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/cLiPISVAwek"&gt;Cosmos&lt;/a&gt;” giving us a sneak listen of what the lauded anime composer might have been working on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwt3Ek"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cowboy Bebop&lt;/em&gt; comes to Netflix on November 19th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="24iFnT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ERWbGu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix scrambled internally to suppress a controversial movie from search results</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kqIXw-1WVGQLVDCKKh_jZEVyjqw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70049638/acastro_211025_1777_netflix_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The streaming giant kept &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; from appearing in some search results and recommendations after backlash to the poster&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="4VORrQ"&gt;In September 2020, Netflix was in turmoil as the company battled its most significant PR scandal to date. Earlier that year, the streaming platform had acquired the worldwide rights to the French film &lt;em&gt;Cuties &lt;/em&gt;after its lauded premiere at the Sundance Film Festival. Director Maïmouna Doucouré had made the movie as a &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/cuties-director-maimouna-doucoure-why-i-made-the-film/2020/09/15/7e0ee406-f78b-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html"&gt;commentary on social media and the hypersexualization of young girls&lt;/a&gt;. But the poster Netflix released to promote it didn’t have that same self-awareness. Instead, it displayed the actors, some of whom were only 12 years old, in booty shorts and crop tops, striking provocative dance poses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTYqC4"&gt;The fallout was immediate. #CancelNetflix started trending on Twitter. QAnon conspiracy theorists claimed the company was distributing child porn and started tweeting about it with the hashtag #SaveTheChildren. A Change.org petition calling for the film to be removed &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2020/10/netflix-cuties-twerking-poster-drama-explained.html"&gt;had more than 40,000 signatures&lt;/a&gt;. Texas House of Representatives member Matt Schaefer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RepMattSchaefer/status/1304162860998823939"&gt;asked attorney general Ken Paxton&lt;/a&gt; to investigate the film “for possible violations of child exploitation and child pornography laws.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Irf9Mi"&gt;Netflix apologized for the poster but stood by the film. After all, the frenzied response was to the marketing, not to the movie itself. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos called the director, Maïmouna Doucouré, to personally own up to the mistake, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/09/cuties-director-death-threats-netflix-poster-backlash-ted-sarandos-called-apologize-1234569783/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kZPrU7"&gt;Behind the scenes, however, Netflix scrambled to minimize public backlash by suppressing the film in search results prior to its release. It removed &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; from the “coming soon” and “popular searches” categories and excluded it from queries for “cute.” It then adjusted its algorithm so searches for the film would not surface “steamy / sexual titles” or kids’ movies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8ZxRFX"&gt;The incident hints at how Netflix can manipulate its algorithm to navigate a PR crisis, walking a fine line between allowing for creative expression while tightly controlling a movie’s reach. Internal documents reviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; detail how Netflix dealt with this PR crisis by, in the company’s own words, “suppress[ing] promotion and related search queries.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vOqcCp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We see ourselves as just a conduit for content”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="T6R17I"&gt;In response to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Netflix spokesperson said: “Our recommendations help members find great titles to watch amidst all the choices on Netflix. Not every title gets promoted in the same way, just as every member’s homepage is different.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gh5pPH"&gt;Inside Netflix, the fallout from &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; has been compared to Facebook’s Cambridge Analytica scandal — a moment of reckoning where the company realized it was going to be held responsible for anything that happened on its platform. “This incident demonstrated that we see ourselves as just a conduit for content,” read one analysis, called a “post mortem,” on the incident. “In contrast, our members see us as the source, as the author/presenter. As a result, we may unconsciously absolve ourselves of the need to view our content through this lens.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1zqBRV"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; controversy also highlights why some employees have been disappointed by the executive response to Dave Chappelle’s comedy special &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt;, which released earlier this year and has been widely criticized as transphobic. While the &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; backlash was partly driven by QAnon conspiracy theorists who likely hadn’t seen the film, &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt;’s&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;criticism came from employees, trans activists, and prominent civil rights organizations, and Netflix did not appear to respond with the same level of urgency. Some at the company felt bad faith attacks were taken more seriously than criticism from Netflix’s own workers. This past month, Sarandos doubled down on his support of Dave Chappelle and defended his decision to keep &lt;em&gt;The Closer &lt;/em&gt;on the platform. The company also did not suppress the special in search results, recommendations, or on platform promotional materials. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5XByz9"&gt;Until now, it was not publicly known the lengths at which Netflix went to suppress &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; prior to its release. But within the company, it has been a catalyst for change in how Netflix deals with potentially sensitive content — and a sign that these issues will only continue to get more complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Wi5sh9"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="WAirxj"&gt;The warning signs came as early as January 16th, 2020. Netflix’s editorial creative team, responsible for reviewing films prior to release, watched &lt;em&gt;Cuties &lt;/em&gt;and wrote a summary of the potential issues American audiences might have with it: “The dance scenes are provocative, sexual in nature and can be sometimes uncomfortable to watch, featuring slow-motion shots of 11-year-old girls sucking on their fingers and close-ups on their crotches and behinds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iGizyS"&gt;This review process is supposed to prepare Netflix for potential backlash and make sure the right people have seen a film so there aren’t any surprises. But Netflix determined that &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; did not meet the bar for additional oversight. In France, the film received an All Public rating, deemed appropriate for everyone. In the US, it got a TV-MA rating, meant to be seen only by mature audiences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EQ2oVQ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Netflix’s Spanish language translators couldn’t find a direct corollary to “twerking,” so they changed it to “sensual dance”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mvCbsJ"&gt;In March, a copywriter wrote the movie synopsis that appears on the Netflix platform when users click on the movie title: “Amy, 11, becomes fascinated with a twerking dance crew. Hoping to join them, she starts to explore her femininity, defying her family’s traditions.” Netflix’s Spanish language translators couldn’t find a direct corollary to “twerking,” so they changed it to “sensual dance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccfxTC"&gt;Netflix decided that the image that had originally been used for the film, showing young girls running up a hill with shopping bags, wasn’t going to do well on the platform. So the company created its own poster, as it often does for licensed films. This one was far more provocative. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yFsqUe"&gt;The synopsis, combined with the poster, made some employees uncomfortable. Yet, few were willing to speak up, according to people familiar with the situation. Some felt that because the creative aspects of the film weren’t in their direct control, it wasn’t their place. Plus, Doucouré had won the Directing Award at Sundance in 2020 for the film. &lt;em&gt;Cuties &lt;/em&gt;had prestige. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oa90Pk"&gt;This hesitancy goes against a core Netflix value: courage. “You say what you think, when it’s in the best interest of Netflix, even if it is uncomfortable,” &lt;a href="https://jobs.netflix.com/culture"&gt;reads a public culture document&lt;/a&gt;. But it wasn’t totally clear where employees should turn if they wanted to flag the film.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7H6DAB"&gt;Netflix has a number of resources for employees looking to find information about how to handle sensitive content. These include a Slack channel dedicated to sensitive assets and sensitive content guidelines for scenes that could be offensive in certain countries. At the time &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; came out, however, there wasn’t standardized guidance related to nuanced depictions of minors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s8HID2"&gt;The problems were exacerbated because the rollout was happening during the pandemic. Netflix employees were working remotely, making collaboration more difficult. By the summer, Netflix knew that Doucouré hadn’t yet seen the poster but decided to move forward anyway. This was typical for Netflix, where directors aren’t always made aware of how their films will be promoted. So, on August 18th, 2020, the film’s marketing materials went live, both on the Netflix platform and in the press. The movie was added to the “coming soon” category — a key traffic driver for upcoming titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dyHSdA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The film is pedophile grooming and also an attack on Muslims and traditional morality”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="qOwhWp"&gt;Almost immediately, the right-wing media latched on. “This is disgusting,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dailycaller/status/1296202990894940160"&gt;wrote the &lt;em&gt;Daily Caller&lt;/em&gt; on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;. “How is this in any way okay?” “The film is pedophile grooming and also an attack on Muslims and traditional morality,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cernovich/status/1296656497007448064?lang=en"&gt;tweeted right-wing commentator Mike Cernovich&lt;/a&gt;. Soon, prominent Muslim-American activists joined in, criticizing the film for stereotyping the lead character’s family. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CepuLb"&gt;Doucouré, who saw the poster at the same time as the American public, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2020/09/cuties-director-death-threats-netflix-poster-backlash-ted-sarandos-called-apologize-1234569783/"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; that she started getting harassed online&lt;/a&gt;. “I received numerous attacks on my character from people who had not seen the film, who thought I was actually making a film that was apologetic about hypersexualization of children,” she said. “I also received numerous death threats.” According to Netflix’s internal documents, her young cast, some of whom were as young as 12, started getting attacked as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3w0sIC"&gt;Netflix believed it had a bit of distance from &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt;. After all, it had acquired the rights to it after it was celebrated at Sundance — this wasn’t a Netflix original production. But the company quickly realized that the public didn’t see a strong distinction between films Netflix made and films it distributed. “Multiple people had concerns about the English title translation from the distributor, but they did not raise those concerns as strongly as they may have if this was a Netflix Original,” an internal Netflix analysis of the &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; incident says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fsFO8t"&gt;This had happened before. In June, Netflix had received criticism for a film called &lt;em&gt;365 Days&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.glamour.com/story/people-are-calling-for-netflix-to-remove-365-days-from-the-streaming-service"&gt;which some people felt romanticized sexual assault&lt;/a&gt;. As with &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt;, the Netflix poster — which showed a topless woman being caressed by her kidnapper — made the situation worse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GXZzjF"&gt;Now, Netflix admitted that its “guidelines and review mechanisms, which we previously believed would have prevented such an incident from occurring,” were insufficient.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TvJ3TL"&gt;By 3:30PM on August 19th, Netflix updated the &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; synopsis. “Amy, 11 years old, tries to escape family dysfunction by joining a free-spirited dance clique named &lt;em&gt;‘Cuties&lt;/em&gt;,’ as they build their self confidence through dance,” the new summary read. (Unfortunately, the Spanish translators changed “free-spirited” to “sensual,” which also then had to be updated.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HGd9GJ"&gt;By 6PM the same day, the movie had a new poster — this time just showing the main character's face and shoulder. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2TaiPr"&gt;The following day, Netflix tweeted an apology:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gmWcCO"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're deeply sorry for the inappropriate artwork that we used for Mignonnes/Cuties. It was not OK, nor was it representative of this French film which won an award at Sundance. We’ve now updated the pictures and description.&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix (@netflix) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1296486375211053057?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 20, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hV1x2T"&gt;On Slack, a group of managers and directors involved with the film discussed the issue. It seemed to be causing Netflix customers to cancel their accounts. One mentioned that multiple employees had been working for days to fix the growing communications crisis. It was an all-hands-on-deck moment for the organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EOUtO7"&gt;The group decided to focus in part on the algorithm. Netflix search results are controlled by what a user types into the search field, the country they’re in, and the titles available in that country. But the &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; documents reveal ways in which the company can take manual steps to hide a film from the platform. It removed the movie from the “coming soon,” “more like this,” “coming later,” “extras,” and “popular searches” categories. It also excluded the film from search results for “cute.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dJoVg7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Avoid looking like we have removed the film page from service”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="i1lenO"&gt;The goal, according to the Netflix documents, was to “minimize press coverage” related to the poster and “avoid looking like we have removed the film page from service, are moving release date and/or not launch the film,” as “this could be seen as reactionary.” Netflix didn’t remove &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt;, but it did its best to minimize its prominence on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Hi1vp"&gt;Netflix manually altered the search results so queries for “cuties,” “mignonnes,” (the title in French), or any variation thereof would exclude “steamy / sexual titles,” as well as kids' movies. Prior to this change, two overtly sexual movies, &lt;em&gt;365 Days&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;An Easy Girl&lt;/em&gt;, were surfacing on Netflix as movies similar to &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eyKCp8"&gt;The company also made sure that searches for problematic terms like “pedo” wouldn’t surface results for &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt;. Without oversight, that was a real possibility because Netflix’s algorithm takes into account behavioral data, which tracks what Netflix viewers actually watch in addition to what they search for. If members search for “pedo” but end up playing &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt;, the French film would have eventually surfaced as a result for the search term “pedo.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rzRh62"&gt;Still, by August 21st, the controversy wasn’t dying down, and Netflix employees were starting to get harassed by QAnon conspiracy theorists online. “We do not believe QAnon is a sophisticated group with advanced offensive skills,” the Netflix security team wrote in an internal memo obtained by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sjMy1"&gt;Elsewhere, the Netflix customer service organization was also in turmoil. The team fielded over 16,236 messages in the weeks following the movie’s release, making it one of the largest causes of incoming customer experience messages of all time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mkuX4X"&gt;In the aftermath of the scandal, Netflix promised to do better. The company compiled a list of hundreds of titles that had potentially sensitive content, which it flagged for further review. Most of the &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; blowup happened in less than a week, but its repercussions would be felt far in the future. In September 2020, after the film’s release, Netflix cancellations were eight times higher than the daily average a year before, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/cuties-backlash-netflix-cancellations-record-levels-1234769354/"&gt;according to an article in &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBZ4tP"&gt;The controversy over &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; overshadowed the film itself. “I wanted to open people’s eyes to what’s truly happening in schools and on social media, forcing them to confront images of young girls made up, dressed up and dancing suggestively to imitate their favorite pop icon,” wrote Maïmouna Doucouré, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/cuties-director-maimouna-doucoure-why-i-made-the-film/2020/09/15/7e0ee406-f78b-11ea-a275-1a2c2d36e1f1_story.html"&gt;in an op-ed for the &lt;em&gt;Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, she and her cast were relentlessly harassed, slammed for oversexualizing young girls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MCauXO"&gt;Netflix took the &lt;em&gt;Cuties&lt;/em&gt; crisis extremely seriously, owning up to its mistake and overhauling its internal processes in the wake of the scandal. This, despite the fact that it wasn’t a Netflix original, and the company’s budget for the film was just $847,500.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="YFp7eK"&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="KOYhxO"&gt;Just over a year later, on October 19th, 2021, Netflix had a quarterly earnings call, where it reported subscriber growth of 4.4 million, beating analysts’ expectations. No one asked about the controversy over Dave Chappelle’s &lt;em&gt;The Closer&lt;/em&gt;, which had occurred just a week prior, even though the story had become national news. Netflix employees were walking out of work the next day to protest the company’s handling of the crisis, and one activist had been fired for allegedly leaking documents about its cost and performance on the platform (the employee has categorically denied this allegation). But it apparently hadn’t translated into a serious business problem for Netflix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YwvlBL"&gt;Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos responded to employee concerns about the Dave Chappelle special by saying, “We have a strong belief that content on screen doesn’t directly translate to real-world harm.” He later admitted this was a “gross simplification” &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/10/netflix-ted-sarandos-speaks-up-dave-chapplle-the-closer-controversy-interview-1234858762/"&gt;in an interview with &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="cr7HWB"&gt;Netflix paid ​​$24.1 million for &lt;em&gt;The Closer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oZzaId"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo 64 games on Nintendo Switch are not too up to snuff</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JrubpogT6CsBarrjXeGKBbGlxfI=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70049297/IMG_0122.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Textures and environments are outputting inconsistently in the Switch version of Ocarina of Time&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Or3D5f"&gt;Monday evening, Nintendo released its latest features bundled into the Nintendo Switch Online subscription: Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis games via an “Expansion Pack.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGeVVY"&gt;As soon as players got a chance to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728113/nintendo-switch-online-plus-expansion-pack-price-n64-genesis-animal-crossing"&gt;throw down another $30 on top of their $20 / year sub&lt;/a&gt;, they immediately took to Twitter to share their disdain of the less-than-ideal emulation quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uZLICf"&gt;A particularly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/stopskeletons/status/1452901471553351680"&gt;fascinating set of images&lt;/a&gt; posted to Twitter by speedrunner ZFG1 comparing the Water Temple on N64, Wii Virtual Console, and Switch was a hot topic today. The Switch version was noticeably lacking fog, revealing terrible-looking textures that represent water.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n86R1i"&gt;I launched &lt;em&gt;Mario 64, StarFox 64&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Zelda: Ocarina of Time &lt;/em&gt;for a quick test. Input speed for &lt;em&gt;Mario 64&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;StarFox 64&lt;/em&gt; seemed OK, but &lt;em&gt;Zelda &lt;/em&gt;had a noticeable input lag in movement (portable mode).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1qjR1l4KYy6X8R36QGoXCNFe4B8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957470/IMG_0123.JPG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Pre-rendered backgrounds and texture maps never translated well to modern displays from their original intended look on old CRT displays.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ew02Nh"&gt;While the images of the missing fog from the tweet started a wildfire of disappointment towards Nintendo, games producer Jon Riesenbach had posted on Twitter to show that the fog-free look is much more akin to the Japanese version of &lt;em&gt;Zelda: Ocarina of Time&lt;/em&gt;. “This likely won’t matter to the people who have already written news articles and make up their minds about this, but that last screenshot is how JP Ocarina’s water has always looked,” he said. Reisenbach would later delete this tweet after ZFG1 &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/zfg111/status/1453071674102857729"&gt;confirmed&lt;/a&gt; that the two images were, in fact, both Japanese versions of the game running on Wii U and Switch, respectively. While both versions look quite similar — which is to say, not great — the six-year-old Wii U release still runs smoother than the Switch version released today.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Comparison shots of Japanese Zelda Ocarina of Time Wii U vs Switch" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4fP_RHJB2qS1ldF-7Ys2wIJjaB4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957631/zeldacompare.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Comparison shots of Japanese Zelda Ocarina of Time Wii U (left) vs Switch (right) Tweeted by @moriyoshijon and confirmed by @zfg111&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AWC0I8"&gt;The Nintendo library is among the deepest and most often revisited in the gaming industry, and fans tend to draw comprehensive comparisons of ports from the original releases (down to the scan lines on old CRT TVs). Efforts to bring the purest form of retro gaming exist as a business model for companies such as &lt;a href="https://www.analogue.co/super-nt"&gt;Analogue&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.eongaming.tech"&gt;EON Gaming&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22323002/mister-fpga-project-retro-computer-console-early-pc"&gt;MiSTer&lt;/a&gt;, where there are options to play classic games in different resolutions on modern displays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mckYdc"&gt;It would seem there is enough demand for the perfect nostalgic experience that Nintendo should do more to fine-tune each game and perhaps even release different region versions of games for a new generation to discover. Perhaps a world &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/30/17408346/nintendo-switch-virtual-console-mega-man-street-fighter"&gt;without&lt;/a&gt; a virtual console or game subscription service would be better for the fans. Being able to buy collections from various game publishers (think &lt;em&gt;Mega Man Legacy Collection&lt;/em&gt;) enables a higher level of nostalgic fan service by bundling multiple games, art, and maybe even some fine-tuned emulation (although, perhaps that&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nibellion/status/1437794471278792708?lang=en"&gt;does not always&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;work out). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksJb2O"&gt;To Nintendo’s credit, half of the nostalgic experience of playing classic games is the controller you use. Nintendo released versions of the Nintendo and Super Nintendo controllers starting in 2018, and now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728144/nintendo-64-sega-genesis-controllers-switch-online-expansion-pack-buy-order"&gt;Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis controllers&lt;/a&gt; are offered (although, &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-64-controller.html"&gt;currently&lt;/a&gt; sold out).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6AfMoe"&gt;The Nintendo Switch Online subscription service is normally $19.99 a year for an individual or $34.99 for a family and includes Nintendo and Super Nintendo games. To unlock the “expansion pack,” it costs another $30 for an individual or $45 for a family of eight.&lt;/p&gt;
