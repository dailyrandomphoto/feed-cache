    <title>Google Workspace turns to ‘smart chips’ to weave Docs, Tasks, and Meet together</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B7KthskGN98BSu3kfvGBbeqWYM0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69306187/acastro_051821_4589_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The @ mention is the key to Google’s Office competitor&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="UYxUeC"&gt;Google is launching a slate of new features for its Workspace productivity suite today, starting with new “smart chips” that connect Google Docs to other products. Just like you can tag people with an @ symbol, starting today, you can use it to specialize links inside docs that hook up other files or meetings. They’re part of what Google is calling the “smart canvas,” a new initiative that promises to increase the cadence of product improvements for Workspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q1wyfN"&gt;The idea behind the smart canvas is similar to workplace productivity suite dreams that reach as &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDoc"&gt;far back as OpenDoc in the ’90s&lt;/a&gt;: having smaller bits of information like charts, text, and images become more modular and interconnected. It’s not dissimilar to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/19/21260005/microsoft-office-fluid-web-document-features-build"&gt;Microsoft’s Fluid Office document project&lt;/a&gt;, which launched last year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UURtgD"&gt;Ultimately, Google is working to make every single part of its Workspace suite of apps interconnected. You’ll be able to start a Meet video chat directly within Docs or share your Doc directly into a Meet call with a button in the doc. All of that integration will be useful, but it also has the benefit (for Google) of perhaps enticing users away from using competing products like Zoom or Slack and instead using Google’s cohesive suite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ffTjhQ"&gt;There is a smattering of other small updates: emoji reactions in Google Docs in addition to traditional comments, a new timeline view in Google Sheets for improved project management, and best of all: a new “pageless” view in Google Docs that does away with the assumption that your document is meant for an 8.5 x 11 piece of paper. It dynamically resizes the doc to the size of your web browser the way a web app ought to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nAuyOz"&gt;Finally, Google is adding some “assisted writing” features to Google Docs, which will range from warning you about offensive language, wordiness, or noninclusive language. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKiYKS"&gt;Taken together, it’s a grab bag of updates, but the thing to keep an eye on going forward is the smart canvas function, which is built on a new framework for Workspace apps that could accelerate development.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f36wDO8moXwPw0J4URGbCbpbczo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520920/chips.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2VK9s8"&gt;Smart chips and templates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="N3UJUH"&gt;Starting with Google Docs, smart canvas will make it easier to dynamically insert smart objects — called chips — that are linked to other parts of Google’s office suite. Google is starting small, though. At first, the smart chips will only connect with other documents, contacts, and meetings. Hovering over one of them will pop up a box with relevant information you can interact with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwrf8v"&gt;To insert a chip, Google is relying on an interaction model you’re probably already familiar with: the @ tag. Type an @ symbol into Google Docs, and it’ll pop up a menu that will list a bunch of those elements, and you can type to narrow it down to the thing you want to include. Hit enter, and it will make a smart chip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="leoUoo"&gt;“We don’t want you to have to learn a new affordance,” says Erika Trautman, director, Google Workspace. “This is something that people know how to use and millions of people use it every day.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="DBMA71"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Smart chips are a new way to live the old OpenDoc dream&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9wFp_P5eTsQQOcH1nb7uMKtxXZM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520926/chip2.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gDoNNU"&gt;If you link to another document or sheet, you can scroll through that document inline in the resizeable hover box — and it should work with lots of different document types in Google Drive, including Microsoft Office docs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vMi3xc"&gt;The smart chips do more than simply link out or create hover boxes, too. The @ symbol can bring up custom templates for things like project management tables, complete with voting and task tracking. If you select a meeting template, it will auto-populate smart tags for the attendees and any files attached to the calendar invite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jbJFsr"&gt;You can also create task lists inside a Google Doc and then assign them to a contact — and if they choose, those tasks will auto-sync with Google Tasks (which, by the way, is still not getting its own website and only lives in a sidebar in other Google apps for some reason). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SibiLc"&gt;Google says that smart chips will also come to Google Sheets “in the coming months.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OmTQ9mh5bQBY8CUWE3yvMpXzjK0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520931/pageless.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;GIF: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="4VsbS3"&gt;Pageless view, timelines, and other features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="66z3ER"&gt;There is a smattering of other features being announced today alongside smart chips, many of which will probably have a more immediate impact on many people’s day-to-day work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ejgGYW"&gt;The pageless format in Google Docs is wildly overdue, especially considering how simple it is. It just does away with the wholly unnecessary concept of a “page break” and also makes the text flow smoothly no matter the width of the browser window. It’s arriving just in time for the 11th anniversary of Ethan Marcotte’s &lt;a href="https://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design/"&gt;seminal Responsive Web Design article&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="59B97k"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Finally, a responsive layout for Google Docs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WyyHBy"&gt;If you use Google Sheets to track projects, there is a new timeline view that can be used to track multiple overlapping tasks. Sheets will also &lt;em&gt;finally&lt;/em&gt; get a little smarter about auto-suggesting formulas when you drag a mouse across cells — as well as offer better troubleshooting for broken ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zjSYL"&gt;There are also a bunch of integrations with Google Meet coming. Docs, Sheets, and Slides will let you present from them directly into a meeting without mucking about with screen-sharing options. Later this fall, all three will integrate Meet directly, so you can start a meeting directly within a document tab.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid c-image-grid__odd"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iy-I9_22gQlvpIZC7Gwy-mCdTMk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520932/Sheets_Timeline_View.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SBuJLKRbb7BG-ixY1bGnoGFG7lg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520937/Assisted_analysis_formula_suggestions.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1vtHiZN-BjgT_EnsqIuSzPULMKE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520940/Assisted_writing_word_warnings.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5CdXG"&gt;Docs is also getting some new options that are either wonderful, infuriating, or perhaps a bit of both. Instead of leaving comments, you’ll soon have the option to just put an emoji reaction on a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XZP6vq"&gt;Last but not least, add one more squiggly underline to go along with red for misspellings and green for grammar: purple for style. Google Docs will be able to make suggestions about different kinds of writing style issues ranging from the genuinely important (suggesting inclusive language like “delivery person” for “mailman”) to patronizing (suggesting “to” for “in order to”) to the downright Victorian (underlining swear words). It’s similar to &lt;a href="https://www.grammarly.com/"&gt;Grammarly&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/microsoft-editor-spelling/gpaiobkfhnonedkhhfjpmhdalgeoebfa?hl=en"&gt;Microsoft Editor&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0gJgsSG00I0uZEuhqtJPM-4JEj8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520942/Table_Checklist_Chips.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FxKxRK"&gt;Workspace and the web&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="OoUJqS"&gt;Last week, &lt;a href="https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com/2021/05/Google-Docs-Canvas-Based-Rendering-Update.html"&gt;Google put up a blog post&lt;/a&gt; announcing that “Google Docs will now use canvas based rendering: this may impact some Chrome extensions.” That “canvas” is different from the smart canvas we’ve been discussing. I regret to inform you that we must now briefly discuss web standards, but it’s relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H4ZBCu"&gt;At a &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_element"&gt;very high level&lt;/a&gt;, canvas is an element you can put into any HTML page, and as the name suggests, it is an empty space you can use to display more complex things — like stuff built with scripts. Essentially, it sits on top of web technology, but — depending on who you ask — it isn’t &lt;em&gt;made&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;of&lt;/em&gt; web technology. It’s a technique for putting code on a webpage that doesn’t necessarily use the stuff you might think of as the code that makes up most of the web like HTML, CSS, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PIycFC"&gt;I bring this up because it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/steveklabnik/status/1392540892746104840"&gt;caused a bit of a stir&lt;/a&gt; in the web community last week. One refrain is that Google is one of the greatest champions of the web and puts significant engineering resources into web technologies — and if Workspace isn’t using them for core features, that’s a bad sign at best and harmful to the development of the web at worst. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="mE4LXy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google is committed to the web as Workspace’s main platform, but it’s evolving&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UqqUvU"&gt;Google insists that the switchover from more traditional web code to canvas is unrelated to today’s announcements, but Trautman admits that the “shift in technology is part of what’s allowing us to innovate and bring these new affordances forward.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kgpAGi"&gt;At the same time, Javier Soltero, VP and GM of Google Workspace, emphasizes that Google — and the Workspaces team, in particular — contributes quite a bit to the web: “We are fiercely committed in steering the path of innovation around the web. [...] These standards are really important to us. And this approach is, to us, an opportunity for us to showcase what you can do through these apps.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OPgukQ"&gt;It’s unclear what third-party Workspace plugins or what Chrome extensions may break in the future, but that’s true of any web app, whatever technology it’s built on. Google does say that its smart chip system &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; be open to other companies. “We do not want this to be a walled garden. It will be extensible,” Trautman says. “We have third party partnerships underway.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5LmVBR"&gt;Ultimately, the most important question may not be whether Google is using traditional web technologies, but whether Google Workspace will continue to be a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/24/15681958/what-is-web-definition"&gt;real web app&lt;/a&gt; instead of just a Chrome app. For that to be true, it needs to be broadly compatible across many desktop and mobile browsers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DJm7b9"&gt;The answer to that question turns out to be fairly complicated because web standards are complicated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8W5ZEY"&gt;Google says Blink-based desktop browsers (including Chrome and Edge) should fully support all of the features mentioned here. WebKit (Safari) and Gecko (Firefox) desktop browsers should support everything except some of the Meet features like opening a videoconference from within Docs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DDompL"&gt;Google officially supports “view mode” for mobile web browsers (though the iPad can present itself as a desktop browser and work). In general, Google wants to point mobile and iPad users to its native apps. Those apps will support many smart canvas features like smart chips, tasks integration, and the responsive pageless layout — but miss out on others like templates and the purple assisted writing squiggles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V3u5YNzutB3f-5UyGvNpKHp3JzM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22520946/Present_to_Meet_from_Docs.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Google&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="BCZix2"&gt;A coherent product roadmap. At Google. Really!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="ip4ptS"&gt;Google Workspace was on a tear in 2020, adding new features and rebranding itself from G Suite (the name you probably still associate with Docs, Sheets, and Meet products). Many of the developments were necessary (and overdue) improvements for both Meet and Chat, two vital collaboration tools for remote work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4sicsD"&gt;The pandemic surely put more priority and resources behind those features, but what was remarkable about them wasn’t what they did, but how they seemed to be part of a larger plan instead of just being haphazardly added as they occurred to a Google engineer. Even Google Chat, the Slack competitor that is the ultimate inheritor of Google’s fractured message app fiascos over the last decade, seems to have a coherent product direction these days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qcvq5W"&gt;It’s happened under the leadership of Soltero, who came to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/1/17067130/microsoft-outlook-cortana-boss-javier-soltero"&gt;Google from Microsoft in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. He came to Microsoft as part of its acquisition of Accompli, an email client so good it ultimately became Outlook for Mobile. Now in charge of Workspace and Google’s communication apps, Soltero is methodically working his team toward a new vision for Workspace. The vision seems to be more influenced by trendy productivity apps like Notion than by Microsoft Office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="YcxDP9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Development on Workspace has accelerated in the past year&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AAa1d4"&gt;In fact, in speaking to Trautman or Soltero, asking even simple questions like how a Docs smart chip could create a Google Task leads quickly to heady discussions around product design and the future of collaborative work. “We want all of that to be under the hood and completely invisible,” Trautman says. “We want that behavior to, from a user perspective, to know what you intended and to do what you intended.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PZ85fS"&gt;“The technical complexity [...] isn’t as important as the sense of restraint and predictability you have to deliver to users,” Soltero adds. For Google, it was a conscious choice to start with Docs and build from there, rather than create an entirely new product or system for collaboration. It’s trying to meet users where they already are and build on that. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5T7b5Q"&gt;There are limits to that approach, but it definitely makes the new features more approachable. The Workspace team is deliberately trying to help users build new habits organically rather than foist an entirely new framework for understanding how productivity software could work on them. &lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/"&gt;Notion&lt;/a&gt;, to cite that example again, is incredibly rich and powerful if you’re able to dive into that system and spend the time it takes to learn it, but Workspace is a giant product with a giant user base that can’t get there right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y6PjRH"&gt;As for some future system that actually presents all of these interconnections, tasks, and documents in a new dashboard? Soltero says: “I don’t want to spoil the rest of our roadmap,” but “there are many examples of decisions you could make to aggregate these things and the decision about whether you create yet another surface… I think restraint actually is not only the right call, but it is more characteristic of what has made Google successful.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="MuiwLY"&gt;In other words, if you were hoping this new interconnected and collaborative smart canvas portends the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/30/2989189/google-wave-shutdown"&gt;return of Google Wave&lt;/a&gt;, it does not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NPetRp"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WEBRQr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Windows 10 May 2021 Update now available, designed to improve remote work</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_LyvnU46guYxeE2SQn8auZ9t9PA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69306134/acastro_180504_1777_microsoft_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Jxh23A"&gt;Microsoft’s next major Windows 10 update is starting to roll out to devices today. The Windows 10 May 2021 Update focuses on improving remote work scenarios, with changes like being able to use multiple Windows Hello cameras on a single machine. That’s particularly useful for Surface devices that owners might want to connect to a monitor with an additional webcam while working from home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WG4RcD"&gt;Here are the full new features of the Windows 10 May 2021 Update (version 21H1):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="vpjo57"&gt;Windows Hello multicamera support to set the default as the external camera when both external and internal Windows Hello cameras are present.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nGUMwO"&gt;Windows Defender Application Guard performance improvements including optimizing document opening scenario times.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ac1Wit"&gt;Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) Group Policy Service (GPSVC) updating performance improvement to support remote work scenarios.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="GbwDB3"&gt;Microsoft typically delivers a big major update of Windows 10 during the springtime, with a smaller one in the fall. The company has reversed that cadence for 2021, so the update that will likely arrive in October will be full of changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FZZv87"&gt;The next major update will include &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313037/microsoft-windows-10-new-system-icons-ui-overhaul-sun-valley"&gt;new system icons&lt;/a&gt;, File Explorer improvements, and even the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422553/microsoft-windows-95-era-icons-removal-windows-10-update-sun-valley"&gt;end of Windows 95-era icons&lt;/a&gt;. Microsoft has some even broader visual changes arriving in Windows 10, as part of a “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/4/22212817/microsoft-windows-10-visual-changes-update-sun-valley-2021"&gt;sweeping visual rejuvenation of Windows&lt;/a&gt;.” The October update will also fix the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/28/22407995/microsoft-windows-apps-rearranging-sleep-resume-fix-directx-12"&gt;rearranging apps issue&lt;/a&gt; on multiple monitors, add the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/17/22336240/microsoft-windows-10-auto-hdr-pc-gaming-directx-11-12"&gt;Xbox Auto HDR feature&lt;/a&gt;, and even improve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410088/microsoft-windows-10-bluetooth-aac-support-update"&gt;Bluetooth audio support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BSiPCp"&gt;Today’s May 2021 Update is so small that you’ll barely even notice it install. Microsoft has been using a special enablement package so that the features are simply hidden on your Windows 10 PC right now, and this update switches them on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MYtpoS"&gt;As always, the Windows 10 May 2021 Update will be available on Windows Update, but if you don’t see it yet, it’s because Microsoft is rolling this out in waves to ensure there are no compatibility issues. If you’re feeling brave, Microsoft does let people force the update through its &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD%2FrLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24542&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fsoftware-download%2Fwindows10" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;installation media tool right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>One of NASA’s Solar Orbiter tools caught its first video of a coronal mass ejection</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Uh5QFmjI_S2z2TRl26-8yNZuSc=/0x109:800x642/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69306028/fig1_solohi_optimized_gif.0.gif" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;ESA &amp;amp; NASA/Solar Orbiter/SoloHI team/NRL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ial5Zi"&gt;One of the instruments aboard Solar Orbiter, a probe built by the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA, caught its first video of a coronal mass ejection while whizzing around the other side of the Sun in February. Solar Orbiter, which launched in early 2020, has detected these massive bursts of energy in the past, but the explosion captured in February this year was an exciting first for NASA.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d8LtzY"&gt;NASA built the Solar Orbiter Heliospheric Imager, or the SoloHI instrument for the Solar Orbiter. It recently captured an energetic gust of solar plasma jetting from the star’s surface as the spacecraft was meandering around the Sun. Scientists didn’t expect the spacecraft to beam back any exciting images at this point — data is slow to reach Earth from such a far distance, and Solar Orbiter’s main mission doesn’t kick off until November.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xZZzpFCqLf85lHI4y-DjW_xFRj8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22522754/fig1_solohi_optimized_gif.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;ESA &amp;amp; NASA/Solar Orbiter/SoloHI team/NRL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The first coronal mass ejection captured by the Solar Orbiter’s Solar Orbiter Heliospheric Imager (SoloHI).&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wLdV7r"&gt;But SoloHI delivered the goods anyway, as it came out from behind the Sun and reentered Earth’s line of sight, beaming back what NASA called a “happy accident.” Two other instruments aboard the Solar Orbiter, the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) and the Metis coronagraph, may have captured different views of the coronal mass ejection around the same time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9SUKz"&gt;Scientists are still piecing together the images from the different instruments to get a clear picture of what was going on near the Sun that day. Around the same time that SoloHi recorded its &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/a-new-space-instrument-captures-its-first-solar-eruption"&gt;first detection of a coronal mass ejection&lt;/a&gt;, EUI and METIS detected &lt;a href="http://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Space_Science/Solar_Orbiter/Solar_Orbiter_images_first_coronal_mass_ejections"&gt;a pair of coronal mass ejections&lt;/a&gt;. Other solar-focused spacecraft also captured images and video of the eruptions that day.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/J8Rvp2wVQEIX7IYTVtpZys8uIIg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22522803/RESIZED_fig2_stereo_a_cor2_cme.2021_05_18_15_14_35.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;NASA/STEREO/COR2&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The same coronal mass ejection Solar Orbiter’s SoloHI instrument observed, captured by NASA’s Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-A — one of two spacecraft launched in  2006.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="542SFz"&gt;Coronal mass ejections are lively bursts of plasma that send geomagnetic shockwaves across the solar system. The bigger ones that cross paths with Earth can wreak havoc on satellites in space, potentially disrupting radio transmissions or (for really rare and massive ones) knocking power grids offline. The plasma emitted from these ejections pummel Earth’s protective magnetosphere and slide around into its polar regions, clashing with the atmosphere and giving rise to the Northern and Southern Lights, or aurora.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uEoq4x"&gt;Solar Orbiter’s main mission is to study the Sun up-close, helping scientists understand the causes of solar wind and how it affects Earth. The minivan-sized craft, coming as close as 26 million miles from the Sun, is among the closest human-made objects to probe the star. It’s second only to NASA’s Parker Solar Probe which is designed to get even closer, zipping around the Sun at a distance of just 3.8 million miles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="zbk88v"&gt;In July last year, Solar Orbiter’s Extreme Ultraviolet Imager nabbed some high-resolution shots of what scientists dubbed “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21326014/esa-nasa-solar-orbiter-images-flares-campfires-sun-close-distance"&gt;campfires&lt;/a&gt;” — tiny surface explosions more formally called nanoflares.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Live blog: Google I/O is back for 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Sundar Pichai at Google I/O 2017" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zQBITCktmf8dBSYYqgTjmIbt0T0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69305793/thumb_googleio.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Sundar Pichai at Google I/O 2017&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Google is actually doing it live&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="4IaEwB"&gt;After taking a year off, &lt;a href="https://events.google.com/io/?lng=en"&gt;Google is back with its I/O developer conference for 2021&lt;/a&gt;. Like most tech events over the past year, this is not an in-person event and will be streamed over the internet instead. Unlike most tech events over the past year, this keynote will actually be &lt;em&gt;live&lt;/em&gt;, not prerecorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rCFJy0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/14/22435116/google-io-2021-rumors-android-12-pixel-buds-a-series-chip"&gt;What will Google announce at I/O? It could be anything&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a lock that there will be a deeper look at Android 12, but a late surprise is that Wear OS might also get some attention. Google usually has some kind of fancy AI demo, and there are lots of other products that could get some stage time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzDEjd"&gt;Google I/O isn’t usually the place where we expect new hardware, but we know Google is working on the Pixel 5A and low-cost Pixel Buds — so they could be a surprise entry. And there’s also some rumored Nest hardware floating about, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon goes quiet on its Twitch-based Pac-Man game, but Bandai Namco says it’s still in development</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IsQDdUukfDpRPGQkmJ_MmWTm8Lc=/79x0:922x562/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69301024/pic_03.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Amazon Games and Bandai Namco&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rnmAeI"&gt;In May 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/22/21266881/pac-man-live-studio-playable-on-twitch-june"&gt;Amazon announced &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an interesting new version of &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man &lt;/em&gt;that you’d be able to play right inside Twitch. The game was set to release that June — but recently the company removed all traces of it from the Amazon Games website. Nearly a year after &lt;em&gt;Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; was supposed to debut, its status remains a mystery — though developer Bandai Namco says the game is still in the works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SePP7C"&gt;Right now, &lt;em&gt;Live Studio&lt;/em&gt;’s page on the Amazon Games website &lt;a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/games/pac-man-live-studio"&gt;shows a 404 error&lt;/a&gt;, but the Wayback Machine has an archived version of the filled-out webpage &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210407014742/https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/games/pac-man-live-studio"&gt;from April 7th&lt;/a&gt;. This archived version lists a release date of “coming soon” — many months after the original June launch date. And Wario64, who you might know as one of the &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/microsoft-new-gaming-console-545e87c5-0a6f-4384-8b69-dbded2737e01.html#:~:text=Wario64,worse"&gt;best video game deal-finders on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, reported that the site wasn’t working &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1383552847120257024"&gt;as recently as mid-April&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dQoHaS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10505133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tmT7cS"&gt;There is a live page for the game on Pac-Man’s &lt;a href="https://pacman.com/en/games/livestudio.php"&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;, which says &lt;em&gt;Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; is “coming soon” and lists Bandai Namco as the developer and Amazon Games as the publisher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvrXLN"&gt;There’s also a live Twitter account, @&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/playpacmanlive?lang=en"&gt;PlayPacManLive&lt;/a&gt;, that has only &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1263642826018971651"&gt;posted&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1280317322842931201"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1290349893421211648"&gt;handful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1290350207553564672"&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1290350895025143809"&gt;tweets&lt;/a&gt;. The latest is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1295162966736695297"&gt;from August 16th, 2020&lt;/a&gt; (in reply to a tweet from an account that no longer exists) saying that “we’re getting closer to having all the pellets in place.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="A3DCbe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We're getting closer to having all the pellets in place, and coffee breaks activated. We greatly appreciate your patience.&lt;/p&gt;— PAC-MAN LIVE STUDIO (@PlayPacManLive) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayPacManLive/status/1295162966736695297?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 17, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ewPnZ2"&gt;After this story was originally published, Bandai Namco shared the following statement, saying that the game isn’t ready just yet:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="xozNgh"&gt;Amazon is a great partner and helped us with the heavy lifting on Twitch integration, testing and westernization. &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man Live Studio&lt;/em&gt; was intended to be part of &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man’s&lt;/em&gt; 40&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Anniversary celebration, but the game is not quite ready to launch yet. We are working to determine a launch date now, and hope to have news to share soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5ExYxX"&gt;But it’s still not clear why the game is no longer listed on the Amazon Games website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hivyrY"&gt;Amazon’s game development studio has had a rocky history.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Hero shooter &lt;em&gt;Crucible&lt;/em&gt; launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/5/21246923/amazon-crucible-relentless-studio-free-to-play-launch-date-may-20"&gt;last May&lt;/a&gt; but was put back into closed beta &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/30/21308638/amazon-game-studios-crucible-closed-beta-failure-relentless-studio"&gt;in July&lt;/a&gt; and eventually canceled &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/9/21510190/amazon-crucible-canceled-game-studios-closed-beta"&gt;in October&lt;/a&gt;. The studio also canceled a &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; online roleplaying game &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/17/22389533/amazon-canceled-lord-of-the-rings-game-tencent"&gt;in April&lt;/a&gt; after a contract dispute with Tencent. (Amazon is still working on its &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/16/amazons-lord-of-the-rings-will-cost-at-least-465-million.html"&gt;extremely expensive &lt;em&gt;Lord of Rings&lt;/em&gt; series&lt;/a&gt;, however.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHQ9wH"&gt;And open-world MMO &lt;em&gt;New World&lt;/em&gt;, Amazon Games’ current marquee title (and, I should add, the only one listed in &lt;a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/games"&gt;the Games section&lt;/a&gt; of the studio’s website), was delayed for the third time from a spring 2021 release to August 31st &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22285810/new-world-amazon-delay-august-2021-release-date"&gt;in February&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="RRqMbI"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10505115"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rgW81Q"&gt;Despite the cancellations, the company recently reiterated support for game development. In response to a &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-01-29/amazon-game-studios-struggles-to-find-a-hit?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;damning &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; report from January&lt;/a&gt; describing problems at the studio, incoming Amazon CEO Andy Jassy shared a memo internally, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-02-03/andy-jassy-next-amazon-ceo-says-he-s-committed-to-making-video-games?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;also reported by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, stating the company’s continued commitment to gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VUJBEn"&gt;“Some businesses take off in the first year, and others take many years,” Jassy reportedly wrote. “Though we haven’t consistently succeeded yet in AGS, I believe we will if we hang in there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NeFvPD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 18th, 12:13PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added statement from Bandai Namco and made changes to reflect that the game is apparently still in development.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>TikTok is helping games about high heels and long nails go viral</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xP8l3uRcG1ZxzLpKWtHbXwT-lfw=/300x0:1920x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69305649/HighHeels_1_0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;There’s now an assembly line of ‘baddie games’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="eQVAk3"&gt;One night in January, I was scrolling through TikTok with the bottomless human need for content when a video urged my glassy eyes awake. It was a &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@isaiahbaca_/video/6919037106161585414?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowtWMs0%2Bcc5kwB%2BvD4Vl7zFh23ty5G8%2FV1gcO30OHn08KwEmzMJHjnV6Fh9mLCAG1LGgA%3D&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;preview_pb=0&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAsnRtH4NmKnrIUH0lfirtlf8o9H0mLiBx-kT_mIufohUsVbqAVyuXSdBwG3lU09k1&amp;amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;amp;share_item_id=6919037106161585414&amp;amp;share_link_id=93F08AFD-4599-443D-8D00-9CC2ADE0BC4F&amp;amp;source=h5_m&amp;amp;timestamp=1619927298&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=dd7g5ak540h11k&amp;amp;user_id=6844705173010957318&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;_r=1"&gt;TikTok&lt;/a&gt; for hypercasual phone game &lt;em&gt;High Heels!&lt;/em&gt; made from an original video by TikTok user &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@isaiahbaca_?lang=en"&gt;Isaiah Baca&lt;/a&gt;. He proclaimed that he had “found a game for baddies.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nhImqb"&gt;A “baddie,” if you’re not familiar with the term, is essentially a hot, independent girl. According to one of the &lt;a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Baddie"&gt;oldest&lt;/a&gt; Urban Dictionary entries for “baddie,” from 2006, one of the ways that you could use “baddie” in a sentence is to say, “Wow, that girl is a baddie.” So, checks out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ui35lf"&gt;Baddies aren’t your typical phone game demographic. But watching the addictive, repetitive premise of &lt;em&gt;High Heels!&lt;/em&gt; unfold, you kind of see what Baca means. The game, by Turkish developer Rollic Games, is as simple as its genre necessitates. You play as a continuously sashaying woman, stacking high heels to get over obstacles that progressively eliminate your heels. Occasionally, you slide down a platform while doing the splits and clapping. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NlzEnK"&gt;Although I mostly forgot about &lt;em&gt;High Heels! &lt;/em&gt;until I started getting more TikToks for different-but-very-similar hypercasual games, it went viral. Most of the thousands of comments lauded the developer’s use of a genuine TikTok as an ad, laughed about the game’s use of the splits (it’s pretty good), and asked (in all caps) what the name of the game was. Just like with &lt;a href="https://www.vulture.com/2019/06/brand-twitter-jokes-history.html"&gt;Brand Twitter&lt;/a&gt;’s strange but often successful imitation of relatability, the perceived authenticity of &lt;em&gt;High Heels! &lt;/em&gt;brought it relevance. According to a mid-April &lt;a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/data-and-research/76319/app-annie-zynga-high-heels-breakout-mobile-game-of-q1-2012/"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;Pocket Gamer&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;High Heels!&lt;/em&gt; was one of the biggest mobile game debuts for the first quarter of 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NMdXdi"&gt;It also unintentionally spearheaded a new genre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="Vc2GM1"&gt;A lot of the conversation surrounding these TikToks are the same. Users declare the games to be “baddie games” or what video games made by Gen Z would be like. They are also heavily associated with the queer community, not only because queer users tend to play them but also for other signals, like LGBT &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@aaronbeattie_/video/6919232127087299842?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgow%2BORA4HfKt0pAbOIT2wONh2CkqWtbdRvp4ar6UAbqUJI3C4ZLi1af%2BQf42pWsG8yqGgA%3D&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;preview_pb=0&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAsnRtH4NmKnrIUH0lfirtlf8o9H0mLiBx-kT_mIufohUsVbqAVyuXSdBwG3lU09k1&amp;amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;amp;share_item_id=6919232127087299842&amp;amp;share_link_id=001B3FB8-3B75-4FF2-AC5C-00A33A97B8B3&amp;amp;source=h5_m&amp;amp;timestamp=1619931388&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=dd7g5ak540h11k&amp;amp;user_id=6844705173010957318&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;_r=1"&gt;hashtags&lt;/a&gt; and strategic music choices, namely sped-up versions of Nicki Minaj’s “Megatron” and Lil Nas X’s “Call Me By Your Name.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqNNBQ"&gt;The aesthetics of the games themselves also gesture at queerness and online culture more broadly. A lot of “baddie games” are centered on exaggerated gender performance, much like drag or ballroom culture. Other games flirt with the idea of sex work or embrace the “bimbo,” two things notably redefined by the internet’s obsession with sugar babies, OnlyFans, and previously maligned 2000’s hot girls like Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. Even the bestowed moniker “baddie game” encompasses these things with its implied hyperfemininity and sexual liberation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WeEwBQ"&gt;In a February &lt;a href="https://www.inputmag.com/gaming/high-heels-app-game-queer-joy"&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;em&gt;Input&lt;/em&gt;, writer Matt Wille singled out &lt;em&gt;High Heels! &lt;/em&gt;as a game that rewards players for queerness, writing, “Whether or not its creators intended it, &lt;em&gt;High Heels!&lt;/em&gt; deserves credit for being a space around which the queer community can celebrate being femme.” I’m not entirely sure of that. The only things that are “queer” about these games are the aesthetics and vernacular co-opted from their most loyal players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4zxfh"&gt;With this in mind, I talked to queer comedian Mano Agapion about baddie games after seeing an old tweet of his about it. “Everyone play the iPhone game &lt;em&gt;High Heels!&lt;/em&gt;,” he wrote on February 6th. “It’s queer culture.” Wondering if he still played the game, I DMed him. “I burned through it in two weeks. I don’t play anymore, but I did try the big butt one,” he said over DM. “You clap as you’re split upon broom sticks connecting two skyscrapers. And that’s drag.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;div id="o2ia2h"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@antonio_cuciniello/video/6943284851315395846" data-video-id="6943284851315395846" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@antonio_cuciniello" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@antonio_cuciniello"&gt;@antonio_cuciniello&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Il primo video mi è stato segnalato per nudità ED IO LO RIPOSTO. LE MIE UNGHIE DOPO AVERLE TAGLIATE &lt;a title="viral" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/viral"&gt;#viral&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="fyp" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/fyp"&gt;#fyp&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="foru" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/foru"&gt;#foru&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="perte" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/perte"&gt;#perte&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="game" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/game"&gt;#game&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="nail" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/nail"&gt;#nail&lt;/a&gt; name game? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - justice" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-6866612555591305990"&gt;♬ original sound - justice&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CMnWM9"&gt;I asked if anything about the game’s purported queerness bothers him. “It makes sense that it’s queer bait,” he said. “But sometimes you have to turn your brain off with a dumb thing. And I like queer things being celebrated in pop culture.” Ryan Davis, a Twitter user who tweeted that he was “willing to trade all of the live feed videos on my TikTok [For You Page] in exchange for more &lt;em&gt;High Heels!&lt;/em&gt; game ads,” DMed me something similar. “Honestly, I just thought the ad itself was pretty funny. I think the aesthetic and branding plus the Nicki song paired well and made the game seem intriguing.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LpE9Pc"&gt;So maybe I am overthinking this whole “baddie game” thing. Maybe I should let games like Rollic’s &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bounce-big/id1552911964"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bounce Big&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which asks you in the description to “collect delish jigglers!” as you grow your character’s ass, jiggle in peace. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jhw0hw"&gt;But Rollic has refused to acknowledge its explicit tie to the queer community, the one it created by using a queer person’s TikTok as free, viral advertisement. The studio, and other developers, strengthen the tie by flooding the app store with new baddie-baiting games that all seem to be in never-ending imitation of each other. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2h32IG"&gt;Searching any variation of “queen” or “heels’’ will yield you a healthy handful of hypercasual game results, most by Turkish developers like Rollic. Some notable titles that speak to just how strong the assembly line vibes on this whole “baddie game” thing is: &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/catwalk-queen/id1560181694"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Catwalk Queen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Baris Yilmaz, which involves filling an ever-growing purse with mounds of money; &lt;a href="https://appadvice.com/app/roll-queen/1557507047"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Roll Queen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;from Hakan Ozer, which uses the slogan “the simps go round and round” and has your character stepping on men to progress levels; and &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/baddies-up/id1559784459"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Baddies Up&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Wixot Studios, which requires you to both step on men and collect wads of cash. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZbbHhi"&gt;Turkey is a bit of a powerhouse when it comes to mobile gaming and has been a part of a few high-profile sales, including San Francisco-based Zynga’s acquisition of Rollic for $180 million in cash in 2020. Homosexuality is legal in Turkey but institutionally &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55901951"&gt;suppressed&lt;/a&gt;. The “baddie games” tie to Turkey makes their queer bent a bit more exciting, flickering with the possibility that they’re giving Turkish queer developers and artists a space to create. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3S3GA4"&gt;But when pressed on the topic in the past, Rollic has been deliberately cagey. In an April &lt;a href="https://www.venn.tv/gaming/2021-04-12/tiktok-and-mobile-games-how-high-heels-went-viral/"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with video game news network VENN, when its games’ popularity with the LGBT community was mentioned, Rollic’s director of art and design Inci Alper said, “We didn’t make it specifically for one group of people, but wanted to be as inclusive as possible; we wanted to include everyone, kings and queens and everything in between. We make games that are played worldwide, and any age group can pick up.” In an interview with &lt;em&gt;Input&lt;/em&gt;, Rollic evaded revealing whether the studio employed any queer developers and did not respond to my request for comment. In other words, Rollic won’t publicly stand with, employ, or speak positively about the queer community, but it will certainly profit off of their support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qC6oAX"&gt;TikTokkers have continued to &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@i.test.games.lol/video/6935750979551808774?_d=secCgYIASAHKAESMgowe0rDxUyogiwS66UaiQITf%2FOFaxStXDkgmm6%2FfcCPT%2BBu5i%2BITqzlELc2eHJdEXuCGgA%3D&amp;amp;language=en&amp;amp;preview_pb=0&amp;amp;sec_user_id=MS4wLjABAAAAsnRtH4NmKnrIUH0lfirtlf8o9H0mLiBx-kT_mIufohUsVbqAVyuXSdBwG3lU09k1&amp;amp;share_app_id=1233&amp;amp;share_item_id=6935750979551808774&amp;amp;share_link_id=E076F395-0A36-445B-B46A-2F09488A91F7&amp;amp;source=h5_m&amp;amp;timestamp=1620065840&amp;amp;tt_from=copy&amp;amp;u_code=dd7g5ak540h11k&amp;amp;user_id=6844705173010957318&amp;amp;utm_campaign=client_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios&amp;amp;utm_source=copy&amp;amp;_r=1"&gt;highlight&lt;/a&gt; new “baddie games” because they tend to get a lot of likes. They’re also inundating the games with 5-star, facetious-yet-undeniably-glowing reviews. “This game is the reason I am still alive today,” one review from February 9th reads. “If you don’t download it you will go through a life of depression and misery and you will never learn to be a baddie.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NL3Ehc"&gt;When I asked Agapion what he thought of Gen Z’s understanding of being gay, he wrote, “It’s a weird moment for queerness.” He continued: “As someone who’s visibly POC and queer, my queerness affects my life, my health, my well being. The community (like trans queens at Stonewall) didn’t choose advocacy because it was cute. They &lt;em&gt;couldn’t live&lt;/em&gt; if they didn’t advocate. That is lost on young people.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="dyYykg"&gt;For the makers of “baddie games,” leaning into a younger generation’s disconnect with history is the key to their success as imitating internet-speak, using memes, and catering to queer social media users become increasingly popular marketing strategies. But even if they want us to play, we don’t have to let them win.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halide’s iPad camera app is here to recklessly promote tablet photography</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hr8zNsDjKz3uoZwcqNgNXOWSvCE=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69305591/iPad_Pro___Pro_View_and_Regular_View.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ylwtz0"&gt;One of the best third-party camera apps for iOS, Halide, is coming to the iPad, its &lt;a href="https://lux.camera/halide-pro-camera-for-ipad/"&gt;developer Lux announced today&lt;/a&gt;. The iPhone app has a reputation for the amount of control it gives you over your photographs, and this functionality has been carried over to the iPad along with a redesigned interface that’s optimized for larger displays. The app is free to existing Halide owners, while new users can either pay a one-off purchase fee ($40) or go with monthly ($1.99) or yearly ($11.99) subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lgCtK4"&gt;Using iPads to take photographs has a bit of a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/10/16/6990649/apples-ipad-air-2-shows-that-tablet-photography-is-here-to-stay"&gt;reputation problem&lt;/a&gt;. Not only do Apple’s tablets tend to have fewer and lower-specced rear cameras than its phones, but the act of taking a photograph using a large tablet often looks just plain goofy. At least Lux appears to be aware of one of the most egregious iPad photography sins: &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/m88cm/you_thought_people_taking_pictures_on_their/"&gt;taking photos at a concert&lt;/a&gt;. The company is teasing a potential future “Concert Mode,” which could automatically disable the camera if it detects it’s being used at a show.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93v5iz"&gt;“Concert Mode is disabled for now - as we trust our users to Do The Right Thing,” Lux tells me, “but we’re going to be ruthless about bringing this in a future update if people cannot behave.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IIhY1f0ow8iw79S6lm9S1BbxSYU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22522759/Concert_Mode__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Halide&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A proof of concept for a potential “Concert Mode.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V5PitlOn53aNmnulUOLxA_wDAjY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22522761/Pro_View___Portrait_with_Manual_Focus.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Halide&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pro View shrinks the viewfinder to make it easier to see on larger displays.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zafEGU"&gt;The app’s controls have been reconfigured to work better with a larger display. It’s got a toggle to switch between modes for left- and right-handed users, and key features have their controls arranged around the edges of the screen where they’re within thumbs’ reach. Like the iPhone app, Halide on the iPad allows for manual control of ISO, shutter speed, focus, and supports its recent &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/22/21528652/halide-mark-ii-update-raw-processing-new-pricing-subscriptions-memberships"&gt;RAW photography modes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7o6QYR"&gt;One of the more interesting features of Halide’s iPad app is a “Pro View” mode, which is a toggle that shrinks the viewfinder into the center of the display. Lux’s argument is that this makes it easier to take in the entire viewfinder, and it has the side benefit of creating extra space around the edges of the display for a bigger histogram, waveform, manual focus, and other controls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c3v63F"&gt;Halide’s launch on the iPad isn’t going to convince anyone that tablets are the best devices for taking photographs. But if you insist on going against the grain, at least there’s a nicer way to do it now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LDV9JT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QDpuVw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S62loA"&gt;Just a few inches of human-driven sea level rise contributed to Hurricane Sandy’s devastation of the Northeastern US in 2012. Tens of thousands more people were affected, and more than $8 billion in damages incurred during the storm were a result of climate-induced sea level rise, according to a new study published in the journal &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/ncomms/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nature Communications&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fNzqS8"&gt;That’s about 13 percent of the more than $62.5 billion total in damage that the superstorm created in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Because climate change pushed sea levels higher, floodwaters were able to creep further inland — bringing more destruction with them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="G4TZQs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Sea level rise raises the launchpad for every single coastal storm.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jL0rHg"&gt;This is the first study to put a dollar sign on how much human-caused sea level rise exacerbated damage during a storm, the researchers say. They hope their methods can reveal the vulnerabilities other coastal communities face as climate change pushes floodwaters closer to their doors.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vlj8GX"&gt;“Sea level rise raises the launchpad for every single coastal storm,” says lead author Benjamin Strauss, a chief scientist and CEO of the nonprofit research organization Climate Central. “Climate change is already hurting us more than we realize. And hopefully, this research can help to inspire more investigation into just how much.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NTdSwO"&gt;Waters surrounding the New York area rose by roughly four inches in the 100 years before Hurricane Sandy made landfall. As a result, floodwaters reached about 36,000 more homes and 71,000 more people, according to the study conducted jointly by Climate Central and other researchers from the Stevens Institute of Technology and Rutgers University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gaRWou"&gt;Hurricane Sandy was one of the costliest storms to strike the US. At least 147 people in the US lost their lives, according to the National Hurricane Center. Nearly a decade later, others are still recovering from the damage inflicted on their homes by the storm. Parts of the city were flooded with up to &lt;a href="https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/data/tcr/AL182012_Sandy.pdf"&gt;nine feet of water&lt;/a&gt;. Waves in some places grew to &lt;a href="https://sos.noaa.gov/datasets/wave-heights-hurricane-sandy-2012/#:~:text=Hurricane%20Sandy%20was%20the%20largest,killed%20in%20the%20affected%20region."&gt;32 feet&lt;/a&gt; tall. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="kpgqcg"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Without climate change, thousands of people would have been spared&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="D8OeUi"&gt;Without climate change, thousands of people would have been spared from the chaos, according to the study authors. “They would have been dry without the human caused portion of sea level rise,” says Philip Orton, another author of the study and a research associate professor at Stevens Institute of Technology. Others, he says, may have actually had their basement filled up with water because of human causes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WD7ND3"&gt;A complex mix of factors can push sea levels higher, with more dramatic change in some areas compared to others. Waters around New York City, for example, rose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/2/17924052/new-york-sea-level-rise-city-flooding-climate-change-science"&gt;1.5 times faster&lt;/a&gt; than the global average during the 20th century. That’s in part because of the land readjusting ever since glaciers retreated some 20,000 years ago. Gravity and ocean currents play a role, too. And then &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18511662/coastal-cities-sea-level-rise-cost-new-york-resiliency"&gt;there’s climate change&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/23/18511662/coastal-cities-sea-level-rise-cost-new-york-resiliency"&gt;redrawing our coastlines&lt;/a&gt;. When greenhouse gas emissions trap heat and raise global average temperatures, ice sheets and glaciers melt, and water in the world’s oceans expands. In the new study, researchers were able to isolate each contributing factor so that they could pinpoint just how much sea level rise is the fault of humans pumping out greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UvEiDh"&gt;Once the researchers figured out how much sea level rise was attributed just to climate change, they conducted more modeling. They simulated Hurricane Sandy twice: once with sea level rise attributed to climate change and again without it. Lastly, they estimated the costs from Hurricane Sandy attributable to climate-induced sea level rise. They landed on a range of losses from $4.7 billion to $14 billion, with $8 billion representing the midpoint. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="qzsGFZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Important implications for the future of coastal cities”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AJHgjh"&gt;“The new study has many important implications for the future of coastal cities facing the threat of sea level rise and severe coastal storm damage,” Vivien Gornitz, a retired geologist previously with Columbia University and NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email. The methods the researchers used to come to their findings could be used to figure out the damage climate change adds to other disasters, Gornitz says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NgaySM"&gt;There could have been even more damage during Hurricane Sandy that might not have been captured by the study because the researchers focused on flood depths, according to Gornitz. Other factors like erosion and chemical corrosion weren’t accounted for in the study and might have caused even more problems.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;There might have been even more economic losses in the aftermath because of power outages and business closures, she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wKwwJk"&gt;“I’m actually surprised that the percentage of the damage, or the absolute value, was as low as they got it. I would have expected to be a little bit higher,” says Klaus Jacob, a geophysicist at Columbia University’s Earth Institute who was not involved in the study, adding that the authors of the paper “did a very thorough analysis.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q82r33"&gt;“The key takeaway for me is, every coastal flood today and for the last half century has been more damaging because of sea level rise caused by human activity,” Strauss says. “And that effect is only increasing as seas continue to rise.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASZaGN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SCq9ny"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch, like everything else that can lighten the mood during this difficult time, is in short supply. And as soon as retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart get it in stock, it quickly sells out. It can be disheartening to miss out on the opportunity to buy a Switch — but fear not! The purpose of this article is to help you do just that without paying more than it would usually cost at retail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BazuMH"&gt;We’re keeping a lookout across the web to find where, when, and how you can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt; (the one you can dock to your TV or remove for portable use) or a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt; (the portable-only version of the console) as well as any bundles that seem like good deals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6nOmgX"&gt;Keep in mind that stock — even Switch consoles that are preowned or refurbished — will likely continue to sell out quickly during the pandemic. But we’ll do our best to keep this article up to date with the latest in-stock offers, and we’ll tell you when each offer was posted. When something gets sold out, we’ll try to let you know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch or Switch Lite right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qcOiY9"&gt;Over at Amazon, you can buy an updated Nintendo Switch model with gray Joy-Cons, plus a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YMM3RHZ?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;64GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $317&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re looking to upgrade, Amazon is offering two additional bundles, one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YBVJRD7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $327&lt;/a&gt; and one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YMJ4XBP?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $346&lt;/a&gt;. All three bundles will be in stock on May 28th.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ueoxw3"&gt;You can purchase the updated Nintendo Switch model with gray Joy-Cons for $300 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07VJRZ62R?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; (in stock 6/4), or with red and blue Joy-Cons for $300 at &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch-neon-blue-neon-red-joy-con.html"&gt;Nintendo&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;li id="pbWPDc"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergehowto&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fsearch%2F%3Fq%3Dnintendo%2Bswitch%26lang%3Ddefault" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1720139703165212912#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/1068185/2092?subId1=Verge&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fs%3FsearchTerm%3Dnintendo%2Bswitch%26category%3D0%257CAll" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt; receive new supplies of the Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite consoles fairly regularly, and it’s a good strategy to keep these pages open so you can quickly add one to your cart when they come back in stock. Keep in mind, however, that they’re occasionally only available for in-store pickup.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="o2G175"&gt;If you’re not against buying a preowned or refurbished console, you’ll want to check out &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=vergeevergreen&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fswitch%2Fconsoles%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-with-gray-joy-con%2F206007.html%3Fgclid%3DCjwKCAiAt9z-BRBCEiwA_bWv-HzeKt4-dsaWdi9G9SGmxFTUUEAxrCA4NxZS0xEWCkIacwTZ_cUKPRoCEYUQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;. Another good place to look is &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo’s online store where it sells refurbished Switch consoles&lt;/a&gt;. Currently, Nintendo is offering the &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch-gray-gray-joy-con-refurbished-2.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;second-gen Nintendo Switch with gray Joy-Cons&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch-neon-blue-neon-red-joy-con-refurbished-2.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;red and blue Joy-Cons for $260&lt;/a&gt;, in addition to every color of the Switch Lite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8hV7z9"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Nintendo Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hgAR00"&gt;Frankly, the Switch comes with everything that you need to get started and have fun. However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jnXhNd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556339"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9sHCpf"&gt;First off, a MicroSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage. Amazon, Best Buy, and other retailers regularly sell cards with up to &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GXXKY6P/ref=asc_df_B08GXXKY6P/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;512GB of storage for around $70&lt;/a&gt;. A &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B074RNRM2B?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;400GB microSD card will cost you around $50&lt;/a&gt;, and with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes, the card has enough space to store several of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Agp45r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10397609"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdvLy"&gt;Let’s talk quickly about controllers. The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some Super Mario Party titles require the Joy-Cons to play. If you are looking for a Switch Pro controller, both &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01NAWKYZ0?ots=1&amp;amp;slotNum=29&amp;amp;imprToken=7cbcbe4d-23d3-64db-2f0&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20&amp;amp;ascsubtag=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21021684%5Bt%5Dw%5Br%5Dgoogle.com%5Bd%5DD" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller-Black%2F55485228&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; also have the Switch Pro controller for $59, knockings $11 off its normal retail price. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2BZPIqmUqpLcZoV5GVxdxMULT3I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9537475/akrales_171025_2091_0010.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UODwlY"&gt;Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ulULMw"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N3ASPNV?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;A two-pack of amFilm tempered glass protectors for the Nintendo Switch is $6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="cx5X9k"&gt;If you want to play online with friends, ensure that your saves are backed up in the cloud, and get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era, you’ll want to get a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $20 per year for a single user&lt;/a&gt; on a console or &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1728487093072266361" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$35 a year for up to eight users on different consoles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Grand Theft Auto V is coming to the PS5 and Xbox Series X in November</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s9lggj"&gt;One of the bestselling games of all time is coming to next-gen consoles at the end of the year. Today, &lt;a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/3981k373a7a9ok/details-on-new-updates-to-g-t-a-online-and-red-dead-online"&gt;Rockstar announced&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V&lt;/em&gt; and its online spinoff will both be launching on the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X on November 11th; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21288378/grand-theft-auto-v-5-gta-ps5-2021-release"&gt;the new version was previously announced at the PS5’s reveal event last year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MgnvJA"&gt;We don’t yet know what exactly will be changed for the next-gen iterations, but Rockstar says they will be “expanded and enhanced.” It’s also not clear what the upgrade path will look like for current owners of the game. &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt;, meanwhile, will be available as a standalone title, and Sony previously said that it would be free for all PS5 owners during its first three months of availability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AEJ28b"&gt;Despite launching &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/9/16/4736176/grand-theft-auto-v-review"&gt;in 2013&lt;/a&gt; — it debuted on the PS3 and Xbox 360 — &lt;em&gt;GTAV&lt;/em&gt; has proved to be an enduring hit, one that will soon span three generations of game consoles. Publisher Take Two says the game has sold more than 140 million copies to date.&lt;/p&gt;
