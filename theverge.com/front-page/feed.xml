    <title>The PlayStation 5 will be available through Sony’s store later today</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Ww7DNc"&gt;More than six months after its initial debut, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PlayStation 5&lt;/a&gt; remains as elusive as ever. Sony also expects console shortages to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428322/sony-ps5-supply-constraints-2022-hiroki-totoki"&gt;stretch into 2022&lt;/a&gt;, however, as of 5:15PM ET / 2:15PM PT, both the PS5 and PS5 Digital Edition will be available at Sony’s store. &lt;a href="https://direct-queue.playstation.com/?c=sonyied&amp;amp;e=hsm0u2oyux&amp;amp;ver=v3-javascript-3.6.3&amp;amp;cver=281&amp;amp;man=PS%20Direct%20Prod%20KU%20Action&amp;amp;t=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fhardware%2Fps5&amp;amp;kupver=akamai-1.0.2"&gt;You can head to that site right now&lt;/a&gt;, and the page will automatically toss you into the queue to (hopefully) secure a PS5 from the batch being released into the wild today. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DcPHQX"&gt;Sony says that you don’t need to refresh the page, but make sure that you stick around once the queue begins because it’ll likely ask you at some point to verify that you’re still present, or else you might be booted from the queue. If it’s your first time, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/23/22434905/ps5-restock-best-buy-walmart-sony-playstation-5"&gt;welcome to the needless drama involved with buying a PS5&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WVpQBa"&gt;So, what’s the difference between the two models?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dA6hbH"&gt;The standard PS5 ($499.99) and the Digital Edition ($399.99) are nearly identical, aside from the obvious. The standard console features a UHD Blu-ray disc drive whereas the latter does not, meaning you’ll need to download or stream anything you want to watch or play. The Digital Edition also features a slimmer, lighter build because of this, however, keep in that the size difference is slight. Both consoles also sport an 825GB SSD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0F29IF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10384391"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="7hBTYW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9563999"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8zFuNf"&gt;If you do manage to purchase a PS5, there are a few games and additional &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550907/ps5-wireless-controller-ssd-hard-drive-accessories-sony"&gt;accessories we suggest you pick up&lt;/a&gt;, including &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1736382577329371434" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Sony’s Pulse 3D Headset&lt;/a&gt;, the forthcoming &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B094WL86N5/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;midnight black DualSense controller&lt;/a&gt;, and the best PS5 exclusive released thus far: &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Returnal-PlayStation-5/dp/B08QFPS48J/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Returnal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="AasZjK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10499033" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="JTGN3h"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10510093" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="nefQI6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10420564" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QXm507"&gt;In addition to the accessories above, we also recommend buying an &lt;a href="https://www.awin1.com/cread.php?awinmid=20387&amp;amp;awinaffid=173843&amp;amp;clickref=VergePlayStationDeal020121&amp;amp;ued=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.eneba.com%2Fus%2Fpsn-playstation-network-card-psn-365-days-usa-psn-key-united-states" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;annual membership to PlayStation Plus&lt;/a&gt;. Doing so gives you access to online multiplayer, a selection of free monthly titles, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21440388/playstation-plus-collection-ps5-ps4-games-titles" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PlayStation Plus Collection&lt;/a&gt;, which allows you to play a host of PlayStation 4 classics on your PS5 at no additional cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="N4rM16"&gt;During a normal week, Leiti Hsu dedicates at least one night to hosting her Dream Dinner Party. She hops on Clubhouse to interview guests, describing the food and atmosphere of her fictitious party as a gateway into deep, emotional conversations. Wagyu steak sizzles in front of you, she calls out, a massage table and masseuse sit on call for anyone who wants to take some time away from the (imaginary) table, she reminds you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WAAudB"&gt;But last week, Hsu showed us what her Clubhouse room looks like when brought into the real world. Packed inside a New York City apartment, Hsu has brought in an actual masseuse, Tony Qin, to rub people down. A chef stands behind an island prepping “roving omakase,” like octopus salad and spicy tuna onigiri, along with various a la minute dishes. Tom Shpetner, aka Tom the Somm, aka the night’s sommelier, walks around pouring drinks. This party’s his first time back working the room, schmoozing with guests, and gushing about wine since the pandemic shut everything down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xMoNsM"&gt;Lisa Ann Markuson, a poet at Ars Poetica, is also available to write poetry on-demand, typed on a typewriter, for guests. “Poems on a cloud,” Markuson says, as she sits on a white fluffy cushion. She writes me a post-pandemic poem about coming out the other end of it: “nourished, healed, no need to hide.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lfLZtPl2d2YH7MSxe7iN-hA1jvE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22663110/akrales_20210607_4616_0046.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Host Leiti Hsu welcomed guests into the apartment and encouraged them to, instead of their names, write down their go-to, after-school snack.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9PWr-ZgV7j27D0n5LGRV6dnJr94=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22663118/akrales_20210607_4616_0294.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Although the event wasn’t broadcast on Clubhouse, partygoers still captured moments they could share online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1mY9_nIbQOAVEHNDN_Yq0Svx4Fc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22665138/akrales_20210607_4616_0253.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xvOxPa"&gt;This event could represent Clubhouse’s worst-case scenario: why would anyone tune in to an app when they could join in person and eat eggplant katsu with a bunch of cool, creative people? There’s already speculation that fewer users are logging in to Clubhouse regularly, and multiple people at the party tell me this is true — they’ve seen their room numbers drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x6vjzO"&gt;The app’s future seems to be on everyone’s mind. Without prompting, one person launches into a defense of Clubhouse without me ever even asking about its problems. Another person tells me that “navel-gazing” about the platform’s future and how it’s doing is a “boring question,” which, interpret that as you will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2vm19"&gt;Hsu isn’t the first creator to make her Clubhouse rooms happen in person. Nicole Behnam of the Beyond club has hosted events in person in Los Angeles, while the Lullaby Club, a club with more than 45,000 followers, hosted its first in-person event in New York City in June. (Axel Mansoor, formerly the Clubhouse app icon and founder of the Lullaby Club is even in attendance at this party.) All these events clearly owe their attention and existence to Clubhouse, but the move to in person suggests a shift of sorts, away from the digital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QjPBMa"&gt;Whether the actual app numbers are waning or not, though, everyone here loves Clubhouse, if only for a chance to meet and get to know new people. The party comes off more like a reunion. The attendees had clearly already chatted, sang together, and shared their secrets on the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ah5acp"&gt;“It was just like, ‘Yep, I know who you are. You’re that same, silly person that I saw online,’” says an attendee. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E3wjhC"&gt;The broader group tends to attribute this comfort to having heard each other’s voices first. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6JKXP7"&gt;“If I met you on Clubhouse, and we had a heart-to-heart, or even if you heard me and I heard you, I’d remember your voice,” Kunal Sood, a Clubhouse creator with more than 35,000 followers tells me. “I feel like that’s what the app does, it gives you a feeling of wanting to be intimately connected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZbjqnUFSEbXe889q9ruqN2-q8Sw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22663114/akrales_20210607_4616_0115.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Guests embraced often, making the event feel more like a reunion than a gathering of people meeting for the first time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FswBZvPwGIcVYTuQWOXvaq-6Kcg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22665111/akrales_20210607_4616_0139.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/S9RxPeDskXPaJmd7ixwFkI0Gb08=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22663112/akrales_20210607_4616_0097.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Masseuse Tony Qin offered massages to party guests along with a blanket to cover up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nW5Thr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASB1AQ"&gt;And now they could actually, physically connect. Most of the attendees seem to consider themselves &lt;em&gt;huggers&lt;/em&gt;, often going in for a hug, even with me, instead of a handshake. Everyone is constantly embracing and touching each other, putting their arms around one another’s shoulders, resting their heads on others’ shoulders. Contact all the time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Udmcd7"&gt;“I don’t like shaking hands now,” one attendee and Clubhouse user tells me. “I’ve been hugging people instead now.” “We’re all so touchy-feely,” another person says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4l9InM"&gt;Instead of name tags, guests write their after-school snack of choice down on a sticker. Mine — mac and cheese — became my identifier and also my “safe word,” Hsu says, though I’m still not entirely clear where or when I’m supposed to use it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7dsjB"&gt;Hsu reminds us of this rule after three hours of partying when everyone is instructed to take a seat on the floor around the DJ booth and some microphones. Guests sing, thanks to the presence of the Lullaby Club, and Hsu auctions off a coffee date with the Knicks’ physical therapist, who is at the party, as well as the founder of the period activist group Period.org. The date sells for $400, which Hsu says she’ll donate, along with ticket proceeds from the event, to the nonprofit Food for Soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xS078h"&gt;But controlling an in-person crowd isn’t as easy as wrangling a group on the app. Hsu attempts to quiet everyone down, as do multiple party guests who take the mic, but they can’t stop everyone from talking and eating in their small groups. It’s a party, and there’s no mute button IRL. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3UP9N"&gt;Hosting in an apartment comes with its own complications, too. Hsu needed to find a physical space, food to dish out, and, broadly, be an attentive party host who wants people to enjoy their time while also not forcing them to quiet down and stop talking, which likely won’t go over in a room of talkers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="n1Ir1w"&gt;“What I have been astonished by is just speaking things into existence, and on Clubhouse, you can do it to like hundreds or thousands of people,” Hsu says. “In real life, it takes a little bit of a different kind of effort to get 50 people in a room, but no matter what, it’s always speaking things into existence and [getting] the right people here, and their magic unfolds.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="egYgLg"&gt;Strangely, I consistently get the sense that these people — big Clubhouse users who are used to talking for hours on end — are panicking about what they say to me during this event, even though it’s never incriminating or even all that spicy. Someone tells me the app “changed their life.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pWJR5wVTGojlpzm4Ems7CSNB_1s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22663109/akrales_20210607_4616_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lisa Ann Markuson of Ars Poetica sits on a “cloud,” aka a very soft, feathery pillow to type poems on-demand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zNEOwe"&gt;Two Clubhouse creators, who seemingly pride themselves on honest, real, authentic conversation, worried after the event that I might quote them or actually print what they said, which suggested to me that they perhaps feel safer on the app, where conversations disappear, people aren’t supposed to record, and they control the space, despite much of this being true of the real world, too. Still, at this party, what you say might be remembered, repeated, or, if you’re standing in the presence of a journalist, written down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ig7yFo"&gt;They’re intensely loyal to the platform, though, with only some willing to admit to seeing cracks in Clubhouse’s buzzy facade. One person proudly tells me they haven’t logged in to Clubhouse in four months, but they believe if the app can make it through 2021, it’ll be here to stay. Another tells me multiple other platforms have reached out about signing exclusive deals, although they’re loyal to Clubhouse for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IyOLsQ"&gt;The following day, two creators message me to point out that Clubhouse numbers are popping off, and sure enough, they are. Rooms are reaching thousands of listeners, a rarity recently. The numbers recalibrate to the usual, lower reach the next day, but none of these people who’ve seen the numbers drop, or have even cut back on their time, seem worried. Clubhouse gave them a platform and place to connect with people. It’s not going anywhere for them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Qj3Oob"&gt;As I listen to the live auction, I decide to head over to the massage table. Lying face down, I listen to guests name who they’d want at their dream dinner party, like Glenn Close, Issa Rae, and someone’s grandpa. I slightly drift off with the sound of the partygoers chatting in the background, similar to how I have in the app itself. But when my massage ends, and I realize it’s already nearly 11PM with a subway ride ahead of me, I can’t just close the app and immediately fall asleep. I instead make the rounds, saying goodbye to people I met, exchanging info and phone numbers. Maybe we’d meet up for drinks sometime soon, we say. But more likely, I’d catch them on the app, maybe raise my hand as a little hello, and then log off and go back to the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="thsCPu"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N3AT9F"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Peter Jackson-directed documentary about The Beatles will debut on Disney Plus in November</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KvmBV3EUogzyaBsdcfsCBK32Yhg=/0x9:1192x804/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69467398/beatles.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UocEGvQ10OE&amp;amp;ab_channel=TheBeatles" target="_blank"&gt;The Beatles/Peter Jackson&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HxXHdq"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Beatles: Get Back&lt;/em&gt;, a documentary about the iconic band directed by Peter Jackson, &lt;a href="https://www.thebeatles.com/news/%E2%80%9C-beatles-get-back%E2%80%9D-disney-original-documentary-series-directed-peter-jackson-debut-exclusively"&gt;will debut as a three-part series&lt;/a&gt; on Disney Plus over the Thanksgiving holiday later this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3cQiqN"&gt;Jackson spent three years restoring and editing some 60 hours of footage shot in January 1969 by &lt;a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0512327/bio"&gt;Michael Lindsay-Hogg&lt;/a&gt; that hasn’t been seen before, and more than 150 hours of previously unheard audio. It captures John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr preparing for their first live show in more than two years, writing and rehearsing 14 new songs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H187vp"&gt;The documentary also includes the band’s famous rooftop concert on Savile Row in London— you’ve probably &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F346026991&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F6%2F17%2F22538527%2Fbeatles-documentary-peter-jackson-directed-disney-plus-november" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;seen parts of it&lt;/a&gt; — a show that ended up being The Beatles’ final public performance. The film also includes songs that later were released on &lt;em&gt;Abbey Road&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Let It Be&lt;/em&gt;, two of the band’s final albums.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MurSHH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UocEGvQ10OE?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UOlKhq"&gt;Jackson, perhaps best known as the director of the &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; trilogy, said the documentary wasn’t merely nostalgia, “it’s raw, honest, and human,” he said in a statement. “Over six hours, you’ll get to know The Beatles with an intimacy that you never thought possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j42i6O"&gt;The project has the full support of the two living Beatles McCartney and Starr, Lennon’s widow Yoko Ono and Harrison’s widow Olivia. &lt;em&gt;Get Back &lt;/em&gt;was originally scheduled for a September 2020 release, then bumped to September 2021 before finally being scheduled for Disney Plus this Thanksgiving. It will be shown in three two-hour segments on November 25th through 27th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aivHXI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s Halo body fat percentage calculator outperforms lab devices  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Halo’s body scanning feature, which calculates body fat percentage." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Hp2INOzSvHif8YuZCJPXw6Ttu9k=/1x0:2500x1666/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69467324/Halo_App_Body_Feature.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Amazon&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aPXzKy"&gt;Amazon’s body fat percentage scanner performs better than other, more cumbersome methods of calculating body fat, a &lt;a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.10.21258595v1.full.pdf"&gt;new study showed&lt;/a&gt;. A body scan is one feature on the Amazon Halo Band subscription service, which the company announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/27/21402493/amazon-halo-band-health-fitness-body-scan-tone-emotion-activity-sleep"&gt;last August&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B4UnPx"&gt;The Halo Body feature works through smartphone cameras. Users take four photos of their bodies, which are then combined into a 3D image. Then, Amazon’s tool uses machine learning to calculate the user’s body fat percentage. When Amazon launched Halo, the company said it did an internal study to validate the feature. Now, they’ve released a study — which was funded by Amazon, but conducted with leading experts in the field — showing that the tool works well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeVa0P"&gt;The results show that the tool could be a benchmark for people looking to get more information about their bodies, says Diana Thomas, a mathematician who studies body weight regulation at West Point and was not involved in the study. She wouldn’t use it for scientific research, but it could give users another data point. “It gives you more information,” she says. “If you have a high percent body fat flagged by this, it could be a red flag for you.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdIOhT"&gt;Body fat percentage can be a more accurate way to assess someone’s health than their weight. Two people at the same size could have different amounts of fat relative to their overall weight and would have different health risks as a result. Having some body fat is important, but having a high percentage is associated with &lt;a href="https://www.insider.com/healthy-body-fat-percentage"&gt;health problems&lt;/a&gt; like heart conditions and diabetes. The percentage of body fat considered healthy &lt;a href="https://www.vumc.org/health-wellness/news-resource-articles/body-fat-percentage"&gt;varies&lt;/a&gt; for people of different ages and sexes. Women, for example, have more body fat than men.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RhvrKR"&gt;The study used data collected at two sites: Massachusetts General Hospital and Pennington Biomedical Research Center at Louisiana State University. It had 134 participants of varying body types and included 82 women and 52 men. Of the group, 81 were Caucasian, 32 were Black, nine were Asian, four were Hispanic, one was American Indian, and seven were multiracial. It’s a small number of people, but that’s typical with this type of research, which has to run people through expensive and unwieldy tests, Thomas says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b4MPuG"&gt;Each person in the study had their body fat percentage calculated through an X-ray technique that shows fat distribution through the body called dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which is the gold standard. The results from those scans were compared to the Amazon system, five scales that calculate body fat (two professional and three consumer), and something called air displacement plethysmography — which uses a pod-shaped device that measures how someone’s body displaces the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RWtxJq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This showed [Halo Body] is more accurate than the burdensome thing”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="neStJB"&gt;The study found that the body fat percentages calculated by Amazon Halo Body were closest to those calculated by DXA. It performed better than the air displacement plethysmography device, which is often used to calculate body fat by people studying weight and body composition, but is cumbersome and tricky to conduct correctly. The pods are expensive, have to be housed in a lab, and require people to wear swim caps and tight-fighting clothing. “This showed [Halo Body] is more accurate than the burdensome thing,” Thomas says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pgze6F"&gt;The accuracy held for people of different ages, ethnic backgrounds, and body types. “It makes those same kinds of accuracy measurements for people across the spectrum from lean to obese,” says Steven Heymsfield, a body composition expert at Pennington Biomedical Research Center who worked on the study. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KbMct8"&gt;Notably, in the study Halo Body got closer to the DXA’s body fat calculations than the body mass index, or BMI. BMI is often used as a first, crude estimate of someone’s body fat, and it’s calculated based on height and weight. But often, people who are muscular (and weigh more) can have a BMI that says they’re overweight — even if most of that mass is muscle. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U3J7l1"&gt;BMI is cheap and easy, so it’s appealing as a first look at someone’s body mass and in situations where expensive equipment, like the pod, might not be available. “BMI is still used as the red flag,” Thomas says. But if the Halo Body — which is also easy and cheaper than the lab equipment — is better than BMI, it could be a strong additional resource, she says. “It gives you more accuracy than the crude things we’ve been using.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c4bd2N"&gt;There are other devices on the market that also calculate body fat percentage based on images. Heymsfield says he has some in his lab, which range from $4,000 to $20,000. The Halo Band is $99.99 and the subscription for its services is $3.99 per month. This study did not compare Halo Body to those tools. Heymsfield says, though, that based on his experience, it looks like Halo Body could work as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jdpoEQ"&gt;Technology like the Halo Body is shaking up the field of body composition research, after years of reliance on expensive devices, Heymsfield says. “The question now is, can we use this for research and clinical purposes, not just for the consumer out of curiosity. Can we use this as a real medical device to get body shape and size, so that people can use it to make clinical decisions?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="doLawn"&gt;It’ll take more validation studies to get to that point. Heymsfield says he’d want to see data on how accurately the Halo Body can estimate waist and hip circumference, for example. Thomas says additional studies should include people with different body types (like athletes).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="20JexO"&gt;Testing the tool on more people and people with different body types will also be important for consumer use to make sure everyone is getting information with the same accuracy, Thomas says. But one of the best ways to get that information will be to see what happens when people start to use it in the real world. Then, experts will be able to see what kinds of information people are getting from the tool and if they’re making any changes as a result, she says. “At the end of the day, how do you change public health? It’s not the lab rats, it’s actually the people that are using these tools.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The smart home gym that analyzes your moves will soon have Olympian trainers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xulQrV9X_6Of3fCaScK1QWBtD4I=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69466818/04_Tempo_Garage.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xqs1js"&gt;Tempo, the company behind the piece of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21154185/tempo-smart-home-gym-kinect-computer-vision-ai-form-correction"&gt;exercise equipment that uses Microsoft Kinect&lt;/a&gt; to check your form, is announcing that it’ll have Olympians teach classes on its connected device. The classes are being made as part of an event that’s called the Tempo Games challenge, which will involve participating in workouts led by seven Olympic athletes that will be headed to Tokyo this year — you can see Tempo’s list below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="x8GBY8"&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/carlinisles/?hl=en"&gt;Carlin Isles&lt;/a&gt;: Carlin Isles is a champion track and field athlete and the world’s fastest rugby player, holding several records at his alma mater, Ashland University. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5JwFC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/jessicatatianalong/?hl=en"&gt;Jessica Long&lt;/a&gt;: Jessica Long is one of the world’s most decorated swimmers with over 50 cumulative medals. She was also amongst the youngest competitors for the U.S. when she made her international debut at the 2004 Athens Games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfrGyT"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/johnnyhooper/?hl=en"&gt;Johnny Hooper&lt;/a&gt;: A four-time All-American water polo player, Johnny Hooper was instrumental in leading his team to a NCAA championship. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xIuHPc"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/kyra_condie/"&gt;Kyra Condie&lt;/a&gt;: Climbing since she was 11 years old and overcoming idiopathic scoliosis, Kyra Condie was a Bouldering World Cup finalist in addition to a regular in the pro climbing competitions around the U.S. and is bound for Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPQg3T"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/leticiabufoni/"&gt;Letícia Bufoni&lt;/a&gt;: Letícia Bufoni has been skating since she was 9-years-old and is a multi-X Games gold medalist. Letícia is a member of Brazil’s first-ever national skateboarding team and will be among the first to compete in skateboarding in Tokyo on behalf of the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0fz87"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/aka_mcfierce/?hl=en"&gt;Paige McPherson&lt;/a&gt;: Paige Arielle “McFierce” McPherson is a 2012 Olympic bronze medalist, Pan Am Games Champ and Grand Prix Champ. She will be competing in the Tokyo Games and will be the first U.S. female athlete to compete in three Games for TaeKwonDo. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b1vSwy"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/willclaye/?hl=en"&gt;Will Claye&lt;/a&gt;: A three time Olympic medalist, Will Claye earned the bronze medal in the long jump and a silver medal in the triple jump, making him the first man since 1936 and the first American since 1904 to medal in both events. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sJhnUlzz2z2pfXRpLXi9Yvk7BDQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19747784/08_Tempo_Feedback.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tempo Studio can give you feedback on how well you’re performing a given move.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gdqzWJ"&gt;The Tempo Studio, which is the device users will access the classes from, is a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/26/21154185/tempo-smart-home-gym-kinect-computer-vision-ai-form-correction"&gt;wardrobe-like piece of home gym equipment&lt;/a&gt; that includes a 42-inch touchscreen, weights, and Microsoft Kinect tech that tracks your movement to ensure that you’re doing workout moves correctly. When one of our writers used the Tempo Studio, it also provided an exercise summary with feedback on how to improve your next workout. The classes, including the upcoming Tempo Games ones, are delivered as part of Tempo’s $39-a-month subscription service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n24NZo"&gt;Tempo says that the classes are “inspired” by the athletes’ own training routines, and that they aim to train both your body and your mind. The classes will cover categories like HIIT, strength training, and more, and the Tempo Games challenge will involve completing 14 of them in three weeks, starting June 21st — those who do will get a limited-edition shirt, according to Tempo’s press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZnCbbp"&gt;The Tokyo Olympics were meant to take place in 2020, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21174606/summer-olympics-2020-postponed-coronavirus-delay-date"&gt;were postponed&lt;/a&gt; until July 23rd, 2021 due to COVID-19. Since then, both the International Olympics Committee and companies have worked to find some way to introduce a virtual element to the games. The IOC has announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/2/22464255/olympic-virtual-series-esports-most-popular-games"&gt;an official Olympics virtual series&lt;/a&gt;, which includes classic sports like baseball and cycling, as well as a tournament that will be held in the video game &lt;em&gt;Gran Turismo Sport&lt;/em&gt;, and connected fitness company Peloton has &lt;a href="https://blog.onepeloton.com/champions-collection/"&gt;its Champions series&lt;/a&gt; of classes led by athletes like Usain Bolt and Scout Bassett.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram Reels now has ads</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MVXV5V4TJam7gPLkRUCD8BbeyVY=/0x0:1812x1208/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69466809/reels_ads.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZwjPTD"&gt;Get ready to start seeing ads in Instagram Reels. The app’s video feed / TikTok clone will start including ads today across the globe. They’ll look just like any other Reel — full-screen, looping, up to 30 seconds long — and will appear in between other clips. Ads will be identified by a small “sponsored” tag below the name of the advertiser’s account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ou1F9l"&gt;Instagram &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22396841/instagram-reels-ads-stickers-video-facebook"&gt;started testing ads&lt;/a&gt; in Australia, Brazil, Germany, and India in April. There’s nothing particularly surprising about more ads making their way into the app, other than the pace with which Instagram has moved to turn this new format into a revenue generator. Facebook also said this week that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22535511/facebook-ads-oculus-quest-vr-apps"&gt;it would bring ads to Oculus Quest apps&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3QRgJ8"&gt;Reels only launched in August 2020, and the company has yet to share specifics on how the new format has actually been performing. In January, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/19/22238513/instagram-adam-mosseri-reels-decoder-interview-podcast"&gt;Instagram leader Adam Mosseri told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that the format is growing but that the company is “not yet happy with it.” The feature is currently available in “more than 80 countries,” an Instagram spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UzupTZ"&gt;Meanwhile, TikTok has such a huge audience and its ads have been so successful that the company plans to charge up to $2 million for a one-day takeover, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/tiktok-is-jacking-up-prices-as-it-builds-its-ad-business"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But while TikTok’s influence continues to grow (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/10/22528534/tiktok-biden-wechat-executive-order-trump-ban-commerce"&gt;and its legal threat&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/9/22525953/biden-tiktok-wechat-trump-bans-revoked-alipay"&gt;continues to be postponed&lt;/a&gt;), Instagram still retains the huge advantages of having Facebook’s support behind it and being able to tap into an already massive app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pokémon Unite will launch first on Nintendo Switch in July</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gYafg7bSO3pT3ZxUlJNXiCJ9w5Y=/0x0:1329x886/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69466685/unitenew.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3984Wl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21301541/pokemon-unite-team-game-strategy-tencent-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the team-based, five vs. five strategy game co-developed with Tencent’s TiMi Studio Group, now has a release window — and it’s soon. It’s coming first to Nintendo Switch in July 2021, followed by a release on mobile devices in September. Presumably, it’ll be released on both iOS and Android, but specific platforms weren’t confirmed today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B10MAj"&gt;In case you can’t decide which platform you want to play the game on, don’t fret too much, as &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; will support cross-play between Nintendo’s console and mobile devices. &lt;a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/NEW-INFORMATION-REVEALED-FOR-Pokemon-UNITE"&gt;The Pokémon Company announced&lt;/a&gt; that the game will also support cross-progression, which can be enabled by signing in with either your Pokémon Trainer Club account or Nintendo Account on the devices that you want to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SFCoJW"&gt;The game will be free to start, with optional in-game purchases available, including the paid “Aeos gems” currency. You’ll get Aeos coins and tickets just from playing the game, which can unlock cosmetics and other items. There will be season battle passes that you can level up over time to earn in-game rewards. Those paid Aeos gems I mentioned earlier will let you pay to get rewards in the battle pass if you don’t want to put the time in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3nynjC"&gt;Like my colleague Andrew Webster &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21302958/pokemon-unite-esports-competitive-gaming-league-of-legends"&gt;said last year when the game was announced&lt;/a&gt;, a strategy-laced &lt;em&gt;Pokémon&lt;/em&gt; game might seem like a strange combination, and it’s splashing onto the scene years after MOBAs like &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; exploded in popularity. Yet, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon Unite&lt;/em&gt; has a familiar cast of characters, and that might be enough to open the genre up to a new wave of fans.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Performing Hamlet in GTA Online is simply the best theater experience lockdown can offer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ed_00CdnQ4lsDpX84zQS6zEP2PI=/168x0:1517x899/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69466635/Screen_Shot_2021_06_17_at_3.10.56_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="uV15rc"&gt;Plenty of actors can, I’m sure, cite plays they were in where the audience was bored, listless, or simply nonexistent. But few have had to contend with the challenges presented by performing in a public lobby in &lt;em&gt;GTA Online. &lt;/em&gt;That’s a shame, frankly, because it’s hilarious. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyjHxg"&gt;A YouTuber by the name of &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUCmwCCmU6D0tSYijfIpg8A"&gt;Rustic Mascara&lt;/a&gt; has been testing the limits of this bold new performance space, and, though I can’t explain exactly why, I find it amazing to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vWRT1T"&gt;In one video (above), he performs a speech from Act II Scene ii, in which Hamlet explains to his friends Rosencrantz and Guildenstern why exactly he is so very, very sad. In Rustic’s performance, this is prefaced by requests to nearby players that they please not kill him.  He gets as far as lamenting that the Earth itself “appears no other thing to me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors” before being blown up by a rocket. He then respawns and continues with the extremely apt next line “What a piece of work is a man” before being killed again, moments later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LaypDX"&gt;Honestly, this is Shakespeare as Shakespeare himself would have wanted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h21KZm"&gt;Another video (below) shows Rustic and a friend performing the play’s opening scene in &lt;em&gt;GTA Online&lt;/em&gt;’s own Vinewood Bowl. Again, things don’t exactly go smoothly, but there’s something incredible about watching the two characters (a pair of guards on night watch) reassure one another that they’ve heard “not a mouse stirring” as the sound of sirens and gunshots fill the air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KUwfJH"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/54sCXRvP3Y0?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer *; clipboard-write *; encrypted-media *; gyroscope *; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cTG6iV"&gt;That’s all we’ve really got from Rustic so far (there’s two other videos on his channel, but they’re not as good), though I hope his future attempts gather more support. &lt;em&gt;GTA Online &lt;/em&gt;has entertained players with heists and races, but what about incentivizing players to form roving theater troupes, each attempting to perform the classics while fending off rival gangs of gun-wielding actors? After all, a little bit of culture never hurt anybody. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ring reportedly used LA cops as influencers to market its cameras</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7UdHYb9JqE6X2SwDOk5gmjn2H6g=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69466516/dseifert170808_1901_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A Ring doorbell equipped with a camera | Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TK6EXl"&gt;Amazon-owned Ring used Los Angeles police officers as brand ambassadors for its security cameras, providing free products and discount codes in exchange for recommendations, the &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/technology/story/2021-06-17/ring-influencer-marketing-los-angeles-police-department"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt;. Ring gave at least 100 LAPD officers free devices, which helped the department create a network of surveillance cameras, making it easier to obtain video footage, according to the &lt;em&gt;LA Times.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5hZIGc"&gt;Ring ended Pillar, its police officer ambassador program in 2019, and a spokesperson said in an email to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; on Friday that “the practices and programs in question do not reflect Ring today. We stopped donating to law enforcement and encouraging police to promote our products years ago.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rG8Sx"&gt;The LAPD did not immediately reply to a request for comment, but a departmental review found that participating officers didn’t appear to have violated LAPD rules, according to the &lt;em&gt;LA Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sBi9QJ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/2/27/17059664/amazon-ring-acquisition-smart-home-security-cloud-cam"&gt;Amazon acquired Ring in 2018&lt;/a&gt; and has tried to establish that its home security cameras &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/9/17953050/ring-ceo-jamie-siminoff-interview-smart-video-doorbell-security-police"&gt;can help reduce neighborhood crime&lt;/a&gt;. But according to a February 2020 &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/all/cute-videos-little-evidence-police-say-amazon-ring-isn-t-n1136026"&gt;NBC News investigation&lt;/a&gt;, many law enforcement agencies can’t actually attribute any crimes to being solved due to the assistance of a Ring camera. And of the arrests that were helped by Ring footage, many were for low-level nonviolent property crimes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ycB9of"&gt;But police departments can ask Ring customers to provide them with access to camera footage; a January report from the &lt;em&gt;Financial Times&lt;/em&gt; found that Ring &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/31/22258856/amazon-ring-partners-police-fire-security-privacy-cameras"&gt;partnered with more than 2,000 police and fire departments&lt;/a&gt; last year, reportedly requesting footage for around 22,000 total incidents. Most of the requests ask users to voluntarily submit video, but police can obtain footage directly through parent company Amazon with a search warrant or court order.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XjibH6"&gt;And last summer during anti-racism and police brutality protests, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22287287/los-angeles-police-department-ring-anti-racism-protest-video-surveillance-request"&gt;LAPD asked Ring customers to provide footage&lt;/a&gt; from their camera doorbells, according to emails obtained by the &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/02/lapd-requested-ring-footage-black-lives-matter-protests"&gt;Electronic Frontier Foundation&lt;/a&gt;. “During the recent protests, individuals were injured and property was looted, damaged, and destroyed,” the LAPD wrote in one request, and it was seeking the footage “to identify those responsible.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ckVuRw"&gt;Earlier this month, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/3/22465295/ring-public-agencies-request-for-assistance-feed-neighbors-app"&gt;Ring made changes&lt;/a&gt; to the way police and other public agencies can request video clips from camera owners in its Neighbors app. Agencies can no longer send individuals private requests for clips and can only request clips be sent to them via public posts viewable in the main feed of the Neighbors app. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/17/21141336/amazon-ring-cameras-spy-neighbors-police-nbc-news-intelligencer"&gt;Neighbors app is separate&lt;/a&gt; from the main Ring app and is more akin to local social networks like Nextdoor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PdANB8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update June 17th 10:23AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added comment from Ring spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo thinks the Switch is well-placed for post-pandemic life</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A1bJuQ9C7T8mqeK5RKH1daRPQBc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69466478/akrales_190820_3597_0355.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CdScAf"&gt;The Switch is nearly five years old and facing increased competition from new and powerful consoles from Sony and Microsoft. But despite all of this, Nintendo’s E3 2021 presentation this week was arguably the highlight of this year’s event — even if &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22456160/new-nintendo-switch-release-date-september-e3-announcement"&gt;the long-rumored Switch Pro&lt;/a&gt; failed to make an appearance. Nintendo showed off &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22533513/nintendo-switch-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-sequel-trailer-e3-2021-release-date-trailer"&gt;the much-anticipated sequel to &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22466240/nintendo-metroid-dread-side-scroller-e3-2021-switch"&gt;revealed that the mythical &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt; is launching later this year&lt;/a&gt;, and peppered in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535127/advance-wars-1-and-2-re-boot-camp-nintendo-direct-e3-2021"&gt;a handful&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535212/nintendo-the-legend-of-zelda-ii-links-awakening-game-watch-handheld-release-date"&gt;of other&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22535183/mario-party-superstars-warioware-nintendo-direct-e3"&gt;announcements&lt;/a&gt; to excite fans. As always, the company continued to exist in its own world, divorced from the technological rat race that typically defines these debates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrzPt0"&gt;In fact, the launch of the PS5 and Xbox Series X appears to have had very little impact on Nintendo, as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422451/nintendo-annual-earnings-switch-84-59-million"&gt;the Switch is selling as well as ever&lt;/a&gt;. Doug Bowser, president of Nintendo of America, believes the reason is simple: there’s still nothing else like the Switch on the market. While he notes that new console launches “bodes well for the industry,” Bowser tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the hybrid nature of the Switch means it still occupies “a unique position” that differentiates itself from more traditional consoles. And it’s a proposition that has proven to be surprisingly enduring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jgEoHP"&gt;As with most gaming companies, the past year has been both a challenge and an opportunity for Nintendo. With everyone stuck at home, many turned to games like &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing&lt;/em&gt; as a form of escape or social interaction. The pandemic meant that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215786/video-games-covid-19-animal-crossing-among-us"&gt;more people were playing games&lt;/a&gt;, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21325659/game-developers-survey-coronavirus-gdc"&gt;conversely that games were more challenging to develop&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kn6gn1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I think the teams have adapted very well.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="1A4Ytp"&gt;“We’ve seen video games really grow in terms of the number of people playing, and the amount of time that they’re playing overall,” Bowser says. “For us at Nintendo, our focus first and foremost has been keeping our employees safe, and ensuring that we’re providing safe environments for them to work within. And while there have been some challenges, what I can say is I think the teams have adapted very well, and it’s allowed us to be effective in the various environments where we may be working overall. I think the lineup that you’ve seen so far this calendar year bodes well.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Owe0L9"&gt;Outside of an increased appetite for games, he says that there have also been some changes in player behavior during the pandemic. For starters, there’s been a change in who is playing games on the Switch. “Demographics are changing,” Bowser says. That includes more casual players, as well as more women playing on the Switch. (Bowser previously noted a similar audience expansion &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20951926/nintendo-doug-bowser-interview-switch-lite-sales-3ds-support-consoles"&gt;when the Switch Lite launched in 2019&lt;/a&gt;.) Unsurprisingly, those new players are also spending a lot of time using online features. “&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; again fueled a lot of that,” says Bowser. “But it’s carried through and, for instance, even more recently &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; has been the source of a lot of online play overall for us.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YYAU1v"&gt;He also adds that, despite its absence from the company’s E3 presentation, &lt;em&gt;New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; remains a big part of Nintendo’s future. “While we didn’t talk about it [during the E3 Nintendo Direct], we absolutely have plans going forward to ensure the 33 million people who have islands out there have new and fun activities to engage with,” Bowser says. “Look for more to come.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HejZBH"&gt;Looking ahead, it’s likely those behaviors will shift again, as various places open up and stay-at-home restrictions are lifted. Bowser believes this will be yet another advantage for Nintendo. “I think that’s going to be really important as we emerge from this pandemic, and people are looking to engage in other activities, hopefully travel, vacations, etc.,” he says. “Nintendo Switch is one of those devices that they can take with them as they embark on various travels. The positioning we still think is incredibly relevant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EqHUM6"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxZ4Mr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
