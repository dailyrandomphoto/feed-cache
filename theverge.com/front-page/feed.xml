    <title>New York City will reopen its movie theaters for the first time in nearly a year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/x6s4kHcYHIVzyWRfJPYD4MYLwck=/290x0:1310x680/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68857549/cc34ecb078c29957ad70d987b6b38121.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Marvel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pvATSs"&gt;New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo will allow movie theaters in New York City to open with a limited audience capacity for the first time in nearly a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mc8UOv"&gt;As part of the restrictions, theaters will only allow a maximum of 50 people to sit in any one screening (restricting capacity to 25 percent). Attendees must wear masks and sit in their assigned seats. The theaters will also have to implement advanced air filtration systems, according to Cuomo. While theaters outside of New York City have been allowed to reopen over the last few months, high case numbers in the city have prevented people from going. Theaters originally shut down because of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/16/21182499/regal-cinemas-close-all-us-theaters-march-17th-coronavirus"&gt;pandemic in mid-March 2020&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iNRxLB"&gt;Allowing New York City theaters to open is a big deal, especially for studios like Disney and Universal, whose executives are likely worried about timing for upcoming big releases like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21437889/black-widow-delayed-release-date-marvel-cinematic-universe-disney-streaming-mulan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;(May 7th)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/12/21176895/fast-and-furious-f9-delay-universal-coronavirus-vin-diesel"&gt;&lt;em&gt;F9 &lt;/em&gt;(May 28th)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;Ticket prices are much higher in key markets like New York City and Los Angeles (where theaters are still unable to open). Plus, New York and California make up 21.5 percent of &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/07/blockbusters-return-until-new-york-and-california-reopen.html"&gt;all US filmgoing audiences&lt;/a&gt;. Not having those theaters open, even in a limited capacity and with higher ticket revenue, is catastrophic for movies that could potentially make $1 billion in pre-pandemic days. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u8Zue8"&gt;While industry insiders speculated that Disney could move &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;to Disney Plus as a Premier Access title and then release the film internationally where theater attendance is better, it was also increasingly apparent Marvel Studios didn’t want to go that route. &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;is a $200 million-plus budget movie; moving it to Disney Plus, even as a $30 Premier Access title, would never generate the same initial revenue it could earn at a theater pre-pandemic. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YMZWKy"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The alternative is a situation US audiences saw with ‘Wonder Woman 1984’&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tfnRmo"&gt;Without New York City or Los Angeles, Disney likely would have delayed the film again. But with New York City theaters reopening, even at just quarter capacity, it likely gives studio executives hope that Los Angeles could follow in the coming weeks, and there may be a better shot at a decent release for &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;(well, by pandemic standards). Add in a rebounding movie theater business in key markets like China, one of Marvel Studios’ most important demographics, and &lt;em&gt;Black Widow &lt;/em&gt;could break even — potentially even earning a slight profit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R3nQvz"&gt;The alternative is a situation US audiences saw with &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984&lt;/em&gt;. With a production budget of $200 million and additional tens of millions in marketing budget, the film needed to generate at least a couple hundred million dollars to break even. That wasn’t going to happen in December 2020 with New York City and Los Angeles theaters closed, as well as restricted capacity at theaters in other states. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LIufW4"&gt;Warner Bros. decided to move the film to a simultaneous release, premiering it in theaters and on HBO Max in the United States on the same day. By the end of January, AT&amp;amp;T (Warner Bros.’ parent company) executives told analysts that &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman 1984 &lt;/em&gt;pushed a swath of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22215274/wonder-woman-1984-hamilton-hbo-max-disney-plus-numbers-streaming-success"&gt;new subscribers to HBO Max&lt;/a&gt;, boosting numbers to 17.2 million accumulated activations, more than double the number of activations in AT&amp;amp;T’s previous quarter (8.6 million). The film  &lt;a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl3624109569/weekend/"&gt;ended up making $159.9 million&lt;/a&gt;, with roughly 73 percent of that total coming from outside the US. To compare, the first &lt;em&gt;Wonder Woman &lt;/em&gt;film &lt;a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl578455041/"&gt;earned $821 million worldwide&lt;/a&gt; with roughly 50 percent coming from the US alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5BZAwR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Studio executives and theater owners can’t predict if people will actually show up to theaters right now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="q1BtrV"&gt;It’s also a big win for theater owners, whose executives have asked Cuomo and California Gov. Gavin Newsom to open theaters in New York City and Los Angeles over the last couple of months. AMC CEO Adam Aron thanked Cuomo when theaters in New York state were allowed to open back in October 2020, noting at the time that the company continued “to work closely with state and local authorities about the reopening of New York City, which we now hope with increasing confidence is not far away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixR2Jk"&gt;Still, studio executives and theater owners can’t predict if people will actually show up to theaters right now. As more vaccinations roll out across the country, people may feel safer about being in a theater with strangers while maintaining proper social distance. For others, however, it may be some time before they’re ready to watch a stranger six feet away toss popcorn in their mouth or sneeze. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dd0lmR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Epic Games will settle Fortnite loot box lawsuits in V-Bucks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xGE4HOIRS-xi3PTYGjwmPQaE0v8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68857482/acastro_20200818_1777_epicApple_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sprt44"&gt;Epic Games will give &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;players 1,000 V-Bucks if they ever purchased an in-game loot box, presented within the game as “loot llamas” containing randomized items, as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/fortnite-save-the-world-loot-llama-purchasers-to-receive-1000-v-bucks"&gt;proposed class action lawsuit settlement&lt;/a&gt; to be approved later this week. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Xjs3p"&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;’s massively popular battle royale mode has never contained randomized loot boxes, the game’s cooperative survival mode, “Save the World,” did — at least until 2019 when Epic &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/1/26/18198543/fortnite-save-the-world-upgrade-llamas-loot-boxes-x-ray"&gt;changed its loot box system&lt;/a&gt; to allow players to see the item inside prior to purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91UwyG"&gt;Now, anyone who purchased a randomized loot box prior to their discontinuation will have the 1,000 V-Bucks (roughly $8) deposited automatically into their accounts over the next two to three days. The decision is part of a broader move from Epic to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/28/18245574/fortnite-epic-games-sued-lawsuit-predatory-llama-loot-boxes"&gt;settle blind draw loot box lawsuits it’s faced over the last few years&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xjuWmJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We believe players should know upfront what they are paying for when they make in-game purchases. This is why today we only offer X-Ray Llamas that show you the contents before you purchase them in Save the World.&lt;/p&gt;— Fortnite (@FortniteGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1363954445919354884?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wN1taJ"&gt;In this case, the developer on Monday received confirmation from a judge of preliminary approval for its class action settlement in the Superior Court of North Carolina, which is why Epic says it will begin distributing the rewards today. The move is unusual, as class action lawsuit settlements typically require claimants to file claims to receive benefits. But Epic says it’s giving out benefits early because it feels its current position on loot boxes is the right one, and that its players are owed something for having bought randomized ones in the past. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZWyNb1"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Epic will deposit V-Bucks and Rocket League credits automatically &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vALV1T"&gt;“For one, it’s the right thing to do and we feel strongly about random item loot boxes. And two, we feel good about the settlement,” said Jeffrey Jacobson, a partner at the law firm Faegre Drinker representing Epic, tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;in an interview. “We hope our players agree with us.” A final approval hearing is scheduled for May, and lawyers representing both Epic and the plaintiffs expect the settlement to be approved as is. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W0mFSv"&gt;Epic says that while the settlement affects only US players, it’s deciding to award the 1,000 V-Bucks to all players of &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; globally, so long as they purchased at least one of its randomized loot llamas. The proposed settlement also includes &lt;em&gt;Rocket League &lt;/em&gt;players who purchased in-game items like event crates or keys to open loot boxes in the game, and affected players will be given 1,000 credits to be distributed automatically this week in similar fashion. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/1/18525842/epic-games-psyonix-acquisition-rocket-league-fortnite-unreal-deal"&gt;Epic acquired &lt;em&gt;Rocket League &lt;/em&gt;developer&lt;/a&gt; Psyonix in 2019. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aPA2oO"&gt;Epic says with regard to the scope of the US settlement, the V-Bucks benefit will go to 6.5 million players who bought a random item loot llama in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;and 2.9 million &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; players who purchased an event crate or a key that was used to open a crate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jGmRbz"&gt;“We stopped offering random item loot boxes like &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; Loot Llamas and &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt; Crates because we realized that some players were repeatedly disappointed by not receiving the random items they hoped for,” said Epic CEO Tim Sweeney in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;on Monday. “Players should know upfront what they are paying for when they make in-game purchases.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2s9zBQ"&gt;The proposed settlement also provides up to $26.4 million in additional cash and other benefits for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Rocket League &lt;/em&gt;players “to resolve claims arising from players’ loot box purchases,” in other words refunds on prior purchases that go beyond the standard settlement terms. This pool includes both sides’ attorney fees, according to Epic. But the preliminary settlement also includes a provision that would allow for players who think they were subject to legal harm as part of randomized loot box purchases to argue for money back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dnf3pE"&gt;This benefit pool is available to minors in California who used their own money, and not the money of a parent or guardian, to purchase Epic loot boxes, which qualifies them for benefits under the state’s &lt;a href="https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=df3d235d-b953-4dcb-8610-bcf7125042cb"&gt;contract disaffirmation law&lt;/a&gt;. It also includes any US &lt;em&gt;Fortnite &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Rocket League &lt;/em&gt;player who thinks they were subject to legal harm, such as fraud, by purchasing randomized loot boxes from Epic. In each case, a player can submit a claim to be investigated by a neutral administrator, with a potential refund award of up to $50 in refunds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QFGP21"&gt;For non-minors filing claims regarding legal harm, Epic will award either up to $50 or 13,500 V-Bucks (or 13,000 &lt;em&gt;Rocket League &lt;/em&gt;credits) depending on which benefit the claimant prefers, if the claim is approved. US residents who believe they’re entitled to these extra benefits can file claims at &lt;a href="http://www.epiclootboxsettlement.com/"&gt;www.epiclootboxsettlement.com&lt;/a&gt;, which Epic put live Monday afternoon. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8viZ4M"&gt;Epic stopped selling randomized loot boxes in 2019, replacing what were once “V-Buck Llamas’’ with “X-Ray Llamas” in &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; “Save the World”&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;game mode. At the time, these blind draw llamas ran users 50 V-Bucks (at the time around 50 cents) and contained a random assortment of skins, weapons, or other loot. Later that year, &lt;em&gt;Rocket League &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/6/20757479/rocket-league-loot-boxes-fortnite-psyonix-epic"&gt;removed loot boxes as well&lt;/a&gt;, months after Epic acquired its creator Psyonix. According to Jacobson, Epic’s lawyer, the class action settlement is “an exclamation point on a position we first announced two years ago.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="vmedP3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Players should know upfront what they are paying for when they make in-game purchases.” &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="YsgGjy"&gt;Loot boxes have come under &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18226852/loot-boxes-gaming-regulation-gambling-free-to-play"&gt;fire from lawmakers and regulators&lt;/a&gt; around the world who claim selling random chances at rare or coveted in-game items is akin to gambling. Especially concerning to critics of the practice is that many of the players engaging with loot box systems are children, sometimes using their own money but often with access to a parent or guardian’s credit card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dizpd2"&gt;Many of the biggest games of the last decade, including entries in Electronic Arts’ &lt;em&gt;FIFA &lt;/em&gt;franchise and Blizzard’s &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, sell blind draw loot boxes for real money, and the business practice has proved lucrative for game developers. In some cases, game companies make more money on in-game microtransactions, like loot boxes, than they do on selling games outright. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c50LAM"&gt;In 2018, Belgium ruled that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/25/17280440/belgium-video-game-loot-boxes-illegal-gambling"&gt;randomized loot boxes constituted illegal gambling&lt;/a&gt; and were subject to the country’s gaming law, forcing many prominent developers to either discontinue the practice in the country or alter how they allow players to buy and spend in-game currency at the risk of steep fines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sacFtC"&gt;Though the US has laws around online gambling, it does not consider loot boxes as such, meaning many games continue to offer them in the US. Bills have been introduced in Congress, such as Sen. Josh Hawley’s (R-MO) proposed Protecting Children from Abusive Games Act, but none have passed. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung’s recent Galaxy devices will now get at least four years of Android security updates</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Samsung Galaxy S21, S21 Plus, and S21 Ultra" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uYaknM4NkaaMJ9eCzqUh6Jsu1og=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68857474/cgartenberg_210111_4368_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Chaim Gartenberg / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IzZW6D"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-galaxy-security-extending-updates-knox/#_ftnref1"&gt;Samsung has announced&lt;/a&gt; that it’ll be extending the amount of time that its Galaxy smartphones and tablets will be getting security updates. Now, devices released from 2019 and onward will receove at least four years of &lt;a href="https://security.samsungmobile.com/workScope.smsb"&gt;security updates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GqBWTX"&gt;Previously, Samsung offered either monthly or quarterly security updates for at least the first two years of a device’s life span, the frequency of which is determined by the device itself. More premium phones like the Galaxy Note or Galaxy S lines get monthly updates, while budget-friendly models like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21315936/samsung-galaxy-a71-5g-uw-release-date-specs-price-verizon"&gt;2020’s Galaxy A71 5G&lt;/a&gt; get quarterly updates. Samsung also drops some of its higher-end devices down to quarterly updates after a certain point in time, like the Galaxy S8 lineup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qKFKTL"&gt;It’s important to note that Samsung is only promising four years of “regular security updates,” which is actually Samsung’s lowest tier of update frequency, reserved for devices that it still supports but without the promise of a monthly or quarterly cadence. Still, the new announcement does mean that Samsung is working to extend the usable life span of dozens of its devices, including some of its cheaper entry-level phones that might not ordinarily see that kind of long-term support. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yJojei"&gt;To put that commitment in perspective, Google itself only promises “at least three years” of security updates for &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpixel-phones"&gt;its Pixel phones&lt;/a&gt;. And there are far fewer models of Pixel hardware to support than the 40-plus phones and tablets for which Samsung is promising security updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NbUbFB"&gt;The other important caveat here is that Samsung is promising security updates for at least four years, not Android OS updates. Samsung &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21355777/samsung-android-os-update-promise-galaxy-phones-3-generations"&gt;&lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; guarantee support&lt;/a&gt; for at least three “generations” of Android OS updates in 2020, but only for some of its phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0NX9lt"&gt;Today’s news from Samsung is also not the same commitment that Google and Qualcomm &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22178833/google-qualcomm-snapdragon-888-faster-android-updates-four-years"&gt;made in December&lt;/a&gt; to ensure that phones with new Qualcomm chips will support both four Android OS updates and four years of security updates. While similar in overall goals, that announcement only applied to devices starting with this year’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21678359/qualcomm-snapdragon-888-processor-first-look-5g-performance-ai-photography"&gt;Snapdragon 888&lt;/a&gt; and on, whereas Samsung is retroactively making its commitment for devices as old as 2019. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="KbRXrn"&gt;&lt;a href="https://about.instagram.com/blog/announcements/how-were-supporting-people-affected-by-eating-disorders-and-negative-body-image"&gt;Instagram is announcing&lt;/a&gt; that it’s adding resources for people affected by eating disorders to its social platform. If users search for hashtags or content that’s potentially related to disordered eating, the company will guide that user to resources or help lines provided by the National Eating Disorders Association (or NEDA) in the US, as well as others in the UK, Australia, and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="2QgtSa"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10354938"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="eOFQUX"&gt;Instagram says that currently, it &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/instagram/188848648282410"&gt;tries to blur out potentially triggering content&lt;/a&gt; in search results, and it does direct people to generalized crisis support, but it should now direct users to resources specifically designed around eating disorders. In its blog, Instagram also says that it plans to show the resources if someone is trying to share eating disorder-related content, or “if a friend is concerned about something they see posted and wants to offer support.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lH8Es5"&gt;This update is similar &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22292166/tiktok-eating-disorder-support-resources-hashtags"&gt;to what TikTok announced earlier today&lt;/a&gt;. However, unlike TikTok, it doesn’t appear as if Instagram pointed to eating disorder-specific resources before, though they were shown in the general list of help lines. Currently, searching for content related to eating disorders will bring you to that general help line list, which not only includes NEDA but the National Alliance on Mental Illness, Veterans Crisis Line, and Trevor Project as well. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I5CDjDHA7KMBCb_LDdLkTbCG5sc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320938/IMG_0876.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Currently, the list doesn’t surface eating disorder help lines, even if that’s the type of content from which the user was directed to it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AOFLXa"&gt;However, Instagram’s screenshots imply that the support button will specifically point out the NEDA contacts to people, rather than just showing them the whole list of available help lines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O4WYZC"&gt;As part of its National Eating Disorders Awareness Week programing, the company also says it’s planning to work with community leaders to publish Reels that “encourage positive body image, push back against weight stigma and harmful stereotypes, and show that all bodies are worthy and deserve to be celebrated.” According to the post, this is the third time that Instagram has worked on content for NEDA week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4z3KWy"&gt;Instagram has &lt;a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47637377"&gt;had issues in the past&lt;/a&gt; trying to regulate eating disorder content, and the social network is often brought up in conversations about negative body image and perception, especially among young people. While the higher resource prioritization likely won’t do much to help with self-esteem issues after using the site, it should help people who are struggling and vulnerable get easier access to help from experts.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Watch new dramatic videos from NASA’s Perseverance rover landing on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/j_AMh9FDlcU6RtBJ9iNHlXYx5oo=/0x7:430x294/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856936/mars_landing_perseverence3.5.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ntv99t"&gt;NASA on Monday released a trove of video footage showing its Perseverance rover landing on Mars after plunging through the planet’s atmosphere, unveiling the most in-depth views of a Mars landing ever. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tVfSIB"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Your front-row seat to my Mars landing is here. Watch how we did it.&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CountdownToMars?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CountdownToMars&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Avv13dSVmQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Avv13dSVmQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA's Perseverance Mars Rover (@NASAPersevere) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAPersevere/status/1363929492138254340?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O8o8pR"&gt;Mission teams at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California got back 30 gigabytes of data and over 23,000 images of the vehicle descending down to the surface. The videos were among 4,500 images NASA planned to release on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LttMvd"&gt;Perseverance &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;entered Mars’ atmosphere&lt;/a&gt; last week bundled with a protective shell and a descent stage called the “Skycrane,” which fired rocket thrusters to slow its descent near the surface. The bundle sported four cameras to capture the landing sequence: one fixed on its protective backshell facing upward, one on the descent stage, and two on each side of the rover. Together, they captured some incredible views of the spacecraft’s descent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1HnAwP"&gt;“I can watch these videos for hours, and keep seeing new stuff every time,” Allen Chen, the mission’s entry, landing, and descent lead, said during a press conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mltrl"&gt;Imaging company FLIR provided the four cameras, and NASA made little to no modifications to them. “You can purchase the same camera off the internet,” Dave Gruel, lead engineer for Mars 2020’s EDL Camera system said at the press conference. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="rwH2F1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Now that you’ve seen Mars, hear it. Grab some headphones and listen to the first sounds captured by one of my microphones.  &lt;a href="https://t.co/JswvAWC2IP"&gt;https://t.co/JswvAWC2IP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CountdownToMars?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#CountdownToMars&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA's Perseverance Mars Rover (@NASAPersevere) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAPersevere/status/1363937472971907072?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 22, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PljiLQ"&gt;A microphone onboard Perseverance also captured sounds once the rover was on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PSHHfZ"&gt;The data started coming through NASA’s Deep Space Network last Thursday and Friday as the team pored over data on the spacecraft’s health. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>LIDAR maker Velodyne boots its founder after an investigation into ‘inappropriate’ behavior</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Yandex NV Trials Driverless Taxis" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CvHocOCjEYsr94M-JX58RoBjlsg=/0x0:4000x2667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856898/1164317768.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YyAi76"&gt;Velodyne, which makes LIDAR sensors crucial for the operation of autonomous vehicles, has removed its founder, David Hall, as chair of the company’s board following an investigation, &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; reports. Hall’s wife, Marta Thoma Hall, has also stepped down as chief marketing officer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pSRIC3"&gt;The investigation, which started in December 2020, concluded that the Halls “each behaved inappropriately with regard to Board and Company processes, and failed to operate with respect, honesty, integrity, and candor in their dealings with Company officers and directors,” the company said in &lt;a href="https://velodynelidar.com/press-release/velodyne-lidar-announces-changes-to-board-of-directors/"&gt;a statement&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xeePbf"&gt;David Hall had previously stepped down as chairman of the board “voluntarily,” the board said, and transitioned to a new role as executive chairman. Marta Hall was terminated as an employee of the company but will remain a member of the board of directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="02nxsY"&gt;“The Board also formally censured both Mr. Hall and Ms. Hall, and directed them both to receive appropriate remedial training,” the company said. It is unclear what behavior proceeded this decision. A spokesperson for the company declined to provide further comment.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="apSl5d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“formally censured”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kMyDtQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/18/16491052/velodyne-lidar-mapping-self-driving-car-david-hall-interview"&gt;David Hall has long been revered in the world of autonomous vehicle technology&lt;/a&gt; as a pioneer in the use of laser sensors to enable AVs to “see” the world around them. LIDAR, which stands for Light Detection and Ranging, uses thousands of laser beams to sense objects and measure their distance. The cone- or cylindrical-shaped sensor perched on the roof of a vehicle has become synonymous with self-driving cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Tdqbvl"&gt;Ford was an early backer of Velodyne, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/16/12499622/ford-baidu-velodyne-investment"&gt;investing $150 million&lt;/a&gt; in the company in 2017 along with Baidu, the Chinese search giant. Ford contributed $75 million of that total and held 13.1 million shares in the company. But the automaker abruptly dissolved its stake in the LIDAR company earlier this month and noted in a regulatory filing that it would no longer be a customer for Velodyne’s sensors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LVJe7q"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21055011/lidar-sensor-self-driving-mainstream-mass-market-velodyne-ces-2020"&gt;Hall stepped down as CEO of Velodyne in January 2020&lt;/a&gt;, replaced by the company’s chief technology officer Anand Gopalan. But he remained chairman of the board, steering the company’s major financial decisions, until earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IQkauc"&gt;Last summer, Velodyne became the latest mobility technology company to go public via a reverse merger, or SPAC. The company struck a deal to merge with special purpose acquisition company Graf Industrial Corp., with a market value of $1.8 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Karma’s new GS-6 hybrid is a cheaper version of its luxury sports car</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jiZGZKr7qeYcID8bLYUK3HIsz7M=/17x0:2024x1338/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856845/GS6__6_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Karma Automotive&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u3HwHX"&gt;Electric vehicle startup Karma Automotive has fully revealed its newest hybrid car, the GS-6. While it shares the same design as the company’s ultra-luxury sedan, the Revero GT, Karma is pricing the GS-6 at nearly half the price — $83,900 — in a bid to reach a much wider set of customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ydo9r0"&gt;Karma says it’s able to do that because it plans to make more cars at its California production plant, is making them more efficiently, and has streamlined its supply chain, according director of public relations Jeff Holland. “It helps that our parent company also owns our battery supplier A123 Systems, but over the past few years we have also seen a substantial reduction in the cost of lithium ion batteries and other EV-related components including other items such as motors and generators,” Holland told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; in an email. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Gzzt2"&gt;If the new car is successful, Karma could finally realize its goal of becoming a small-volume manufacturer just in time to capitalize on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/23/22194330/ev-startups-tesla-success-2020-electric-vehicles-spac-public"&gt;a new wave of optimism (and funding) in the electric vehicle space&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="YEKXYX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Almost half the price of the Revero, but mostly the same car&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NMw5CE"&gt;The path to that goal has been difficult so far for Karma. The startup was born in 2014 when Chinese automotive conglomerate Wanxiang Group bought a bulk of the assets of Fisker Automotive following &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; company’s bankruptcy. Wanxiang named the new startup after the Fisker Karma, the defunct company’s failed hybrid sports car, and ultimately revived that vehicle as the Revero. (Henrik Fisker, who founded Fisker Automotive, now has a new company called Fisker Inc. that is also working on electric vehicles.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LiRUqV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10355814"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Llh3uy"&gt;Karma has spent the last few years selling a small number of Revero hybrids for nearly $150,000 while struggling to really get on its feet as Wanxiang allegedly waffled on fully backing the startup, as &lt;em&gt;Jalopnik&lt;/em&gt;’s Jason Torchinsky has reported. The startup has been &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/source-claims-that-karma-will-layoff-most-workers-and-s-1842985031"&gt;accused of making prototypes that are basically just “movie props,”&lt;/a&gt; and may have even &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/karma-was-reportedly-considering-chapter-11-sources-up-1844136394"&gt;considered filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last year&lt;/a&gt;. (Karma has denied both claims.) Karma has also laid off more than one hundred employees over the last two years and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/6/21314730/byton-lordstown-karma-ppp-loans-coronavirus-bailout-layoffs"&gt;took a PPP loan of more than $5 million&lt;/a&gt; from the government in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aBREGp"&gt;The GS-6 is meant to help lift Karma out of that turmoil by appealing to a potentially much bigger group of buyers. It’s powered by a BMW-sourced, turbocharged three-cylinder engine and two electric motors that, altogether, generate a total of about 536 horsepower — the same powertrain found in the Revero. A 28kWh battery pack allows for up to 80 miles of driving on electricity alone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsDJIT"&gt;The interior features a touchscreen in the center of the dashboard, which is compatible with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, as well as a digital instrument cluster for the driver. Karma says it’s sourcing a lot of sustainable materials for the trim and the seats, too, in an attempt to appeal to more conscientious buyers. Karma will sell a Sport and a Luxury trim of the GS-6, and an all-electric version (dubbed GSe-6) is due out later starting at $79,900. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="snMAnM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We are not selling PowerPoints anymore, we’re selling real cars.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kbfR7T"&gt;“We are not selling PowerPoints anymore, we’re selling real cars,” Joost de Vries, Karma’s vice president of global sales, said on a conference call with reporters last week. de Vries explained that Karma hopes to target younger buyers with the lower price point, and more of them, too, with a total production capacity of 15,000 cars per year at the California factory. That said, de Vries was quick to point out that the startup has retained many of its older, existing customers whose Revero leases have expired. Karma is “starting to really feel like a more complete auto manufacturer here in the US,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FeSMS8"&gt;While Karma has spent time and money developing autonomous technology (it even &lt;a href="https://www.karmanewsroom.com/news/karma-automotive-debuts-all-new-level-4-autonomous-van-e-flex-platform/"&gt;created an allegedly self-driving van last year&lt;/a&gt;), de Vries said that’s not expected to come to the startup’s passenger vehicles any time soon. The GS-6 lineup will have optional driver assistance features like adaptive cruise control and lane keeping, but nothing more. “We’re not seeing anything in our near future on level three or level four,” de Vries said, referring to the Society of Automotive Engineers’ designations for hands-free driving and fully driverless capability within a certain area, respectively. “It’s on the roadmap, but I think we still want to wait another decade or so before the legislative problems have been resolved, and our customers are really not asking for it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BeibFP"&gt;Karma has a hand in a lot of other advanced technologies, too. The startup has shared that it’s working on a way to &lt;a href="https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1131161_karma-will-test-a-hydrogen-fuel-cell-car-without-the-infrastructure-hurdles"&gt;use methanol and hydrogen fuel cells to power future electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt;. It also &lt;a href="https://www.karmanewsroom.com/news/karma-automotive-completes-e-flex-platform-projects-to-offer-new-electric-mobility-solutions/"&gt;hopes to sell the technological platform that powers its cars to other automakers&lt;/a&gt;. An SUV is in the works, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="apKNDd"&gt;To fund all of this, Karma announced last July that it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/9/21319273/fisker-inc-karma-automotive-fundraising-public-evs-tesla-nikola"&gt;had raised a fresh $100 million&lt;/a&gt;. That announcement came at the beginning of a wave of electric vehicle companies going public by merging with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;special purpose acquisition companies&lt;/a&gt; (including Fisker Inc.). But so far, Karma remains private. “Our management team is exploring all avenues for a larger financing with investment bankers. And of course, IPO has always been an aspiration for Karma when it is public company ready, but for now the key focus is on growing our business,” a spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; at the time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Valheim tops 500,000 simultaneous players, breaking four more records</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EGZjH0EW7fxTBQCapk7_-8E1H2g=/155x0:829x449/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68856757/valheim_steam.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s8EhFA"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; is on a trajectory like nothing we’ve ever seen. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286507/valheim-steam-pc-game-2-million-sales"&gt;The Viking-themed indie survival game&lt;/a&gt; has been shooting up the Steam charts, &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/892970/view/3059603718053006418"&gt;selling 3 million copies&lt;/a&gt; in an unheard-of 17 days. And people aren’t just buying it on a whim; they’re actively playing it, too. On Sunday, the game reached 500,000 simultaneous players, &lt;a href="https://steamdb.info/graph/"&gt;according to SteamDB&lt;/a&gt;, leaving the charred remains of four other all-time Steam player count records in its wake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jkKWvt"&gt;As of Friday, February 19th, the game had already passed &lt;em&gt;Postal&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Grand Theft Auto V &lt;/em&gt;to become the ninth most-played game on Steam at peak, but now it’s surpassed the records for &lt;em&gt;Among Us, Life is Strange 2&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Fallout 4,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Terraria&lt;/em&gt; to reach the No. 5 slot, &lt;a href="https://steamcharts.com/"&gt;according to Steam Charts&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1kcZpnv9CsR-IwoJg3naUw32ZSY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22320792/chrome_uk2vwXiCeS.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="h6QcpW"&gt;It’s going to be an uphill battle from here: the four records it broke were in the 400,000 range, but the next record is the 830,000-player record &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077 &lt;/em&gt;set at its December launch. To beat &lt;em&gt;Dota 2&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Counter-Strike&lt;/em&gt;, it’d have to cross 1.3 million players.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YNmhIX"&gt;It seems completely doable, though, considering how rapidly the game has already grown, and the way it can suck you (and your friends) in again and again. There’s a huge randomly generated world to explore and loads to craft and build, with up to 10 people cooperatively working together. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/17/22286507/valheim-steam-pc-game-2-million-sales"&gt;It’s fun&lt;/a&gt;, and with a remarkably shallow learning curve and a $20 price tag, I’d be surprised if it bottoms out anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VB99Hj"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Valheim&lt;/em&gt; was built by a five-person team, but &lt;a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/valheim-dev-says-the-games-success-is-quite-incredible-and-very-humbling/"&gt;they tell &lt;em&gt;PC Gamer&lt;/em&gt; they’ll be hiring up now&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best gaming laptops to buy right now</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best gaming laptops at every size and price&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="ow4mCb"&gt;The best gaming laptop of 2021 looks different from those of years past. The early days of mobile gaming were largely desktop replacements — clunky chassis, multiple power bricks, and RGB lighting galore. But the top gaming laptops now are different. Manufacturers are finally putting powerful specs in sleeker, more portable, and more professional builds. They have excellent, fast refreshing screens that are necessary for a great gaming experience. These laptops aren’t just great for gaming, but for everyday work as well. That’s why the best gaming laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;. It can handle the most demanding games on the market today and also makes a great daily driver.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1D14gn"&gt;We’ll be updating this page regularly as new gaming laptop models hit shelves throughout this year. Some exciting updates are on the way. AMD and Nvidia have announced their next-gen series of mobile processors and mobile graphics cards — the Ryzen 5000 series and the GeForce RTX 3000 series, respectively — and we’re already seeing them in premium gaming laptops across manufacturers. Intel’s Tiger Lake H series is also on its way, though we expect to see those more frequently in lighter-weight models. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cGRnFN"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/14/22217171/gaming-laptops-qhd-screens-display-fast-refresh-rate"&gt;QHD screen&lt;/a&gt; is another feature to watch for. A growing number of manufacturers are releasing configurations with 1440p displays, even in gaming laptops under $2,000. These options can hit a sweet spot for many gamers: a better experience than 1080p without the price premium or raw horsepower required for a 4K display. You can expect decently high refresh rates from these panels as well, depending on the model. The upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22215119/razer-blade-15-17-laptops-screens-graphics-gaming-price-release-date"&gt;Razer Blade 15&lt;/a&gt;, for example, will offer up to a 240Hz panel with QHD resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5KtNO"&gt;One more thing to keep in mind is the power you can expect. Not all chips with the same name are created equal — the RTX 3070 in one laptop may not deliver the same frame rates as the RTX 3070 in another laptop due to its wattage (as well as other factors like the processor and cooling). Nvidia now requires companies to disclose clock speeds and graphics power on each model’s product page, but plenty of manufacturers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/5/22266921/nvidia-requiring-companies-share-clock-speed-power-gaming-laptop-rtx-30-series-gpu-specs"&gt;haven’t done that yet&lt;/a&gt;. Your best bet, if you can’t find those numbers on a company’s website, is to read some reviews and make sure the model you’re considering will deliver the frame rates you’re looking for. We will note the wattage used in any laptops we review with the new RTX graphics cards. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is the best gaming laptop of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best gaming laptop of 2021&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="PjVXGI"&gt;The ROG Zephyrus G14 is the best gaming laptop you can buy. We most recently reviewed last year’s model, which includes AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series up to the eight-core Ryzen 9 4900HS and an Nvidia RTX 2060 GPU. There’s a brand-new model out featuring the Ryzen 5000 series and Nvidia’s RTX 30-series graphics, which we’re looking forward to getting our hands on ASAP.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvmPMM"&gt;For well under $2,000, the Zephyrus crams one of the most powerful mobile processors on the market into a super portable 14-inch chassis. With capable cooling to boot, the laptop delivers frame rates we’ve never seen in a laptop of this size before. It handled every game we threw at it without breaking a sweat.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LRoiIm"&gt;But aside from its excellent gaming performance, the G14 makes a great daily driver. The keyboard, touchpad, display, and port selection are all excellent. Even the battery life is good — something we almost never get to say about gaming laptops. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0yypId"&gt;There are a few downsides to the G14, but they’re fairly small and user-dependent. The most significant note is that it lacks a webcam; you’ll need an external one if you plan on taking video calls. There’s also some bleed in the backlighting, there’s no Thunderbolt connectivity (since it’s an AMD system, and that’s an Intel standard), and the fans can get louder than most under load. But these are very much nitpicks that won’t have a large impact on plenty of people’s gaming experience. Overall, we have very few complaints. &lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Best gaming laptop 2021: Razer Blade Pro 17" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Hw1GXC0JJNr36nQ6K4vzlWTH-k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/21820230/mchin_181119_4158_0015.0.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade Pro 17 is a monster of a gaming laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yzdsDK"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="jT5h16"&gt;The best big-screen gaming laptop&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="E8Fdz3"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 delivers some of the best gaming performance you can find in a laptop — but that’s not even its superpower. What makes Razer’s 17-inch flagship so impressive is it packs that unbelievable power into a thin and attractive chassis. It’s just 0.8 inches thick and only requires one charging brick — so you can carry it around in a backpack or briefcase without compromising on power. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jaBYbX"&gt;Gaming enthusiasts can opt for a model with a 300Hz screen — the highest refresh rate you can get on a laptop — while folks who want to combine gaming with some creative work can opt for a 120Hz touchscreen configuration. Both models come with a customizable per-key RGB keyboard, which adds a touch of color to the Pro’s design without being too obnoxious for the office. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AsGaDN"&gt;The Blade Pro 17 certainly isn’t cheap, but it’s the laptop to buy if you want the best of the best.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE is the best gaming laptop under $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MaGh3q"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328344/dell-g5-15-se-review-2020-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen"&gt;Dell G5 15 SE&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="DMtcRV"&gt;The best budget gaming laptop&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="hCCjrZ"&gt;The Dell G5 15 SE offers a great gaming experience at a price range far below that of many competitors. It’s the best gaming laptop you can buy under $1,000, and it doesn’t ask too many compromises for that price. While it only comes with a 60Hz screen, the hardware inside (especially AMD’s Ryzen 7 processor) is capable of maxing that out on all kinds of demanding games at native 1080p resolution, so you can reliably expect a playable experience from your favorite titles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6ozmE"&gt;We’re also impressed by the G5’s connectivity. It includes a Mini DisplayPort, an HDMI, and an Ethernet jack — all ports you don’t see every day on laptops at this price point. Overall, if you’re looking for great value for your money, the G5 is your best bet. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade 15 is the 15-inch gaming laptop to beat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3 id="n9BvYP"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21499199/razer-blade-15-advanced-edition-gaming-laptop-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade 15 Advanced&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="wzRw2D"&gt;The best thin and light gaming laptop&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="EcPuJg"&gt;The Blade 15 isn’t as powerful as its 17-inch sibling, but it may be a more pragmatic purchase for many people. If you’re looking for a balanced combination of performance and portability, the Blade 15 may hit that sweet spot. It still packs the top chips on the market and can come with a 300Hz display, but at just 4.7 pounds and 0.7 inches thick, it’s comparable in size to a number of 15-inch productivity machines like the Dell XPS 15. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w8vpQe"&gt;In addition to its reliable gaming performance, the Blade 15 works well as a productivity machine. We’re big fans of its keyboard, which is quite comfortable to use and has per-key RGB lighting, and the touchpad, which is roomy with a satisfying click. Our primary complaint is that this Blade got quite hot during our game testing — not only did the processor reach 99 degrees, but the hinge and palm rests were uncomfortable to touch. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="E7sNUb"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22195676/asus-rog-strix-scar-15-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Strix Scar 15&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="7lPrCK"&gt;The flashiest gaming laptop&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="SK7elL"&gt;If you’re looking for a “traditional” premium gaming laptop with colorful, flashy panache, the ROG Strix Scar 15 is for you. The Strix’s keyboard isn’t just one of the most comfortable that we’ve ever tested on a gaming laptop; it also has some of the coolest per-key RGB lighting we’ve ever seen with all kinds of effects. There’s also a colorful light strip wrapped around the front of the deck (customizable as well) and a colorful glowing logo on the lid. In short: if you use this in public, people will notice. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZuwqX"&gt;Of course, the Strix is great on the inside as well, delivering some of the best frame rates you’ll find from a 15-inch laptop with Intel’s and Nvidia’s top chips. You’ll get the full benefit of their power with a 300Hz screen option as well. And the Strix comes preloaded with various programs to help customize your gaming experience. You can personalize color profiles, bandwidth allocation, and more based on the type of game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="tCRMB0"&gt;The best gaming laptop with desktop-class parts&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="SH9RLt"&gt;If money and desk space are no objects for you, you might be interested in the Alienware Area-51m. This hefty rig is essentially a desktop in laptop form. It pairs a desktop-class processor and a full-power mobile GPU with a 17-inch display and a full-size keyboard, delivering true desktop performance in a chassis that’s still (technically) portable. PC enthusiasts will also appreciate that you can update many of the components yourself, including the processor, RAM, and storage. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade Stealth 13 is a gaming laptop that’s a breeze to carry around.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="YDSZZF"&gt;The best 13-inch gaming laptop&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="8Da3D3"&gt;The Blade Stealth 13 is far from the most powerful gaming rig out there, but it is one of very few gaming systems that come in a 13-inch chassis. The Stealth can run AAA titles at native resolution and comes with a 120Hz screen, but it’s comparable in size and weight to a MacBook Pro. Use it in a meeting or a classroom, and passing observers may have no idea it’s a gaming laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xdg8S1"&gt;In addition to its powerful chips, the Stealth comes with a colorful keyboard, a sturdy build, and a decent webcam. Even the battery life is pretty good. If you’re looking for a laptop that’s small but mighty, the Stealth will get the job done as a gaming rig and productivity machine in one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="7cRV6L"&gt;8. Gigabyte Aero 15&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4 id="5tIPDZ"&gt;The best gaming laptop for content creators &lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p id="cXeYk1"&gt;One of the benefits of gaming laptops is, with their powerful graphics cards, they can double as drivers for content creators who want to get photo or video work done on the go. For these folks, the Aero 15 is as versatile as it comes. It has gaming laptop chips inside and a flashy RGB keyboard on the outside, but it pairs them with a gorgeous OLED display rather than a high refresh rate panel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XclmXe"&gt;Those specs don’t come cheap, and plenty of people will be just fine with a more affordable gaming laptop or a standard OLED ultraportable. But if you need powerful specs, a color-accurate screen, and a portable chassis, the Aero 15 delivers all three. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="rtol9z"&gt;Netflix is adding a new mobile feature that will automatically download show recommendations and movies based on viewer history. Downloads For You launches globally today for Android users, the company &lt;a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/downloads-for-you-takes-on-the-go-to-the-next-level"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iyQefJ"&gt;You’ll need to opt in to use the feature. Once toggled on from the downloads tab, you’ll need to set how much space — 1GB, 3GB, or 5GB — you’ll want to use. More space equals more Netflix recommendations downloaded. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/02/22/netflix-launches-downloads-for-you-a-new-feature-that-automatically-downloads-content-youll-like/?tpcc=ECTW2020"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that although Netflix’s full catalog is available with the feature, some downloads will be limited because of licensing restrictions. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="IpNGXj"&gt;The platform continues to improve its offline watching options; Netflix launched &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/7/18215134/netflix-smart-downloads-ios-automatic-download-wi-fi-deletion"&gt;Smart Downloads&lt;/a&gt; on Android &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/10/17552858/netflix-smart-downloads-episodes-shows-android"&gt;in 2018&lt;/a&gt;, which automatically deletes downloaded episodes after they’ve been watched. Although Downloads For You is currently only available on Android, an iOS version will begin testing soon.&lt;/p&gt;
