    <title>Sony announces PlayStation showcase, promises ‘sneak peek at the future of PS5’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RWrZi_o3RGbnB0w4DlkQC0Nivl0=/128x0:1505x918/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807597/1920x1080_BLOG_LEAD_IMAGE_SOCIAL_POSTS.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vRYLN3"&gt;Sony is announcing that it will hold a special PlayStation showcase on September 9th. The event will start at 10AM ET / 1PM PT, and will run for 40 minutes in what is being teased as “a look into the future of PS5.” &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/09/02/youre-invited-playstation-showcase-2021-broadcast-next-thursday/"&gt;Sony says&lt;/a&gt; its showcase will include updates from its PlayStation Studios, and a look at games releasing this holiday and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t9XvQz"&gt;Sony could be ready to launch a new PS5 system software update that it has been beta testing. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599593/sony-ps5-m2-ssd-support-beta-features"&gt;The update unlocks M.2 SSD support&lt;/a&gt;, and also includes some UI improvements to the PS5 dashboard and 3D audio support for built-in TV speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="C2QVMj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Get a sneak peek at the future of PS5, with updates from PlayStation Studios and industry-leading devs. Hope to see you there!&lt;/p&gt;— PlayStation (@PlayStation) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1433407411872747521?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Es7NJN"&gt;While there’s a promise of what’s next for PS5, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22296998/sony-ps5-next-gen-vr-headset-virtual-reality-features"&gt;Sony’s new PlayStation VR headset&lt;/a&gt; won’t make an appearance at the showcase. The next-gen PSVR was reportedly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609558/sony-playstation-psvr-oled-aaa-eye-tracking-controllers"&gt;detailed at a developer summit recently&lt;/a&gt;, revealing that the headset connects to a PS5 via a single cable. The headset also includes higher-resolution OLED displays (2000 x 2040 pixels per eye)and an improved 110-degree field of view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQJ3Ql"&gt;Sony is still promising “plenty of great PS5 games from developers large and small,” and it’s likely we’ll get another look at &lt;em&gt;Horizon Forbidden West&lt;/em&gt;, the sequel to &lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn, &lt;/em&gt;that was recently &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22602306/horizon-forbidden-west-playstation-delay-2022-february"&gt;delayed to February 18th, 2022&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps we’ll also see some updates on the next-gen patch for GTA V, and some final gameplay of Bethesda’s &lt;em&gt;Deathloop &lt;/em&gt;PS5 exclusive that launches later this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z5g2o4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; will be covering Sony’s PlayStation Showcase, so stay tuned for all the latest PS5 news.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>JBL boosts the durability of its popular Flip Bluetooth speaker</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HVsupzsOgoWu4Mub0sY0NYDj_es=/0x0:2692x1795/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807559/JBL_Flip_6_Poolside_2670_A_BLUE_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The JBL Flip 6.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: JBL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qDPNgb"&gt;JBL has announced an update to its popular lineup of Flip Bluetooth speakers with the Flip 6. Perhaps the biggest change is that the latest speaker is now officially dustproof thanks to its IP67 rating, while the Flip 5 was officially only waterproof (IPX7). Its Bluetooth version has also been boosted from 4.2 to 5.1, and it features a newly redesigned JBL logo. Battery life is unchanged at around 12 hours. It’ll retail for $129.95 when it goes on sale in December in the US, up from the Flip 5’s current $119.95 price.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zMqwmi"&gt;The Flip 6 is just one of a host of new audio products JBL is announcing today. There’s also the Partybox 110 and 710, two large rugged speakers which feature guitar and mic inputs for impromptu music-making and which will retail for $399.95 and $799.95 respectively. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mRaXAV"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10731516"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OGriSC"&gt;When it comes to headphones JBL has the $99.95 Quantum 350 gaming headset (available this month), and the true wireless Reflect Flow Pro ($179.95, available November), Tune 230NC and Tune 130NC (both $99.95 and available October), and Endurance Race ($79.95, available October). Finally, it’s also announcing the JR 460NC, a pair of $79.95 noise-cancelling over-ear headphones aimed at children that’ll be available to buy this month.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>This chainless drive system could revolutionize e-bike designs </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mLEtJ8yBcmzT5BmCx7sAhNrDDus=/0x0:1520x1013/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807526/chainless_drive.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Schaeffler’s Free Drive system converts pedal power into electrical power.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Schaeffler&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qBkr5U"&gt;We don’t often write about bicycle components, but it’s not everyday that an innovation like the &lt;a href="https://www.schaeffler.com/content.schaeffler.com/en/news_media/press_releases/press_releases_detail.jsp?id=87716736"&gt;Schaeffler Free Drive&lt;/a&gt; is announced for pedal-assisted e-bikes. The so-called “bike-by-wire” system, first &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/08/31/radical-new-electric-bike-drive-systems-requires-no-chains-or-belts-entirely-ride-by-wire/"&gt;spotted by &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, dispenses with the need to string a chain or belt between the pedals and wheel hub. It’s an all-electric drive system that allows for entirely new bicycle designs with fewer moving parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GfxYfG"&gt;The Free Drive system works by converting the rider’s pedaling power into electrical energy via a small generator housed between the pedals. It then delivers this energy to the rear wheel (or wheels) via cables strung inside or outside the frame of the bike, rather than sending it mechanically through a chain or belt. Excess energy created by pedaling is fed back into the battery. The end result is a power system with fewer moving parts to complicate construction. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nS37GQ"&gt;The Free Drive system is sold to bike makers as a set of optimized components consisting of a 250W hub motor, the pedal generator, battery, and interface unit. And while the technology could have serious design implications for commuter and city e-bikes, Free Drive’s biggest and most immediate impact might be on cargo bikes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z5DIpN0B8tEd3TxgZ4X9u8aqWJI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822198/chain_wobble.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Tern&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A chain-free drive system would remove the need for unwieldy designs like that of the Tern cargo bike (above). &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="FxFKUO"&gt;Cargo bikes come in some unusual designs in order to create space for freight. These designs often require absurdly long chains slung between the pedals and rear derailleur. These can snag or soil clothing, and slap about noisily over any bumps. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22274747/tern-hsd-p9-ebike-review-electric-cargo-bike-price-specs"&gt;Tern cargo bikes&lt;/a&gt;, I’m looking at you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KjQXWD"&gt;Electric cargo bikes have the potential to transform cities by replacing those hulking delivery vans that block traffic and pump the air full of pollutants. So, anything that accelerates the adoption of e-cargo bikes is welcome news, indeed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LtO0RmBBjydUSRd1ao7exr8T0rc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822200/00195DF7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Schaeffler&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;A prototype electronic cargo bike from BAYK fitted with a Free Drive system.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="P3XCKd"&gt;Schaeffler recognizes this opportunity by replacing the chain drive of a Bring S cargo bike from &lt;a href="https://bayk.ag/en/bring-s-cargobike/"&gt;BAYK&lt;/a&gt; with its Free Drive system. The bike is on display at the big Eurobike trade show happening now in Frankfurt, Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yahoo is Yahoo once more after new owners complete acquisition</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MtYq1ya8ChrirckOIRA67OomlCg=/0x0:2000x1333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807170/mb_yahoo_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Yahoo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wvtjHJ"&gt;Yahoo and AOL, formerly known as Verizon Media, have &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/09/01/2290243/0/en/Apollo-Funds-Complete-Acquisition-of-Yahoo.html"&gt;officially been acquired&lt;/a&gt; by their new owners and renamed as simply “Yahoo.” Verizon announced it was selling the properties &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22416854/aol-yahoo-sale-apollo-venetian-hotel-verizon"&gt;to Apollo Global Management in May&lt;/a&gt; in a deal said to be worth $5 billion, around half of the nearly $9 billion the telecom giant originally paid for them, and a fraction of the hundreds of billions the &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/15/how-aol-dominated-the-internet-of-the-90s-and-let-it-slip-away.html"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dont-cry-for-yahoo%E2%80%94the-stock-has-raced-past-previous-leaders-of-the-dot-com-era-2016-07-25"&gt;companies&lt;/a&gt; were worth at their peaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFpIBt"&gt;Verizon originally purchased AOL in 2015 for $4.4 billion, and acquired Yahoo in 2017 for $4.5 billion. After completing its Yahoo acquisition, Verizon placed both brands under the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/3/15166872/aol-verizon-oath-announced-merger-rebranding-new-name-logo"&gt;woefully bland “Oath” brand&lt;/a&gt;. “#TakeTheOath” proclaimed &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_armstrong/status/848994977715826690"&gt;AOL CEO Tim Armstrong&lt;/a&gt;. The media divisions, which include properties like &lt;em&gt;Yahoo Sports&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;, were officially renamed “Verizon Media” in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kGmEf8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;#TakeTheOath&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Vnoehh"&gt;Yahoo will now be run by CEO Guru Gowrappan, and will operate as a standalone company under Apollo Funds. Apollo is a private equity firm that owns assets like crafts retailer Michaels, Chuck E. Cheese restaurants, and the Venetian resort in Las Vegas. “The close of the deal heralds an exciting time of renewed opportunity for us as a standalone entity,” Gowrappan said. “We anticipate that the coming months and years will bring fresh growth and innovation for Yahoo as a business and a brand, and we look forward to creating that future with our new partners.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kinNkS"&gt;The acquisition marks the end of Verizon’s short-lived dalliance with media production and advertising. In 2019 the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/12/20802639/tumblr-verizon-sold-wordpress-blogging-yahoo-adult-content"&gt;company sold Tumblr&lt;/a&gt; (which had previously been owned by Yahoo), before selling &lt;em&gt;The Huffington Post&lt;/em&gt; (formerly part of AOL) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575599/buzzfeed-acquires-huffpost-verizon-jonah-peretti-tumblr"&gt;last year&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the selloffs, Apollo says Yahoo still boasts nearly 900 million monthly active users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="phaqjK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NOpIUT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Quick phrases could let you skip ‘Hey, Google’ for common tasks</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/svul2p5p4sSUBAZQ06zkrCB3kqs=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69807008/acastro_180510_1777_google_assistant_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1w6Uk0"&gt;“Quick phrases” is a new feature currently under development for Google Assistant that could one day let you skip having to say “Hey, Google” for common phrases like “What time is it?” or “Turn the lights on,” &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/09/01/google-assistant-quick-phrases/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt;. The feature is yet to be officially announced, and it’s unclear when it might launch or exactly which devices might support it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GyoqYP"&gt;The feature emerged back in April under the codename “&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22400412/google-guacamole-voice-shortcuts-assistant-snooze-stop-alarm-call"&gt;Guacamole&lt;/a&gt;.” At the time it was called “Voice shortcuts,” and its capabilities seemed limited to silencing alarms and timers, or responding to incoming phone calls. But the new menu discovered by &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; shows a much broader range of tasks, or “salsas” as Google is nicknaming them. These salsas include the ability to ask about the weather, skip songs, or set alarms and timers in addition to just silencing them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hWbYdqTSLmFJpuTlvwbcP0MSDuI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22822124/Google_Assistant_Quick_phrases_c.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2021/09/01/google-assistant-quick-phrases/" target="_blank"&gt;9to5Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A menu showing Quick Phrases that can be enabled.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AxbIxm"&gt;From the settings menu, it appears as though you’ll need to individually enable specific commands to get them to work without a wake word, and then &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/assistant/answer/9071681?hl=en&amp;amp;co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid"&gt;Voice Match&lt;/a&gt; will be used to ensure they only respond to your unique voice. Another menu item suggests that the phrases can be set to work across other Google Assistant devices in addition to your own phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n4rDkG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt; speculates that the feature works by expanding the list of wake phrases an Assistant device is actively listening for. By default, the software is only listening for a “Hey, Google” or “OK, Google” wake phrase, but presumably if you’ve added “What time is it?” as a Quick Phrase this effectively becomes a wake phrase of its own. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7Dq9JB"&gt;A similar feature, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/7/18535647/google-assistant-alarm-stop-timer-hey-update-io-2019"&gt;introduced in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, already exists for Google’s Nest smart speakers and displays that lets you silence an alarm without needing to say a wake word first. Quick Phrases expands this functionality dramatically to potentially encompass a wide variety of other common tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H6geWw"&gt;It’s an intriguing feature, especially for smart home controls that are best activated quickly and without much thought. But Google’s software will have its work cut out if it wants to avoid mistaking other random sounds for its expanded list of wake phrases.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Samsung announces 200-megapixel phone camera sensor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DfByx5kve0EaZOBy5F7rWtUTEF0=/79x0:921x561/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69806895/ISOCELL_HP1_GN5_main1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Samsung&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NZVHJI"&gt;Samsung has &lt;a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-brings-advanced-ultra-fine-pixel-technologies-to-new-mobile-image-sensors"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; a 200-megapixel image sensor intended for smartphone cameras, by some distance the highest resolution phone camera sensor ever made. The ISOCELL HP1 has 0.64μm pixels and can bin 16 of them at once for the equivalent of a 12.5-megapixel sensor with 2.56μm pixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vxe3Pn"&gt;Samsung calls the HP1’s pixel-binning technology “ChameleonCell.” The four-by-four 12.5-megapixel setting is intended for low-light usage, but it can also capture full 200-megapixel resolution photos, or use a two-by-two binning technique for 50-megapixel images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iFJGZN"&gt;The two-by-two binning mode also lets the HP1 capture 8K video. Samsung says it’s capable of shooting 8K without cropping, although standard 8K (7,680 x 4,320) is less than 50 megapixels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="X9ics9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3 review: nearly normal","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22638257/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-review"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="AqSyO8"&gt;Samsung is also introducing a new sensor called the ISOCELL GN5. It’s a 50-megapixel sensor with 1.0μm pixels, and Samsung says it’s the first 1.0μm-pixel sensor to integrate its Dual Pixel Pro technology. That basically makes it sound like a smaller version of the 1.4μm-pixel GN2, which was the biggest phone camera sensor available when it made its debut on Xiaomi’s Mi 11 Ultra this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IueW3"&gt;Samsung hasn’t said when either new sensor will be going into mass production, but samples are currently available for phone manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple concedes to let apps like Netflix, Spotify, and Kindle link to the web to sign up</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z_lfLKzYhZG4Hpchu1XaBtVSESw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69806725/acastro_170731_1777_0003_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ppIiJC"&gt;While vocal app developers accused Apple last week of spinning a lawsuit settlement into &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/26/22643807/apple-developer-class-action-lawsuit-collect-information-ios-apps-anti-steering"&gt;an App Store change that was barely a change at all&lt;/a&gt;, the company appears to be making a true, if small concession today: Apple says it will let developers of “reader” apps (think Netflix, Spotify, and Amazon’s Kindle app) directly link their customers to their own sign-up website, where they could potentially skirt Apple’s in-app payment system (and its 30 percent cut) entirely, in those cases where they haven’t already.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mvLwik"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/japan-fair-trade-commission-closes-app-store-investigation/"&gt;In a press release&lt;/a&gt;, Apple claims that the move will close an investigation by the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC), and that it’ll only apply to those sorts of “reader” apps right now — a category that was originally designed by Apple to placate companies like Netflix and Hulu by allowing them to let users simply sign into their existing account instead of signing up for a new subscription via the App Store (and having to pay Apple’s fees).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QBg1OS"&gt;The JFTC has confirmed the agreement &lt;a href="https://www.jftc.go.jp/en/pressreleases/yearly-2021/September/210902.html"&gt;in a press release&lt;/a&gt; of its own, saying that the move by Apple “would eliminate the suspected violation of the Antimonopoly Act.” The commission, which has been investigating Apple since 2016, says the company has pledged to report on the status of app review transparency once a year for the next three years. According to the JFTC, Apple proposed changing its app review guidelines in response to the investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="2Rk61c"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You can’t sign up for Netflix in the app. We know it’s a hassle”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AywYGE"&gt;Currently, the Netflix and Spotify apps on iOS are useless if you don’t already have a subscription: both of them only offer a sign-in page, with no link out to their website, and a cheeky apology. “You can’t sign up for Netflix in the app. We know it’s a hassle,” reads the Netflix app’s splash page. The Amazon Kindle app, by contrast, offers a basic “Create a new Amazon account” page inside the app itself, but doesn’t let you buy books there, or even in the standard Amazon app. You have to go to a mobile browser to purchase.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hGLefKU-OG9ML3YGcbPRlxYRXbE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22821705/netflix_app.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The message that greets you when opening the Netflix app on iOS.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sB9svf"&gt;The rule change has an extremely limited scope, as Apple claims it only agreed to let developers of so-called reader apps to “share a single link to their website to help users set up and manage their account.” Apple also says it will “help developers of reader apps protect users when they link them to an external website to make purchases,” which suggests it will have specific guidelines for how these links appear. It’s not clear whether developers will be able to mention pricing at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SEdgJj"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;There are just as many questions as answers:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- Does Apple still get to define “reader” app by fiat?&lt;br&gt;- Can apps explicitly mention payment or price or is that muzzled?&lt;br&gt;- One link - where does it go? Are there rules?&lt;a href="https://t.co/KuKgj9dXuW"&gt;https://t.co/KuKgj9dXuW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Dieter Bohn (@backlon) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/backlon/status/1433236886953279489?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wgu1dG"&gt;It’s also worth noting that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation"&gt;when Apple rejected the Hey email app&lt;/a&gt;, and even after it later modified that controversial decision, the company was very clear that email apps do not count as “reader” apps, even if you similarly subscribe outside of the app and the only thing you can do without an account is sign in. Apple is the one that decides which apps qualify as reader apps to begin with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Oe8wZY"&gt;It also seems like Apple may be slightly redefining what a “reader” app means: &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/review/guidelines/#reader-apps"&gt;While the company’s App Review Guidelines suggest&lt;/a&gt; that a reader app “may” allow users to access previously purchased content (presumably alongside in-app purchases, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421734/apple-epic-netflix-in-app-purchase-removal-emails"&gt;like Netflix offered for years&lt;/a&gt;), Apple’s new press release specifies that “developers of reader apps &lt;strong&gt;do not offer in-app digital goods and services for purchase&lt;/strong&gt;”&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;(bolding ours). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DZ6Kh2"&gt;That would mean that Apple’s only offering this exception to companies that aren’t contributing any in-app purchase commissions to Apple anyways. Which, admittedly, include some of Apple’s sternest critics like Spotify. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MfifXJ"&gt;Some critics of Apple’s anti-steering rules have suggested they’d like to advertise inside their app that they charge users less at their own website than via Apple’s IAP — since they wouldn’t have to pay Apple that extra 30 percent, they could pass along the savings. But if Apple’s “reader” category doesn’t wind up including apps that offer IAP, that idea probably won’t be possible under Apple’s new rule.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qre5ui"&gt;It may be a while before we find out the answers to these questions: Apple says the rule won’t go into effect until early 2022.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk says the Tesla Roadster ‘should ship’ in 2023</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vSnKZTAAr4JOvdUIrgKhnmhVFio=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69806228/Roadster_Hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Tesla Roadster.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Tesla&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zkqzEZ"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk said that the upcoming Tesla Roadster “should ship in 2023” in &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1433115031940440065"&gt;a tweet on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. He blamed the ongoing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/31/22648372/willy-shih-chip-shortage-tsmc-samsung-ps5-decoder-interview"&gt;supply chain shortages&lt;/a&gt; for the long timeline. “2021 has been the year of super crazy supply chain shortages, so it wouldn’t matter if we had 17 new products, as none would ship,” Musk said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lXNSeX"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;2021 has been the year of super crazy supply chain shortages, so it wouldn’t matter if we had 17 new products, as none would ship. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Assuming 2022 is not mega drama, new Roadster should ship in 2023.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1433115031940440065?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 1, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ls759J"&gt;Elon Musk first announced the $200,000 second-generation Roadster at a splashy event &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/17/16669024/tesla-roadster-2017-fastest-car-world"&gt;in November 2017&lt;/a&gt;, promising that the base model could go from 0 to 60 in a staggering 1.9 seconds. He also said that the Roadster would have a 200kWh battery pack and a 620-mile range per charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qDQOFD"&gt;At the time, production was scheduled to start sometime in 2020, but in January, Musk said that production &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22255902/tesla-roadster-production-2022-elon-musk-ceo-tweet"&gt;would instead begin in 2022&lt;/a&gt;. The delays might sting for people who have already put down deposits on the car — Tesla is taking $50,000 deposits for the base model and $250,000 deposits for the higher-end Founders Series model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kIkhsS"&gt;Tesla has already adjusted to the global chip shortage by substituting alternative chips into its cars and rewriting its software to support it, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22595060/tesla-chip-shortage-software-rewriting-ev-processor"&gt;Musk said in an earnings call in July&lt;/a&gt;. But it seems that are still some hurdles to clear until it can release the promising new Roadster. And it’s not just the Roadster that’s a ways out; production on the Tesla Cybertruck has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/8/22615539/tesla-cybertruck-production-delayed-2022-elon-musk"&gt;been delayed until 2022&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>FAA investigating off-course descent of Virgin Galactic’s flight with Richard Branson</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="xAHVOz"&gt;Richard Branson’s July flight to the edge of space is under investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration for veering out of its designated airspace mid-flight, the FAA said on Wednesday after a &lt;a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-red-warning-light-on-richard-bransons-space-flight"&gt;report from &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The mission’s two pilots were alerted to yellow and red light warnings mid-flight that, according to sources in &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker&lt;/em&gt;, should’ve prompted them to abort the mission. The flight continued and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/11/22572374/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-unity"&gt;ultimately landed safely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hCfgga"&gt;Virgin Galactic’s SpaceShipTwo spaceplane air-launched from its carrier aircraft on July 11th carrying founder Branson and three company employees over the firm’s New Mexico spaceport, Spaceport America. The rocket plane soared 53.5 miles high, skimming the edge of space for a few minutes of weightlessness before free-gliding back to a runway, using the rocket-propelled momentum from its ascent. Branson and the company lauded the mission as a success shortly after, with the company’s president Mike Moses telling reporters “the ship looked perfect” at touchdown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Vsu1ya"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A red light that “should scare the crap out of you” lit up&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VUTr0t"&gt;But as the space plane was accelerating toward peak altitude, the two pilots, Dave Mackay and Michael Masucci, saw cockpit warnings that indicated the ship wasn’t flying as steeply as it should have been. Such warnings “should scare the crap out of you,” Masucci was quoted by &lt;em&gt;The New Yorker &lt;/em&gt;as saying in a 2015 meeting with other company pilots. That gave the pilots two options, per company procedures: “implement immediate corrective action, or abort the rocket motor,” the magazine reports. Triggering an abort and returning Branson and his crew to ground without reaching space would’ve been the safest option at the time, multiple sources told Nicholas Schmidle, the article’s author who also published an exhaustive book on Virgin Galactic’s history earlier this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7PsqbO"&gt;The July flight fulfilled Branson’s long-held goal to travel to space. Branson, originally slated to fly on a later mission, moved up his flight soon after Jeff Bezos announced he’d fly on his space company Blue Origin’s rocket in July. Virgin Galactic has said safety is its top priority and Branson has denied that Bezos’ rival jaunt to space played a role in his decision to launch sooner than planned.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IvvQ53"&gt;In a statement, a Virgin Galactic spokesperson said the crew was never in any danger, the “change in trajectory” was caused by high-level winds and that the company disputes what it considers “misleading characterizations and conclusions” in the New Yorker story. “Our pilots responded appropriately to these changing flight conditions exactly as they have been trained and in strict accordance with our established procedures,” the spokesperson said. “Although the flight’s ultimate trajectory deviated from our initial plan, it was a controlled and intentional flight path that allowed Unity 22 to successfully reach space and land safely at our Spaceport in New Mexico.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;Branson, 71, speaks to reporters in July shortly after flying to space&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="i5htxI"&gt;“During its July 11, 2021 flight, the Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo vehicle deviated from its Air Traffic Control clearance as it returned to Spaceport America,” a spokesperson for the FAA said in a statement. “The FAA investigation is ongoing.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7wauC5"&gt;The off-course descent isn’t Virgin Galactic’s first brush with danger. In 2014, the company suffered a mid-flight disaster during a test flight that killed one pilot and severely injured another. After that, Branson vowed to fly aboard the ship himself before flying paying customers, as a show of confidence in the vehicle’s safety. In another test flight in 2018, with Mackay and Masucci as pilots, SpaceShipTwo veered out of control, spinning and tumbling mid-air before the pilots regained stability and landed safely, Schmidle reports. The cause was later found to be a manufacturing defect that took months to fix. After the plane flew again in 2019, engineers found significant damage to a crucial part of the plane, with a glue-like material ripped up and exposing a large gap, Schmidle wrote in his book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FSnEZf"&gt;Schmidle’s &lt;em&gt;New Yorker&lt;/em&gt; story also revealed that Virgin Galactic’s former lead test pilot and flight test director, Mark Stucky, was fired eight days after Branson’s flight in the wake of revelations from Schmidle’s book. Stucky &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/22/virgin-galactic-flight-test-director-mark-stucky-leaves-company.html"&gt;previously wrote on LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; that he didn’t leave on his own terms, but the reason for his departure had been unclear. That marked the second departure of a senior safety-related employee for the company — Todd Ericson, a retired Air Force Colonel and Virgin Galactic’s former VP of safety and test, resigned from the company shortly after the 2019 test flight, frustrated with the Virgin Galactic’s safety culture, according to Schmidle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0gMIxL"&gt;Virgin Galactic’s next crewed mission, which will also be its first revenue-generating flight, is slated for late September carrying three members of the Italian Air Force. FAA investigations into unexpected flight events usually keep future missions from taking place until the agency’s inquiry is complete and any potential corrections are made by the company. But the FAA’s probe into the Unity 22 mission “has no impact on future test flights,” the Virgin Galactic spokesperson said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xmVqiB"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, September 1st, 8:32PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds a statement from a Virgin Galactic spokesperson&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The time a human-driven car ran over an autonomous robot</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Starship Technologies delivery robot" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DW6O8vtEHrjM3G9jTGWi-MXm_ek=/96x0:1905x1206/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69805900/starship_delivery_bot.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Starship Technologies&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5cUJcr"&gt;Crossing city streets filled with SUV drivers in a hurry is tricky for any pedestrian, but what about a robot that’s less than two feet tall? &lt;a href="https://www.starship.xyz/"&gt;Starship Technologies&lt;/a&gt; is flooding college towns with autonomous electric delivery bots that trundle goods to your location in their locked storage compartment. While the&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/20/20973971/uber-self-driving-car-crash-investigation-human-error-results"&gt; safety of human pedestrians around large vehicles with autonomous capabilities&lt;/a&gt; is still being debated, this time, the roles were reversed. &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rach.ipsa/video/7002765870946651398"&gt;As shown in a video posted to TikTok by rach,ipsa&lt;/a&gt;, even a couple of lights plus cameras, radar, ultrasonic sensors, and neural networks weren’t enough for this robot to avoid getting clipped by a Ford Escape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="abuN7P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Thousands of autonomous delivery robots are about to descend on US college campuses ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/20/20812184/starship-delivery-robot-expansion-college-campus"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="bj6hBn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@rach.ipsa/video/7002765870946651398" data-video-id="7002765870946651398" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@rach.ipsa" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rach.ipsa"&gt;@rach.ipsa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reply to @cody_offic it's about as wonderful as you imagined   &lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - rach.ipsa" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7002765681733241606"&gt;♬ original sound - rach.ipsa&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uXYAQm"&gt;In the robot’s defense, it appears to have had the right of way. This video was captured &lt;a href="https://uknow.uky.edu/campus-news/uk-partners-starship-bring-robot-food-delivery-campus"&gt;at the University of Kentucky&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/10/22617175/starship-technologies-delivery-robots-college-campuses"&gt;one of the four schools Starship Technologies said it’s expanding to this fall&lt;/a&gt;. Combine unfamiliar robots with students and faculty who have probably been away from campus for more than a year, and it feels inevitable that there would be a dust-up eventually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOrzgH"&gt;While the delivery bot could retreat onto the sidewalk despite a busted wheel or two, it’s unclear if the vehicle it collided with took any damage. Insurance companies aren’t always the easiest to deal with, and it’s hard to imagine they’re prepared to respond when someone runs into a robot. Last September, a Frisco, TX woman said a Starship robot hit her car at a stoplight, doing $2,600 in damage. As &lt;a href="https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/nbc-5-responds/nbc-5-responds-what-happens-if-youre-in-a-crash-with-a-robot/2442345/"&gt;reported by&lt;em&gt; NBC 5 Dallas-Fort Worth&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, she learned Starship had video of the incident, but she couldn’t obtain a copy or get additional responses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZvQByG"&gt;Her insurance company initially insisted she was responsible for paying the deductible; however, after the media outlet contacted Starship Technologies, the robot operators reportedly paid for the repairs.  Starship Technologies did not respond to requests for comment about the incident or the status of the robot. Still, for our robot friend, things could’ve been worse — at Purdue University, &lt;a href="https://www.purdueexponent.org/campus/article_50e991d0-db68-11eb-8ad5-cb5ef0447653.html"&gt;one of them got smushed by a garbage truck coming out of an alley&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
