    <title>How to use Google’s budget feature on Android so you don’t overspend</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qnCBiu"&gt;Google has provided a budgeting feature in its Play Store that allows Android users to establish a monthly maximum they want to spend on digital content. This applies to apps, games, movies, TV shows, music, ebooks, and so on. As you get close to reaching your budget limit, you’ll see an alert that you’re nearing it — or have gone over the amount you specified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GrHNS5"&gt;You access it like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qpmLYU"&gt;Open the Play Store on your Android device, tap on your personal icon on the upper right side, and select “Payments &amp;amp; subscriptions.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ibqrH5"&gt;From there, select “Budget &amp;amp; history.” &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="BTRG2W"&gt;You’ll see the amount you spent during the current month. Choose the “Set budget” option and enter the amount you’re comfortable spending on your apps, music, movies, TV shows, and ebooks for a month. Then hit “Save.” Your budget can always be adjusted or removed altogether from this same screen. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Choose an amount for your budget." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/64XbKwh8Woe-_LFqcBHLDLzmxiw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899906/Screenshot_20211004_110750.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Choose an amount for your budget.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can remove or edit the budget anytime." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/L1vHScBBWTV_5EbRSt2fr3-XI8s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22899908/Screenshot_20211004_110832.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can remove or edit the budget anytime.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="biBi74"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/9281767?hl=en&amp;amp;ref_topic=3364261"&gt;As Google notes&lt;/a&gt;, setting a budget won’t actually do anything to prevent purchases or subscriptions on your Google Play account once you’ve exceeded it. This feature is meant to be an easy reference for tracking your spending that you can take advantage of; it doesn’t implement hard restrictions like &lt;a href="https://families.google.com/familylink/"&gt;Google’s Family Link&lt;/a&gt; parental controls can. One other thing to know is that you can only set budgets using the currency of the country where your Google Play profile is linked. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r8WQRo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 20th, 2020, 2:37PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; This article was originally published on April 17th, 2019, and has been updated to reflect the fact that the feature is available to all.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eO4wzo"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 2021, 11:25AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect changes in the Android interface.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Volvo announces plans to go public in bid to accelerate shift to electric cars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fRGTR7LndinbJDayzQ5PJ4MSbro=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948413/ahawkins_201221_4352_6471.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Andrew Hawkins / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LNSCwN"&gt;Volvo, the Swedish luxury car maker owned by China’s Geely, &lt;a href="https://www.media.volvocars.com/global/en-gb/media/pressreleases/287174/volvo-cars-announces-its-intention-to-launch-an-initial-public-offering-and-list-on-nasdaq-stockholm"&gt;announced its plan&lt;/a&gt; for an initial public offering as it seeks to raise more cash to accelerate its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22308851/volvo-electric-cars-only-2030-online-sales"&gt;transition to a fully electric car company.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ir54Rk"&gt;The announcement follows the news last week that Polestar, the electric car company that is a joint venture between Volvo and Geely, would be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22696139/polestar-spac-public-value-ev-startup-volvo-geely"&gt;going public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company, or SPAC&lt;/a&gt;. That deal values Polestar at roughly $20 billion, despite selling only two models — a hybrid luxury coupe and an all-electric fastback sedan. Volvo is choosing a more traditional route by proceeding with an IPO in Stockholm that could value the company at upwards of $25 billion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Deb6LN"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Volvo said it aims to raise about 25 billion kronor, equivalent to $2.86 billion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XhJuqE"&gt;Volvo said it aims to raise about 25 billion kronor, equivalent to $2.86 billion, by issuing new shares. The aim is to use this money to speed up plans to phase out the sale of gas-powered cars in its bid to become an EV-only company by 2030. It also represents a dramatic comeback for Volvo, which was sold to Geely by a beleaguered Ford for just $1.8 billion in 2010. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zka7fx"&gt;Volvo launched its first fully electric car, the XC40 Recharge, last year. The SUV has a roughly 200-mile range and can charge its batteries to 80 percent capacity in 40 minutes. In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195499/volvo-xc40-recharge-ev-suv-first-drive-specs-price"&gt;our time with the car&lt;/a&gt;, we found it to be an “impressive blend of Swedish ingenuity, crossover utility, and electric performance. The follow-up, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22307699/volvo-c40-recharge-electric-vehicle-ev-specs"&gt;C40 Recharge&lt;/a&gt;, will be available later this year, while an electric XC90 SUV won’t be revealed until 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8N0xTd"&gt;The listing would offer investors a chance to bet on the auto industry’s transition to fully electric vehicles at a time of rising concerns about tailpipe emissions and a crackdown by governments around the world on the production of gas cars. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8B3dmW"&gt;Geely, which is the largest privately owned automaker in China, will sell some of its shares in Volvo as part of the IPO, though it hasn’t said how many nor how it could affect the company’s overall stake in the automaker. Earlier this year, the company backed off a plan to fully merge Volvo with Geely’s auto division. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A surgically implanted brain stimulation device could help treat severe depression</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Deus Ex Brain" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qjmQVNESA4pogOKATHRzS9lwfSo=/0x2:640x429/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948357/Deus_Ex_brain.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WtvAn7"&gt;Sarah had no options left. Over five years, she’d tried every possible treatment for her severe depression, and nothing had helped. “My daily life had become so restricted and impoverished by depression that I felt tortured by each day,” the 36-year-old said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8Yy6Nj"&gt;But after undergoing an experimental procedure that implanted a device into her brain, she felt her depression lift for the first time in years. “It was like my lens on the world changed,” Sarah, who is remaining anonymous because of the stigma around depression, said during a press briefing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wBaWGC"&gt;Sarah was the patient in a proof-of-concept trial of a new approach to treating severe, treatment-resistant depression, &lt;a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-021-01480-w"&gt;published today&lt;/a&gt; in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature Medicine&lt;/em&gt;. The findings open up another possible strategy for helping people with the disorder. The study only involved Sarah, and it’s still not clear how well it might work in other people. The lessons from the trial, though, helped the researchers understand more about the nature of depression and could apply to other efforts to treat the disease. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ThGd44"&gt;“We identified through this trial some fundamental properties about the brain,” said study author Katherine Scangos, a psychiatrist at the University of California San Francisco Weill Institute for Neurosciences, during the press briefing. “We think these findings about the brain will be available for the general public, and will help us develop new personalized depression treatments.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zE6n4C"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“depression is caused by faulty circuits”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ICyAE2"&gt;The trial used a technique called deep brain stimulation, where electrodes implanted within the brain deliver electrical impulses in an attempt to change or regulate abnormal brain activity. It’s common for conditions like epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease. Research over the past decade has shown that it can sometimes help with depression, but the findings have been &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/04/zapping-peoples-brains-didnt-cure-their-depression-until-it-did/558032/"&gt;inconsistent&lt;/a&gt;. Most previous efforts delivered stimulation to &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5871707/"&gt;individual regions&lt;/a&gt; of the brain thought to be involved in depression. This study, though, was targeted at regions that were part of specific brain &lt;em&gt;circuits &lt;/em&gt;— interconnected parts of the brain that are responsible for specific functions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BjCE4s"&gt;“What we are increasingly realizing now is that depression is caused by faulty circuits,” Scangos says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QuLzLq"&gt;In addition, the circuits involved might be different for each person. So in this trial, the study team personalized the treatment approach to the specific patient’s depression. They mapped out the type of brain activity that occurred when Sarah’s depression symptoms flared. Then, they surgically implanted a device that could detect that brain activity and send stimulation to the circuit where the activity was happening. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eMbHqU"&gt;For Sarah, the procedure was highly effective. Her scores on depression rating scales dropped the morning after the device was turned on. And perhaps more importantly, she felt dramatic changes in her mood. During her first time getting the stimulation, she laughed out loud in the lab. “And everyone in the room went, ‘Oh my god,’ because that’s the first time I spontaneously laughed and smiled, where it wasn’t faked, in five years,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oAgicW"&gt;Sarah’s depression circuit flares up hundreds of times a day, and each time, the implanted device delivers a brief stimulating pulse. In total, she gets around 30 minutes of stimulation each day, Scangos says. Sarah can’t feel the pulses, but she said she does have a general idea of when they’re happening throughout the day. “There’s a sense of alertness and energy or positivity that I’ll feel,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eAferA"&gt;Despite the overwhelming success for Sarah, this trial was just a first demonstration of this approach. The device used in the trial isn’t authorized to treat depression — it was originally designed to treat epilepsy and was used in the trial under an investigational device exemption from the FDA. “We have a lot of work ahead of us as a field to validate this result to see if it’s actually something that will be enduring as a treatment option,” said Edward Chang, an author on the study and the chairman of the department of neurosurgery at UCSF. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="d1q15y"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“a lot of these approaches we consider a last resort”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DmX9bR"&gt;If it proves to work for other people, it would likely be used only after trying all other options, Chang says. Surgery — especially brain surgery — is always a risk. For patients with Parkinson’s and epilepsy, patients who go that route have generally tried every other treatment. “For now, a lot of these approaches we consider a last resort,” Chang said. It’s an expensive approach, as well — the device used in this study typically costs &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2013/11/16/245468383/new-medical-device-treats-epilepsy-with-a-well-timed-zap"&gt;between $35,000 and $40,000&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="x9PAaf"&gt;But even just this demonstration could help push our general understanding of depression forward. The team was able to identify circuitry in the brain involved in at least one person’s depressive symptoms, and that circuitry could be shared by other patients. Having foundational information about depression circuits could help develop non-surgical strategies that target similar areas. “Having this information and knowledge we think is going to go far beyond this application,” Chang said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M4C388"&gt;Sarah thinks her success could also help cut through some of the stigma around depression. Going through the study helped Sarah reframe her relationship with the disease, she said. For her whole life, she said she’d internalized some of the idea that she should be able to feel better if she picked herself up and tried hard enough. “We tried every treatment possible, and I had such a positive attitude through all of it, and none of it worked. And it just reinforced the depression, and made me feel like I was the world’s worst patient, and that was my own personal moral failing,” she said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gxsYFF"&gt;The trial changed that and helped the constant refrain from her doctors — that her depression was a disease in her brain — fully sink in. “By the end of this I went, ‘Oh my god, this is no different than someone with Parkinson’s,’” Sarah said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qbWUnV"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube Music will launch free background listening starting in Canada</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hCS0PP8jNbuypyRbk4vOZm5qOas=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948062/acastro_180322_1777_youtube_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="s4Gq5M"&gt;YouTube Music is lifting one of its most annoying limitations — but only in Canada. Today, YouTube announced that beginning November 3rd, customers in Canada will be able to continue listening to their music in the background while doing other tasks on their phone or when the screen is off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RS57Pp"&gt;Background listening will support both the standard ad-supported, personalized radio mixes and any uploaded content you’ve added to your account. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qmqOhT"&gt;This is the first time that YouTube Music has offered the feature without requiring that customers step up to a Premium subscription to get it. As for when listeners in other countries can expect to get the same convenience, for now, YouTube is only saying to “stay tuned for additional information and expansion plans.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="2L8hAg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Music lovers rejoice!  Background listening is coming to the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/youtubemusic?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@YouTubeMusic&lt;/a&gt; app, and    will be the first to enjoy this new feature starting Nov 3! Get radio-like listening with your screen off and don’t stop the music!     &lt;a href="https://t.co/GPwRMcVhp1"&gt;https://t.co/GPwRMcVhp1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Google Canada (@googlecanada) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/googlecanada/status/1445025116614709255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WjtsgN"&gt;Free background listening is table stakes among YouTube Music’s competitors, including Spotify, Apple Music, Pandora, Tidal, and others, so this is an area where YouTube lags its rivals. Hopefully, that expansion will get underway sooner than later. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QhDtOY"&gt;Even if background playback comes to the free tier, YouTube Music Premium still has other benefits: offline downloads is the big one, but you also get to listen without any ads and seamlessly switch between regular audio and music videos. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Some must-have Nintendo Switch games are $20 off at several retailers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OP-wdeSftWgDpWegiGTX6IdzBPg=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948046/MHRISE_Gathering_Hub_Canteen.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZlBczm"&gt;This is a big week for the Nintendo Switch. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22690483/metroid-dread-nintendo-switch-oled-console-hands-on-preview"&gt;Switch with an OLED screen and &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; launch Friday, October 8th. Whether you’re a Switch veteran, or you’re prepping for your first console with the $350 OLED model, there are some excellent deals on must-have, cartridge-based titles you should know about. &lt;em&gt;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword HD&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;New Pokémon Snap&lt;/em&gt; are each $20 off. Amazon is the only retailer honoring this deal for all three games, but Best Buy and Walmart are hosting some deals, too. &lt;em&gt;Monster Hunter Rise&lt;/em&gt; is $20 off, but only at GameStop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3KSEqI"&gt;All of these are noteworthy deals because they’re rarely discounted games. Nintendo sometimes hosts price cuts, but only for a select batch of games — many of which have been available since the Switch launched a handful of years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="MRMOxx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10660223"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="MDXV7k"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10241211"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="6aOgty"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10283625"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="0EdGQj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10415477"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ga2waH"&gt;Outside of Nintendo’s world, the Apple AirPods Pro are back down to one of their lowest prices yet. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZPC9QD4/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon is selling these wireless earbuds for $179&lt;/a&gt;, down from their normal $249 price. It’s not tough to find a decent deal on this model, but it rarely goes below this price point, outside of Black Friday, at least. In case you didn’t know, these high-end AirPods have active noise cancellation, excellent sound quality, and their case can charge via Lightning or wirelessly on a Qi charger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="4EcugC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9513673"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wEebVp"&gt;If over-ear headphones are more your style, the Beats Studio 3 noise-canceling headphones in a few colorways are steeply discounted at Amazon. Originally $350, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio3-Wireless-Over%E2%80%91Ear-Headphones/dp/B085296FLT?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;some of the color options are available today for $170&lt;/a&gt;.

    <title>Blue Origin is officially sending William Shatner to space</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="PM Jacinda Ardern Attends Rocket Lab Factory Opening" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BtEUPDmUVwJsNb1MGWyuV82mMOA=/0x0:4861x3241/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69947827/1051924568.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Phil Walter/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="to6ga4"&gt;Jeff Bezos’ spaceflight venture &lt;a href="https://www.blueorigin.com/news/shatner-powers-announced-ns18"&gt;Blue Origin is launching William Shatner&lt;/a&gt; — aka Captain James T. Kirk of the USS Enterprise — to space on the company’s New Shepard rocket. At 90 years old, he’ll become the oldest person to fly to space, surpassing legendary aviator Wally Funk, who flew on the first crewed flight of New Shepard this summer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCuLy0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.tmz.com/2021/09/24/william-shatner-going-space-jeff-bezos-blue-origin/"&gt;TMZ first broke the news&lt;/a&gt; that Shatner would be flying on the next New Shepard flight, which is currently scheduled for October 12th out of Blue Origin’s launch facility in West Texas. The outlet claimed the Shatner’s flight will be filmed as part of a documentary. Shatner will be joined by two other customers announced earlier by Blue Origin: Chris Boshuizen, a former NASA engineer who co-founded the small satellite company Planet Labs, and Glen de Vries, the co-founder of software company Medidata and vice chair of life sciences at Dassault Systèmes, a French software company. Blue Origin also announced today that Audrey Powers, the company’s vice president of mission and flight operations, will become the fourth passenger on the flight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kMrue4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;At 90 years old, he’ll become the oldest person to fly to space&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bphwRI"&gt;This will be the second flight of New Shepard to carry people to the edge of space and back, as Blue Origin transitions into regular commercial flights of its suborbital rocket. After many years of test flights, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/20/22582735/blue-origin-jeff-bezos-space-launch-landing"&gt;the vehicle carried its first humans to space in July&lt;/a&gt; — a crew that consisted of Funk, Jeff Bezos, his brother Mark Bezos, and a Dutch teenager named Oliver Daemen, whose father paid an undisclosed sum for the ticket.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="se60iH"&gt;The New Shepard rocket is designed to launch vertically from Earth, carrying up to four passengers in a crew capsule on top. It then climbs above an altitude of roughly 62 miles (100 kilometers) over the Earth, where the planet’s thin atmosphere gives way to the vacuum of space. While in the sky, the capsule and the rocket separate, and the passengers inside feel a few brief minutes of weightlessness. Both parts of the vehicle fall back to Earth; the rocket lands upright after reigniting its main engine and the capsule lands under three main parachutes. All in all, the flight lasts about 11 minutes, from liftoff to capsule touchdown. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9yfrsz"&gt;Shatner’s announcement comes just a few days after current and former employees at Blue Origin &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702335/jeff-bezos-employees-essay-blue-origin-toxic-workplace"&gt;published a public essay alleging systemic sexual harassment&lt;/a&gt; and an unsafe work culture at the company. The essay claimed that at least one major executive had sexually harassed employees before getting fired for groping a female worker. The employees also expressed concern over the safety of Blue Origin’s New Shepard vehicle, citing a culture where competition was prioritized over safety, in which workers feared retaliation for raising concerns.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0VbWWe"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Watch Series 7 launches October 15th, preorders begin on Friday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VYJLsuxRPAJ9WlsPRgRLGPEsDnw=/0x47:1960x1354/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69947813/Apple_watch_series7_availability_hero_10052021.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Watch Series 7 includes a bigger display.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DEXMH2"&gt;Apple &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/apple-watch-series-7-orders-start-friday-october-8/"&gt;is opening up preorders&lt;/a&gt; for its Apple Watch Series 7 on Friday, October 8th, with the devices set to ship on October 15th. Apple first revealed the Watch Series 7 at an event last month, but the company simply said it would be available later this fall. Preorders for the Apple Watch Series 7 will now begin at 5AM PT / 8AM ET on Friday, October 8th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U4rsJI"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/14/22667395/apple-watch-series-7-price-specs-redesign-announcement"&gt;Apple Watch Series 7 includes a display&lt;/a&gt; that goes virtually to the edge of the case, with more rounded corners and a softer design. The Series 7 now comes in 41mm and 45mm sizes, up 1mm from the Series 6. The bezels around the display are just 1.7mm, and the always-on mode is 70 percent brighter than the Series 6.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new Contour watchface for the Watch Series 7.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="CqsEmC"&gt;Apple has also created a variety of new watchfaces to take advantage of the larger screens on the Apple Watch Series 7. An improved modular watchface lets you view activity ring details alongside the regular complications found on the regular modular watchface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DCCHDc"&gt;The screen size is really the big change to the Apple Watch Series 7, alongside watchOS 8 improvements like better outdoor cycling support, fall support in workouts, and some Fitness Plus upgrades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8NqShL"&gt;The Apple Watch Series 7 will start at $399 and will be sold alongside the Watch Series 3 at $199. If you buy a Watch equipped with cellular service, whether through Apple.com or directly from a carrier, there’s also a $100 rebate available after activation with T-Mobile/Sprint or Verizon. Preorders for the Apple Watch Series 7 start on October 8th, and devices will start shipping on October 15th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zALDC9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 10:45AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information regarding cellular activation and rebates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to watch the 2021 League of Legends World Championship</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="CHINA-ESPORT-GAMES-LEAGUE" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7mVma0igVVIOLj3A5I2Nb1Ojou4=/0x0:5262x3508/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69947751/1229376555.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by HECTOR RETAMAL/AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5fUFRE"&gt;The 2021 &lt;em&gt;League of Legends &lt;/em&gt;World Championship (aka Worlds) kicks off tomorrow, October 5th, marking the beginning of a month-long tournament where 22 of the best &lt;em&gt;League of Legends teams&lt;/em&gt; will face off to take home the Summoner’s Cup. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7r2Fmy"&gt;While Worlds is one of the biggest esports competitions on the planet, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; isn’t exactly the easiest game to start watching. This time of year is one of the best times to jump in, though, as you get to see the best teams at their peak.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VJQSxf"&gt;If you want to learn more about the game — or are a longtime fan who just wants to know more about Worlds before it starts — we’ve put together this primer for you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tIA5YU"&gt;What is Worlds?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="RoNnGJ"&gt;Worlds is the concluding tournament in the &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; esports year. Teams from around the globe have qualified for the event after having successful seasons in their local leagues. Think of it sort of like the Champions League in soccer; all year long, teams compete locally for the chance to face off against the best from other regions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gXd3Ni"&gt;This year, Worlds takes place &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22649691/league-of-legends-world-championships-2021-europe"&gt;in Reykjavík, Iceland&lt;/a&gt;, at the Laugardalshöll indoor sporting arena. The location means that if you’re in the US, games might take place in the morning or early afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YeqOwM"&gt;No fans will be in attendance at the matches themselves due to COVID-19 restrictions. The event was originally going to take place in China, but &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; developer Riot Games had to move the location &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22638914/league-of-legends-world-championships-2021-moved-china-europe"&gt;in the 11th hour&lt;/a&gt; due to travel restrictions and COVID protocols.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="6QtXXk"&gt;What are the rules?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="icqFIl"&gt;Here is a very basic explanation of &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a strategy game pitting two teams of five “champions” against each other. Each champion is controlled by one player, and each has different abilities. The goal of a game is for one team to break into the other team’s base and destroy a giant crystal, called the Nexus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ND50h8"&gt;Players can’t just walk in and whack on their opponent’s Nexus from the beginning of the game, though. The bases are guarded by turrets that shoot powerful magic energy, auto-spawning soldier units that march toward the other team’s base, and, of course, the enemy team. Over the course of a game, which typically lasts about 30-45 minutes, players will level up, earn in-game money to buy items, skirmish against the enemy team, and, eventually, attack the Nexus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MRqxkq"&gt;I’m glossing over a lot of what happens in a typical &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; match, but that’s the gist of it. For a short video explainer with more detail, check out Riot’s &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4bf7pjcYYw"&gt;introductory video&lt;/a&gt; made for last year’s tournament. For a slightly deeper dive, I recommend &lt;a href="https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/29915901/league-101-league-legends-beginner-guide"&gt;ESPN’s written article and video&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9XoYtY"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l4bf7pjcYYw?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="T2238L"&gt;Who should I root for?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mmRr2b"&gt;Like any sport, that’s not an easy question to answer. There are big dogs and underdogs, and you might decide to root for a team based on their name, their logo, or because you think one player is exciting to watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GLUBRW"&gt;If you want to root for a US team, there are three at Worlds this year, representing the League Championship Series (LCS): 100 Thieves, which &lt;a href="https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/100-thieves-capture-2021-lcs-championship-become-fifth-team-ever-to-win-a-north-american-title"&gt;just won the 2021 LCS Championship&lt;/a&gt;, Team Liquid, a consistent powerhouse in the LCS, and Cloud9, one of the most storied teams in the league. (Cloud9 punched their ticket to Worlds by beating longtime rival TSM.) Europe is represented by &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; European Championship (LEC) teams MAD Lions, Rogue, and Fnatic. (Fnatic also earned their Worlds trip in dramatic fashion, beating one of its rivals, G2 Esports.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9g0g6a"&gt;They’ll be up against some tough competition, though. Last year’s champions, Korea’s Damwon Gaming, have qualified again, as has Korea’s T1, the home of perhaps the most famous League of Legends player of all time, &lt;a href="https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Faker"&gt;Faker&lt;/a&gt;. The four teams from China’s &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; Pro League (LPL), including the 2019 world champions FunPlus Phoenix and LPL 2021 champions Edward Gaming, could prove to be formidable opponents as well. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O8J3Fl"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dot Esports&lt;/em&gt; has a good rundown of &lt;a href="https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/all-teams-qualified-worlds-2021"&gt;the 22 teams that have qualified for Worlds&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zwXV6M"&gt;Tournament Format&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="f7yfrz"&gt;Play-Ins&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cTyyHF"&gt;Competition starts with Play-Ins, where 10 teams will compete for four spots in the Group Stage. The 10 teams will be split into two groups of five. Each team will play one match against the other teams in their group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DYa4Db"&gt;The team with the best record in each group automatically moves on to the Group Stage. To determine who gets the final two Group Stage spots, the third- and fourth-place teams in each group will play against each other, and then, the winners of those matches will play the second-place teams in each Play-In group. Whoever wins advances to the Group Stage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="STk4uG"&gt;Play-Ins kick off at 7AM ET on October 5th and will run through October 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="oDcNMS"&gt;Group Stage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6qdK2B"&gt;The Group Stage pits the best teams in the world against each other in four groups of four. Three teams in each group have already been locked in, and one of each of the Play-In victors will be added to the groups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6Yxynx"&gt;Each team will play each other team in their group twice. The two teams with the best record in each group will move on to the Knockout Stage, which is the final stage of the tournament leading up to the championship match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LPX5mu"&gt;Groups go on for a bit longer than the Play-Ins. The first round of matches runs from October 11th through the 13th, while the second takes place from October 15th through the 18th. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="RFsmi8"&gt;Knockout Stage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uedOfA"&gt;Finally, there’s the Knockout Stage, where the top eight teams from Groups vie for the championship. In this stage, teams will compete in a single-elimination bracket, playing each other in best-of-five matchups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gu5UzW"&gt;The games take place over three weekends: a quarterfinals round set for October 22nd through 25th, a semifinals round scheduled for October 30th and 31st, and the finals match on November 6th to determine the world champion. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q3ONFJ"&gt;If you don’t tune into anything else, consider checking out the Knockout Stage. The high caliber of teams that have advanced that far are almost always worth watching. That doesn’t mean there aren’t blowouts or mismatches — the champions in both &lt;a href="https://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/25164094/invictus-gaming-sweeps-fnatic-3-0-win-league-legends-world-championship"&gt;2018&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2019/11/10/funplus-phoenix-win-the-league-of-legends-world-championship-in-a-3-0-stomp/"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt; won in 3-0 sweeps — but you can expect to see some very exciting matchups during these three weekends of the tournament.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="eXzEp4"&gt;How to watch and schedule&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="cVJJSS"&gt;You can watch games live on the &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/riotgames"&gt;Riot Games Twitch channel&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/lolesports"&gt;&lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt; esports YouTube channel&lt;/a&gt;, and at &lt;a href="https://lolesports.com/"&gt;https://lolesports.com/&lt;/a&gt;. And if you want to see the full schedule, &lt;a href="https://lolesports.com/schedule?leagues=worlds"&gt;it’s right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HG75eU"&gt;And don’t miss out on the cool graphics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Y9alJv"&gt;Riot usually uses Worlds to put on a spectacular show that can be as interesting as the competition itself. The 2017 Worlds finals ceremony included &lt;a href="https://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-world-finals-had-a-freaking-dragon-1820142112"&gt;a giant virtual dragon&lt;/a&gt;. 2019’s opening ceremony &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/11/20959206/league-of-legends-worlds-2019-opening-ceremony-holograms-holonet"&gt;featured holograms&lt;/a&gt;. And last year, Riot made an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/24/21529317/league-of-legends-world-championship-high-tech-stage-riot-mandalorian"&gt;astonishing mixed reality stage&lt;/a&gt;. Each year, Riot seems to do everything it can to top the last, so it surely has some impressive technological wizardry up its sleeve for the 2021 event.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The very big eagle that escaped from the National Aviary in Pittsburgh is back home</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AC4-4nlfGeJaL5K95CU8tEj9ZUw=/0x81:940x708/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69942472/kodiak_the_stellers_sea_eagle.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Kodiak (Kody) the Steller’s sea eagle, who escaped the National Aviary in Pittsburgh September 29th | &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/National_Aviary/status/1444319155843477508?s=20" target="_blank"&gt;National Aviary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HJJcYY"&gt;A Steller’s sea eagle named Kodiak &lt;a href="https://www.aviary.org/birds-habitats/kodiak-the-stellers-sea-eagle/"&gt;escaped from its enclosure&lt;/a&gt; at the National Aviary in Pittsburgh on September 25th, and thanks to the valiant efforts of the Aviary staff, was found and brought back to the Aviary on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5nAW7V"&gt;According to a &lt;a href="https://www.aviary.org/birds-habitats/kodiak-the-stellers-sea-eagle/"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt; posted to the Aviary website at 8:15PM Sunday, a team of the Aviary’s animal care experts spotted Kodiak — Kody to his friends— in a suburb of Pittsburgh north of the Aviary. The Aviary team used “professional falconry techniques and equipment” to retrieve the bird and bring him home to the Aviary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MTe0Vx"&gt;Kody is a bird that would be difficult to miss: he’s large (although in Pittsburgh we probably wouldn’t call him “giant” because “Giant Eagle” is a grocery store chain here), with a yellow beak, white tail and white feathers on the tops of his wings. He’s bigger than a bald eagle, and has a wingspan of about six feet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OZVeai"&gt;The Steller’s sea eagle (&lt;em&gt;Haliaeetus pelagicus&lt;/em&gt;) typically weighs between 13 and 20 pounds, and stands about four feet tall. It has no natural predators, &lt;a href="https://www.aviary.org/birds-habitats/our-birds/?category=30"&gt;according to the Aviary&lt;/a&gt;, but Kody has lived in captivity for 15 of his 16 years, so he may be a little rusty on the whole hunting/prey thing. Steller’s sea eagles eat fish, and more fish, “scavenged mammals” (ew) and even other birds “when fish is in short supply.”  And in case you wondered, they’re named for German naturalist &lt;a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Georg-W-Steller"&gt;Georg W. Steller&lt;/a&gt;, who encountered the birds on a visit to Alaska in 1741.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JdvQfN"&gt;The Aviary posted frequent updates to social media and kept getting tantalizingly close to retrieving Kody, but he eluded them for more than a week. I was half-hoping Kody might make some kind of majestic appearance at the September 26th Steelers’ game since Heinz Field is not far from the Aviary, and the team was at home against the Bengals (we’re not going to talk about &lt;a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/32292626/cincinnati-bengals-wr-tyler-boyd-says-pittsburgh-steelers-gave-late-loss"&gt;that game&lt;/a&gt; today, though). Alas, he did not. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mb6Kcc"&gt;On Thursday, the Aviary’s animal care experts camped out to monitor his roost in a high tree in the North Park area of the city, and they confirmed he was in good condition. They tried to entice him with some food, but he didn’t come down. But look at this handsome, handsome boi:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SRH2Wa"&gt;Many people— including me, before I moved to Pittsburgh a thousand years ago— don’t know what a hidden gem the National Aviary is, or, that it’s in Pittsburgh. &lt;a href="https://www.aviary.org/programs-encounters/animal-encounters/penguin-encounter/"&gt;Their penguins&lt;/a&gt; are usually the big celebrities (hi, this is &lt;a href="https://www.nhl.com/penguins"&gt;Pittsburgh&lt;/a&gt;), but they also have very cute— as well as very large—owls, eagles, flamingos, falcons, and canaries among other birds. You can sign up for educational “animal encounters” with many  of the birds— I recall visiting when my son was little; we sat in a large auditorium where some birds of prey were flying around, and we got like a popsicle stick with some food on it (I would prefer not to think about what the food actually was) and you’d hold it up until one of the birds swooped down to eat it. Extremely awesome. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ocCzkI"&gt;The Aviary said on Sunday that a veterinary exam found Kody in “excellent” health, and added he was “enjoying healthy meals of fresh meat” while he rests up from his adventure. The Aviary thanked the community for its help locating their missing bird.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SBleJ5"&gt;“The entire team at the National Aviary is extremely relieved to have Kody back, and would like to share our gratitude to the community of supporters who helped in these efforts.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="muZhhM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th 8:45AM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Adds the news of Kodiak’s return to the Aviary&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
