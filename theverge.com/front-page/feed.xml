    <title>Samsung’s latest foldable phone perk is free dessert</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4R5C2YZGCrWt_kyEZiJrMgt-NrI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69151573/vpavic_200907_4181_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z8Zago"&gt;Samsung is giving owners of its foldable phones some free dessert. Specifically, an order of “Chef Daniel Boulud’s signature &lt;a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/daniel-bouluds-madeleines"&gt;Madeleines&lt;/a&gt; and Canelé,” designed by the chef exclusively for &lt;a href="//www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/am/sid/verge/https://www.samsung.com/us/smartphones/galaxy-z-premier/benefits/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Premier program&lt;/a&gt;, which offers Galazy Z Fold and Flip owners free perks in exchange for having bought the luxury-styled phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c1ppMS"&gt;The new perk is being offered in partnership with the Michelin Guide through Boulud’s restaurant, &lt;a href="https://www.danielnyc.com/cuisine"&gt;Daniel&lt;/a&gt; (which itself has two Michelin stars). Samsung’s announcement claims that the dessert in question is valued at $75, which seems like a lot for French pastries, but if you already own a Galaxy foldable, the price tag isn’t something you’ll need to worry about, given that it’s free. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IGpu-z0mcw0De16eOEqspIujx1o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22455352/Screen_Shot_2021_04_19_at_3.36.35_PM.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fgGlFt"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Who doesn’t like free French pastries?&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QSDy62"&gt;The company has been offering additional perks for foldable owners through its Galaxy Z Premier program since it relaunched the service alongside last year’s Galaxy Z Fold 2. And Samsung has since been adding bonus offers for the owners of its most expensive phones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ltk2TI"&gt;In addition to the free snacks (which will take three to four weeks for delivery), Samsung is offering a free year of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Ffounderscard.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F19%2F22392343%2Fsamsung-galaxy-z-premier-program-new-perks-madeleines-canele-free-dessert-founderscard" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;FoundersCard&lt;/a&gt; membership, letting owners join a “community of over 50,000 entrepreneurs and business executives who receive unprecedented benefits and networking opportunities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iB8A3H"&gt;The Galaxy Z Premier program already includes a free six-month trial of LinkedIn’s Premium Career service, a free round of golf through ClubLife, and six months of Obé Fitness. Samsung is also promising that it’ll have “new partners and benefits” to announce in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nextdoor will alert users if it thinks they’re about to post something racist</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SBlStyNIzCSO8KVEMOYQ7GFN22Y=/220x0:1828x1072/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69151295/Anti_racism_blog_header_NEW_2048x1072.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nextdoor&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OONU7q"&gt;Nextdoor &lt;a href="https://blog.nextdoor.com/2021/04/19/nextdoor-launches-anti-racism-notification-to-prevent-discriminatory-language/"&gt;is introducing a new anti-racism notification&lt;/a&gt;, which asks users to reconsider posting content if the app thinks it may be offensive. As with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/18/20871894/nextdoors-kindness-reminder-mean-comments-community-guidelines"&gt;its previous Kindness Reminder&lt;/a&gt;, if a user tries to post something with words or phrases Nextdoor thinks may be objectionable, it will give them the option to edit the post before it actually goes live. The users can, however, ignore the warning and post it anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WvzcR49VvEHe5NApZYOoLi4DQuY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22455207/Anti_racism_blog_header_NEW_2048x1072.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nextdoor&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The notification users may receive if they try to post something containing the phrases “all lives matter,” “blue lives matter,” etc.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LwnUGs"&gt;In the blog post announcing the anti-racism notification, Nextdoor says that its similar Kindness Reminder has reduced “incivil content” by 30 percent. It’s hard to say whether this new feature will be as effective. The example that Nextdoor shows — someone responds to a Black Lives Matter post by saying “all lives matter,” then decides that they’d actually like to hear the person out after seeing the anti-racism notification — doesn’t really seem to match up with real-life behavior. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ISYH1a"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0yLUWsZp5Ug?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hqIQBs"&gt;Nextdoor is probably aware of this. In its &lt;a href="https://help.nextdoor.com/s/article/About-the-anti-racism-notification?language=en_US"&gt;support page for the feature&lt;/a&gt;, the company says that it’s mostly aiming to make sure people are aware that they could be violating the social network’s discrimination policy — according to the announcement blog post, comments about blue lives matter, all lives matter, or white lives matter are already regulated on Nextdoor. While the new notification may not change many people’s minds, hopefully it can at least reduce some of the bad behavior on the platform, making it a safer place for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Dnti1s"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Inside Nextdoor’s ‘Karen problem’","url":"https://www.theverge.com/21283993/nextdoor-app-racism-community-moderation-guidance-protests"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Sen. Tammy Duckworth on hate crimes, racism, and environmental justice  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Senators Schumer, Kaine And Duckworth Address Media At The Capitol" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zy1NKL96-VXQpcVORBH-3Prm0no=/0x0:6533x4355/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69151291/1286220992.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;‘There are structures that are racist in our society.’&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="o3GeFT"&gt;Senator Tammy Duckworth (D-IL) has been tackling racism on multiple fronts recently, particularly against Asian Americans. A bill aimed at curbing anti-Asian hate crimes during the pandemic finally &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/14/us/senate-anti-asian-american-hate-crimes.html"&gt;picked up bipartisan support&lt;/a&gt; last week, which Senator Mazie Hirono (D-HI) sponsored and Duckworth supported. And following criticism from Duckworth and Hirono on a lack of Asian American and Pacific Islanders (AAPI) in his cabinet, President Joe Biden last week &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/14/president-biden-announces-erika-l-moritsugu-as-deputy-assistant-to-the-president-and-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-senior-liaison/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that Erika Moritsugu would step into the role of deputy assistant to the president and Asian American and Pacific Islander senior liaison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RO4Uhq"&gt;In March, Duckworth released a memoir detailing her childhood as a biracial kid growing up in Southeast Asia and Hawaii. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; talked with Duckworth about how those experiences inform her work now, and how she’s navigating her role during a time of dramatic reckoning with racism in America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aIs1rt"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JgBvth"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As an Asian American woman, I’m still reeling from the murders in Atlanta last month, and what feels like a steady stream of attacks against people who look like me and my elders. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tmaEYb"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s it like for you to see the recent rise in violence against Asian Americans, particularly against Asian American women? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="OiYtoE"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I’ve always known that Asian women were targeted.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dxkp5C"&gt;This is something I have been bringing to my colleagues’ attention: the fact that, yes, we have a &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/anti-asian-hate-crimes-increased-nearly-150-2020-mostly-n-n1260264"&gt;150 percent rise&lt;/a&gt; in reported hate crimes against Asian Americans last year alone, about &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/there-were-3-800-anti-asian-racist-incidents-mostly-against-n1261257"&gt;3,800&lt;/a&gt;. Those were just the ones that were reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IR1ivc"&gt;Almost two-thirds of those were against Asian women. And so it’s really affecting how I go about doing what we’re doing. Mazie Hirono and I, along with Senator Richard Blumenthal , are moving forward with this anti Asian racism bill. But one of the things that is going to be an amendment to it is the fact that we need to recognize that, how we classify a crime as being race motivated is really not accurate. So for example, a lot of crimes against AAPIs are listed as robberies or muggings. But if your motivation for who you choose to be your victim for the robbery that you’re about to conduct is based on racism, like you’re choosing Asian American women in particular, or you’re choosing elderly Asian American women like my 80-year-old mom, then that should be reported as a hate crime, not as a mugging or a burglary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lAufCD"&gt;And so for me, watching what has happened this past year... I’ve always known that Asian women were targeted, but to have what little data we have clearly point out that two-thirds of those crimes are directly targeting Asian women really crystallized for me what I have always known instinctively. It bothers me a lot because my mom is very independent and she goes out and she drives and she goes shopping, and I know that she is a potential target, and I worry about her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R4I4A3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I have similar worries about my parents. Thank you for sharing.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="do3iLB"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You’ve also supported the Black Lives Matter movement and have &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.military.com/daily-news/2021/04/14/sen-duckworth-calls-doj-probe-of-brazenly-violent-police-treatment-of-black-army-officer.html"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;asked the DOJ to probe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; into the police treatment of Army Second Lieutenant Caron Nazario, who is Black and Hispanic and was pepper sprayed while in uniform during a traffic stop in Virginia. Can you talk with me about why those issues are important to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ns9JGQ"&gt;We shouldn’t be fighting each other over the one slice of diversity pie. I’m tired of the Black community being pitted against the Latinx community, being pitted against the Asian community. We should all have a seat at the table. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="tfMTEu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We should all have a seat at the table.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ixrSjh"&gt;I tried to learn to be a good ally this past summer in the Black Lives Matter movement, and I learned a lot actually from my own staff members. So I hope that transfers over into my work now as a senator, trying to be each other’s allies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VsU5DX"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You confronted the White House about a lack of AAPI representation in the president’s Cabinet. Why is that a problem? What do you see as the consequences of excluding Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IOKqd8"&gt;I’ve been working with the Biden administration for a long time — like for six months —  setting forward names of well-qualified Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders to be considered for the top Cabinet posts. And I voted for every nominee they put forward. I voted for every single one, whether they were white, Black, Native American, Latinx. Time and time again I was told that there was going to be a Cabinet-level AAPI nominee. And then we had 15 Cabinet secretaries nominated and not a single one of them were AAPI. And there were well-qualified AAPI candidates who were not even interviewed. That was very frustrating to me, and it led to a conversation where a member of the White House team basically said, “Well you have Kamala, that should be enough.” I was incredibly offended, and I said wait a minute, you would never say, “We have a white male president, that should be enough. We shouldn’t need any more white male Cabinet secretary nominees.” You wouldn’t say that to the Black Caucus. You wouldn’t say that to the Latinx caucus. Why would you say that to Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="VhqPde"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I was incredibly offended.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="IY34vC"&gt;It’s important to have representation because government needs to look like the people that it represents. This is the first time in 20 years that we do not have a single Cabinet secretary in either a Republican or a Democratic administration that is AAPI. That’s not good for the nation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ltn7se"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In your memoir, you describe how being biracial shaped your experiences growing up in Southeast Asia. And you write about how America’s history of segregation and racism might even have influenced your American dad’s decision not to return to the US sooner — since his marriage to your mom, who is Thai Chinese, would have been illegal in some states when they met in the 1960s. How have all those experiences shaped your work today?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6hk5wO"&gt;Well, if you read my memoir you know that there are themes of both prejudice and racism, but then there’s also structural racism that existed. My parents’ marriage would not have been deemed legal when they met. So there are structures that are racist in our society — even if we maybe never thought of them as racist — and that really affected how I look at the work that I do today. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FX5WfU4abUwjQGYGTl22E8PEnj8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22454752/9.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Tammy Duckworth’s office&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Duckworth’s new memoir describes her experience growing up biracial. Her father was born in the US and met her mother in Thailand.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="LFZDsB"&gt;For example with environmental justice, we continue to grant permits for polluting industries on a one-off basis without looking at them cumulatively. So you have Black and brown communities exposed to far greater amounts of pollutants because that’s where we’ve always put the petcoke industry, now we’re going to put the ethylene oxide industry, and then we’re going to do manganese recycling there. And it just keeps going into the same communities because the structure of how we do permitting doesn’t look at cumulative effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="uLm46m"&gt;So when I started the Environmental Justice Caucus with Senator Tom Carper and Senator Cory Booker, I understood instinctively that there are systems in place that are inherently unequal, and that we have to lift up communities of color to an equal footing, and then make an investment across the board. It’s not that we’re going to say “Okay, we’re going to give a wealthy white suburb $50,000 and we’re going to also give a poor Black suburb $50,000. That’s equal, right?” Well, no — because of history and how things have been, one is not on an equal footing. So I think it really does speak to what I’m trying to do today and how I approach my job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oRXVbL"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfEcfJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best deals on 4K TVs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rmtJvuBPnkpZu39fUo0GC39vOAg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69151213/jbareham_170613_1754_0016_main_04.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;TCL 6-series Roku TV | Photo by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vtXpJr"&gt;There are a lot of 4K TVs available to choose from, complete with a wide variety of prices and performance. But even if your budget is less than $500, you can get a good 4K TV in a bigger size than you might expect. Whether you want a secondary TV for a bedroom or a high-end, next-gen-gaming-ready OLED, we’ve picked out the best TV deals across four common categories:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="zUfn7z"&gt;Best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="sFCZyo"&gt;Best budget 4K TVs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="3C0Il4"&gt;Best OLED TVs &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jVQclk"&gt;Best 4K TVs for the PS5 and Xbox Series X&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="d2lRkA"&gt;We will provide regular updates to this post so be sure to check back regularly for the most up-to-date info on the deals available. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="f9MF2Z"&gt;Best 4K TV deals for most people&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mszLRr"&gt;A 55-inch TV is the most popular size available now. It is not too big, nor is it too small, making it a safe size if you’re looking to upgrade the TV in a living room or bedroom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NyQnT"&gt;Vizio’s M-series 4K TVs have QLED panels, making the lineup one of the better options for color contrast and accuracy. They include four HDMI 2.0 ports, which makes it easy to hook up a variety of set-top boxes or gaming consoles at the same time. This TV is available in four sizes (50, 55, 65, and 70 inches). Best Buy has the M-series on sale in various sizes, but only if you log into a (free) My Best Buy account. The 55-inch model is &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738226127738129233#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;available for $480 ($20 off)&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="X3LwO3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10255489"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JbaBai"&gt;The TCL 6-Series R635 model is a good option if you are looking for a reasonably priced TV in terms of price and performance. This model also includes &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363318/tcl-2020-5-6-series-4k-tvs-qled-mini-led-backlighting-gaming-ps5-xbox-series-x" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Mini-LED backlighting&lt;/a&gt;, which brings better brightness and contrast while in use. The R635 model in the 55-inch size is available for $698 at &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FTCL-55-6-Series-4K-UHD-Dolby-Vision-HDR-QLED-Roku-Smart-TV-55R635%2F796005169&amp;amp;subid1=BestTVDealsDeals04122021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt; right now. You can also get it in 65- or 75-inch sizes if you want something bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="y8BpYm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10327662"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MPfLVC"&gt;Samsung’s Crystal TU-8000 series line of TVs offers many features, such as multiple screen mirroring. It’s available in a wide variety of sizes, ranging from 43 all the way to 85 inches. Right now, the 55-inch model is &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Crystal-TU-8000-Built/dp/B084JH43DJ?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$498 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, which is $52 off its usual price of $550.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="9SocSo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444776"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EYhbja"&gt;Best TV deals on a budget&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="zWYgij"&gt;You don’t have to spend a lot for a 4K TV: $500 or less can still get good image quality. This includes Toshiba’s 50-inch Smart FireTV Edition 4K LED, which normally retails for $380. As the name implies, it offers the option to stream content on services like Disney Plus or Netflix and includes the option to watch live TV. You can get a &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737687233984981481#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;50-inch model for $400 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; or step up to the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737687411898346509#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model&lt;/a&gt; for just $30 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="cW4VPC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10444802"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="74eOSC"&gt;TCL also competitively priced televisions, and its 4-series line is one of the more affordable options on the market. The S435 model features a built-in Roku interface; dual-band Wi-Fi; support for Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri voice assistants; and HDR10. You can get the 43-inch model for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/TCL-4K-Smart-LED-43S435/dp/B08DHDS4T3?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$258 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Ftcl-43-34-class-4-series-4k-uhd-hdr-smart-roku-tv-8211-43s435%2F-%2FA-52177069&amp;amp;subid1=Best4KTVDeals4192021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$260 at Target&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HtnMEi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9740197"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I7fy7f"&gt;Hisense’s H6510 model is a good option if you want to buy a 4K LED TV at a competitive price. A Best Buy exclusive, the H6510 includes Android TV software built in and has three HDMI ports. It comes in three additional sizes (65, 75, and 85 inches). Right now, you can get the &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737592810150199993#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model for $380 ($20 off its regular price)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ffRx8b"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10265690"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qm44jO"&gt;Best deals on OLED TVs&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="vbJRlM"&gt;OLED televisions offer the best image quality in a mainstream TV. LG’s BX line supports HDMI 2.1, meaning this TV is perfect for people looking to take advantage of their next-gen consoles, the PS5 or Xbox Series X. You can get it in either the 55- or 65-inch sizes and save up to $200 on it, depending on the size. The popular &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-OLED55BXPUA-Alexa-Built-Ultra/dp/B0829RXYSN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;55-inch model is currently $1,297 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OMVgrF"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JvNG4d"&gt;Sony’s A8H OLED TV has sterling picture quality and contrast, and it runs Google’s Android TV software. It comes in two sizes, 55 and 65 inches, and the starting price is $1,900. But you can get the 55-inch model for as low as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-A8H-55-Inch-Compatibility/dp/B084KQFNBX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,498 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1545415-REG%2Fsony_xbr55a8h_a8h_55_class_hdr.html#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H Photo&lt;/a&gt;. The 65-inch is also on sale for $2,298 at B&amp;amp;H Photo, about $200 off its usual $2,500 price tag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="OvRhzP"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733790"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MB8PX4"&gt;Despite the high price tag, LG’s Gallery Series GX OLED is a good television for people looking to mimic a cinematic experience. It also includes built-in Google Assistant and Alexa, and for those who also want to use this TV for gaming, it does include Nvidia G-Sync and HDMI 2.1 support so that it can take full advantage of the RTX 30-series cards or Sony’s and Microsoft’s next-gen gaming consoles. You can get the 55-inch for as low as &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B086TSW95T?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,797 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLG-GX-55-inch-Class-with-Gallery-Design-4K-Smart-OLED-TV-w-AI-ThinQ-54-6-Diag-OLED55GXPUA%2F152371849%3Firgwc%3D1%26sourceid%3Dimp_33DRwsUfoxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkESb%253AWnWQ-N3A0%26veh%3Daff%26wmlspartner%3Dimp_1943169%26clickid%3D33DRwsUfoxyLULpwUx0Mo387UkESb%253AWnWQ-N3A0%26sharedid%3D%26affiliates_ad_id%3D565706%26campaign_id%3D9383&amp;amp;subid1=BestTVDeals04142021&amp;amp;sharedid=verge" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Walmart&lt;/a&gt;. There are also 65- and 70-inch models available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lpiA85"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10445785"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O5Vjam"&gt;4K TVs for the Sony PS5 and Microsoft Xbox Series X &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="OxIzpR"&gt;Sony’s PS5 and Microsoft’s Xbox Series X can play 4K games with HDR at up to 120 frames per second. So naturally, if you don’t have a TV that takes full advantage of the consoles, it might be time to upgrade. For the best experience, you’ll want a TV that supports HDMI 2.1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JEEOlw"&gt;Vizio recently released its first OLED TV, and it is a good option for people looking to buy a TV that takes full advantage of the PS5 and Xbox Series X hardware. It supports HDR and HDMI 2.1, so you can game at up to 120Hz in 4K. &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1738235849043083583#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; currently has a deal on this TV where you can buy the 65-inch for $1,900 ($100 off). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="xr7I2E"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9733767"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3Nkhmv"&gt;Alternatively, there is LG’s CX series of TVs. It includes support for Nvidia’s G-Sync and AMD’s FreeSync adaptive sync technologies and a low 1ms response time. The big difference between the CX and BX is the CX line can have slightly better brightness, which is better for HDR content. It comes in three sizes: 55, 65, and 77 inches. Right now, you can grab a 65-inch for &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0817H41YN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;as low as $1,950 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="F5GsVe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9534696"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5fwgNK"&gt;Samsung’s Q80T is one of the best LCD TVs on the market, and it is also a good option for the next-gen console early adopters. It includes vibrant and accurate colors, supports 120Hz gaming, and includes a variable refresh rate. Right now, you can get a 65-inch model for &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1724766383525907740#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$1,600 at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1737688993629547145#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Samsung&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best phone to buy right now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="iPhone 12, Galaxy S21 Ultra, Galaxy S21 Plus, iPhone 12 Mini, Galaxy Z Fold 2, and Pixel 4A 5G" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2xXWN-t57Q2UyqQv662Bj9KonMk=/158x0:1883x1150/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68490961/Best_Phone_Grid_2021_2.7.png" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Buying a new phone can be a chore, but we’ve done the work for you&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="OauOjO"&gt;In 2021, buying the best phone means looking for something that should last you a few years. Smartphones’ upgrade cycles are slowing down for a reason: even at lower prices, it’s getting harder and harder to buy a lemon. In other words, you don’t have to spend a huge amount to get something great, as a bunch of great smartphones are available for around $800. It’s harder than ever to decide between everything in that range, but for most people, our pick for the best phone is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLLWfM"&gt;Luckily, if you’re looking for a no-compromise smartphone at any price, the choices over a thousand dollars are much clearer. If you like Android, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is incredibly good. And if you want to get the best smartphone on a budget, you can find something really good for under $500 or even under $400. For those recommendations, you can &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/this-is-my-next/2018/7/27/17619088/best-cheap-phone-budget-iphone-android"&gt;check out our guide to budget smartphones&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IJpqAH"&gt;A great smartphone will last you for several years (at least), have a great camera, a nice screen, long battery life, and be fast enough to do all the work, social networking, and gaming you want to pack into a day. Believe it or not, all of those things are easier than ever to find in a phone — so picking the best one is often a matter of degrees or preferences. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6I7S1w"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9527699" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple iPhone 12.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="DK8L4P"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21522988/iphone-12-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WnjecW"&gt;Best iPhone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="wW82H0"&gt;Apple has released four different variations of the iPhone 12, more than it ever has at one time. Despite all of those choices, the traditional, regular model is still a good pick. The regular iPhone 12, which starts at around $830 for a 64GB model, is the best smartphone for most people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VycfOO"&gt;The 12 has the same overall design, the same processor, the same wireless charging, the same Face ID system, the same 5G support, the same front camera, and the same main and wide-angle rear cameras as the pricier 12 Pro but for hundreds of dollars less. On top of all that, it comes in five colors, one more than you can choose from in the Pro models.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="wUSPTz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The iPhone 12 balances a big screen with manageable size well&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vgfddW"&gt;Compared to the iPhone 12 mini, the iPhone 12 has a noticeably roomier display and a bigger battery — two things that are important to many people. At 6.1 inches, it’s big enough to make watching video and reading text comfortable and engaging, but it isn’t so big that it’s terribly hard to use in one hand or fit in your pocket. Battery life is also very good; you can reliably expect this phone to last all day without needing to charge up before bed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3CpBRz"&gt;The 12 gives up the telephoto camera that’s available on the 12 Pro and 12 Pro Max, but that’s something not everyone will miss. The iPhone 12’s camera system is the best you can get in this price range and is excellent at most anything you’d use it for. It also has the ability to shoot Dolby Vision HDR for brighter and more dynamic video.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UaJMCS"&gt;Since the 12 has Apple’s latest smartphone processor, the A14 Bionic, it has extremely fast performance and fluid animations. It also has a sleeker, more modern design than the previous iPhone 11 or iPhone XR, which feel frumpy in comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A4Yr6F"&gt;The base iPhone 12 comes with 64GB of storage, but as usual with an iPhone, it’s not expandable, so we recommend buying the 128GB model for only $50 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qsBso"&gt;In all, the iPhone 12 is an easy choice for most people: it offers top-level performance, design, and camera features, while providing reliable battery life for less money than other options on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="eK0QNl"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is the most powerful Android phone you can get" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YeqTG9TtdMdfvxPoil_iBKPmKfQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22248903/vpavic_210119_4377_0153.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra is the most powerful Android phone you can get.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="2t2EER"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22241506/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-review-camera-price"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="GxgXJO"&gt;Best Android phone to buy in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="KXRoWF"&gt;If neither size nor price is a concern, the best Android phone you can buy right now is the Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra. With a big 6.8-inch screen and the best cameras you can get on an Android phone, it’s the no-compromise pick. In some cases, its cameras can even best the iPhone 12 Pro Max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zc0tSW"&gt;The Galaxy S21 Ultra comes with the latest and best specs you can get on Android. It has the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 processor, which is the fastest you can get on Android. It features support for S Pen styluses if you prefer to use a pen with your phone, although it’s sold separately. The screen has a high refresh rate, which makes scrolling much smoother. It also has a huge battery that will last two days without much effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kNdn1U"&gt;Samsung updated the design of the S21 Ultra, with a metal rail that curves naturally into the camera bump on the back. It is the best-looking big phone you can get right now. However, we can’t say we like Samsung’s software as much, which at the moment is a bit cluttered and features ads in places like the weather app. For a sleeker experience the OnePlus 9 Pro would be a good choice; the Ultra beats it on screen and camera quality, but it’s a good device all-around and offers a more grown-up take on Android OS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AOuzp6"&gt;That camera bump houses four cameras: a regular wide-angle with a 108-megapixel sensor, an ultrawide, and two different telephoto lenses. This makes it an incredibly versatile camera system that also has a ton of advanced video features like Pro modes and 8K recording.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b68lAw"&gt;Starting at $1,199.99, the Galaxy S21 Ultra is a very expensive phone. Thankfully, Samsung phones are discounted early and often. If you are in the market for one, it’s worth looking around for a deal before buying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="IyREhz"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Samsung Galaxy S21 is often available for less than full retail price" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CuDtdwJTwbMBxwvpw_1cGz7AwFA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22258914/vpavic_210118_4378_0170.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy S21 is often available for less than full retail price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wFbUhR"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22252460/samsung-galaxy-s21-review-price-camera-processor"&gt;Samsung Galaxy S21 / S21 Plus&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kVG4SO"&gt;Best Android phone to find a deal for&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="bwT4eg"&gt;Although the Samsung Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus don’t post the big numbers the S21 Ultra does, they are still our picks right now for best Android phones under a thousand bucks. The regular Galaxy S21 with a 6.2-inch screen starts at $800 while the Plus version with a 6.7-inch screen starts at $1,000. However, both are frequently discounted with either price drops or bundles, so these are great candidates for hunting down sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7grLVJ"&gt;The Galaxy S21 and S21 Plus are essentially identical phones with three differences: screen size, battery size, and materials. We’ve reviewed the regular Galaxy S21 and found it to be a very competent phone even though you could argue it’s a minor refresh over last year’s Galaxy S20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EbSGE"&gt;However, Samsung refreshed the important part: the processor is the same Snapdragon 888 as the Ultra. That means the Galaxy S21 is super fast and should last more than a couple of years without slowing down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xHvvhF"&gt;There are likely more great Android phones coming soon but right now, the Android phone that strikes the best balance of features and price is the S21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="oL8ji7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326026"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="1sQvkt"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10326050"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max is huge, but it has the best camera system on a smartphone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="QzSdip"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21555901/iphone-12-pro-max-review"&gt;Apple iPhone 12 Pro Max&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="FUQpEY"&gt;Best phone for photography and video in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="G0d3Pt"&gt;The iPhone 12 Pro Max has the best camera system you can currently get on a smartphone. Its three rear cameras — standard wide, ultrawide, and telephoto — combine with Apple’s image processing to produce stunning images, even in poor lighting. If camera quality is your most important factor when buying a phone, the 12 Pro Max is where you should be spending your money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCe5L2"&gt;The big difference between the 12 Pro Max and the other iPhone 12 models is found in its main camera sensor. The 12 Pro Max has a physically larger camera sensor that allows it to gather more light and produce better-quality images when in dark or challenging lighting conditions. In addition, the 12 Pro Max has an improved image stabilization system that helps keep your images sharp as light levels drop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IjBeK"&gt;But unless camera quality is all you care about, the 12 Pro Max isn’t the best iPhone for most people. It’s enormous, and the squared sides make it feel even bigger than its spec sheet implies. Most people will be happier with the smaller but still large-screened iPhone 12.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPhone 12 mini is small enough to be used in one hand by almost anybody.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IZTX1K"&gt;Best small smartphone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="n8BP66"&gt;There’s really only one reason to buy an iPhone 12 mini, but it’s an important one: if you want a phone that’s easier to use in one hand or put into a small pocket. The iPhone 12 mini is the only small phone on the market with top-tier features and specs; you don’t have to compromise in performance, build quality, or cameras with this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lNVbxg"&gt;Though it’s much smaller in size than the other iPhones released this year, the mini’s 5.4-inch screen is still big enough for text messaging, email, web browsing, apps, video, and games, and if you’re coming from an iPhone 6 / 7 / 8, it will feel quite spacious. But it’s also small enough that most adults, even those with small hands, will be able to comfortably reach all of the screen with their thumb. You won’t need a PopSocket on this one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Em0efZ"&gt;Otherwise, the mini is the same phone as the iPhone 12: it has the same design, processor, cameras, 5G support, and build quality as the larger model. It’s just smaller and has a smaller price tag, at about $100 less.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="MPtDpR"&gt;If you want a stylus built into your phone&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="efDFTK"&gt;If you’re looking for the best phone to go from morning to night with heavy use and last through it all, Samsung’s top-of-the-line Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is the one to get. It has a massive 4,500mAh battery that keeps its enormous 6.9-inch screen going as long as you need it to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u3wWez"&gt;The Note 20 Ultra is also a high-end phone in every other respect. Its giant screen supports a 120Hz refresh rate for smooth interactions; its triple rear camera system is one of the most advanced you can get; and the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 Plus processor and 12GB of RAM allow it to perform without a hiccup. In addition, it supports Samsung’s S Pen for stylus input, allowing you to write or doodle on the screen with a pen instead of your finger. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S6gOEi"&gt;Although you can now use a stylus with the Galaxy S21 Ultra, it isn’t built into the phone as it is here on the Note 20 Ultra. Depending on Samsung’s plans, this may be the last “Ultra” version of the Note, too — though rumors have been conflicting on that front. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The OnePlus 9 is a step down from the 9 Pro, but it only gives up a few features at a significantly lower price.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="ofDQRV"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22338398/oneplus-9-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;OnePlus 9&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ZJWuDD"&gt;If you want an excellent ultrawide camera&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="uUgURs"&gt;The OnePlus 9 is the step-down model from the OnePlus 9 Pro, which is itself an excellent phone. But you don’t give up too much by opting for the 9, and you save a ton of money. Like the 9 Pro, it offers great performance with a Snapdragon 888 processor, fast 65W wired charging, and something that will appeal especially to the landscape photographers out there: a great ultrawide camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qa2S7w"&gt;The sensor behind the OnePlus 9’s ultrawide camera is physically larger than most and offers a healthy 50-megapixel resolution. A unique lens design corrects distortion without introducing the funhouse mirror-type stretching you’ll often see in the corners of ultrawide images. And if super-wide photography isn’t your thing, know that the main camera turns in solid image quality, too. Images are well-exposed, and colors look pleasantly vibrant. OnePlus makes a big deal of the Hasselblad color science at work here, which does a fine job but isn’t as mind-blowingly good as the company suggests.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O804KE"&gt;Unfortunately, you do miss out on a couple of good camera features opting for the 9 rather than the 9 Pro. The main camera on the 9 Pro offers optical image stabilization, which isn’t included on the 9, and is useful for its ability to keep subjects looking sharp in lower light conditions. There’s also no telephoto lens — just digital zoom, which isn’t as good as the 9 Pro’s optical zoom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zxzBBh"&gt;The OnePlus 9 also doesn’t work on AT&amp;amp;T’s 5G network. (It works on both T-Mobile and Verizon’s 5G networks, however.) That’s no great loss right now (honestly, it might be for the better), but in a couple of years, this will probably become a downside. Bearing this in mind and a couple of camera feature omissions, the OnePlus 9 is an excellent device. It offers a flagship feel and performance for a bit less than the highest-end Android options and a seriously good ultrawide camera for wide-angle photo fans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="7spKRS"&gt;Best cheap phone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4WMzav"&gt;Google’s Pixel 4A 5G starts at $500 and gets you access to several key features: a big-ish 6.2-inch screen, clean and uncluttered Android software, Google’s excellent Pixel camera, and of course 5G. Although buying a phone &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; to get 5G is a mistake, all things being equal, it’s worth getting 5G if you can in 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwyHDO"&gt;Even though the Pixel camera isn’t the very best you can get anymore, it still is competitive with phones that cost hundreds of dollars more. No other phone at this $500 ($600 on Verizon) price point can match the Pixel’s camera quality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1YRQbD"&gt;The Pixel 4A 5G doesn’t have the fastest processor, but it does have a good-looking OLED screen. Just as importantly, it has the promise of getting timely software updates directly from Google. While other Android phones take forever to get the new versions of Android, Google’s get them right away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KdXXRK"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9503882"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="yteQuG"&gt;9. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21351770/google-pixel-4a-review-camera-specs-price"&gt;Google Pixel 4A&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WMeIkj"&gt;Best Android phone under $500&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="cBeDqy"&gt;If you’re on a budget and prefer Android, then the Google Pixel 4A is the obvious choice. It doesn’t have the largest screen or the fastest processor, but it does have a clean version of Android that’s guaranteed to get software updates for at least three years. It only comes in one version: black with 128GB of storage for $349.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tZEqw2"&gt;The Pixel 4A’s main claim to fame is its camera, which can go head-to-head with smartphones that cost $1,500 or more. That’s because Google does so much of the image processing in software — the sensor itself is actually quite old and not very special. It means the Pixel 4A can take night photos, do astrophotography, and has a passable portrait mode. It can’t hang with the iPhone SE for video but beats it for photos every time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lZsgOa"&gt;The rest of the Pixel 4A’s specs are good but not great. It has a 5.8-inch screen, just enough RAM to keep apps from closing in the background, and a headphone jack. There’s no wireless charging, no fancy face unlock, and the body is made out of plastic instead of something more premium like glass. The Pixel 4A doesn’t even offer any IP water resistance ratings (but a splash of water is probably fine).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ftzlw6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556642"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sUP4Y7"&gt;But for all that, the Pixel 4A is probably the safest bet if you want to get an Android phone for less than $500. You’ll get better software support and a better camera for $350. Not a bad deal.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2 is expensive, extravagant, and the easiest way to fit a tablet-sized screen into your pocket.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mre8Bq"&gt;10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21427462/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="4x700N"&gt;Best folding phone in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="JDL8H8"&gt;Folding phones have been around for less than two years and have already seen their share of controversies. But if you are interested in buying one and are willing to pay the hefty price required, there’s really only one model worth considering: Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Mbw2f"&gt;The Fold 2 is Samsung’s second-generation folding phone. Its main premise is this: it is sized like a normal smartphone that fits in your pocket, but it unfolds to reveal a tablet-sized 7.6-inch display on the inside. That inside screen makes everything from reading books to browsing the web to watching video to playing games more enjoyable and immersive. When you’re done using it, just fold it back up and stick it in your pocket just like any other phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nKplTb"&gt;That flexibility is unmatched by any other phone you can buy right now, but it doesn’t come without a significant list of compromises. The Fold 2 is twice as thick when closed compared to normal phones, and its outside screen is much smaller than what you’re probably used to. It is also delicate; there’s no rated dust or water resistance, and its inner screen is more likely to get damaged if you poke it too hard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Rta9KS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10215758"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Fp3cHb"&gt;But the biggest compromise is its cost: the Fold 2 is roughly twice as expensive as other high-end phones. Since it debuted for $2,000, it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364162/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-2-5g-price-cut-announced-1800"&gt;permanently marked down by $200&lt;/a&gt;, but you’re still paying a lot for the ability to fold a tablet screen in half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xA969T"&gt;If you’re willing to put up with those compromises for an experience that’s unlike anything else, though, the Fold 2 delivers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iahfYJ"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKGbug"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mercedes-Benz’s EQB will be its first mass-market electric SUV in the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9jWAsIN53v2UT-2NzMfRNTwow9U=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69151199/20C0580_006.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Images: Daimler&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Mq6cow"&gt;Mercedes-Benz has revealed a new electric SUV called the EQB at Auto Shanghai 2021. It’s the first mass-market electric SUV the company will sell in the US after it &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/mercedes-benz-eqc-launch-right-america/"&gt;canceled plans to bring its first mass-market EV&lt;/a&gt;, the EQC, stateside in February. It will be the second mass-market electric Mercedes-Benz in the US &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/15/22385437/mercedes-benz-eqs-electric-ev-photos-specs"&gt;after the EQS sedan goes on sale later this year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7LMIEQ"&gt;The EQB is a slightly taller electric SUV than the EQC, and it has space for seven people. It won’t dazzle in the range department, though, as Mercedes-Benz says it expects the EQB to squeeze 419 kilometers out of the 66.5kWh battery pack when fully charged, or about 260 miles. That figure is based on Europe’s WLTP testing standard, too, which typically produces rosier estimates. The EPA-rated range will likely be less. Mercedes-Benz says a longer-range version is in the works but didn’t offer any more details.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lsEoqb"&gt;Before it comes to the US, the EQB will see debuts in China (hence the reveal at Auto Shanghai) and Europe by the end of 2021, with localized production. The eventual US model will be imported from Europe. Mercedes-Benz has also previously announced a smaller electric SUV called the EQA, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/20/22239135/mercedes-benz-eqa-electric-crossover-range-price-specs"&gt;it’s Europe-only for the moment&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ak1f7S"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10454787"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BFZnXW"&gt;The EQB will be available in both all-wheel and front-wheel drive configurations, with some offering more than 200kW of power (about 270 horsepower) for a modest amount of zip. It can charge at a rate of up to 100kW, though that could change upon the introduction into the US. And it’s of course outfitted with Mercedes-Benz’s MBUX infotainment system, which operates on a pair of large screens that sit behind the steering wheel and on the center of the dashboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="saFCdA"&gt;Mercedes-Benz didn’t talk pricing on Monday, though it’s safe to assume the EQB will cost less than the expected six-figure price tag that the EQS will go for, considering that this SUV lacks a lot of the electric sedan’s bells and whistles. For what it’s worth, the EQC was supposed to start at just under $70,000 before the company canceled its entry into the US market. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Celeste developer teases next game with a ‘vibe reveal’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1IE5WyLkFDYPm9vDsCDDMPZCvwg=/0x25:2979x2011/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69151173/Ap5k0FaQ.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Extremely OK Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qgPeRl"&gt;The developer of indie hits &lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Towerfall &lt;/em&gt;has unveiled its next game: &lt;em&gt;Earthblade&lt;/em&gt;. There aren’t many details about the game just yet, but Extremely OK Games billed Monday’s news as a “vibe reveal,” taking the wraps off the game’s title, a poster, and a song from the game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l8S8Jw"&gt;You can see the poster and the game’s logo (designed by Pedro Medeiros) and hear the song (composed by Lena Raine) in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/exok_games/status/1384182598507778052"&gt;teaser video posted on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6zfn4b"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Earthblade   Vibe reveal!  ( sound on!) &lt;br&gt;A 2D explor-action game in a seamless pixel art world. The next release from the Celeste team, coming 20XX. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ceAM80PEaG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ceAM80PEaG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Extremely OK Games (@exok_games) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/exok_games/status/1384182598507778052?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="bjcBO2"&gt;We might be waiting a while for the actual release of the game. Extremely OK Games has only officially listed a vague “20XX” release date, and the studio’s Maddy Thorson &lt;a href="https://exok.com/posts/2021-04-19-earthblade/"&gt;said in Monday’s announcement blog&lt;/a&gt; that “it sounds optimistic to say out loud that &lt;em&gt;Earthblade&lt;/em&gt; could be released within 5 short years of &lt;em&gt;Celeste.” &lt;/em&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Celeste, &lt;/em&gt;if you were wondering,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;came out in January 2018.) “The truth is that we don’t know how long it will take, just that it will take as long as it takes (and that it will take a long time),” Thorson added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwgcY0"&gt;We might also be waiting some time for more news about the game. “While making &lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;/em&gt;, we basically tweeted out whatever interesting-looking thing we were working on day-to-day, when we were in the mood for sharing,” Thorson said. “But an air of mystery lends itself particularly well to this project, so we’ve opted to save it all up for a big reveal that will hopefully blow your socks off. It’ll probably be a while before you get more information about &lt;em&gt;Earthblade&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KEIOOG"&gt;While you’re waiting for &lt;em&gt;Earthblade&lt;/em&gt;, you should play &lt;em&gt;Celeste&lt;/em&gt; if you haven’t already. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20857240/celeste-farewell-dlc-expansion-masterpiece-platformer-game-release-date"&gt;It’s really good&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="EELxHj"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Celeste’s massive new expansion is a good time to play the platforming masterpiece","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/9/20857240/celeste-farewell-dlc-expansion-masterpiece-platformer-game-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;

    <title>Watch the first footage of a helicopter on Mars</title>
    <content type="html">

        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Ingenuity helicopter on the surface of Mars.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: NASA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1nUQrD"&gt;There’s new video of the Ingenuity helicopter on Mars, captured by the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289668/nasa-mars-perseverance-rover-success"&gt;Perseverance rover’s&lt;/a&gt; cameras and posted to Twitter by NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The copter had its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/19/22391496/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-mars-flight-success"&gt;first flight earlier today&lt;/a&gt;, lifting 10 feet off the Martian surface for 39 seconds and marking the first flight of a powered craft on another planet. The video shows the tissue box-sized craft zipping up and hovering in place before gracefully landing back on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Uiofo3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Witness the historic moment in full. The Mastcam-Z cameras on &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAPersevere?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@NASAPersevere&lt;/a&gt; show us the takeoff, hovering and landing of the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarsHelicopter?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#MarsHelicopter&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://t.co/ypdIWmC4D1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/ypdIWmC4D1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— NASA JPL (@NASAJPL) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJPL/status/1384202604620632074?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vK66Si"&gt;The video was shot at a 34mm focal length at 6.7 frames per second and is a sequence of about 1,400 frames, according to Perseverance imaging scientist Justin Maki. A “full-zoom version” at 110mm is coming in the next few days, along with photos from Ingenuity’s 13-megapixel horizon-facing camera. A black-and-white &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/jpl/ingenuity-s-first-black-and-white-image-from-the-air/"&gt;photo of its shadow&lt;/a&gt;, taken with its 1.5-megapixel navigation camera during the flight, has already been sent back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jwUL8C"&gt;Ingenuity’s flight was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381554/ingenuity-mars-first-flight-delayed-nasa-fixes-software-bug"&gt;delayed multiple times&lt;/a&gt; because of an issue that required reinstalling its flight control software. NASA engineers are &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NASAJPL/status/1384099533026566148"&gt;delighted&lt;/a&gt; at the success of the first flight test. Unlike Perseverance, Ingenuity won’t be involved in carrying out any specific experiments or explorations on Mars, but there are more flight tests planned for it in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook’s Clubhouse competitor is coming this summer</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-ODCnkLbbLZb3FubuIfykF572fw=/8x0:904x597/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69151015/Screen_Shot_2021_04_19_at_11.54.43_AM.5.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N2mXAw"&gt;Facebook is going all in on audio. The company &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/04/bringing-social-audio-experiences-to-facebook/"&gt;announced multiple products&lt;/a&gt; on Monday that emphasize voice content over text, images, or video. The products will be released over the next few months and, in some cases, will start with a limited set of people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="esGGS8"&gt;Most notably, Facebook is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/10/22276645/facebook-clubhouse-social-audio-app-develop"&gt;indeed launching&lt;/a&gt; a competitor to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22380290/clubhouse-social-audio-twitter-facebook-platforms"&gt;the buzzy social audio app Clubhouse&lt;/a&gt; with a feature called Live Audio Rooms, which will be available this summer. It’ll first roll out to groups and public figures as a test, but it will eventually make its way to Messenger, too, so people can hang out with friends. Users will be able to record their conversations and distribute them, and eventually, people can charge for access to these rooms through either a subscription or one-time fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rjUGLX"&gt;To get people to join, Facebook says it’s introducing an Audio Creator Fund to “support emerging audio creators.” All of these conversations can also be turned into “Soundbites,” a forthcoming feature that allows people to create and share shortform audio clips along with an algorithmic feed to promote them. Think TikTok, but with audio clips.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6DeEilFJCup_LHIBztYP_0_OSws=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22455069/Soundbites_Audio_Creation_Tool_and_Listening_Side_by_Side.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Soundbite creation tool will let people put effects on their voices.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kXOO8a"&gt;Soundbites will live within the broader News Feed. Users will be able to record them in a separate tool within Facebook, which the company describes as a “sound studio in your pocket.” In a chat with Casey Newton, the author of &lt;em&gt;Platformer &lt;/em&gt;and a contributing editor at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg equated Soundbites to Reels, Instagram’s TikTok competitor, but for audio. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RQdvPE"&gt;He also added that he likes audio over video or images because it allows people to multitask and host longer, nuanced conversations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6wrh3T"&gt;“The high-level picture here is that we think that audio is, of course, also going to be a first-class medium, and that there are all these different products to build across this whole spectrum,” Zuckerberg said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UDzYY9"&gt;Facebook also plans to take on a bigger role in podcasting. The company says it’ll start recommending shows and episodes based on people’s interests and that people can comment on them and recommend them to friends. The company says 170 million people on Facebook are connected to a page that’s linked to a specific podcast, and more than 35 million people are members of fan groups around podcasts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nfP0MQvs8OGeevlTQKNWZK8ei74=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22455083/Podcasts_Listening.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Facebook&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Facebook wants to support podcasts with direct monetization.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="8QIvrI"&gt;Zuckerberg says a partnership with Spotify is forthcoming, too, which will bring the company’s player over to Facebook, letting people stream music and podcasts from their News Feed. Zuckerberg emphasized that this feature is for music. But still, Facebook users will be able to share Spotify podcasts and let people listen without having to leave the Facebook world — they just have to link their accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yhNbHw"&gt;“Our ambition has always been to make Spotify ubiquitous across platforms and devices — bringing music and podcasts to more people — and our new integration with Facebook is another step in these efforts,” a Spotify spokesperson said in a statement. “We look forward to a continued partnership with Facebook, fueling audio discovery around the world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oKqUiT"&gt;Finally, Facebook’s tipping system, Stars, will be coming to Live Audio Rooms as well as for individual creators and public figures. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mVnMzu"&gt;How serious Facebook is about audio and whether users actually want it over other formats is still unclear. On one hand, the audio industry is hot right now, with most major tech companies wading into the broader podcasting industry. Clubhouse and other audio startups have also made live audio a popular way to interact, and already, multiple big platforms &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22362980/clubhouse-social-audio-facebook-twitter-android"&gt;have integrated&lt;/a&gt; the format into their apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qpYbQk"&gt;On the other hand, live audio has clearly found its moment during the pandemic, when everyone’s been starved of human interaction and mostly confined to their homes. Podcasting offers edited, on-demand conversations, which people have enjoyed for years, but whether the live formats will survive remains an open question. Facebook has also routinely gone all in on a format, only for it to languish. It went for longform video with IGTV but has since pivoted to a focus on Reels. It launched and subsidized Facebook Live content, which has since mostly fallen by the wayside. The same could happen for audio, but Facebook is clearly using its size to try to make its mark on the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Xbox update speeds up downloads by suspending games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ViRiWnQ2OeezB4w_jJs1QJ0ZIiI=/7x0:2034x1351/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69150847/twarren_200909_4177_0029.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Tom Warren / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F1j2yS"&gt;Microsoft is rolling out a new Xbox April dashboard update today that will improve the way games are downloaded. A new feature will now let Xbox owners suspend games to speed up download speeds. Currently, Xbox One and Xbox Series X / S systems throttle game updates and new game downloads if another game is active.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E2bpXS"&gt;This new suspend option can be coupled with Quick Resume on the Xbox Series X / S to quickly pause a game, download game updates, or download a new game altogether and then resume the suspended game later. It’s a much cleaner option than having to manually quit a game or app to ensure download speeds aren’t getting throttled.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LDcHmveJo-5D4rBK85LvKy1Bcbw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22455028/SdRN4pK.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new suspend option.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Z4MP2Q"&gt;Alongside this new dashboard option, Microsoft is finally improving its Xbox mobile app to bring achievements back. The newly designed app &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/19/21524109/microsoft-xbox-app-iphone-ipad-game-streaming-xbox-app-microsoft-features"&gt;launched on Android and iOS back in October&lt;/a&gt;, but it was missing achievements functionality and many other features that the mobile app previously included. Monthly leaderboards for achievements are also starting to appear for some Xbox mobile app users, and &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/04/19/xbox-update-april-2021/"&gt;Microsoft says&lt;/a&gt; “everyone will see these updates in the app by the end of the month.”&lt;/p&gt;
