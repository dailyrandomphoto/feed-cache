        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can now buy Google’s newest Pixels, pending availability.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p512wU"&gt;Google’s new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22713338/google-pixel-6-event-top-announcements-tensor-processor-snapchat-pass"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22514428"&gt;reviewed&lt;/a&gt;, and are now up for order. These Pixels promise new designs, new cameras, a uniquely designed Google Tensor CPU, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="57DFat"&gt;This year’s Pixel phones come in two sizes: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;the standard Pixel 6 and the larger, triple-camera equipped Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. The base Pixel 6, with 128GB of storage, starts at $599, while the Pixel 6 Pro runs $899 and up if you prefer to go above the base 128GB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="samX3I"&gt;What’s new&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jTBVbQ"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22731034/google-pixel-6-pro-price-specs-features-release-date-hands-on"&gt;Pixel 6 and 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; look mostly nothing like prior iterations, with a metal-and-glass design highlighted by a rear camera bar that is slightly reminiscent of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/20/9571535/nexus-6p-review"&gt;classic Nexus 6P&lt;/a&gt;. The smaller Pixel 6, which cannot truly be considered small by any stretch of the imagination, has a 6.4-inch, 2400 x 1080 OLED display with a 90Hz refresh rate. The larger Pixel 6 Pro stretches its legs with a 6.7-inch, 120Hz LTPO OLED display with 3120 x 1440 resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzGN0n"&gt;On the inside, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22710844/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-ai-speed-specs-details"&gt;Google’s brand-new Tensor processor&lt;/a&gt; powers both, while the Pixel 6 gets 8GB of RAM and the 6 Pro has 12GB. The new chips have a lot to prove for Google, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22727944/google-pixel-6-pro-cameras-computational-photography-features"&gt;just as the new camera systems do&lt;/a&gt;, with the Pixel 6 housing a dual-camera setup and the 6 Pro adding a third camera and lens to its rear bar. The phones match each other with 50MP main cameras and a 12MP ultrawide, but only the Pro counterpart gets a 48MP sensor complete with telephoto 4x optical zoom. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kpMCfQ"&gt;Time will tell if all this hardware and new camera software brings the Pixels back to the top of the pack, but in the meantime, let’s look at how the Pixel 6 phones are configured and made available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="x26RG3"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s how the Pixel 6 compares to the Pixel 6 Pro","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22724481/google-pixel-6-pro-specs-comparison-price"},{"title":"Sundar Pichai and Rick Osterloh think the Pixel 6 is Google’s breakout phone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22733159/sundar-pichai-rick-osterloh-google-pixel-6-interview-podcast"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="af9xF5"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10816444"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="qoPTwM"&gt;Where to buy the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="3iYB8E"&gt;&lt;a href="https://store.google.com/category/phones?hl=en-US"&gt;Google kicked off orders first on its own store&lt;/a&gt;, right as the phone became official. Now we’ve reached the launch date for the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, though, like most phone launches these days, there are some shipping delays. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="In20xd"&gt;Currently, &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/category/phones?hl=en-US"&gt;Google’s store&lt;/a&gt; indicates that some models of the Pixel 6 Pro are out of stock or have long delivery times. This seems to affect the unlocked model the most, which is listed as out of stock with only an option to be added to a waitlist for some configurations. There are some Verizon and Google Fi models available in the Google Store, and the current stock shortage is not yet affecting the regular Pixel 6.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZO9lWc"&gt;We will update this post as more options become available, but we can immediately see how some models are not available everywhere — if a 512GB Pixel 6 Pro is your jam, your only option is to purchase an unlocked one from Google once it’s in stock. As far as general availability at retailers, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cfO5wFAh05o" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-5g-unlocked-128gb%2F-%2FA-84683612%3Fpreselect%3D83607398%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;amp;subid1=vergepixel6preorders" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1665071-REG%2Fgoogle_ga02900_us_pixel_6_dual_sim_128gb.html&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22734748%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;B&amp;amp;H&lt;/a&gt; all have some Pixel 6 availability, but Pixel 6 Pros are mostly unavailable or sold out. Unlocked models seem to have the greatest scarcity, with better chances of getting a carrier-locked version. The carrier stores seem to have higher stock levels, so if you want to get the phone as soon as possible, it might be your best chance — particularly if you want the Pro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="FfBJXi"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10815891"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="ZBa1GT"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10815902"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="gHSBMR"&gt;Carrier deals&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qBhCBk"&gt;If you’re not shopping for an unlocked phone and prefer to utilize promos and payment plans from your carrier, there are some offers from the likes of AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, Verizon, and Google’s own Fi service. Bear in mind that carriers give discounts as bill credits over time, attempting to rope you into service for 36 months or more. The Pixel 6 models offered from &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13610485?sid=vergepixel6preorder&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-128gb-stormy-black.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon&lt;/a&gt; (including Verizon models bought on Google’s store) have radios for mmWave 5G, which cost upward of $100 more and still may not give you faster speeds depending on where you live and use the phone. Pixel 6 Pro phones, unlocked or bought through a carrier, work with mmWave 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="bskHg6"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="fwxgST"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is offering up to $700 off the &lt;a href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8836598-13610485?sid=vergepixel6preorder&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro-128gb-cloudy-white.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; with a qualifying trade-in for new and existing customers, and 50 percent off of any Google-branded accessories purchased simultaneously. The base &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-13610485?sid=vergepixel6preorder&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.att.com%2Fbuy%2Fphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-128gb-stormy-black.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; 128GB model costs $15 per month over 36 months without a trade-in, but keep in mind that the mmWave-equipped model AT&amp;amp;T is selling is fully priced at $740 and not the base $599 of unlocked models using only Sub-6 5G. The $15 per month over 36 months will result in a total price of $540, reflecting the $200 AT&amp;amp;T will discount over time via bill credits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="X9W7Oc"&gt;Verizon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="pPtJqr"&gt;Verizon’s offers are similar promo, with up to $700 off a &lt;a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-11365093?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.verizon.com%2Fsmartphones%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro%2F" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; with a trade-in— though this is limited to new customers switching over. Existing customers can get up to $350 off when trading in a phone and upgrading a line. If you’re shopping for more than one Pixel device, you can buy one and get a second Pixel 6 or 6 Pro for up to $700 off (given to you in billing credits over time; you’ll pay in full upfront) with eligible unlimited plans. The base Pixel 6 on a payment plan from Verizon will run $23.33 per month for 30 months, totaling $700 and a one-time $35 activation fee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="74YwEQ"&gt;If you want to buy a Pixel 6 for Verizon’s network &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/config/pixel_6?hl=en-US" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;direct from Google&lt;/a&gt;, you’ll also receive up to $100 in Google store credit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="O5sVYL"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="hVohEb"&gt;T-Mobile is advertising the base &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fgoogle-pixel-6%3Fsku%3D810029932646&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22734748%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt; as free with a trade-in on its Magenta Max plan and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro%3Fsku%3D810029931533&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22734748%2Fgoogle-pixel-6-pro-preorder-buy-how-to-price-availability-release-date" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt; up to $900 off under the same terms. Once again, these promotions involve buying the device as a Magenta Max subscriber or purchasing that service, paying the sales tax, trading in a qualifying phone that T-Mobile will offer a value on, and then receiving the allotted money back as monthly bill credits over 24 months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bpnx5n"&gt;Note that T-Mobile’s offerings for the Pixel 6 does not have a mmWave radio, only Sub-6 5G, and is thus the respective $599 base price as Google advertised. T-Mobile’s price for the Pixel 6 Pro also matches Google’s $899.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro review: finally, more than just good cameras</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;The new Pixels are the best phones Google has ever made&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="1M4A8y"&gt;It’s rare that a new smartphone feels all that &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt;. The common refrain is that smartphones are all a “mature” technology and today’s new phone is only incrementally different from the prior one. There’s a lot of truth in that — Apple’s made 15 generations of iPhones! — and the newness you gain from plunking down hundreds of dollars every couple of years to upgrade rarely changes your day to day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EBaQCn"&gt;Google’s new Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, however, are a bit more new than the typical phone, even though they don’t fold in half or have especially unique designs. They come with new cameras, new materials, new hardware, new software, and new thoughts on what a smartphone should be able to do for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ADueEq"&gt;But a lot of this is new &lt;em&gt;for Google&lt;/em&gt; and not necessarily different from what you can get from a litany of other smartphone makers right now. The $599 Pixel 6 and $899 6 Pro are a reset for Google’s smartphone ambitions, a fresh start for the company that has slogged through five generations of Pixel phones without so much as a dent in the smartphone world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9YgXao"&gt;As a result, the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro are not perfectly refined devices, nor do they do everything Google claims as well as you might expect. But that doesn’t stop them from being among the best phones available and perhaps the best Android phones to buy right now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WiVH9P"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10832253"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Gu8yYY"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10832255"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="U6xTbo"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Android 12 review: it’s mostly about the looks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uwpk-zXoSnjbk7Cl9atGkDmIE68=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934831/bfarsace_211014_4802_0002.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The most distinctive part of the new Pixel 6 design is the camera bar on the back.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="r91XGl"&gt;The design of the new Pixel phones is a change of pace for Google and follows the conventions of other popular Android phone makers for the past few years. Instead of quirky textured finishes with fun pops of color, they are the typical glass and metal sandwich slabs with aluminum frames and slippery backs. There’s less whimsy and character to their details than prior Pixel phones, something I miss. And if you look closely, they aren’t quite as polished as the best from Apple and Samsung at this point — it’s easy to find a rough edge or two along the seams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="djgaYO"&gt;The front of both phones is hard to distinguish from lots of other big Android phones on the market; they mostly resemble a Samsung Galaxy Note 10 or Note 20 to my eye. And while the back has a distinctive bar toward the top that houses the cameras, the whole thing reminds me of a TCL phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="13npwk"&gt;The Pixel 6 is available in three two-tone colors — black, red, or green — while the Pixel 6 Pro is only available in more staid variations of black, white, or gold. The aluminum sides of the regular 6 are chunky and matte black, while the 6 Pro’s sides are thinner and polished to a shine. Between the two, the 6 is certainly more fun, while the 6 Pro doesn’t quite match up to other phones within its price tier in terms of design or fit and finish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="5kOUDs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These designs have less character or whimsy than Google’s earlier efforts&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RE29Ja"&gt;The most prominent design element is the camera bar that spans the back of each phone. It’s large, sticks out far, and doesn’t quite blend seamlessly into the rest of the phone. On the plus side, it doesn’t cause the phone to rock on a table or desk when you put it down, unlike the camera bumps on other phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4OaFr5"&gt;A lot of these design critiques are purely academic, though, because in reality you’re going to put a case on either phone and cover up any of the rough edges or boring colors. That’s an extremely good idea, too, because both phones are capital-L Large and their smooth glass backs are extremely slippery. I’ve had them slide off my desk, wireless chargers, sofa arms, tables, my lap, you name it, and one of our sample units actually fell hard enough to crack the Gorilla Glass Victus glass panel covering its screen. (Side note: I’ve been testing Google’s translucent recycled plastic cases alongside the Pixel 6 and they are horrible — I recommend checking out third-party options.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kO5iLr"&gt;Really, my main problem with the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro’s design is that they are just too big for my taste. They are challenging to use in one hand, they don’t fit comfortably in a lot of my pants pockets, and they are easy to drop. In prior years, Google offered both small and large versions of its phones, but for this sixth generation it’s big or bigger; the size difference between the two is negligible. These are iPhone Pro Max-size phones, which is fine if you want a big phone but leaves out those of us who aren’t fans of oversized slabs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SZFY2OIMElXN-iNEcQuGV6bNN5w=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934833/bfarsace_211014_4802_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro both have big, spacious displays.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="gWyOXZ"&gt;The flip side of that is both phones have big, spacious displays. The Pixel 6’s is a 6.4-inch OLED panel with 1080p-wide resolution; the 6 Pro steps up to a 6.7-inch OLED screen with 1440p wide resolution. The Pixel 6’s screen is fully flat, while the 6 Pro has curved sides that taper into the frame. I prefer the flat screen of the 6, but the 6 Pro’s curves didn’t cause any errant touch issues in my testing, something that can make a curved screen difficult to use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjytBq"&gt;Both are sharp, vibrant, and colorful, with the 6 Pro being slightly brighter when outdoors in sunlight. Neither have any glaring problems that plagued older Pixel phones, like weird color reproduction or flickering at low brightness levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RnzUBl"&gt;There are some issues if you look closely, like a slight color shift at oblique angles or a noticeable shadow under the curved sides of the 6 Pro when using a light background, things we don’t see on the best phones from Apple or Samsung at this point. If there’s one place where the cheaper price tag of these phones comes through, it’s these displays. They’re good, but not up to the level set by other flagship competitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="1p0VNe"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The displays are good, but not quite the best we’ve seen&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="O726Vq"&gt;They also have fast refresh rates — 90Hz on the Pixel 6, up to 120Hz on the 6 Pro — that make scrolling and interactions very smooth. Fast refresh screens have become table stakes on premium phones and it’s good to see Google follow suit here. I did not notice a difference between the 90Hz and 120Hz, either, unless I compared the phones side by side— both are smooth in use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RrcBYE"&gt;Less smooth is the fingerprint scanner under the screen. It’s located in a comfortable spot — about a quarter of the way up from the bottom — but it’s much slower than other fingerprint scanners, including the ones on the back of older Pixel phones. Because it’s optical, the screen lights up when you scan a finger, which can be really disruptive in dark rooms. The scanner also misread my finger from time to time, requiring multiple attempts to unlock the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a6TiBM"&gt;Compounding this error is the fact that the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro don’t have any sort of facial recognition unlock — the fingerprint scanner is the only biometric authentication available, and it’s just not very good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/p3b7AYz9iBasM0ZPVmyUI3fNSso=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934841/bfarsace_211014_4802_0054.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Even the regular Pixel 6 is still a very large phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="quBj6E"&gt;One of the most important things about the Pixel 6 pair is the processor inside of them, Google’s new Tensor chip. It’s the first custom processor from Google, which is following in Apple’s footsteps and leaving behind off-the-shelf processors from Qualcomm or MediaTek. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IyZqY4"&gt;In addition to powering the phone, the Tensor processor also has a lot of AI-based customization to enhance features in the camera, speech recognition, and gaming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oikAff"&gt;Google says the new processor is competitive with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 for performance, and in my experience, that’s true. Apps open quickly, it’s easy to switch between them smoothly, and the interface is free of stutters and hang-ups. Twitter was the one app that stuttered on both phones, but it was an outlier. The Tensor chip will not benchmark as highly as Apple’s latest processors, but it’s far ahead of the processor that was in the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514312/google-pixel-5-review-camera-speed-processor-fingerprint"&gt;Pixel 5 last year&lt;/a&gt; and right up there with other premium Android phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t1SiKk"&gt;The Pixel 6 has 8GB of RAM, while the 6 Pro is equipped with 12GB. In practical use, the 6’s lesser amount of RAM did not present issues — streaming apps do not aggressively close in the background like they did on older Pixel phones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Dnc0I"&gt;There also wasn’t an appreciable difference in battery life between the two phones. Both are easily able to cruise through a full day of use with plenty of juice left in the tank — most nights I went to bed with 35-40 percent battery remaining, even while using the camera a lot and enabling the always-on display feature. Light users can probably stretch this to two days without much effort. A big reason for this stamina is the fact that the batteries are just big — big phones bring big batteries and big battery life.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DznWh20KyWGOdtuMs_kwV9Aw8XY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22934884/bfarsace_211014_4802_0123.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The fingerprint scanner is located about a quarter of the way up from the bottom.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="2YtMAz"&gt;Both models support wireless charging and fast wired charging, but neither come with a charger in the box. Google sells a &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/usb_c_30w_charger?hl=en-US"&gt;$25 30-watt brick&lt;/a&gt; separately and will be releasing a &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/product/pixel_stand_2nd_gen?hl=en-US"&gt;$79 fast wireless charger&lt;/a&gt; in the near future, but I haven’t been able to test that yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l2oSGn"&gt;Even if you do use a powerful enough charger, neither phone charges particularly quickly. Google aggressively slows down charging once it’s past 80 percent to preserve the battery cells’ longevity, and since these batteries are so large, getting to a full charge can take a long time. Fortunately, thanks to the long battery life, you will likely only have to charge when you’re sleeping anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="02eeNC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google nailed the haptic feedback in the Pixel 6 — it’s clicky, but subtle, with just the right amount of feedback&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HwjiZ1"&gt;Another area that the Pixels excel is in their haptic feedback. Bad, buzzy haptics can ruin a phone experience for me, but the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro have subtle, clicky responses that provide just the right amount of feedback. It makes typing on the keyboard or interacting with the UI very enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yra4ls"&gt;Both the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro have proper, dual stereo speakers that pump out a satisfactory amount of volume and sound clear for both streaming music or video and taking speakerphone or video calls. Good riddance to the vibrating screen pseudo-speaker Google used in the Pixel 5 last year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LgK76L"&gt;Google is advertising 5G connectivity for both the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, but the details around it aren’t quite that straightforward. The unlocked and T-Mobile versions of the Pixel 6 are limited to sub-6 5G, while the Verizon and AT&amp;amp;T models are more expensive and support the faster but very limited millimeter wave (mmWave) 5G.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YhM5Xy"&gt;None of that confusion applies to the Pixel 6 Pro — no matter how you buy it, it will support both sub-6 and mmWave 5G. AT&amp;amp;T’s extra cost for its model relative to the unlocked, T-Mobile, or Verizon versions just buys you the privilege of being an AT&amp;amp;T customer, nothing more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xCyh7F"&gt;I tested unlocked versions of the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro on Google Fi, which uses T-Mobile’s 5G network. Performance was commensurate with other premium phones I’ve used on T-Mobile — I was able to reach speeds of 300 to 400Mbps in certain areas of New York City, which is a lot faster than I get on LTE in the same areas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kQrh9lhcFjli9Nu9AT373ed2aQo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957770/akrales_211020_4802_0323.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 Pro is the first Google phone with a wide, ultrawide, and telephoto camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="XEfWev"&gt;The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro’s camera systems are also wholly new, with new sensors, new lenses, and new capabilities. Google has finally upgraded the camera hardware in the Pixel line for the first time since 2017, and it’s gone big — literally. The new main camera sensor is much larger than the one used in the Pixel 5 and earlier, and the Pixel 6 Pro is the first in the line to have ultrawide, wide, and telephoto cameras.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="denxON"&gt;Both phones have the same main wide camera and ultrawide. The main camera is a 50-megapixel sensor that is hard-coded to produce 12.5-megapixel images behind an optically stabilized f/1.85 lens. That means you can’t actually capture the full 50-megapixel resolution and the images produced aren’t especially sharper or more detailed than other 12-megapixel cameras, including the Pixel 5’s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;aside id="MOp3xB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The telephoto camera on the Pixel 6 Pro is the most fun to use&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7vHaSy"&gt;Still, the images are very good in both normal and low light, and very competitive with the best from Apple. I won’t say there’s a clear winner here; some images from the Pixel 6 look better, some images from the iPhone 13 Pro look better, and which you prefer really comes down to your own personal preferences, something we’ve been saying about smartphone cameras for a few years now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TvCow0"&gt;The Pixel 6 images have the classic Pixel look: high contrast, slight overexposure, extreme sharpness, and cooler white balance. You can adjust the white balance easily enough using on-screen sliders in the camera app, but tweaking the sharpness requires a bit more post processing work. Google’s artificial portrait mode is also largely unchanged — it aggressively blurs the background to the point where it almost looks like the subject is a cardboard cutout placed in a diorama.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCQX8d"&gt;One area I would like Google to improve is how long its vaunted night mode takes to capture a shot. It’s incredible how much detail the night mode is able to capture in dark scenes, but it takes quite a few seconds to do so, and oftentimes either the subject or the person taking the photo loses patience and things get blurry. The iPhone’s night mode frequently took half as long to capture night scenes as the Pixel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kAqCcN"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10832288"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="HcbUgX"&gt;Overall, though, the advancements in image quality from the main camera are not as big as you might expect from new, significantly better hardware. Oftentimes, it’s hard to tell the difference between it and what you could get with older Pixel phones, especially in good lighting. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RtNigz"&gt;The Pixel 6’s ultrawide camera is its weakest link — images are soft, it’s not as wide as others, and there’s a noticeable difference in color and processing between it and the main camera. It also lacks the macro focusing abilities available on the iPhone 13 Pro’s ultrawide camera.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DUuZbc"&gt;On the other hand, the Pixel 6 Pro’s telephoto camera is excellent. It’s the first telephoto on a phone that I’ve actually enjoyed using and might be reason enough to spring for the 6 Pro over the regular 6. The 4x reach is noticeably longer than the 3x telephoto on the iPhone 13 Pro, but it’s much more usable day to day than the 10x zoom on Samsung’s Galaxy S21 Ultra.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KwcarS"&gt;On top of that, the telephoto produces sharp, detailed images, with great subject separation that requires much less use of software-based portrait modes. It’s a lot of fun to shoot with and the kind of thing that changes what you can do with your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="ciG9v6"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Images have the classic Pixel look: high contrast, a little overexposure, and lots of detail&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vc6GtC"&gt;Google says it has upgraded the Pixel 6’s video recording abilities, but it’s still behind the iPhone, which remains the standard. You can shoot 4K 60fps as long as you want without the phone overheating, but there’s still noticeable artifacting and wonkiness with image stabilization, and the video image processing is weirdly different from how the Pixel processes still images. Highly saturated colors, like reds and oranges, are amped up to the extreme in video, almost like how Samsung used to process colors years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLY2sT"&gt;On the front of the phones, the cameras differ — the Pixel 6 has an 8-megapixel camera with an 84-degree field of view, while the 6 Pro has an 11-megapixel camera with a 94-degree field of view. Not only will you fit more people in the 6 Pro’s frame, the image quality is noticeably better, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PHozb87stxx869rcwgyj7_CQ6CY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957782/akrales_211022_4802_0839.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Magic Eraser feature in Google Photos makes it easy to remove unwanted people or objects in images, but it can be hit or miss.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="I7my4c"&gt;The Tensor chip in the Pixel enables a couple of special software tricks in the camera and photos app. The new Magic Eraser tool lets you remove unwanted people or items from a captured photo with a single tap, or you can highlight things to remove. It’s very cool, but also hit or miss — it won’t be taking the place of any skilled Photoshop editors anytime soon. You can also accomplish similar things with third-party apps, so it’s not entirely necessary to buy a Pixel for this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzdeVq"&gt;What’s more interesting to me are the new motion capture modes, which let you mimic a panning motion shot or a long exposure with just a single tap of the shutter button. You can make a moving object, like a car, freeze in front of a blurred background, or you can capture traffic light streaks without the need for a tripod.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8EcJMb"&gt;These kinds of images typically take years of practice and lots of gear to do with a traditional camera, but the Pixel 6 makes it as easy as snapping a selfie.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_IgMtL_a_VAx4ipur-SOEIqYtJM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957784/akrales_211022_4802_0876.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 makes capturing a panning shot as easy as snapping a selfie.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="KTok65"&gt;Google has also made a big deal about tweaks it made to its image processing algorithm this year to better handle darker skin tones, which it’s calling Real Tone. Bias in image processing is a problem that’s beset the photo industry for decades, dating all the way &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/2015/9/18/9348821/photography-race-bias"&gt;back to film&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s encouraging to see Google address it. Google says the Real Tone processing is baked into the Pixel’s image processing pipeline and it’s not possible to turn it on or off at will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYolzl"&gt;Both Nicole Nguyen &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-built-the-pixel-6-camera-to-better-portray-people-with-darker-skin-tones-does-it-11635177665?st=l805lxv5h4q9ve7&amp;amp;reflink=desktopwebshare_twitter"&gt;at the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and Julian Chokkattu &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/review/google-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro/"&gt;at &lt;em&gt;Wired&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; were able to test the camera with a range of darker skin tones and their conclusions are interesting; I encourage you to read their respective articles. Looking at all the photos, it’s clear the Pixel is still doing Pixel things: high contrast, with a dose of overexposure to compensate for that, and very sharp details. Some folks might like that look but not everyone will, even if you have darker skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D18tfaBTNzVe-giUTl3StbkE8bQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957781/akrales_211022_4802_0822.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6 and 6 Pro show off Android 12 well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="UeOAsn"&gt;As you’d expect with a new Pixel, the Pixel 6 and 6 Pro run the latest version of Google’s Android, the completely redesigned Android 12. We’ve already done a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;full review of Android 12&lt;/a&gt; — I’ll just add that it feels like the fun and whimsy that’s missing from the hardware design of the new Pixels was reserved for the software. It’s colorful and easy to read, with a lot of personalization options.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0ewnmh"&gt;Also unsurprising, there are a number of Pixel-specific software features, including things that are improved by Google’s new Tensor chip. The Pixel 6 has better voice dictation transcription, since it can do it all locally now, and it can translate foreign languages in messages and media faster than before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/njVwf8sdV8dg2e4_3OByiOyCz20=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22962441/Screenshot_20211027_175036.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Pixel 6’s ability to navigate an automated phone tree system is extremely clever but still needs work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="XBTwB0"&gt;But the most impressive software features to me are found in the phone app. In addition to the spam routing features Google has had for a few years, the Pixel 6 can now help you with automated phone tree systems and tell you how long the wait time might be when you call a business. It can even wait on hold for you and then notify you when someone picks up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BrG2iA"&gt;The automated phone tree feature will listen in on the call and transcribe the options presented, then give you big tappable buttons to make choices. It’s far easier than trying to listen to every word the system is saying only to miss something critical and have to wait for it to restart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xd3qnx"&gt;But in testing, it’s clear this still needs work — it can’t recognize languages other than English (such as when you’re presented to “press two for Spanish”) and it often misses words and context that prevent it from giving you the right buttons on the screen to press. Still, it’s a novel idea and I hope Google continues to iterate and improve on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5oIPds"&gt;Other additions are the ability to show boarding passes and other useful information right on the lock screen and support for select voice commands to the Assistant without having to say “Hey Google” first. It’s particularly convenient to just mumble “snooze” when an alarm goes off and have the phone obey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gshBVdQBcXY-fsgw38qruMxCe5s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22957766/akrales_211020_4802_0082.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="qpBvGh"&gt;One of the biggest questions surrounding the Pixel 6 announcement has been, did Google do it? Has it actually been able to produce a competent, flagship-level smartphone that doesn’t have any show-stopping bugs or big gotchas?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UhsiQo"&gt;And the answer is a resounding yes, the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro are excellent phones. They may not be the best in every category, but as a whole, they perform well, have great screens, excellent cameras, and reliably great battery life. The only real hang-up here is the size — if you don’t like large phones, they probably aren’t for you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="UXrBhK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Pixel 6 is an incredible phone for $600&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PI9Cff"&gt;Adding to their appeal is how much value is packed in. The Pixel 6 in particular is just a lot of phone for $600 — it’s hard to think of anything on the market that can compete with it at that price. Google is offering a better experience than basically any other Android phone maker in the markets where the Pixel is available, and often doing so for a lower price. It’s even undercutting OnePlus, which built its entire brand on selling premium phones for lower prices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="Imbs6s"&gt;Does that mean lots of people will actually buy the Pixel 6 or 6 Pro, when Google has long struggled to gain any market share? Frankly, I don’t really care, because those who do buy it will have a great phone at a great price. It’s hard to argue against that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="MiPiH4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10832275"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Sony now uses PlayStation PC label for its PC games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4iXzSgb5GfUgE8Us8aExsvUDKdY=/0x0:1320x880/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70056912/sonylogo.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wa6nTC"&gt;Sony’s PlayStation games on Steam are now published by PlayStation PC LLC instead of PlayStation Mobile. Forum posters &lt;a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-playstation-games-on-pc-are-now-published-by-playstation-pc-llc-no-longer-playstation-mobile.506331/"&gt;at Resetera&lt;/a&gt; noticed the change yesterday, and it appears the PlayStation PC company was &lt;a href="https://www.corporationwiki.com/p/39ipjn/playstation-pc-llc"&gt;formed earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. It could mean we’ll see Sony use more PlayStation PC branding in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5IjZE"&gt;Sony has been gradually growing its presence on PC over the past year, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/3/21312588/horizon-zero-dawn-pc-release-date-august-7-features-sony"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Horizon Zero Dawn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; arrived on Steam in August 2020, followed by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297091/days-gone-pc-playstation-games-ports-jim-ryan"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Days Gone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in February. Sony is also bringing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736518/god-of-war-sony-playstation-pc-steam-epic-games-store"&gt;&lt;em&gt;God of War &lt;/em&gt;to PC&lt;/a&gt; on January 14th and the remastered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/9/22661816/sony-playstation-showcase-uncharted-legacy-of-thieves-collection-ps5-pc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; at some point in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NgkNRbK2M5IiomEP-BmCEy3Am0Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22962905/EwOMTgn.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Days Gone is now published by PlayStation PC.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="DvkmIi"&gt;Sony’s head of PlayStation Studios, Hermen Hulst, revealed in June that Sony was still early on in its PC plans. “I want to emphasize that PlayStation will remain the best place to play our PlayStation Studios titles at launch,” said Hulst in a &lt;a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2021/06/02/hermen-hulst-qa-whats-next-for-playstation-studios/#sf246401757"&gt;PlayStation blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “But we do value PC gamers, and we’ll continue to look at the right times to launch each game.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Npz1ng"&gt;Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan has previously described Sony’s PC games push as an easy decision for the company. “There’s an opportunity to expose those great games to a wider audience and recognize the economics of game development, which are not always straightforward,” said Ryan in an &lt;a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/playstation-vr-jim-ryan-interview-2021"&gt;interview with &lt;em&gt;GQ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; earlier this year. “The cost of making games goes up with each cycle, as the caliber of the IP has improved. Also, our ease of making it available to non-console owners has grown. So it’s a fairly straightforward decision for us to make.”&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="RHCSff"&gt;Comcast’s X1 platform has slowly added apps to its library over the years, and &lt;a href="https://www.cmcsa.com/events/event-details/q3-2021-comcast-corporation-earnings-conference-call"&gt;this morning on the company’s earnings call&lt;/a&gt;, CEO Brian Roberts announced that the Apple TV app would join the roster soon, while Comcast’s Xfinity Stream app will launch on Apple TV devices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zg5NjK"&gt;Comcast’s tech platform, which already has apps for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16593310/netflix-4k-comcast-xfinity-x1-users-stranger-things-house-cards"&gt;Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17645152/comcast-amazon-prime-video-xfinity-x1-box"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, YouTube, and Disney+ in the US, isn’t just on its cable boxes anymore. It underpins the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/21/18276040/comcast-flex-streaming-announced-features-pricing"&gt;Xfinity Flex&lt;/a&gt; streaming platform, the XiOne streaming set-top box, and new &lt;a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/comcast-launches-xclass-tv-powered-by-global-entertainment-platforms"&gt;XClass 4K TVs&lt;/a&gt; that recently launched from Hisense. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;XClass 4K TV&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vkkY59"&gt;Two models of the TV are available, in 43- and 50-inch sizes, for &lt;a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FHisense-43-inch-XClass-4K-UHD-A6-Series-Smart-TV-43A6GX%2F357811284&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$298&lt;/a&gt; and $348, respectively. Like other smart TVs in their price range — and other devices on Comcast’s platform — they have streaming apps, Dolby Vision HDR, and voice search remotes. They also include a one-year subscription to Comcast’s Peacock Premium streaming service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9vNHK0"&gt;As Comcast tries to sell its tech on devices worldwide (in the UK and other European markets, it’s pushing a &lt;a href="https://corporate.comcast.com/press/releases/introducing-sky-glass-streaming-tv-from-sky"&gt;Sky Glass TV&lt;/a&gt; with the same basic platform), then including access to Apple TV Plus is simply a requirement to compete. Getting its app on Apple TV is a bonus as cord-cutting proceeds to shrink its base of customers with cable TV service.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Making this album with AI ‘felt like wandering in an enormous labyrinth’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RkJAo7DnkTwHw2dBpJZDiDTjsng=/0x354:3000x2354/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70056810/cotton_modules_shadow_planet_cover_3000x3000.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;‘Shadow Planet’ was made by Robin Sloan and Jesse Solomon Clark, aka The Cotton Modules, using OpenAI’s Jukebox AI music model. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aQKKYp"&gt;The scare is over and the fun can begin. That’s how I tend to think of creative endeavors involving artificial intelligence these days. We’ve moved past, I think, hyperbolic claims about AI making human art redundant and can now enjoy all the possibilities this technology affords. In that light, &lt;a href="https://ooo.ghostbows.ooo/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadow Planet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; — a new album made as a three-way collaboration between two humans and AI — shows exactly what sort fun can be had.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XXnnFM"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shadow Planet&lt;/em&gt; is the creation of writer &lt;a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/"&gt;Robin Sloan&lt;/a&gt;, musician &lt;a href="https://www.agentsdelfuturo.com/"&gt;Jesse Solomon Clark&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://openai.com/blog/jukebox/"&gt;Jukebox&lt;/a&gt;, a machine learning music program made by OpenAI. After an off-the-cuff Instagram conversation between Sloan and Clark about starting a band (named The Cotton Modules), the two began exchanging tapes of music. A seasoned composer, Clark sent seeds of songs to Sloan who fed them into Jukebox, which is trained on a huge dataset of 1.2 million songs and tries to autocomplete any audio it hears. The AI program, steered by Sloan, then built on Clark’s ideas, which Sloan sent back to him to develop further.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="du2TCi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;OpenAI’s Jukebox model is trained on 1.2 million songs to produce its own music&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="v6Phqr"&gt;The end result of this three-way trade is &lt;em&gt;Shadow Planet&lt;/em&gt;, an atmospheric album in which snippets of folk songs and electronic hooks emerge like moss-covered logs from a fuzzy bog of ambient loops and disintegrating samples. It is a complete album in and of itself: a pocket musical universe to explore. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAGyxi"&gt;As Sloan explained to me in an interview over email, the sound of &lt;em&gt;Shadow Planet&lt;/em&gt; is in many ways a result of the limitations of Jukebox, which only outputs mono audio at 44.1kHz. “Making this album, I learned that this kind of AI model is absolutely an ‘instrument’ you need to learn to play,” he told me. “It’s basically a tuba! A very… strange… and powerful… tuba…”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aMQTz5"&gt;It’s this sort of emergent creativity, when machines and humans respond to limitations and advantages in one another’s programming, that makes AI art so interesting. Think about how the evolution of the harpsichord to the piano affected styles of music, for example, and as the ability of the latter to play loudly or softly (rather than the single fixed dynamic of the harpsichord) engendered new musical genres. This, I think, is what’s happening now with a whole range of AI models that are shaping creative output. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xpPd5Q"&gt;You can read my interview with Sloan below, and find out why working with machine learning felt to him “like wandering in an enormous labyrinth.” And you can listen to &lt;em&gt;Shadow Planet&lt;/em&gt; on &lt;a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2w3ncCMwS9sP5tBayVBWbI?si=gFwAWVAwS8K3nYmnD8bpeA"&gt;Spotify&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apple.co/3mguKhq"&gt;Apple Music&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://apple.co/3mguKhq"&gt;iTunes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://cottonmodules.bandcamp.com/"&gt;Bandcamp&lt;/a&gt;, or on Sloan and Clark’s &lt;a href="https://ooo.ghostbows.ooo/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="o8sseL"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/2w3ncCMwS9sP5tBayVBWbI?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="380" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7W9Opn"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gEV7ZD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for clarity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hegcc9"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hey Robin, thanks for taking the time to speak to me about this album. First of all, tell me a little bit please about what material Jesse was sending you to start this collaboration? Was it original songs? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vKDHEQ"&gt;Yes! Jesse is a composer for commercials, films, and physical installations — he wrote the generative soundtrack that runs inside the visitor center at Amazon’s Spheres in Seattle. So he’s well-accustomed to sitting down and producing a bunch of musical options. Each tape I received from him had around a dozen small “songlets” on it, some only 20-30 seconds long, others a few minutes, all different, all separated by a bit of silence. So, my first task was always to listen through, decide what I liked best, and copy that to the computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TLUHU5"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And then you fed those into an AI system. Can you tell me a little bit about that program? What was it and how does it work? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nP4UDM"&gt;I used OpenAI’s Jukebox model, which they trained on ~1.2 million songs, 600K of them in English; it operates on raw audio samples. That’s a huge part of the appeal for me; I find the MIDI-centric AI systems too… polite? They respect the grid too much! The sample-based systems (which I’ve used before, in different incarnations, including &lt;a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__www.mcdbooks.com_features_sourdough&amp;amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;amp;c=7MSjEE-cVgLCRHxk1P5PWg&amp;amp;r=PP6-LTvRn3fOxO6seMWTQKOHEIiDwuZlSodM6UESPxA&amp;amp;m=rR_nZk_IWLfn3yt-3mshPh6aEztBNTY8Of0nEtDvT9Q&amp;amp;s=72alzV9crnmJFuLo7r_J6ZqTfedMGOrP5mcM02h0Q6U&amp;amp;e="&gt;to make music for the audiobook of my last novel&lt;/a&gt;) are crunchier and more volatile, so I like them better.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aaimlf"&gt;To sample the Jukebox model, I used my own customized code. The technique OpenAI describes in their publication is very much like, “Hey, Jukebox, play me a song that sounds like The Beatles,” but I wanted to be able to “weird it up,” so my sampling code allows me to specify many different artists and genres and interpolate between them, even if they don’t have anything in common.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ZyQWAC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It was, to be honest, an extremely slow and annoying process”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gPmPdi"&gt;And that’s all just the setup. The sampling process itself is interactive. I’d always start with a “seed” from one of Jesse’s tapes, which would give the model a direction, a vibe to follow. In essence, I’d say to the model: “I’d like something that’s a mix of genre X and Y, sort of like artists A and B, but also, it’s got to follow this introduction: &amp;lt;Jesse’s music plays&amp;gt;”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SLg6fy"&gt;I’d also, in some cases, specify lyrics. Then, I would go about eight to 10 seconds at a time, generating three options at each step — the computer churns for five to 10 minutes, FUN — then play them back, select one, and continue ahead… or sometimes reject all three and start over. In the end, I’d have a sample between 60-90 seconds long, and I’d print that to tape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VvVpvx"&gt;It was, to be honest, an extremely slow and annoying process, but the results were so interesting and evocative that I was always motivated to keep going!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UNzGKAu1VgKylkNFlF6HILwkeNo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22962443/the_cotton_modules_photo_credit_Dafna_Kory_3600px.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yebKAV"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What did Jesse think about the material you were sending him? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uRXUSO"&gt;He underscores that working with the material was often VERY difficult. Weird instruments would rise up out of nowhere, or the key would change in a strange way, etc. But I think that was part of the fun, too, and the reason to do this project at all: each sample I sent him was a puzzle to solve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nl3dM6"&gt;Ultimately, his work was both responsive — “how do I support this sample, help it shine” — and transformative — “what kind of song should this be?” That’s evident on all the songs, but a clear example is “Magnet Train,” where Jesse took pains to showcase and support the vocal performance (weird and dorky and great) and then extended it with elements that suggest “train-ness” — the chugging percussion, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DgZCnP"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And how exactly did you hone in on this particular sound, do you think? What pushed you in this direction?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Id0dmH"&gt;Oh, it was definitely the grain of the medium. Early on, I told Jesse that although the model could produce sound at 44.1kHz, it was only in mono. His response was: “Cool! Let’s use mono cassettes then.” And the music he sent back to me was mono, as well. In his final production pass, he added a bit of stereo width, just so the songs weren’t all totally locked in the center, but it’s a pretty “narrow” album generally, and that’s totally because of the AI’s limitation, which we decided to embrace and extend rather than fight. Same goes for the lo-fi, grainy, “radio tuned to a ghost channel” sound — totally an artifact of the way the model produces music, which we amplified further by bouncing the music to tape so many times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XAlVPC"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/2H61s7xW1IxjWnmiuT0Xzl?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="80" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Xog9Ly"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RjPleW"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So, in the finished songs that we’re hearing, what proportion of the music is made by AI and what by human? Is it even possible to make that distinction? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F5Tyrp"&gt;It really does vary widely from song to song, and the truth is, in some cases, we lost track! I’d start with a phrase from Jesse, put it through my sampling process, send it back to him, he’d add a layer or extend it, send it back to me, I’d put it BACK through the sampling process… what’s the human / AI breakdown there? It’s all sort of mixed and layered together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WBHdMF"&gt;There’s one division that’s clear: anytime you hear anything that sounds like a human voice, whether it’s enunciating lyrics clearly or sort of ooh-ing and ahh-ing, that voice is generated by the AI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="well9Z"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“this kind of AI model is absolutely an ‘instrument’ you need to learn to play”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ipPHp9"&gt;Making this album, I learned that this kind of AI model is absolutely an “instrument” you need to learn to play. And I’ve come to believe that analogy is a lot more useful and generative than like, “AI co-composer” or “automatic AI artist” or whatever other analogy you might have heard or can imagine. It’s basically a tuba! A very… strange… and powerful… tuba…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p3VvLm"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haha, right! I’ve spoken to quite a few artists who use machine learning models to make songs or books, and they often talk about the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;dynamic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; between them and the AI — whether it was pushing them in a given direction, for example. Did it feel like this for you at all, when you were exploring what music Jukebox could give you? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B5TbUn"&gt;I love this question, and here’s why: previously, I have been pretty skeptical / critical of the “big [AI] models trained on everything,” even as they’ve risen to prominence. This is a class that includes GPT-3, Jukebox, CLIP, VQGAN, etc. It’s very clear that this approach produces powerful results, but I always thought it was more creatively interesting to take responsibility for your own dataset, understand its composition as a key creative decision, etc. And I still think that’s true, to a degree…&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AupVjT"&gt;BUT!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="I7S27E"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“it has felt like wandering in an enormous labyrinth or a dead city”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="L31cnq"&gt;The experience of using Jukebox really turned me around on this. For me, it has felt like wandering in an enormous labyrinth or a dead city: huge, full of alleys and arcades. Even now, having used it for so long, I have no idea what’s still waiting in there, what can be found and carried out. Obviously, I’m betraying the fact that I’ve played too many RPGs here… but truly! That’s the feeling, and it’s VERY fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bIo7Xi"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;With that in mind, then, what do you think making this album with Jesse taught you about the future of AI and creativity? What do you think these systems will be doing in the future?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lzcvSd"&gt;AI techniques can do a whole bunch of different things for different kinds of artists, of course, but regarding this specific category, the generative model that can produce new music, new sounds. It seems TOTALLY clear to me that these are on the path to becoming a new kind of synthesizer or electric guitar. I think the story will be broadly similar — they’ll go from research project to novelty (which is where we’re at now) to tools for nascent virtuosos (it’s exciting to think about getting to that point!) to commonplace participants in any / every studio.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The OLED Switch’s new kickstand was made for Mario Party</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uU44yN73PgKc_Pcb0UNS_TC-1m0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70056808/Characters_group_shot_NOA_bmp_jpgcopy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ImSsAa"&gt;One of the core promises of the Nintendo Switch — the ability to easily play multiplayer games on the go — has long been undone by a flimsy piece of plastic. While the original Switch model technically made it possible to whip out the tablet for some impromptu &lt;em&gt;Mario Kart&lt;/em&gt;, the terrible kickstand made this impractical at best and dangerous (for your Switch’s screen) at worst. The latest iteration of the hardware finally fixes that —&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"&gt; along with the showcase feature, a much-improved OLED screen&lt;/a&gt; — and makes the dream of spontaneous &lt;em&gt;Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; tournaments a reality, at last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vgZ7mF"&gt;This week Nintendo is releasing &lt;em&gt;Mario Party Superstars&lt;/em&gt;, a sort of greatest hits collection for the digital board game series. It includes boards from the early Nintendo 64 games, alongside more than 100 mini-games pulled from both N64 and GameCube entries in the series. It’s a pretty solid collection, with some familiar favorites — along with some, let’s say, &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22745502/mario-party-superstars-tug-o-war-warning-minigame-palm-stick"&gt;less loved games&lt;/a&gt; — that have all been spruced up with a more modern presentation. If you didn’t play any of those originals, it basically feels like a new game, with visuals and animations on par with other titles on the platform, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/5/17931854/super-mario-party-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;including the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; Switch &lt;em&gt;Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; game&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g0T1OhREsxWOkqO-7BlLZTPoXnQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22873311/cfaulkner_210921_4751_0013.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Cameron Faulkner / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="iZAkHA"&gt;If you’re looking for a good collection of mini-games, and particularly if you have a fondness for the classic &lt;em&gt;Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; titles, &lt;em&gt;Superstars&lt;/em&gt; will scratch that itch. It doesn’t have as many playable characters as new titles, and some players might miss the more modern motion control games. Mostly, it’s great, though — and that’s true no matter which iteration of the Switch hardware you’re playing it on. But the game is also a perfect test case for the OLED Switch’s much-improved kickstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKdVDm"&gt;The problem with the original was that the stand was both too small and flimsy; your Switch never felt fully secured, even on a flat surface. This made it less than ideal for playing multiplayer games where things might get a little hectic. I definitely never trusted it myself. On the OLED version of the Switch, though, the stand now extends across the length of the tablet, and it’s a lot more sturdy as a result. As an added bonus, it’s adjustable as well, offering multiple viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tjfYoQ"&gt;Now, &lt;em&gt;Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; is the quintessential living room game, the kind of experience where it’s great having a group of friends yelling at each other while sitting around the television. That’s still the case here. But it turns out it &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; works really well in what Nintendo calls “tabletop” mode. This is where you have the Switch undocked, propped up on a tabletop, with everyone using their own Joy-Con controller to play.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nHQJHus1SPFnCY6pPdD_8izExiM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22962701/Minigame_LeafLeap_NOA.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kTfLn5"&gt;The OLED Switch screen is big and bright, so I was able to play with two other people sitting around a coffee table, and everyone could see what was going on just fine. And given that &lt;em&gt;Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; can get a little intense — seriously, just try playing a round of tug-of-war with a single Joy-Con — I was surprised to find that my Switch never toppled or even really wobbled. Arms were flying, people were yelling, and the game went on without a hitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lKvXi6"&gt;It may seem like a small thing, but the improved kickstand really fulfills that early promise from Nintendo. And it fits &lt;em&gt;Mario Party&lt;/em&gt; especially well given that the series is basically a board game with some added digital frills. It’s not the kind of feature that sells new hardware, the way a beautiful OLED screen does, but it makes a big difference for this kind of game. Now you can finally be one of &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/nintendouk/status/1088561355748200448"&gt;those rooftop party people&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7gBI0l"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Mario Party Superstars &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;launches on the Switch on October 29th.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Dj4Itr"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ijisvd"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook isn’t telling the whole story about its mental health research  </title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The company is attempting to minimize its own research&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="sHOCMZ"&gt;Ever since &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; published internal Facebook research that found Instagram harmed the well-being of teenage girls, the company’s defense has been to minimize and dismiss its own findings — saying documents were only relevant for internal product development. That’s nonsense, social science researchers say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZsCoP"&gt;Though Facebook’s work by itself is limited, it fits into a larger set of data — including from researchers outside the company — that suggests social media can have harmful effects on mental health. And even if that context didn’t exist, Facebook’s work alone suggests something bad enough is going on that it should cause concern. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CVIGdZ"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-instagram-is-toxic-for-teen-girls-company-documents-show-11631620739"&gt;reporting&lt;/a&gt; included internal slides discussing data that showed Instagram was linked with issues like anxiety, depression, suicidal thought, and body image issues. Facebook immediately went on the defensive, saying that the data was taken out of context, that it was subjective, and that it couldn’t prove anything about Instagram. The company’s efforts to obfuscate the research and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711182/facebook-whistleblower-smear-pr-response"&gt;smear the whistleblower&lt;/a&gt; who leaked it appear to be straight out of Big Tobacco’s playbook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TOXx8G"&gt;Experts &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; contacted think that, while Facebook’s statements on its research may be technically correct, they’re somewhat misleading. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Wxjxh"&gt;“It’s completely disingenuous,” says Melissa Hunt, a psychologist and associate director of clinical training at the University of Pennsylvania. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="jq6w7x"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“It’s completely disingenuous”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UKrYPm"&gt;Facebook put up its own version of the leaked slides —  complete with annotations that it said “give more context” on the research. Many of those annotations stress that the data is “based on the subjective perceptions of the research participants,” and that it wasn’t designed to assess if or how Instagram &lt;em&gt;caused&lt;/em&gt; any positive or negative effects. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACjUlr"&gt;The annotations also repeatedly note that the research is &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Instagram-Teen-Annotated-Research-Deck-2.pdf"&gt;qualitative&lt;/a&gt;. It relied on subjective information collected on questionnaires and through conversations with Instagram users, and it didn’t collect data that determined how frequently users experienced things like depression or body image issues. Facebook is arguing, then, that the information only shows that some users say they feel that way — and that it’s not enough to draw a line between Instagram and the mental health of teen girls more broadly.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hANgdp"&gt;Facebook said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that the studies were designed to help its product teams understand how users feel about the products, “not to provide measures of prevalence, statistical estimates for the correlation between Instagram and mental health or to evaluate causal claims between Instagram and health/well-being.” That changes the inferences people can make about the data, a spokesperson said in the statement.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YBNsAq"&gt;On the surface, that’s not an unreasonable response, says Kaveri Subrahmanyam, a developmental psychologist at California State University, Los Angeles, and associate director of the Children’s Digital Media Center, Los Angeles. The research &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; only based on survey data, and it &lt;em&gt;wasn’t&lt;/em&gt; designed to measure if or how Instagram causes changes in people’s mental health. That’s a problem with a lot of research around social media and mental health, she says: it’s asking people how they feel at one point in time. “That doesn’t tell you much,” Subrahmanyam says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VTRSlS"&gt;In that sense, Facebook’s right — there’s not much people can infer about the impact of a social media platform off of that type of data, Hunt says. In a vacuum, the limitations of research based on subjective survey responses from users mean it may not be particularly compelling. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="KNzn9X"&gt;&lt;q&gt;the data from the study is not in a vacuum&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fdVlRV"&gt;But the data from the study is not in a vacuum, Hunt says. Instead, it came out into a world where independent researchers have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712927/facebook-instagram-teen-mental-health-research"&gt;also been studying mental health and social media&lt;/a&gt;, and where some have been studying it with the type of careful research design that &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; figure out if social media causes changes in mental health.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s7sZpn"&gt;Hunt &lt;a href="https://guilfordjournals.com/doi/10.1521/jscp.2018.37.10.751"&gt;ran a study&lt;/a&gt;, for example, that randomly assigned a group of undergraduate students to continue their typical use of Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook, and another group to limit their use to 10 minutes on each platform a day. At the end of three weeks, the group that limited their use reported fewer feelings of loneliness and depression compared with the group that kept using social media as normal.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4tUeFs"&gt;“We have been finding these exact same things,” Hunt says. That consistency means researchers can take Facebook’s internal findings more seriously, despite the limitations, she says. “What this has conveniently done is provided us with nice illustrative content that simply echoes and mirrors and exemplifies exactly what we keep finding in experimental studies.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XEB2bk"&gt;Even without that context, and with the limitations of the survey data, the findings should be concerning enough that they should lead Facebook and other experts to start asking more questions, Hunt says. “It would still be deeply alarming and should instantly lead to more rigorous work,” Hunt says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OoAdA1"&gt;Facebook could start doing that sort of work if it wanted to. Since the initial leak of the mental health work, whistleblower Frances Haugen has distributed a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22740969/facebook-files-papers-frances-haugen-whistleblower-civic-integrity"&gt;mountain of documents&lt;/a&gt; detailing the company’s internal operations. They show just how much Facebook already knows about the impact of its platform on users — like how algorithmic changes made conversations on the platform angrier and more sensationalized, and how the platform can push users &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-knew-radicalized-users-rcna3581"&gt;toward extremism&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6KCvE"&gt;It probably already has the data it needs for more extensive analysis on Instagram and teen mental health, Subrahmanyam says. “I’m pretty sure they do have data that speaks to the real question of the impact.” In 2012, Facebook and Cornell University researchers were able to manipulate users’ moods by changing the content of their news feeds. The research was &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/06/everything-we-know-about-facebooks-secret-mood-manipulation-experiment/373648/"&gt;ethically dubious&lt;/a&gt; — technically, it was legal, but the team didn’t get informed consent from users, triggering waves of criticism after it was published in 2014. That incident showed just how much information the company can and does collect on its users, Subrahmanyam says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="swI7fw"&gt;If the company is trying to say that the findings from the internal study aren’t that bad, they should make that information — detailed breakdowns of how people engage with the platforms — public, she says. “Why are they not releasing the data that they have that shows the clicks and other behavior? I think they should be inviting researchers who have that expertise, and giving them that data and letting them do that analysis,” Subrahmanyam says. “Because they’re not open about that data, I can’t help but be skeptical.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="12AWwq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Because they’re not open about that data, I can’t help but be skeptical”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JN5o7o"&gt;There are parallels between Facebook’s approach to these issues and tobacco companies’ efforts to minimize the harm caused by cigarettes, Hunt says. Both rely on people coming back to their products over and over again, even if it’s not healthy for them. Social media can benefit teens and young adults if they stick to some guidelines — follow only people they know and like in real life, and don’t use it for more than around an hour a day, Hunt says. “But that runs directly counter to the business model these companies are built on,” she says — the model depends on people looking at content from as many people as possible, whom they may not know, for as many hours a day as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1PQnkX"&gt;Tobacco companies had a similar model. “They knew perfectly well that their products were both highly addicting — in fact, they had been engineered to be as addictive as possible — and that they were harmful. And they suppressed those findings,” Hunt says. Big Tobacco also tried to discredit whistleblowers, similarly to how Facebook responded to Haugen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hnwtEi"&gt;Facebook executives, for their part, say that the tobacco analogies don’t make sense. “I don’t think it’s remotely like tobacco,” Nick Clegg, vice president of global affairs and communication, &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/facebook-whistleblower-big-tobacco"&gt;said on CNN&lt;/a&gt;. “I mean, social media apps, they’re apps. People download them on their phones, and why do they do that? I mean, there has to be a reason why a third of the world’s population enjoys using these apps.” For what it’s worth, in the 1960s, a tobacco executive took a similar position before Congress, &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1965/09/the-quiet-victory-of-the-cigarette-lobby-how-it-found-the-best-filter-yet-congress/304762/"&gt;saying&lt;/a&gt;: “millions of persons throughout the world derive pleasure and enjoyment from smoking.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DkNLeX"&gt;Mark Zuckerberg said in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22711837/mark-zuckerberg-responds-to-facebook-whistleblower"&gt;his note&lt;/a&gt; to Facebook staffers that the company was committed to doing more research, and that it wasn’t suppressing data. “If we wanted to hide our results, why would we have established an industry-leading standard for transparency and reporting on what we’re doing?” he wrote. “If we wanted to ignore research, why would we create an industry-leading research program to understand these important issues in the first place?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="BZ5f3S"&gt;But so far, the company hasn’t released the type of information third-party researchers want to see to actually understand the questions around social media and mental health. “These are really important questions, given how important social media has become,” Subrahmanyam says. “If it’s really not that bad, why not share it?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OXHGnw"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m6ARJh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Activision Blizzard ends forced arbitration as CEO takes a massive pay cut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TOWgq4"&gt;Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20211028005446/en/A-Letter-From-CEO-Bobby-Kotick-Regarding-Progress-and-Commitments-Made-at-Activision-Blizzard"&gt;sent a letter&lt;/a&gt; updating employees on the further steps he and the company will take to change its image in the wake of multiple sexual harassment and discrimination lawsuits. Most notably, Kotick says that Activision Blizzard will employ a zero-tolerance harassment policy, waive arbitration in sexual harassment and discrimination claims, and the billion-dollar-net-worth CEO will take a massive pay cut — earning only $62,500 per year in total compensation until the board of directors feels certain diversity, equity, and inclusion goals are met. (Earlier this year, Activision Blizzard shareholders approved a &lt;a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2021-06-22-activision-blizzard-boss-bobby-koticks-usd155m-pay-package-approved-by-shareholders"&gt;$155 million pay package&lt;/a&gt; for Kotick.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G6bpn2"&gt;The letter outlined other goals for the company, including an investment of $250 million over ten years in programs that support diversity in the gaming and technology industries. Activision Blizzard is also committing to expanding the number of women and nonbinary people it employs by 50 percent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AKXlE5"&gt;Staring in July, Activision Blizzard was hit by &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597113/activision-blizzard-california-sexual-harassment-lawsuit-discrimination-employee-action"&gt;several lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; from government agencies accusing the company of permitting a culture of sexual harassment, abuse, discrimination, retaliation, and other unfair labor practices. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;Employees staged a walkout&lt;/a&gt; and formed an advocacy group called A Better ABK demanding change from the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kZtBEG"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Our demands remain as follows and chief suite still fails to acknowledge them. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ABetterABK?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ABetterABK&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EndAbuseInGaming?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#EndAbuseInGaming&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;a href="https://t.co/4Tk7aV9DjD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/4Tk7aV9DjD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ABetterABK   ABK Workers Alliance (@ABetterABK) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ABetterABK/status/1433466353726361603?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;September 2, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="tw320B"&gt;One of the chief demands of A Better ABK was the end to forced arbitration, greater pay transparency, and improved hiring practices that promote greater diversity and inclusion among Activision Blizzard’s workforce. Kotick’s letter seemingly addresses those demands and supports the company’s other actions, including &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/19/22735413/activision-blizzard-employee-terminations-harassment-discrimination"&gt;the firing of over 20 people&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740836/blizzard-overwatch-jesse-mccree-name-change-cole-cassidy"&gt;multiple updates to its games&lt;/a&gt; to remove problematic content, references, and people.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ford delays launch of its ‘hands-free’ BlueCruise driver assist feature until 2022</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qwAAjBCEWh7XzuIao9J2LlCw-1g=/0x2:1434x958/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70056565/BlueCruise_Mustang_Mach_E_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Ford&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Q4LaiB"&gt;BlueCruise, the “hands-free” driver assist feature that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/14/22383460/ford-bluecruise-hands-free-adas-f150-mustang-mache"&gt;Ford sees as a viable competitor&lt;/a&gt; to GM’s Super Cruise and Tesla’s Autopilot, won’t reach car owners until the first quarter of 2022, the company’s executives said Wednesday night. The automaker had originally planned on pushing an over-the-air (OTA) software update activating BlueCruise for select Ford customers before the end of 2021. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rdeifO"&gt;In an earnings call with investors, Ford CEO Jim Farley said the company’s engineers needed a little more time to make the advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) easier to use for customers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LweSw7"&gt;“We wanted to improve the customer experience,” Farley said. “So we pushed it back in terms of an OTA because we want it to be much simpler for the customer than was originally planned. And that takes a little planning to consolidate. Often these Level 2 systems require multiple updates to the car. We want it to be very simple. That took a little bit more work on our team’s part.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="SFktOM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We want it to be very simple. That took a little bit more work on our team’s part.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oqAzMY"&gt;Level 2 systems, as defined by the Society for Automotive Engineers’ levels of automation, work in concert with a number of distinct features, like adaptive cruise control, automatic emergency braking, lane-keep assist, blindspot detection, pedestrian monitoring, and stop sign detection. These systems do not make the vehicle autonomous, as drivers are required to stay vigilant and keep their eyes on the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Ymk0j"&gt;Ford also included an active driver monitoring system in the form of an infrared sensor on the steering column that tracks the driver’s eyes to make sure they are keeping them on the road. In that way, drivers can technically take their hands off the wheel on “prequalified sections of divided highways” that Ford has mapped. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hHTQ6N"&gt;Ford said that it was currently shipping 2021 F-150 pickup trucks and 2021 Mustang Mach-E SUVs to customers with BlueCruise functionality, but that the system would not be activated until the OTA software update is ready. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bWJTff"&gt;“Given the importance of this technology upgrade, we’ve retimed the BlueCruise over-the-air update so we can deliver the highest-quality experience possible for customers,” a spokesperson said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="INg7GL"&gt;Ford has said it expects to sell more than 100,000 vehicles equipped with BlueCruise in the first year, based on company sales and take-rate projections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="S4DlmW"&gt;Car consumers are certainly attracted to more high-tech systems, especially if they can promise a safer, more stress-free driving experience. A survey conducted by Edmunds in late 2017 found that 58 percent of car shoppers would pay an extra $1,000 or more for a vehicle equipped with active safety features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VpdHCr"&gt;The ADAS has grown highly competitive in the auto industry, as automakers seek to roll out more advanced systems to customers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22712566/gm-ultra-cruise-adas-hands-free-driving"&gt;GM recently announced&lt;/a&gt; a new version of Super Cruise called “Ultra Cruise,” that — when it ships in 2023 — will cover “95 percent” of all driving scenarios. Meanwhile, Tesla is pushing its “Full Self-Driving” beta software on more and more customers, despite warnings from government regulators that the system is being deceptively marketed as a fully autonomous system. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rad Power Bikes overtakes VanMoof to become the ‘most funded’ e-bike company</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/umJn0w6nV7gSPwXDubst346__s4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70056451/ahawkins_210914_4767_0010.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jUOM2Y"&gt;Rad Power Bikes announced that it had raised $154 million from investors as it seeks to grow its e-bike empire in the US and abroad. The company now claims it is the “most funded electric bike company in the world,” a little more than a month after Amsterdam-based VanMoof &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/1/22651860/vanmoof-128-million-funding-most-funded-ebike-company"&gt;made the same claim&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aqEyKB"&gt;For over a year, Rad Power Bikes and VanMoof have been in a neck-and-neck race to raise enough investment cash to help capitalize on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22178543/bike-bicycle-boom-covid-pandemic-2020-sales-cities-infrastructure"&gt;the bike boom&lt;/a&gt; while also smoothing out the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21437704/vanmoof-interview-s3-electric-bike-issues-delays-mobile-service-network"&gt;rough edges of their direct-to-consumer business models&lt;/a&gt;. Last month, VanMoof announced that it had raised $182 million over two years, with almost 200,000 bikes on the road currently and a five-year goal of getting 10 million people on VanMoof e-bikes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oym1mR"&gt;Now, Rad Power Bikes is saying it has retaken the lead. “Rad is the true front-runner,” Rad Power Bikes CEO Mike Radenbaugh said in an interview. “The leader in the space.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="NI3OWO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The leader in the space”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="A8Vd6h"&gt;Radenbaugh says the company has raised a total of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266143/rad-power-bikes-investment-electric-ebike"&gt;$304 million this year alone&lt;/a&gt; and $329 million since the business started in 2007. It presently has 350,000 customers riding its e-bikes and is projected to add another 100,000 customers in the latter half of 2021. The company, which Radenbaugh says operates at about break-even, currently offers 11 e-bike models and plans to add more in the future. And after years of relying on manufacturing in China, Rad Power Bikes has plans to bring some of its manufacturing capabilities to North America and Europe in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v2lrGB"&gt;“Our priority is getting bikes to our riders and creating ... the most seamless experience end-to-end as possible,” Radenbaugh said. “So we see bringing additional manufacturing locations as a way to do that.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="wccSWd"&gt;Like most companies today, Rad Power Bikes is feeling the pinch of supply chain constraints. Radenbaugh said the biggest bottleneck has been ocean freight, followed closely by drayage, or short-haul trucking. As a short-term solution, the company chartered several of its own vessels to deliver bikes and other parts from overseas. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I5NUWj"&gt;The company will triple the number of retail locations and mobile service locations by the end of 2022, he said. Rad Power Bikes currently has showrooms and service centers in Seattle, Washington; Vancouver, British Columbia; San Diego, California; and Utrecht, Netherlands. By the end of the year, the company will also have tripled its distribution capacity, having opened multiple new centers in recent months. Radenbaugh said customers will soon be able to receive bikes and accessories within a week or less of ordering. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MOQMYs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Rad Power Bikes has plans to bring some of its manufacturing capabilities to North America&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QLKAC3"&gt;Rad Power Bikes’ investors in this round are the same as the previous one: Morgan Stanley’s mutual fund, Counterpoint Global; Fidelity Management and Research Company; The Rise Fund, the global impact investing platform managed by TPG; and funds and accounts advised by T. Rowe Price Associates, as well as Durable Capital Partners LP and Vulcan Capital.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GvNo1R"&gt;Radenbaugh, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22296195/electric-bike-ebike-diy-youtube-conversion-kit-cost"&gt;who used to build his own e-bikes&lt;/a&gt; as a kid growing up in Northern California, founded the company in 2007. Since then, it’s risen to become the largest e-bike company in the US. Radenbaugh sees Rad Power Bikes — which makes big, heavy, durable bikes — as a challenge to legacy bike manufacturers and their focus on recreational products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="U36Pdw"&gt;“We popularized fat tires on e-bikes, throttles on e-bikes, big batteries, lots of power, universal front and rear racking systems, e-bikes that are designed to replace cars,” he said. “These fitness-oriented bike companies are integrating an off-the-shelf powertrain from a powertrain provider that does the same thing for 100 other brands ... That’s sort of a low volume and not world-changing way to think about building an e-bike company.”&lt;/p&gt;
