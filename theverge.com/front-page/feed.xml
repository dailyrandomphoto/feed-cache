    <title>Google’s latest Nest Doorbell and camera are not obvious upgrades</title>
    <content type="html">
  &lt;p&gt;Battery-powered options are great, but prepare to make compromises&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="cV9G6J"&gt;Ever since Google folded the Nest brand back into its main hardware lineup in 2019, the company has been slowly updating its product portfolio with a more cohesive design language and support for the newer Home app. This year, Google is finally turning its attention to its video doorbell and security cameras, following the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20946586/google-nest-wifi-review-mesh-router-price-specs-features"&gt;Nest Wifi&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22357214/google-nest-hub-2nd-gen-2021-assistant-smart-display-review"&gt;Nest Hub&lt;/a&gt; smart displays, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21501300/google-nest-audio-assistant-smart-speaker-review-price-specs-features"&gt;Nest speakers&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21725036/google-nest-thermostat-2020-review"&gt;Nest Thermostat&lt;/a&gt; that have already made the jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8GvfMu"&gt;With these updates, Google is not only making products that actually look like they are part of the same lineup; it’s also designing them to reach new customers for whom the older Nest products weren’t suitable. This is most apparent with the $179.99 Nest Doorbell battery, the company’s first video doorbell that doesn’t require a constant power source and can run on its internal rechargeable battery. For those who couldn’t use the prior Nest Hello (still available and now known as the Nest Doorbell wired) because their home didn’t have the required wiring, the Nest Doorbell battery now allows them to install a video doorbell that’s fully compatible with the Google Home platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="8yXYWX"&gt;&lt;q&gt;These latest Nest devices aren’t obvious upgrades for existing owners&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WM4Skm"&gt;The $179.99 Nest Cam battery offers a similar proposition, allowing you to install a Nest security camera in places where you don’t have easily accessible power. It’s also less expensive than prior Nest models, such as the IQ line, while still supporting some of the intelligence for which those cameras were known.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kto7mk"&gt;But while Google is reaching out to new customers with these products, it’s also leaving behind a lot of features that existing Nest customers might appreciate. Things like 4K video capture, which allows for automatic subject tracking and lots of flexibility with digital zoom, is unavailable on the Nest Cam battery. Meanwhile, the Nest Doorbell battery doesn’t support continuous 24/7 recording at all, even if you wire it in and pay for the highest tier of Google’s Nest Aware cloud storage service. There are also features that were supported in the old Nest app that haven’t made it over to the newer Google Home app yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjdrIG"&gt;That means the new crop of Nest security cameras and doorbells aren’t obvious upgrades for existing Google smart home owners. Instead, they are better suited for those who haven’t yet jumped into the smart home or haven’t already bought into one of Google’s many competitors that have addressed their needs for a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="DRO6op"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="EejlSR"&gt;Nest Doorbell Battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="rHUE6e"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10790920"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3cNLTk"&gt;The Nest Doorbell battery is a significant addition to Google’s smart home lineup. The first video doorbell from Google to function completely on battery, the Nest Doorbell can be installed in many more homes than the wired version. It also means that Google now has an offering that competes with Ring’s battery-powered video doorbells (the latest of which is the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Video-Doorbell-4/dp/B08JNR77QY?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$200 Video Doorbell 4&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FTJOuu"&gt;The design of the Nest Doorbell is a departure from the Nest Hello’s looks, with matte-finish plastic and minimal branding. You can get it in four different muted finishes (white, beige, gray, or green) to better match your home’s decor. It’s also much larger than the Nest Hello to accommodate its internal battery. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cteCYj"&gt;At over six inches tall, the Nest Doorbell is the largest video doorbell I’ve tested, and it’s considerably taller (though slightly narrower) than Ring’s battery doorbells. The doorbell button is also large and hard to miss (the circular LED that surrounds the button lights up white when it senses a person, making it even easier to spot). In all, the Nest Doorbell is likely bigger than whatever doorbell you’re replacing, but after some time it doesn’t look out of place. Even though it’s large, I think the new Nest Doorbell is one of the best-looking options you can buy, with its modern, minimal aesthetic that doesn’t have any cheap-looking glossy plastic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D8wYD0e3YbDDMOim39ZxpgojNzo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902334/dseifert_4748_nest_doorbell_cam_battery_4.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Doorbell is one of the largest video doorbells you can buy, taller than Ring’s Video Doorbell 4 (though slightly narrower).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yTEBx7"&gt;Despite being three years newer, the battery-operated Nest Doorbell camera is actually a step down from the wired version’s sensor. Video resolution is limited to 960 x 1280 pixels at 30 frames per second, compared to the 1600 x 1200 pixel resolution the older model captured. It also has a narrower field of view (145 degrees vs. 160 degrees), but since the aspect ratio has been turned to a portrait orientation (taller than it is wide), it provides a better head-to-toe view of someone at your door.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKBPZx"&gt;In my home, that means I can see people head to toe when they are standing in front of the doorbell. But the Nest Video Doorbell’s frame isn’t wide enough to see my entire porch, and packages are occasionally dropped out of its view, even when using the 20-degree wedge that comes in the box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2IBxK0"&gt;Otherwise, the image from the camera generally looks good, with HDR able to balance the exposure well and minimal distortion from the wide-angle lens. If you compare it side by side with the Nest Hello, you’ll likely see differences in sharpness and image quality in the older version. But there was never an instance in the nearly two months I’ve been testing the new version where I felt the video or image quality wasn’t satisfactory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/N8_WF1kYUzXUpf0rTGo_Hlde4T0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902374/Screenshot_20210913_094807.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Doorbell’s 3:4 aspect ratio isn’t quite wide enough to capture my whole porch, but it does show head-to-toe views.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oJo8uo"&gt;The Doorbell Battery has a standard black-and-white infrared night mode that will turn on automatically when it gets dark enough outside and fortunately doesn’t use a piercingly bright LED to illuminate visitors like the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22318478/logitech-circle-view-doorbell-homekit-review-test-price"&gt;Logitech Circle View doorbell&lt;/a&gt;. Though it isn’t wide enough to see my whole porch, I preferred the Nest Doorbell’s taller aspect ratio to the Ring Video Doorbell 4’s higher-resolution (1920 x 1080) but cramped widescreen view that doesn’t easily show feet or packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Spry06"&gt;One of the big pitches with the new model is its ability to track subjects such as people, vehicles, and animals and process that data locally, without relying on the cloud as much as the Nest Hello. It can alert you when someone is at your door, even if they haven’t rung the bell; it can tell you when a package was left (and, crucially, when it’s no longer there); and it can provide alerts for moving vehicles or animals should you choose to turn those on. If you subscribe to the Nest Aware service, you can tag faces and then the doorbell will announce who is at the door on a Nest smart speaker or smart display.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OhsYdj"&gt;The whole point of these features is to provide notifications for things you actually care about and not for any general motion that happens in the camera’s frame, like a waving branch or zealous spider.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="enk07R"&gt;Intelligence remains one of the things that separates Google’s doorbells from the rest of the field, and compared to others that attempt these features, the Nest Doorbell works better. It’s able to identify people easier, it can reliably identify a package, and you can customize what types of notifications you get pinged about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CCTQHT"&gt;But there is room for improvement. Ring’s cameras and doorbells have motion alert scheduling, which is very helpful when you have a busy front door during the day (like kids going in and out all of the time) but want to be alerted to activity at night. Google doesn’t offer this — it’s either notifications on or notifications off, with no scheduling or do not disturb options. I had to turn off people and moving vehicle pings because my phone was blowing up with notifications all day long whenever my family went in and out of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qcpXhC0HLUz-9TigPlMsFH2S-l8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902338/dseifert_4748_nest_doorbell_cam_battery_8.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Branding on the Nest Doorbell is thankfully very minimal.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dJSUrPOyfeN0T41F4b3SpmukijM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902335/dseifert_4748_nest_doorbell_cam_battery_5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Charging the battery takes about 4.5 hours and requires removing the doorbell from its mount. It can also be connected to traditional doorbell wiring if available.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="80UL72"&gt;The one option Google does offer is disabling alerts if the Home app thinks you are “home,” and then turning them on when you’re away. This is a good idea in theory, but in practice the system frequently confuses when I’m home and when I’m not, which makes me wary of relying on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FMykWQ"&gt;Another pitch with the new Nest Doorbell is its internal storage, which allows for it to capture events and save them when the internet goes down. It will then upload the footage once internet connectivity has been restored. This is a nice fail-safe if your home internet goes down regularly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nS8Hf5"&gt;In my experience, however, you don’t need your home network to go down for the Nest Doorbell to lose its internet connection. I tested two separate units and saw them drop from my network rather frequently (the Google Home app gives a push notification every time a camera is offline), even though they are only 20 feet or so from my Wi-Fi router. The doorbell does recover quickly when it has dropped from the network (sometimes it’s back online by the time I act on the push notification on my phone), but I’ve never had this issue with other video doorbells I’ve tested in recent years. Google says it’s inconsistent with its experience, but since I observed the same behavior across two units, it’s definitely a thing to be aware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dql9z3xwMeQfs3aFGekVmGpk_WA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902392/Screenshot_20210917_072028.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Doorbell’s onboard intelligence can detect and alert you to familiar faces, packages, animals, and moving vehicles without using cloud processing.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mz8k6d"&gt;Another thing that Google pitches with the new Nest Doorbell is three hours of video events without having to pay for a subscription to Nest Aware. But that three hours is not cumulative — it’s a rolling time block — so if you are sleeping and it records an event, chances are you won’t be able to see it when you wake up. It’s not something you can really rely on for any kind of security purposes, as a result, but if you wanted to have a simple “visual voicemail” for missed doorbell rings within the past few hours, it does do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="05xgN9"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/product/nest_aware?hl=en-US"&gt;Nest Aware service&lt;/a&gt; offers two tiers of options: a $6 per month ($60 / year) plan that offers 30 days of video history and face identification notifications, or a $12 per month ($120 / year) plan that extends the video history out to 60 days. Neither plan enables 24/7 video recording on the Nest Doorbell battery; the camera simply doesn’t support that feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ok05EY"&gt;Lastly, one of the best features of the old Nest Hello was its response time — it was the fastest doorbell to send a notification to smart displays or your phone when the bell was rung. The Nest Doorbell battery is, unsurprisingly, not as quick, generally taking about four to six seconds to send a notification of a visitor at your door. That’s not an egregious delay, however, and I didn’t miss anyone at my door because of it. Pulling up the live video feed on my phone is also quick enough to not be completely useless, either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dV5V7x"&gt;One thing that differentiates Ring’s battery doorbells and the Nest Doorbell is support for a wireless chime. If you’re using the Nest Doorbell on its battery, the only way you know someone has rung it is if you hear the chime it makes outside (unlikely), see the notification on your phone, or have a Nest smart speaker or smart display announcing the visitor inside your home. There’s no way to select which Nest speaker or display announces the visitor without turning on its do not disturb mode, either. Chances are if you’re considering the Nest Doorbell, you probably already have a Nest smart speaker or two in your home, but without them, it loses some of its convenience. (The Nest Doorbell does work with existing electronic chimes if you set it up in a wired installation.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1UPfskuuyAGZzXkz2ghc52UX4QI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902332/dseifert_4748_nest_doorbell_cam_battery_2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Doorbell’s camera is lower resolution than the Nest Hello from 2018, but image quality is generally good in most scenarios.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d55iNU"&gt;Google claims that with typical usage on its default settings, the Nest Doorbell’s battery should last about 2.5 months between charges. In my experience, with notifications for people, packages, vehicles, and animals in a single zone turned on; video quality set to maximum; event length set to the maximum three minutes; and a late summer / early fall northeastern United States climate, the battery lasts between six and eight weeks. That’s better than the typical four weeks I’ve gotten over long-term testing with Ring’s battery doorbells, but obviously less convenient than a wired doorbell that never needs to be charged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6aVTsV"&gt;Unlike Ring or Arlo’s battery doorbells, the Nest Doorbell doesn’t have a removable battery. Instead, charging it requires taking it down from its mount and plugging it into a charger for about four and a half hours. You can’t just have a fresh battery charged that you can swap in, like you might do with a Ring, and when you’re charging the battery, you obviously don’t have a doorbell for anyone to press or capture moments. It’s less than ideal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B3jquQ"&gt;The Nest Doorbell is primarily designed to be used with its internal battery, but if you have existing wiring available, you can wire it in. (Google says it will also release an AC adapter that’s compatible with both the battery and wired versions of the Nest Doorbell in the future.) But if you can use a wired doorbell, you should just get one that works wired because the Nest Doorbell doesn’t gain any features or better performance when it’s wired in. The wired version of the Nest Doorbell offers faster notifications to a smartphone or smart display, plus the ability to have 24/7 recording. Google has announced that it will be &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700859/google-nest-doorbell-wired-2nd-gen-launching-2022"&gt;releasing a new version of the wired doorbell&lt;/a&gt;, likely with many of the onboard processing and storage features of the wireless one, some time in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="H7QpDZ"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cFGF0l"&gt;Nest Cam battery&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div id="3sfY46"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="scorecard:10790928"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cVE2Wc"&gt;The $179.99 Nest Cam battery is Google’s first attempt at a battery-operated security camera. It can be mounted indoors or out and lasts an expected two and a half months between charges. In the box is a magnetic mounting plate that can hold the camera from above, behind, or below, though Google also sells a $30 stand for placing the camera on a shelf or table.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6G1TDu"&gt;The Nest Cam is larger than Google’s powered camera options, as it has to accommodate the internal battery. It has a simple design, with a matte finish, white plastic body and black front where the camera, microphone, and motion sensors are. It looks nice, at least as far as home security cameras go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6X3Om"&gt;Google says that it has seen a lot of growth in demand for cameras that can be used outdoors instead of just inside, so to test the Nest Cam battery, I installed it under an eave looking onto a side deck of my home. This area doesn’t get as much motion activity as the front of my house, so even after over six weeks of use, it still had 49 percent battery (or an estimated six weeks) left. Installation is very simple — Google compares it to hanging a picture on the wall — and only requires a couple of screws. The magnetic mount is easier to install than other camera mounts and it makes it very easy to adjust the camera’s angle of view or take it down to charge the battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NrcJupsU4fuq-4kuiA_mmHs_KWA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902340/dseifert_4748_nest_doorbell_cam_battery_10.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Nest Cam is attractive, at least as far as security cameras go.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5jIPM2Y4THiVl6gXXDW3rSzYLdU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902342/dseifert_4748_nest_doorbell_cam_battery_12.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nest Cam’s magnetic mount is easy to install and makes it easy to remove the camera for charging.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B0lxp0"&gt;Since the battery is not removable, charging the camera requires taking it down and plugging it in for 4.5 hours. This is less convenient than cameras that have easily swapped batteries, but the Nest Cam lasts about three times longer between charges than the Ring cameras (with swappable batteries) I’ve tested in the same location. If you do want to use it wired and not have to worry about charging batteries, Google sells a weatherproof power adapter for $35 extra. This also enables 24/7 recording with the top-tier Nest Aware plan, which isn’t possible when the camera is running on battery power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zN0OaS"&gt;The Nest Cam has a 16:9 1080p sensor, which is a step down from the older Nest IQ cameras’ 4K sensors. It has night vision and HDR and, generally, the image quality looks good. But since it doesn’t have the resolution of the older camera, you can’t zoom in on details such as a name badge or license plate as easily. It also can’t automatically zoom and pan when it sees a subject like the old IQ cameras could. Google says it limited the resolution to preserve bandwidth, but the tradeoff is you won’t see as much detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BcNdup"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Nest Cam demo clip|104219" data-volume-uuid="fc4fe0da8" data-volume-id="104219" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-540" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="chorus"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="caption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Nest Cam doesn’t not have as high resolution of a sensor as older models.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SVhJfx"&gt;Like the Nest Doorbell battery, the Nest Cam can detect people, animals, or moving vehicles (but no package detection) and it does all of this locally. It also has the same three hours of event history for free, but again, you really need to pay for a Nest Aware plan if you hope to use the Nest Cam as any sort of security device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="B7ICFR"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="nCBhvb"&gt;Google Home app&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zmNjai5f1s6p_U2rDWIXXHaBbas=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902433/IMG_1180.PNG"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Google Home app is missing a lot of important security camera features, but it does let you see all of your cameras at once.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="4RCnV0"&gt;Both the Nest Doorbell battery and the Nest Cam battery are set up and managed in the Google Home app. Neither of them works within the old Nest app, and if you have older Nest devices, you’ll need to use both apps to manage your home. Google says that it plans to migrate everything over to the new Home app eventually, but it hasn’t committed to a timeframe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u272JG"&gt;The Home app collates all of your smart home devices compatible with the Google Assistant in one place, which is nice. But it still lacks features that are useful for security cameras, like the ability to quickly jump from event to event without scrolling through an endless timeline. Google says it plans to add this feature soon, as well as a web app that will let you view camera feeds and perform other smart home actions from a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vhSA37"&gt;Relevant to the cameras, the Home app offers a way to see feeds from every camera you’ve installed at the same time, which is very handy. But it’s very easy to “turn off” the camera when all you want to do is exit the live feed, which then disables all of the camera’s functionality until you turn it back on. As a result, I inadvertently turned off the Nest Cam battery more than once and didn’t get any alerts or recordings until I realized my mistake and turned it back on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NO0ZnU"&gt;The Home app is largely the same between iPhone and Android, but if you are using an Android phone, you’ll get a thumbnail preview of the video in the notification, which isn’t available on the iOS app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="vy7aX9"&gt;
&lt;p id="mszzly"&gt;Google’s first attempts at battery-powered cameras and doorbells are important, even if it’s late to the game. There are a lot of people who don’t have the option for a wired doorbell installation or running power to a security camera is not feasible where they want to use it. But it’s clear that these are first attempts, and there are a lot of things that can be improved (hopefully with software updates, though there are certainly some hardware concerns). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="L6DCQS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Google’s strategy with Nest products has noticeably shifted toward lower-cost, more accessible devices&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NE0683"&gt;The company’s strategy with its Nest smart home products has noticeably shifted over the past few years, as it has continuously revamped the lineup to be less expensive and more accessible. But at the same time, it has had to jettison features that had come to separate Nest devices from the rest of the pack. Some of those features may not have been very popular, but based on the reaction to the new cameras and doorbell (and &lt;a href="https://www.googlenestcommunity.com/t5/Blog/Message-from-our-GM-Updates-for-our-Nest-customers/ba-p/17122"&gt;Google’s recent response&lt;/a&gt; in the Nest community forums), it’s clear that it may have swung the pendulum a bit too far and is leaving some of its most loyal customers behind. Things like image quality, 24/7 recording, camera scheduling, sound alerts, and easy access to captured events are all important features in products designed around home security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="14btnh"&gt;What this means for the Nest Doorbell battery and Nest Cam battery is simple: if you already have a Nest Hello or an older Nest camera, you probably don’t want to buy these new models. The few features they offer over the older versions don’t quite add up to what you’d be giving up by upgrading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="GhDnOg"&gt;For those who haven’t bought into the Nest ecosystem and are looking at these new models, they do offer some compelling features over the competition. The Nest Doorbell battery looks nicer, has a better field of view, and lasts longer between charges than Ring’s competing models. The Nest Cam battery similarly lasts longer between charges than a battery-operated Ring camera, though it is significantly more expensive. If you’re planning to build a smart home around the Google Assistant, the Nest cameras and doorbell are your best options, but if you have some flexibility, I’d encourage you to shop around first.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple shares memorial to Steve Jobs on 10th anniversary of his death</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1ure96Cy3FMUwLBlRAbXTxZs4Eo=/0x32:3650x2465/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69955046/Screen_Shot_2021_10_05_at_9.13.26_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EUpJQu"&gt;Apple is commemorating its co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs’ death with &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/"&gt;a new short film and a personal statement&lt;/a&gt; from the visionary tech executive’s family. Jobs passed away 10 years ago &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2011/10/6/2473035/apple-steve-jobs-has-died"&gt;on October 5th, 2011&lt;/a&gt;, after a difficult battle with pancreatic cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X9cigZ"&gt;The short film — which has currently taken over Apple’s landing page —  commemorates Jobs’ life in photos, videos, and some of his most iconic quotes, from “the computer is a bicycle for the mind” to the introductions of the iMac, the iPod, and the iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Ubqnxz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;“People with passion can change the world for the better.”— SJ. Hard to believe it’s been 10 years. Celebrating you today and always. &lt;a href="https://t.co/x2IUnlO7ta"&gt;pic.twitter.com/x2IUnlO7ta&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Cook (@tim_cook) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tim_cook/status/1445358107157221379?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jCdSaA"&gt;Apple also published a statement from Jobs’ family, shared below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="leaHWN"&gt;For a decade now, mourning and healing have gone together. Our gratitude has become as great as our loss.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G8fKy5"&gt;Each of us has found his or her own path to consolation, but we have come together in a beautiful place of love for Steve, and for what he taught us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rTR5Gx"&gt;For all of Steve’s gifts, it was his power as a teacher that has endured. He taught us to be open to the beauty of the world, to be curious around new ideas, to see around the next corner, and most of all to stay humble in our own beginner’s mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Xqm0xa"&gt;There are many things we still see through his eyes, but he also taught to look for ourselves. He gave us equipment for living, and it has served us well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Vzh3pQ"&gt;One of our greatest sources of consolation has been our association of Steve with beauty. The sight of something beautiful — a wooded hillside, a well‑made object — recalls his spirit to us. Even in his years of suffering, he never lost his faith in the beauty of existence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yoI2b"&gt;Memory is inadequate for what is in our hearts: we miss him profoundly. We were blessed to have him as husband and father.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="ALJz1L"&gt;Michael Dell, founder and CEO of Dell Technologies, &lt;a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/computing/the-steve-jobs-deal-with-dell-that-could-have-changed-apple-and-tech-history/?utm_source=reddit.com"&gt;spoke to &lt;em&gt;CNET&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; about his work with Jobs. “You can’t be following the rules and making amazing things happen. Steve was certainly exceptional in that regard,” Dell says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPevOE"&gt;Tim Cook, Jobs’ successor as CEO, shared his thoughts with Apple employees via a companywide memo, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-10-05/read-tim-cook-s-staff-memo-on-10th-anniversary-of-jobs-s-death?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;obtained by &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “[Steve] challenged us to see the world not for what it was, but for what it could be,” Cook writes. “I feel so lucky that we spend our days creating wildly innovative tools that connect people, inspire them to think differently, and empower them to make their own dent in the universe, too.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OTFyfe"&gt;Jony Ive, Jobs’ close friend, collaborator, and Apple’s former chief design officer offered his memories of Jobs yesterday &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/jony-ive-steve-jobs-memories-10th-anniversary-11633354769?mod=e2tw"&gt;in an editorial for &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. “&lt;/em&gt;My understanding of him refuses to remain cozy or still,” Ive writes. “He truly believed that by making something useful, empowering and beautiful, we express our love for humanity ... I miss Steve desperately and I will always miss not talking with him.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4jqdt2"&gt;Apple’s memorial video is &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/"&gt;available to view on its site&lt;/a&gt;. For more information on Jobs and Apple’s outsized impact on the world at large, you should listen to &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/land-of-the-giants-podcast"&gt;the current (fifth) season of &lt;em&gt;Land of the Giants&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuZNzz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 5th, 2:03PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added Tim Cook’s memo from &lt;/em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;em&gt;and tweet from Cook sharing Apple’s memorial.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>All Facebook Gaming creators can co-stream now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U2MZIoh4YqcHEDW-pQlqwqoPBeQ=/0x0:720x480/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69954916/acastro_210722_1777_facebookgaming_720.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1MPeHv"&gt;Facebook is adding co-streaming to Facebook Gaming, a useful feature the Twitch competitor has lacked &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/06/07/facebook-launches-fb-gg-gaming-video-hub-to-compete-with-twitch/"&gt;since it launched in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, while Twitch’s version of a co-streaming feature — &lt;a href="https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/how-to-use-squad-stream?language=en_US"&gt;“Squad Stream”&lt;/a&gt; — requires you to be a Twitch Partner, Facebook is making co-streaming available to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CwoK8d"&gt;“With co-streaming, we aim to increase discoverability for creators, encourage collaboration between creators and elevate the overall viewing experience,” Facebook explains. In short, streaming the same game alongside someone else is mutually beneficial. Actually starting a stream involves tagging up to three other creators during stream setup or after you’re live. If the other creators tag you back, then your audience is launched into a “co-streaming viewer experience,” according to Facebook. Besides being a method to introduce creators to each other and their audiences, co-streams also allow viewers to see the same game from different perspectives.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Image: Facebook" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nKrBID8WLY5Vgi3BF0s_UszwrMI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902492/Co_play_UI_ScreenOnly_100421.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Here’s what co-streams will look like on Facebook Gaming.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="taVWZa"&gt;Both Twitch and Facebook Gaming viewership &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/15/22331623/twitch-facebook-gaming-pandemic-hours-watched"&gt;blossomed during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, with Facebook Gaming up 82 percent year over year in terms of hours of watch time. Adding co-streaming and not requiring streamers to go through the time-consuming process of becoming a partner — Facebook’s process &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323148/facebook-gaming-partnership-twitch-affiliate-level-up"&gt;is known to be somewhat grueling&lt;/a&gt; — could help make Facebook’s platform grow even more appealing. Hopefully, co-streaming makes the prospect of building an audience that much easier, too.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Taylor Swift fans are getting caught up in the Virginia gubernatorial race</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="55th Academy Of Country Music Awards - Show" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U4bTd_NJBiAzW2Y_5C1q73ZTlew=/390x0:4610x2813/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69954930/1272912319.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by ACMA2020/Getty Images for ACM&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7x2Ley"&gt;Weeks before Virginia’s gubernatorial election, the campaign for Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe is reaching out to an unexpected constituency: Taylor Swift fans. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvCMJA"&gt;On Tuesday, the McAulliffe campaign launched a series of Facebook, Instagram, and Google search ads highlighting his opponent Glenn Youngkin’s role in the controversial purchase of Taylor Swift’s master recordings in 2019. The buyout of Swift’s masters has been a point of bitter contention for the singer and her fans and could be an unexpected liability in the upcoming race.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IwSsLY"&gt;Last year, Youngkin — the Republican nominee for Virginia governor — retired as co-CEO of the private equity firm The Carlyle Group before launching his 2021 gubernatorial bid. At Carlyle, Youngkin worked with the media executive Scooter Braun to acquire Big Machine Label Group, taking control of all of Swift’s master recordings and, for a time, refusing to sell them back to the singer. Several months later, Swift called on Carlyle to intervene in the deal, saying that the acquisition made it more difficult for her to perform her own music and produce her Netflix documentary named after her record &lt;em&gt;Reputation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KQw4x6y2nfGlw1YHvUL7JmpjK0U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902614/unnamed_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Terry for Virginia&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WeEcud"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/24/business/taylor-swift-carlyle-scooter-braun.html"&gt;In a Tumblr post at the time&lt;/a&gt;, Swift wrote that the purchase of her masters put Braun in the position of “controlling a woman who didn’t want to be associated with them. In perpetuity.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PT3Gvm"&gt;The McAuliffe five-figure ad buy will target voters who like Swift and engage with her content across Facebook and Instagram, according to the campaign. They will also place ads in Google search results for Virginians that search for her name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKvW1z"&gt;The ads include images of Swift and Youngkin interlaid with the hashtag #WeStandWithTaylor, a popular tag used by fans and Swifties to show support throughout the artist’s battle with Braun. Last November, Braun sold the rights to a separate private equity firm in a deal believed to be worth more than $300 million, &lt;a href="https://variety.com/2020/music/news/scooter-braun-sells-taylor-swift-big-machine-masters-1234832080/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Variety&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lUU8OD"&gt;As of October, the Virginia gubernatorial race is in a dead heat. &lt;a href="https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/virginia/"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;FiveThirtyEight’s&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;most recent poll analysis, McAuliffe is projected to win 47 percent of the vote, whereas Youngkin is projected to win 44 percent, putting either candidate in striking distance of a win. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0Tl6Jt"&gt;Enthusiastic fan bases have proven to be essential tools for political candidates over the last few years. Sen. Ed Markey’s (D-MA) young supporters helped him turn the tides of last year’s Democratic Senate primary against then Rep. Joe Kennedy III. At least one volunteer for the campaign identified themselves as a former Swifty. Last August, there were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21408407/ed-markey-stans-fandom-politics-massachusetts-primary-joe-kennedy"&gt;at least 100 Twitter stan accounts&lt;/a&gt; backing the senator, including accounts like @harries4markey and @barbz4ed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dD1rqH"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Correction: &lt;/strong&gt;This article wrongly stated that Braun sold the rights to the masters back to Swift. He sold them to a different private equity firm in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJMANB"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OgMejv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>I want to taste an AI-designed flavor</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MPZcxDW-SPlve7Vx_HdnJF9d8FM=/0x0:3600x2400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69954792/HK_05_5S2A0948.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Scentronix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ehZjvN"&gt;When I cook, I typically just Google a recipe or try one out on the fly. But in the future, it’s possible artificial intelligence might help me concoct a meal or assist a chef as they write their next cookbook or design a menu. In today’s&lt;em&gt; Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; AI episode, we explore the world of AI product design — how far could AI go in helping humans design smells and tastes? For that discussion, we chat with Frederik Duerinck, the founder of ScentTronix, which is part software, part hardware and attempts to make customizable perfumes based on individual people. We also talk to Michael Spranger, COO at Sony AI, about how Sony is helping chefs design recipes and maximize flavor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4KIave"&gt;Finally, we take it a step further and ask whether it’s even possible for a computer to eventually smell and taste. We all get to learn about e-noses together! Saket Navlakha, an associate professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, guides us through the world of algorithms, AI, and scent. (Thank fruit flies for his work.) Check out the episode below, and stay tuned to &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast &lt;/em&gt;every week for all the tech talk you need to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google just announced its Pixel 6 event on October 19th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/h1viXulFX7xk2ZqDKhU7vWRABs4=/371x0:3596x2150/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69954788/FA8qbJ0VQAsbGif.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qW1dRE"&gt;Google traditionally holds an October hardware event to reveal its new Pixel phones. This year, it already announced them — here’s the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22628205/google-pixel-5a-review-price-screen-battery-specs"&gt;Pixel 5A&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605094/google-pixel-6-pro-tensor-processor-specs-ai-ml"&gt;Pixel 6&lt;/a&gt;. But the company clearly hasn’t said &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; it wants to say publicly quite yet, because &lt;a href="https://pixelevent.withgoogle.com/"&gt;it just announced a virtual event for October 19th at 1PM ET / 10AM PT&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jBce9g"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Google:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="OWYrKO"&gt;On October 19, we’re officially introducing you to Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro—the completely reimagined Google phones. Powered by Tensor, Google’s first custom mobile chip, they’re fast, smart and secure. And they adapt to you. #Pixel6Launch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="OmPZaA"&gt;And though Google got out ahead of some of the leaks this year with its early Pixel announcements, there’s still a lot we don’t know about the Pixel 6 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22686534/google-pixel-6-pro-leak-display-screen-video"&gt;the Pixel 6 Pro&lt;/a&gt;. We’re intrigued by what we’ve heard &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676099/google-pixel-6-tensor-processor-rumor-arm-cortex-x1-core-mystery-strange"&gt;about the Pixel 6’s Tensor processor&lt;/a&gt;, which undoubtedly deserves some sort of deep dive, and we’re still waiting to hear if &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/8/22525271/google-pixel-fold-folding-phone-samsung-display-theelec"&gt;Google’s first folding-screen Pixel&lt;/a&gt; will see its rumored 2021 reveal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nrt8U6"&gt;Plus, of course, we’re still waiting for Google to formally announce when it’ll release Android 12. We’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708720/android-12-review-features-pixel-update-software"&gt;already reviewed the update&lt;/a&gt;, of course, but Google was only willing to say that a push to Pixel devices &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708992/android-12-aosp-available-download-install"&gt;will begin in the “next few weeks.”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitch icon Nickmercs isn’t going anywhere</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/awstVsr8sDn7Pu90inZzKP77unc=/0x0:8256x5504/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69954742/FaZe_NICKMERCS___Main_Press_Photo_1___Credit_Jeffrey_Cleary.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;FaZe Clan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5iTmXG"&gt;Nick “Nickmercs” Kolcheff, one of the biggest streamers on Twitch, has signed a deal to continue streaming exclusively on the Amazon-owned streaming platform. The deal locks down one of Twitch’s most important creators for the foreseeable future, and it comes at a particularly important time, since Twitch lost two major streamers to YouTube Gaming in September.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v8moJg"&gt;Just to give you an idea of just how big Kolcheff is, the &lt;a href="https://twitchtracker.com/subscribers"&gt;unofficial metrics site TwitchTracker&lt;/a&gt; says he has more than 28,000 subscribers, making him one of the most-subscribed streamers on the platform. If he had been convinced to stream on another site, it would have been a big blow for Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="W6z5MJ"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;THE SHOW GOES ON! &lt;a href="https://t.co/SE93iSIFe0"&gt;pic.twitter.com/SE93iSIFe0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— FaZe Nickmercs (@NICKMERCS) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NICKMERCS/status/1445426865565483011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nhx0fx"&gt;The streaming talent wars kicked off in August 2019, when Tyler “Ninja” Blevins defected &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/1/20750393/ninja-mixer-exclusive-twitch-fortnite-streaming-gaming-announcement"&gt;from Twitch&lt;/a&gt; to the Microsoft-owned streaming platform Mixer. That led to an intense period of streamer shuffling as some of the biggest players signed exclusive deals with Twitch, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20932354/shroud-twitch-mixer-channel-search-hide"&gt;Mixer&lt;/a&gt;, and other platforms like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/4/20948315/twitch-jack-courage-dunlop-youtube-live-exclusive-deal-fortnite-100-thieves"&gt;YouTube Gaming&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/22/20977702/disguisedtoast-twitch-facebook-gaming-hearthstone-teamfight-tactics-jeremy-wang"&gt;Facebook Gaming&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Db7bo"&gt;While the deal-making has cooled as of late (in part because &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21299032/microsoft-mixer-closing-facebook-gaming-partnership-xcloud-features"&gt;Microsoft shut down Mixer&lt;/a&gt;, removing an entire streaming platform from the market) in recent weeks, the ecosystem has shown signs of shifting again. In September, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/30/22643215/drlupo-move-from-twitch-youtube-gaming-exclusivity-deal"&gt;Ben “DrLupo” Lupo&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timthetatman/status/1433096643121909766"&gt;Tim “TimTheTatman” Betar&lt;/a&gt; announced exclusive streaming deals with YouTube Gaming within days of each other — and nearly two years after they had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/10/21004943/twitch-timthetatman-drlupo-lirik-exclusive-deal-sign"&gt;signed deals&lt;/a&gt; with Twitch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NfP7zv"&gt;In response to an emailed question about whether or not he considered switching from Twitch, Kolcheff said “yes and no,” and highlighted how he produces content on other platforms every day. “That said, there is currently nothing like streaming on Twitch,” he added.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b7V7zo"&gt;Terms weren’t disclosed for Kolcheff’s new Twitch deal. But I’d guess that Twitch may have dug deep into its coffers to entice him to stick around.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Instagram is getting rid of IGTV, sort of</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ikGjvnlzHqgKzQt23gnO4PYzVso=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69954505/acastro_190919_1777_instagram_0002.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hKSX8b"&gt;Instagram is finally acknowledging that IGTV, its first big push into video, didn’t pan out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="58ivKh"&gt;Today, the company is rebranding IGTV as “Instagram TV,” and it’s getting rid of the exclusive IGTV video format. Videos posted to the main Instagram feed can now run up to 60 minutes long — a length previously reserved for IGTV videos — and you’ll no longer have to leave the main app to view them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mUy9lK"&gt;A spokesperson for Instagram says the IGTV app, now called the Instagram TV app, will remain as a “destination for people to visit with the intent of watching video.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AgHQaud6HLT7XcEvWAhYou5fSlA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902533/244367723_884783532474523_6124902347763306887_n.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Instagram&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Feed videos and IGTV videos will be consolidated into Instagram TV, which will get a single tab on profile pages. Reels will remain discrete.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rQcpkI"&gt;IGTV was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/20/17484436/instagram-igtv-video-app-launch"&gt;introduced in June 2018&lt;/a&gt; and was essentially meant to become a mobile equivalent to YouTube, creating a space to discover and watch longer videos. But the longer format never caught on. And just two months later, an app called TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17644260/musically-rebrand-tiktok-bytedance-douyin"&gt;launched in the US&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dcap6T"&gt;Instagram has since refocused its video efforts on rivaling TikTok with its short video format Reels. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/5/21354117/instagram-reels-tiktok-vine-short-videos-stories-explore-music-effects-filters"&gt;Reels launched in August 2020&lt;/a&gt;, and Instagram has aggressively pushed forward with them, giving them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/12/21561099/instagram-reels-shopping-home-screen-tab-update"&gt;a central spot in the app’s navigation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/17/22537297/instagram-reels-ads-launch-globally"&gt;starting to sell ads&lt;/a&gt;, and cross-posting them &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22700289/facebook-reels-instagram-play-bonus-tiktok"&gt;into Facebook’s News Feed&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lvXr66"&gt;Reels still has one major shortcoming, though: it doesn’t offer a consistent way for creators to get paid out, as YouTube and TikTok do. Facebook plans to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577242/facebook-1-billion-payments-creators-2022"&gt;pay $1 billion to creators&lt;/a&gt; by the end of 2022. Some of that money has gone to Reels creators, but it’s not a dedicated system for videomakers to get paid — always a good way to encourage people to make things on your app.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Several Kingdom Hearts games are coming to Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rCRZyVU_HTDIuU5P5hl6VNkYGxE=/142x0:1299x771/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69954097/Screen_Shot_2018_06_05_at_2.36.30_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dx59nZ"&gt;The final new fighter coming to &lt;em&gt;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22690440/sora-kingdom-hearts-final-smash-ultimate-character-nintendo-switch"&gt;was revealed as Sora from &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But the event, hosted by game director Masahiro Sakurai, culminated in some arguably bigger news. The three mainline &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; games are coming to the Nintendo Switch. This includes &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 Remix, Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue, &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts III&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CMQ7H2"&gt;Notably, all three titles will be delivered via cloud streaming instead of native ports, so they won’t be stored locally on your Switch. Nintendo showed the games running on PlayStation 4 during the stream.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="s96Y2Y"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-q6Gz_4Yqc?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=3839&amp;amp;start=3839" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="W1mg2J"&gt;Prices and release dates for each of the games weren’t detailed during the stream, but Sakurai stated that the release date will be announced later. It’s hard to say how &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; will look and feel while streamed over the internet instead of played locally. Other games, like &lt;em&gt;Control&lt;/em&gt;, also have cloud versions on the Switch, and the experience wasn’t as bad as I feared. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MzUrVa"&gt;If this &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Hearts&lt;/em&gt; release gets similar treatment, Nintendo will likely offer a free trial period for the games to make sure that your internet connection can handle it.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Xbox web store integrates Xbox Cloud Gaming and wish lists</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Xbox logo (a white sphere with an X through it) against a dark green background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KXNGIOSclbKBRQEBeWlQ3jSrHWA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69954095/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2q3rFZ"&gt;Microsoft is starting to roll out a new Xbox web store that integrates Xbox Cloud Gaming (xCloud), wish lists, and more. The new Xbox web store includes buttons to add games to wish lists, quick access to redeem codes, and full Xbox Cloud Gaming integration. If you’re an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate member, you can simply click play on a supported game, and it will instantly stream from the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9KLNpl"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tamelucas/status/1445184671864741890"&gt;Twitter user tamelucas&lt;/a&gt; first spotted the new Xbox web store yesterday, and it only appears to be live in Canada. It’s very different from the usual Microsoft Store listing and has a design that’s similar to the rest of the Xbox UI. You can also use the web store to quickly install games to an Xbox console you own or buy the game as a gift for a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/M5PQ7tXUUE22t8OKKZb1pD4PMxQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902451/UFX1HGF.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microsoft’s new Xbox web store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="VBLbek"&gt;If you’re interested in trying the new Xbox web store, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-CA%2Fgames%2Fstore%2FHalo-Wars%3A-Definitive-Edition%2FBPRPQSKXTD1L%2F0001%2F9V55MMP1XDBZ&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22710708%2Fmicrosoft-xbox-web-store-xcloud-cloud-gaming-wishlists-features" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;check out this listing for &lt;em&gt;Halo Wars: Definitive Edition&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which also supports Xbox Cloud Gaming. Microsoft hasn’t officially announced this new Xbox web store, but given it’s already appearing in Canada, we’d expect to see it roll out generally to other regions very soon.&lt;/p&gt;
