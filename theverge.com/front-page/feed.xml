    <title>Nissan cuts starting price of its electric Leaf to under $30,000  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GF0ffFfU868nwWVjT1qlu7eFLeU=/0x0:640x427/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69676934/ezgif_2_7b8ff710f040.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The entry-level Nissan Leaf now starts at $27,400.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nissan&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nET6Ee"&gt;Nissan’s Leaf 2022 range &lt;a href="https://usa.nissannews.com/en-US/releases/release-25819c9aeb4792ebec3d4ddceb020a39-2022-nissan-leaf-goes-on-sale-with-additional-standard-features-and-new-starting-msrp-of-27400#"&gt;starts at just $27,400&lt;/a&gt;, making it the cheapest mass market electric car currently available in the US, &lt;a href="https://electrek.co/2021/08/03/nissan-slashes-2022-leaf-price-below-30k-now-the-cheapest-ev-available-in-the-us/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Electrek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. That starting price drops to as little as $19,900 if you include the full $7,500 federal tax credit, for which Nissan vehicles &lt;a href="https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/taxevb.shtml"&gt;are still eligible&lt;/a&gt;. These prices don’t include other charges like licensing and destination fees, or additional state-level incentives, but it’s a promising sign of how affordable electric vehicles are becoming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1k8F3"&gt;The exact price difference between Nissan’s 2021 and 2022 Leaf cars varies from model to model. The entry-level Leaf S, which has a 40kWh battery, has reduced by $4,270 from $31,670 to $27,400, undercutting the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/28/20936110/bmw-electric-mini-cooper-ev-range-price-release"&gt;electric Mini Cooper’s starting price of $29,990&lt;/a&gt; (the electric Mini is &lt;a href="https://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-10-most-affordable-electric-cars-on-the-market-11619206485"&gt;frequently&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://insideevs.com/car-lists/cheapest-evs-2021/"&gt;cited&lt;/a&gt; as the cheapest electric car currently available in the US). However Nissan’s biggest price drop can be found with the top-of-the-range 62kWh Leaf SL Plus, which has gone down in price by $6,570 from $43,970 to $37,400. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zncCdYFigBqA0UFN9oO5Sl-7amQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22760339/21LEAF7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Nissan&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Leaf is available with up to an estimated 226 miles of range. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6zPFhm"&gt;Despite the drop in price, the specs of the new Leaf cars are broadly unchanged from previous years. You should still get an estimated 149 miles of range from the 40kWh model, or between 215 and 226 miles from the 62kWh version. However, all 2022 models now include a CHAdeMO quick-charging port, plus a portable 240-volt charging cable, which should provide more flexibility when topping up the car’s battery.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Gzk6Ep"&gt;The Leaf is currently the only electric car Nissan sells in the US, but later this year &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/15/21324125/nissan-ariya-electric-suv-crossover-specs-price"&gt;it will release the Ariya&lt;/a&gt;, a new electric crossover SUV with up to 300 miles of range. Announced last year, the Ariya is due to go on sale in Japan in the middle of the year, with the US and Canada to follow and pricing starting at around $40,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tyeXeH"&gt;Nissan’s 2022 Leaf is on sale now, &lt;a href="https://usa.nissannews.com/en-US/releases/release-25819c9aeb4792ebec3d4ddceb020a39-2022-nissan-leaf-goes-on-sale-with-additional-standard-features-and-new-starting-msrp-of-27400#"&gt;Nissan says&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to (hopefully) restore your Gmail account if you lose access</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/FMdEUMbGsyjCZNYPbWsg-OBWrWM=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69676764/acastro_180424_1777_gmail_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="gtKJ5H"&gt;Losing access to your Google / Gmail account can be an incredibly frustrating and unhappy experience. When researching this article, I came across several accounts of people who had been locked out of their accounts after forgetting their passwords — and a few who had still not been able to get back in, even after several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svP0el"&gt;Google does provide a list of methods to try if you’ve been locked out of your account — either because you’ve forgotten your password or because somebody has hacked into your account and changed it. Sometimes, they work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3Kcktv"&gt;Your options beyond Google’s suggestions may be limited, so it’s best to be prepared ahead of time. Here are some suggestions to place you in the best possible position to get your stuff back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="T2wfAk"&gt;Back up your account regularly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="nVKAM2"&gt;If you should ever (knock on wood) lose access to your account, it will be less of a blow — and is less likely to get your blood pressure shooting up — if you have a recent backup of your data. Google provides a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21324801/gmail-download-data-back-up-save-email"&gt;means for you to download your data&lt;/a&gt; that it calls &lt;a href="https://takeout.google.com/"&gt;Takeout&lt;/a&gt;. You can download all of the data from all of your Google apps, or from some of them, or just from a single app such as Gmail. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BbRPIo"&gt;The formats of the downloads vary depending on the type of data. Your email will be downloaded in the MBOX format, which can be then uploaded into another Gmail account or into most other email services or apps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mWcn5L"&gt;Keep a record of your old password&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="jHAdHa"&gt;One of the ways Google verifies your identity if you lose your password is to ask you to type in your previous password. If it’s been a while since you changed your password (assuming you’ve ever actually changed it), it may be hard (or impossible) to remember that former password. So when you change your Google password — and it’s not a bad idea to change it regularly — keep a record of your old password somewhere safe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ii4UKx"&gt;A good strategy here is to use your &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"&gt;password manager&lt;/a&gt; — you use one, right? — to keep track of old passwords. Most password managers will offer to update the existing entry for an app when you create a new password; if possible, you can opt instead to create a new entry and then go back and edit the old one to say something like “Gmail - old password.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="lwPhOB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The best free password manager","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22311182/best-free-password-manager-bitwarden-zoho-vault-roboform-sticky-password"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="64eb6L"&gt;If you’re not using a password manager (and if you’ve lost your password, there’s a good chance you’re not), then perhaps you can keep a list of old passwords in an encrypted file. Just in case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uspMs0"&gt;Check to see what recovery info is available&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="VsoOfK"&gt;It’s a good idea to provide Google ahead of time with as much recovery info as you feel comfortable with so that if you ever need to verify your identity, you have some choices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s a good idea to include several ways to verify your account." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QwZHcV3G1qT-Yr29qWcRrDI_ip8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758474/Screen_Shot_2021_08_02_at_1.32.40_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a good idea to include several ways to verify your account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="uy3Pfl"&gt;Go to your &lt;a href="https://myaccount.google.com/"&gt;Google account page&lt;/a&gt; and then click on “Security” in the left-hand column.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CBXRs3"&gt;Scroll down to “Ways we can verify it’s you.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="E5lRzg"&gt;You’ll see whether you’ve registered a recovery phone number or a recovery email. (Note: if you entered an answer to a security question sometime in the past, you’ll see that in the listing as well; however, if you click on it, you’ll get a notice telling you that Google no longer supports security questions.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fSpqaJ"&gt;If you don’t have any of these filled in, it may be a good idea to fill in at least one. If you want to be really careful, go ahead and enter your info. Here’s how.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id="X22Zz0"&gt;Set up a recovery email account&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nCwCyn"&gt;Your recovery email account can be another Gmail account, another email account from a different service, or even a relative’s or friend’s account. (Make sure that relative or friend is security-savvy.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Jhhcq1"&gt;Go to the “Ways we can verify it’s you” section (see above) and click on “Recovery email.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="tyh4xV"&gt;Type in your chosen recovery email address and click on “Verify.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="NT7aEC"&gt;Google will send a six-digit verification code to the email address you entered. Go to your email, copy the code, and go back to the recovery page to enter the code. (You have 24 hours before you have to get another code.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="jtw2uv"&gt;You should get a small pop-up indicating that your recovery email has been verified.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can include a verified recovery email to help in the recovery of your account." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ITT8LLecGGmffJYwszYTSFWMdgY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758605/Screen_Shot_2021_08_02_at_10.44.56_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can include a verified recovery email to help in the recovery of your account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gIzqgg"&gt;Set up a recovery phone number:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="8T9xMw"&gt;Go to the “Ways we can verify it’s you” section (see above) and click on “Recovery email.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="alQHGG"&gt;Click on “Add Recovery Phone” and enter the phone number in the pop-up box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="eLBfQE"&gt;Google will text you a verification code at that phone number. Enter it in the pop-up box.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You can also add a recovery phone number; Google will call or text you with a code." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GA-X00bjfVVoj730rFTEZsRpk5Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758604/Screen_Shot_2021_08_02_at_1.47.06_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You can also add a recovery phone number; Google will call or text you with a code.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="kyBxDl"&gt;Remember when you started the account&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WuxyIv"&gt;If all else fails, Google may ask you approximately when you created the account. Personally, I have no idea when I started most of my Gmail accounts; if you want to check out when you started yours, probably the easiest way is to find your earliest Gmails (now, when you have access to your account) and keep that info somewhere safe. (This, of course, assumes that you haven’t been efficient enough to delete all your old emails; in that case, this won’t help.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="88VOnl"&gt;In your Gmail account, go to the left-hand menu, find “All Mail,” and click on it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="PHd2Ek"&gt;Look in the upper-right corner for the number of emails that you have. (It will say something like “1-50 of 2,000.”) Click on that and select “Oldest.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="mctaa4"&gt;Your email will now sort in the order of oldest first; if you (like me) haven’t been very good about deleting email, this should give you some idea of when you started the account.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Finding your oldest emails may help you remember when you started your account." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UTU7c49LcjSANonAL3lqSRoJA6g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758621/Screen_Shot_2021_08_02_at_3.10.43_PM__1_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Finding your oldest emails may help you remember when you started your account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Qn147Q"&gt;Google does &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7299973?hl=en"&gt;offer some other pieces of advice&lt;/a&gt; for those who are having trouble restoring their websites, including sending all of the info you can using your usual computer in the same location that you usually compute in and using your usual browser. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uLTlJo"&gt;Recover your password&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="W6iBqo"&gt;So what if you actually do lose your password or can’t get into your account for another reason? Well, you go to &lt;a href="https://accounts.google.com/signin/recovery"&gt;Google’s recovery page&lt;/a&gt; and start answering those questions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wLmfWA"&gt;Unfortunately, when I tried it on a test account, I realized that my options were limited indeed. I was first asked for the last password I had used, then for a verification code from my alternate email, a verification code from my phone, and the answer to my security question (despite Google’s assertion that it no longer used security questions). When I claimed I didn’t have any of these available, the last screen simply urged me to try again. I went through the whole rigmarole again — and was again urged to “Try again.” There was no alternative offered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9fuFmK"&gt;You can also try going to the “&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/troubleshooter/2402620"&gt;Can’t sign into your Google Account&lt;/a&gt;” page and selecting one or more of the choices offered to see if there are any other options offered.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Following along with one of these issues may help you recover your account." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5_TuKrDLVTbbbbc57CaEeoPPeno=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22758641/Screen_Shot_2021_08_03_at_12.34.41_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Following along with one of these issues may help you recover your account.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HL3P7j"&gt;But be aware that, even if you can enter the information that Google’s bots ask for, it may not be enough. Back in 2017, tech journalist Ron Miller got locked out of his Google account; in an article, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/22/that-time-i-got-locked-out-of-my-google-account-for-a-month/"&gt;he described his considerable travails&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hlw5q4"&gt;So what can you do? If you really want to keep your emails — and other Google data — available, make sure you have as many ways to restore your account as possible, and don’t forget to back it all up, just in case. Otherwise, after trying everything you can, you may have to do what Google suggests at the bottom of its “&lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7299973?hl=en"&gt;Tips to complete account recovery steps&lt;/a&gt;” page — and &lt;a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/7564124"&gt;create a new account&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s $499 PS5 is no longer selling at a loss</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jQ1w656qe2X2kSpYOc7v3HCQBF4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69676746/vpavic_4278_20201030_0292.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="S9psgb"&gt;Sony’s $499 PlayStation 5 console is no longer selling at a loss. &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-04/sony-raises-profit-outlook-as-gaming-demand-stays-resilient?srnd=technology-vp"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;reports&lt;/a&gt; that Sony chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki shared the news just a week after the company announced it had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597784/sony-ps5-playstation-5-sales"&gt;sold 10 million PS5 consoles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8gx8Lr"&gt;While the PS5 with a disc drive is no longer selling for less than the cost to produce it, the less expensive and disc-less $399 PS5 Digital Edition is reportedly on track to have Sony’s related losses offset by other hardware sales like accessories and the PS4. Sony sold 500,000 PS4 consoles in the most recent quarter, bringing lifetime sales up to an impressive 116.4 million.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-x2BYuo6kBe3O6TBnZMK8Kiz2AE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22760402/Sony_PlayStation_3_2001A_wController_L.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The PS5 won’t be as costly as Sony’s PS3 launch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1zWJew"&gt;It took Sony years to stop losing money on PS3 sales, but the company stopped selling the PS4 at a loss &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/5/23/5744344/ps4-already-profitable-for-sony-ceo-says"&gt;around six months&lt;/a&gt; after its debut in 2013. The PS5 has taken ever so slightly longer, but it’s clearly not repeating the costly exercise of the PS3 despite &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-14/sony-is-struggling-with-playstation-5-price-due-to-costly-parts"&gt;early reports suggesting&lt;/a&gt; Sony was struggling with PS5 pricing due to expensive parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6NL2zj"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422691/microsoft-xbox-consoles-profit-software-services-revenue-apple-epic-games-trial"&gt;revealed earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; that it sells its Xbox consoles at a loss and doesn’t turn a profit on pure hardware alone. Microsoft has not been reporting hardware sales since early on in the Xbox One lifetime, but an Xbox executive revealed during the &lt;em&gt;Epic v. Apple&lt;/em&gt; trial that Microsoft turns a profit from game sales and online service subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EH97EJ"&gt;Sony also reported (&lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/21q1_sony.pdf"&gt;PDF&lt;/a&gt;) its biggest Q1 revenue ever for PlayStation today, and its second biggest revenue for PlayStation during a non-holiday quarter. There are also 104 million monthly active users on PlayStation Network, spending an average of $37.09 each during Q1 2021 across digital software, add-ons, and services.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5vFppd"&gt;Facebook has banned the personal accounts of academics who researched ad transparency and the spread of misinformation on the social network. &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/research-cannot-be-the-justification-for-compromising-peoples-privacy/"&gt;Facebook says&lt;/a&gt; the group violated its term of service by scraping user data without permission. But the academics say they are being silenced for exposing problems on Facebook’s platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aHuBqD"&gt;The researchers were part of &lt;a href="https://adobservatory.org/"&gt;NYU Ad Observatory&lt;/a&gt;, a project created to examine the origin and spread of political ads on Facebook. As the group explained in a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/cybersecurity-for-democracy/the-political-ads-facebook-wont-show-you-e0d6181bca25"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; in May, their aim is to uncover who pays for political ads and how they are being targeted. Such work has important implications for understanding the spread of disinformation on Facebook, as the company does not fact-check political ads.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q6vrkY"&gt;To help their work, the researchers created a browser plug-in called &lt;a href="https://adobserver.org/"&gt;Ad Observer&lt;/a&gt;, which automatically collects data on what political ads users are being shown and why those ads are being targeted to them. As per its &lt;a href="https://adobserver.org/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, the plug-in does not collect any personally-identifying information, including users’ name, Facebook ID number, or friend list. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="0A0443"&gt;&lt;q&gt;NYU’s research offered new insights into Facebook’s problems&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JIGFbo"&gt;Data collected by Ad Observer is then made publicly available to researchers and journalists who use the information to reveal trends and problems on Facebook’s platform. Stories directly resulting from this work include Facebook’s &lt;a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-biden-election-ads"&gt;failure to disclose who pays for some political ads&lt;/a&gt;, and how &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/4/22313013/far-right-news-misinformation-facebook-us-2020-election-nyu-study-engagement"&gt;far-right misinformation is more engaging than misinformation from center or left sources.&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XkH3Ln"&gt;Facebook offers &lt;em&gt;some&lt;/em&gt; of this information voluntarily through its &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library"&gt;Ad Library&lt;/a&gt;, but not all. For example, it doesn’t share data about how ads are targeted based on users’ interests. People can find this for themselves by clicking on ads they’re shown, and it’s this data that was collected by the NYU. (Facebook does provide information on ad targeting through a &lt;a href="https://fort.fb.com/researcher-datasets"&gt;special research program called FORT&lt;/a&gt;, but this is controlled and filtered by Facebook itself.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EKKL1o"&gt;Laura Edelson, an NYU researcher involved in the project, and whose personal account was banned by Facebook, says the company wants to end independent scrutiny of its platform. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="3kJnHF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;By suspending our accounts, Facebook has effectively ended all this work. Facebook has also effectively cut off access to more than two dozen other researchers and journalists who get access to Facebook data through our project, 3/4&lt;/p&gt;— Laura Edelson (@LauraEdelson2) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LauraEdelson2/status/1422736708433481730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5GitcL"&gt;“Facebook is silencing us because our work often calls attention to problems on its platform,” Edelson &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-03/facebook-disables-accounts-tied-to-nyu-research-project?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;told &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg News&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in an emailed statement. “Worst of all, Facebook is using user privacy, a core belief that we have always put first in our work, as a pretext for doing this. If this episode demonstrates anything it is that Facebook should not have veto power over who is allowed to study them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fKhz22"&gt;Facebook says it banned the researchers because they violated the social network’s terms of service, and that the Ad Observer plug-in “collected data about Facebook users who did not install or consent to the collection.” Facebook’s wording suggests the researchers were collecting data about private individuals without consent but, &lt;a href="https://www.protocol.com/nyu-facebook-researchers-scraping"&gt;as reported by &lt;em&gt;Protocol&lt;/em&gt; in March&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook is actually referring to “advertisers’ accounts, including the names and profile pictures of public Pages that run political ads and the contents of those ads.” (&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asked Facebook to confirm this but the company declined to comment.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ccKC9X"&gt;Facebook certainly has good reason to be wary of third-parties collecting data from its site. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/10/17165130/facebook-cambridge-analytica-scandal"&gt;Cambridge Analytica scandal&lt;/a&gt; was only made possible because the company did not exercise proper oversight over how information could be scraped from its platform. It resulted in a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/24/20707013/ftc-facebook-settlement-data-cambridge-analytica-penalty-privacy-punishment-5-billion"&gt;$5 billion fine for the company&lt;/a&gt; and new privacy checks by the FTC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gOWLL6"&gt;Facebook now says it’s required to ban the NYC researchers under these FTC guidelines, as well as disabling their associated Pages and platform access. However, some privacy experts disagree with this. Jonathan Mayer, a professor at Princeton University who researches technology and law, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jonathanmayer/status/1422733522016641028"&gt;said on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; that “Facebook’s legal argument is bogus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3a8WQd"&gt;Facebook says it repeatedly offered to work with the NYU researchers by providing the data they need directly, and first warned the group they &lt;a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/10/24/tech/facebook-nyu-political-ad-data/index.html"&gt;might be banned from the site last year&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The PS5 worked fine with the slowest compatible SSD we could find</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5YwHqYsnb0TPi6LXwXx2bvXuK8o=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69676444/vpavic_4278_20201030_0206.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eGpAhB"&gt;If your PS5 is already running out of speedy solid state storage, there’s a fix on the way. Sony’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/29/22599593/sony-ps5-m2-ssd-support-beta-features"&gt;new beta update for the PS5&lt;/a&gt; allows you to expand your paltry 667GB of usable space by popping in the same sort of M.2 SSD stick you might slip into your laptop or desktop PC. My colleague Mitchell has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22366087"&gt;a PS5 SSD buying guide right here&lt;/a&gt; that meets all of Sony’s recommendations, such as speeds of at least 5,500MB/s. That might leave you wondering, though: what about slower SSDs? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AJUnow"&gt;That’s why we tracked down an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/XPG-S50-Lite-Internal-AGAMMIXS50L-1T-C/dp/B08HVZWGPP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;ADATA XPG Gammix S50 Lite&lt;/a&gt;, one of the slowest compatible PCIe Gen4 drives we could find at 3,900MB/s reads and 3,200MB/s writes, and stuck it into a PS5, along with another drive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The PS5 reads 3898.001 megabytes per second in its speed test" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4_5tGJnWAryRays4zRc7ziYw5go=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759876/IMG_1307.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image by Sean Hollister / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;Yep, that’s a 3900MB/s drive all right.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="v7uWpg"&gt;We compared the S50 Lite against both the PS5’s internal SSD and a 5,000MB/s Sabrent Rocket 500GB in a battery of tests, including load times for games like early PS5 showcases &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man: Miles Morales.&lt;/em&gt; We also measured how long it takes to back up games to each kind of drive, throwing in a Seagate external HDD for comparison, since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381494/sony-ps5-april-update-games-external-usb-storage-social-features"&gt;Sony now allows you to archive PS5 games and play PS4 games&lt;/a&gt; from an traditional hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dE5QEx"&gt;The verdict? Surprisingly, even the slowest compatible SSD we could find had near-identical load times to the one Sony includes in the box. Sometimes it’s a second slower, sometimes a second or two faster, but basically it’s a total wash. Hopping through dimensions in &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart&lt;/em&gt;, I saw no appreciable difference with the slowest SSD. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="qHZe23"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="table:10684101"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Zea66Q"&gt;I also didn’t necessarily see a huge difference between the drives when it comes to transferring games back and forth, but there was one big surprise: at least in this beta, it appears that Sony may be throttling the write speed of the PS5’s own internal drive. It took only 2:26 to send &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/25/22274549/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-ps5-update-graphics-expansion"&gt;both PS5 and PS4 copies&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; to the Sabrent SSD, for instance, but 12:47 to go back to the PS5 — over five times longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="59Q8qI"&gt;On average, I saw write speeds of around 1,100MB/s transferring my five test games to either of my add-in M.2 drives, but just around 220MB/s sending those same games back to the PS5. Both of those are far better than the 141MB/s average transfer speeds I saw sending games to the Seagate HDD and the 97MB/s I saw beaming them back — it took over half an hour (31:24) to transfer the &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy&lt;/em&gt; games’ 176.5GB back to the internal SSD. But the slower internal SSD write speeds are weird, and Sony didn’t have a comment when I asked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GSk2nn"&gt;For now, the bigger question is this: will game developers fully optimize their games for the incredible speeds an SSD can afford? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D718aM"&gt;For instance, take a look at our load times for &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; in the chart above. Regardless of drive, the PS4 version takes over four times longer to load! It’s the difference between waiting through a loading screen filled with gameplay tips to keep you occupied, and — at 10 seconds flat from the time you leave the PS5’s home screen to the time you can move Cloud Strife in your save game — barely seeing a loading screen at all. The latter is incredible to behold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="YlIBe4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4WZ3pTe61O4?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kOH5dC"&gt;Also, see those &lt;em&gt;Spider-Man:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Miles Morales &lt;/em&gt;numbers? The game doesn’t &lt;em&gt;always&lt;/em&gt; load as quickly as it could. Sometimes, you’ll boot up the game to see Marvel, Insomniac, and PlayStation Studios intros that eat up a whole 26 seconds, making the game take more like 43 seconds to load in total. But other times, it’ll mysteriously bypass those, loading in more like 17 seconds, and I couldn’t figure out why. I’d love to have a toggle to turn off those intros, and here’s hoping more PS5 games skip them as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4F4sa4"&gt;Would I run out and buy the slowest PCIe Gen4 SSD I can buy for my PS5? I’m not so sure, because Sony picked its recommended SSD spec for a reason — even if today’s games and today’s PS5 aren’t taking full advantage, developers may need that additional headroom in the future. They’ve been promised 5,500MB/s to deliver instant game worlds, and I’d hate to find out I bought the wrong drive years down the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K5sHxD"&gt;Plus, there might already be some moments in &lt;em&gt;Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart &lt;/em&gt;where you’ll notice a difference, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fitzymj/status/1420825603784122371"&gt;says Insomniac technical director Mike Fitzgerald&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="lXpgVe"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We tried some below-spec Gen4 M.2 drives as well and saw up to 15% slower loading in the most SSD-stressing areas of the game. Not too shabby, but keep a close eye on technical specs if you’re making an SSD purchase, as our game does rely on high-quality storage.  &lt;/p&gt;— Mike Fitzgerald (@fitzymj) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fitzymj/status/1420825603784122371?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 29, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Jj3Wyt"&gt;Then again, Microsoft also uses an SSD in its Xbox Series X, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21185141/ps5-playstation-5-xbox-series-x-comparison-specs-features-release-date"&gt;but one with sustained raw performance at 2.4GB/s&lt;/a&gt;, compared to the PS5’s listed 5.5GB/s read speeds. So even if developers do take advantage, it’s possible many next-gen games never see the full benefit if they’re targeting both Xbox and PlayStation instead of PS5 specifically. You’ll likely see the most benefit from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432601/sony-playstation-studios-ps5-games-25-new-ip-interview"&gt;Sony’s exclusive PlayStation Studios titles,&lt;/a&gt; though Square Enix’s speedy &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&lt;/em&gt; load times gives me hope for more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Pm1LS1"&gt;Either way, for a list of SSDs that actually meet Sony’s requirements and recommendations, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22602046/best-ps5-m2-ssd-options-buying-guide-which-drives-compatible-playstation-5"&gt;here’s our buying guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UmGd7q"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, August 4th 7:25AM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Article updated to note Xbox Series X sustained SSD performance data.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft pauses free Windows 365 cloud PC trials after ‘significant demand’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6amEz0ns5GNDRsmZtNhPCCX1AOY=/0x200:4800x3400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69676386/windows365ui.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ux8WbJ"&gt;Microsoft launched its new cloud PC Windows 365 service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605800/microsoft-windows-365-cloud-pc-streaming-html5"&gt;earlier this week&lt;/a&gt;, and the company has already had to pause free trials due to demand. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22575064/microsoft-windows-365-cloud-pc-launch-date-price-features"&gt;Windows 365 lets you rent a cloud PC&lt;/a&gt; — with a variety of CPU, RAM, and storage options — and then stream Windows 10 or Windows 11 via a web browser. The service reached max capacity after only a day of signups.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o5UwrX"&gt;“Following significant demand, we have reached capacity for Windows 365 trials,” reads a statement from the Microsoft 365 Twitter account. “We have seen unbelievable response to Windows 365 and need to pause our free trial program while we provision additional capacity,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RDS4U/status/1422616706485080065"&gt;explains Scott Manchester&lt;/a&gt;, director of Windows 365 program management.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D98Md45TfMYubBLAPoFCerUGy-Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22716693/windows365web.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Windows 365 running in a browser.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="e0xp0a"&gt;Windows 365 is only available to businesses right now, and there’s clearly been more demand than Microsoft had anticipated if the company has hit capacity issues after just a day of free trials. Microsoft launched the service on Monday, with per-user pricing that starts at $20 per month for one vCPU, 2GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, and 12GB of bandwidth if you already have a Windows 10 license.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UxfiUk"&gt;There are a variety of configurations for Windows 365, including one at the top end that includes eight vCPUs, 32GB of RAM, and 512GB of storage for $158 per month. All of the different price options are available at &lt;a href="http://windows365.com/"&gt;Windows365.com&lt;/a&gt;, but you’ll now need to &lt;a href="https://info.microsoft.com/ww-landing-signup-for-updates-windows-from-the-cloud.html?LCID=EN-US"&gt;register interest&lt;/a&gt; in a free trial as Microsoft has hit capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Oppo announces ‘next-generation’ under-display selfie camera</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BVtbzeVdgX-gEZ2Tc2W38f8KvLQ=/0x0:2700x1800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69675770/OPPO_USC_2021_Prototype___3.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Oppo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IQYZtA"&gt;Oppo has announced the latest iteration of its under-screen camera technology, claiming it allows for a selfie camera to be placed under the display “without compromising the integrity of the screen.” Unlike earlier approaches that reduce pixel density in the portion of the screen that covers the camera in order to let more light pass through, Oppo is using smaller pixels to maintain the same 400-ppi sharpness as the rest of the OLED panel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cvQ0np"&gt;The result, according to Oppo, is that users should notice “almost no visual difference between the [under-screen camera] area and the rest of the screen during everyday use, creating a much more immersive visual experience.” The company has shown off an image of a prototype phone running an e-reader app, which would be pretty much the worst-case scenario for earlier under-display cameras due to the white background and sharp text. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K3TP02N5rcWGkY2IS1v7OHz6xBw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22760057/OPPO_USC_E_book_Reading.JPG"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EEx8tP"&gt;As for the quality of the camera itself, here’s a sample image provided by Oppo:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KQ05q6C4pZWPQry7cZnrc1p2Hng=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22760056/OPPO_USC_Selfie_Sample_1.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UQ8tbD"&gt;It’s only one sample in good light, and there do seem to be some color artifacts in certain portions of the image. It does, however, look considerably better than what you’d get from the first under-display camera to hit the market, which was on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;ZTE’s Axon 20 5G&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9sx6BV"&gt;That said, ZTE has one up on Oppo by actually shipping a phone already, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22597594/zte-axon-30-refresh-specs-availability-under-display-phone-camera"&gt;its latest Axon 30&lt;/a&gt; is meant to have improved the tech as well. ZTE is claiming the same 400-ppi density in the camera portion of the screen, plus better camera quality than the Axon 20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="awZY8O"&gt;Oppo has been working on under-display cameras for a long time, showing off the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/26/18759380/under-display-selfie-camera-first-oppo-announcement"&gt;world’s first demo at MWC Shanghai in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, but at some point it’s going to have to put one in an actual commercial device. For now, it’s hard to say too much about the tech improvements without even seeing a prototype for ourselves in person. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Street Fighter’s Guile and Cammy are coming to Fortnite</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lacPkHsJF85JdzkkDTaYJZTfbLo=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69675236/E75lsESXoAcTOFj.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Street Fighter’s&lt;em&gt; Cammy and Guile in Fortnite.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Epic Games&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ldG1lO"&gt;Epic Games is adding two more &lt;em&gt;Street Fighter&lt;/em&gt; icons to &lt;em&gt;Fortnite. &lt;/em&gt;Playable Chun-Li and Ryu skins were &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/19/22291805/chun-li-ryu-fortnite-street-fighter-mortal-kombat"&gt;added to the game in February&lt;/a&gt;, but soon, &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/round-2-street-fighter-s-cammy-and-guile-soldier-on-in-fortnite"&gt;Guile and Cammy skins&lt;/a&gt; will make their debut in the game’s item shop. You’ll be able to buy them starting August 7th at 8PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWYMuv"&gt;I think both skins look great — I’m personally a huge fan of Guile’s ridiculous-looking flat top hair. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Gs0shb"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Round 2. FIGHT  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Announcing two new challengers! Guile and Cammy from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/StreetFighter?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@StreetFighter&lt;/a&gt; are making their way to the Island.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Read about their upcoming Cosmetic Sets and about the Cammy Cup where you can win her Outfit early.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; : &lt;a href="https://t.co/ASHildQt70"&gt;https://t.co/ASHildQt70&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Uc1nizbn9V"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Uc1nizbn9V&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Fortnite (@FortniteGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1422686370770952199?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 3, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xcyT31"&gt;Each skin will have two different variants, which you can see below:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-9MibduAkhCF3h8mdQE-eP3PzdM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759746/17br_cammy_guile_newsimage_guile_1920x1080_d57b7a2c86f7.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Guile’s cosmetics in &lt;/em&gt;Fortnite&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qhV8d5IZ3nuVU_FLOg6iL08P8-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759747/17br_cammy_guile_newsimage_cammy_1920x1080_bf9e74b28a4d.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Epic Games&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;And here are Cammy’s cosmetics.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SaotJ9"&gt;And if you want a chance of getting to play as Cammy early, you can compete in the Cammy Cup on August 5th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wyFw0Z"&gt;The skins arrive at a busy time for &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; — Tuesday evening, Epic added a skin based on the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1422708867079737354"&gt;DC Comics character Bloodsport&lt;/a&gt; ahead of the release of &lt;em&gt;The Suicide Squad&lt;/em&gt;. And in-game, there’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595880/fortnite-alien-event-date-chapter-2-season-7"&gt;countdown clock&lt;/a&gt; for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/1/22602826/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-concert-epic-games"&gt;Ariana Grande’s upcoming concert series&lt;/a&gt;, which kicks off on August 6th at 6PM ET.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EJubgY"&gt;Tuesday morning, dataminers found audio in the game for an unreleased emote featuring rapper DaBaby, who has come under scrutiny for making homophobic comments last week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22607978/fortnite-dababy-emote-migos-am-to-pm-audio-epic-games-update"&gt;but Epic declined to comment to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; when asked about the audio. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple launches big redesign of its online store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/20J14Q9P0R479D-KsWROhlWP1jQ=/0x81:2900x2014/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69675186/Screen_Shot_2021_08_03_at_4.50.24_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple’s new Apple Store layout.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="d9NObp"&gt;The Apple Store was mysteriously down on Tuesday &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/IsTheStoreDown/status/1422705926197415943"&gt;for just about an hour&lt;/a&gt;, but it has emerged from the downtime &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fstore&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F3%2F22608636%2Fapple-online-store-redesign-2021-launch-cards" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;with a brand new look&lt;/a&gt; and a dedicated tab on Apple’s top-level navigation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nsn2cz"&gt;At the top of the store, there are images and links to many of Apple’s product lines (Mac, iPhone, AirPods, etc.). Some of those links take you to new dedicated Store pages for the products, which show you what models are available and point to resources like shopping guides, accessories, and support. On the main Store page, there are also sections for what’s new, links to support pages, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tt3NiO9CY8QHomP3rx52Am__YA0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759778/Screen_Shot_2021_08_03_at_5.02.21_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The iPad category in the new Apple Store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sZ0X8K"&gt;The new design is filled with cards — it’s somewhat reminiscent of Apple’s Store app for iOS. It feels mobile-first, with smooth horizontal scrolling between cards on phone, something that doesn’t translate as well to desktop. There, the site surfaces arrows you may need to tap on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2f8KGKLy7b04ew2kx6YK8tVuxRU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22759820/RPReplay_Final1628036839_Animated_Image__Large_.gif"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new online store on my colleague’s iPhone 12 Mini.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hDOSt3"&gt;As far as we can tell, there aren’t any new products — this update appears to be strictly a fresh coat of paint for Apple’s online store. And the pages for actually buying a product don’t appear to be different than they were before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CGoWOf"&gt;The change to the store arrives ahead of what’s expected to be a busy fall for Apple — the company has been rumored to be working on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22576703/iphone-13-rumors-sizes-notch-camera-processor"&gt;iPhone 13&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586507/apple-airpods-2021-refresh-rumor-iphone-se-2022-5g-15-details"&gt;new AirPods&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/18/22441805/apple-macbook-pro-2021-redesign-chip-magsafe-sd-card-slot-hdmi-port"&gt;new MacBook Pros&lt;/a&gt; that all could launch soon. Whatever products Apple ends up announcing, now there’s a new store that can showcase them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>T-Mobile confirms it will shut down Sprint’s LTE network next year</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="t-mobile and sprint logos" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/s3IN2gvmTmq1MfpeKh-YCszm0W4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69675116/acasatro_180430_1777_sprint_Tmobile_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;T-Mobile has wasted no time consolidating Sprint’s network and spectrum with its own.&lt;/em&gt; | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nZkG92"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.lightreading.com/5g/t-mobile-to-shutter-sprints-lte-network-on-june-30-2022/d/d-id/771269"&gt;reported by &lt;em&gt;Light Reading&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and confirmed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge,&lt;/em&gt; T-Mobile has committed to a June 30, 2022 shutdown date for Sprint’s LTE network. It’s an expected move as T-Mobile continues to absorb Sprint’s network and customers into its own base, and comes six months after its contentious planned January 1, 2022 shutdown of Sprint’s 3G CDMA network. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mckReg"&gt;A third of Sprint customers have already been moved onto the T-Mobile network, &lt;a href="https://investor.t-mobile.com/news-and-events/t-mobile-us-press-releases/press-release-details/2021/T-Mobile-Raises-2021-Guidance-Across-the-Board-Again-and-Delivers-Record-Financial-Results-in-Q2/default.aspx"&gt;according to T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;. The company expects to be able to migrate the remaining two thirds by that mid-2022 deadline, &lt;a href="https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/t-mobile-running-fast-to-achieve-benefits-merger"&gt;according to CFO Peter Osvaldik’s remarks&lt;/a&gt; at an investor conference last month. Some of those customers will likely need new devices that are compatible with T-Mobile LTE and VoLTE, though the company has had no shortage of enticing &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcell-phone%2Ft-mobile-revvl-v-plus-5g%3Ficid%3DMGPO_TMO_P_21REVVLOUS_1U0R1MHTP3PF5UOM25482&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F3%2F22608265%2Ft-mobile-sprint-lte-network-shutdown-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;5G phone offers lately&lt;/a&gt;. T-Mobile &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fcoverage%2Ft-mobile-network-evolution&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F3%2F22608265%2Ft-mobile-sprint-lte-network-shutdown-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;says it will reach out to all customers&lt;/a&gt; who will need a new SIM card or device to stay connected, but if you’re curious whether your device is compatible you can run an &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fsupport%2Fcoverage%2Ft-mobile-network%23tech&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F3%2F22608265%2Ft-mobile-sprint-lte-network-shutdown-2022" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;IMEI check on T-Mobile’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ujfewh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;T-Mobile hasn’t been shy about moving quickly to consolidate Sprint’s network assets with its own&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7Vud9n"&gt;The Sprint LTE network shutdown doesn’t come as a shock — by Sprint’s own admission the network &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/28/17914230/sprint-lte-network-coverage-bad-tmobile-merger"&gt;wasn’t very good to begin with&lt;/a&gt;, and T-Mobile hasn’t been shy about moving quickly to consolidate Sprint’s network assets with its own. The company’s 3G shutdown timeline &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364126/boost-mobile-3g-cdma-t-mobile-shutdown-customers-costs"&gt;has been the source of a lot of bad blood&lt;/a&gt; between T-Mobile and Dish Network, which acquired Sprint’s former prepaid business Boost Mobile as part of the merger deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="2AlnAM"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"The Dish ‘fix’ for the T-Mobile-Sprint merger seems more shortsighted than ever","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22585761/dish-t-mobile-att-sprint-competition-editorial"},{"title":"Predictably, T-Mobile’s merger promises weren’t enough to make a carrier out of Dish","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22587790/t-mobile-sprint-acquisition-dish-promises"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="MckEQj"&gt;The relationship has soured to the point of Dish announcing that it would &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583799/dish-network-att-mvno-t-mobile-5g-4g"&gt;take the majority of its MVNO business to AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt; — which T-Mobile followed with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598163/t-mobile-metro-5g-prepaid-boost-cricket-switch-promotion"&gt;a promotional offer directed at Boost customers&lt;/a&gt;. Boost had no additional comments to share about the potential impacts of the LTE shutdown on its customers when contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
