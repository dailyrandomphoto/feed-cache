    <title>Razer’s Tomahawk modular gaming PC is finally a real product</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6HrTF6T1sMERi18IF0niEFx_Q-I=/0x0:1500x1000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68453427/https___hybrismediaprod.blob.core.windows.net_sys_master_phoenix_images_container_hc7_h73_9122164572190_Tomahawk_Gaming_Desktop_1500x1000_20201204_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8cUWP1"&gt;Razer has been talking up modular gaming PCs with streamlined swappable parts for years. Now, after various &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/7/5285130/razer-reveals-project-christine-the-concept-gaming-pc-even-a-toddler"&gt;concepts&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21054602/razer-tomahawk-desktop-gaming-pc-intel-nuc-element-design-specs-ces-2020"&gt;CES reveals&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/10/21510415/razer-tomahawk-pc-case-atx-matx-itx-mini-sff-third-attempt"&gt;standard PC cases with associated branding&lt;/a&gt;, the company is actually selling a pre-built desktop PC for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="m5rgQo"&gt;The Tomahawk is the final version of what we saw at CES 2020 back in January. It’s a simple case design with two PCIe slots: one for a full-sized GPU, and one for an Intel NUC Element board that contains the CPU, the RAM, the storage, and basically everything else you need for a functional PC. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kEyZSB"&gt;The NUC module includes a 45W Core i9-9980HK Coffee Lake processor, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, a 512GB NVMe SSD, and a 2TB hard drive. The memory and storage are upgradable, but the CPU is not — unless Intel releases another compatible NUC board that you can swap directly into the Tomahawk. That Coffee Lake CPU is the kind of part you might find in a high-end gaming laptop, so while it’s fast today it may well be something you’d want to upgrade down the line.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nW7_wYmVrCvyRQdmFdEf6D4IOdM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22143486/Screen_Shot_2020_12_04_at_14.46.22.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Bmn0YV"&gt;The Tomahawk does have space for a full-size GPU up to 320 x 140mm and there’s an option to order it with an Nvidia GTX 3080 Founders Edition pre-installed. The metal chassis is 10L in capacity, comes with a 750W PSU, and uses active cooling. There are 4 USB-A 3.2 ports and 2 Thunderbolt 3 ports, as well as onboard Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.0 Razer says the small size is designed for bringing to tournaments and LAN parties or just freeing up desk space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjtexr"&gt;You’ll have to really value those attributes for the Tomahawk to be worth it, because unsurprisingly it does not come cheap. Razer has priced it at $2,400 for the base model without a discrete GPU or $3,200 with a GTX 3080; &lt;a href="http://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-desktops-and-cases%2Frazer-tomahawk-gaming-desktop%2FRZ42-03650200-R3U1&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;preorders&lt;/a&gt; have opened in the US, but it’s currently listed as out of stock. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer’s new true wireless earbuds have noise cancellation and low latency for mobile games</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UXvJclVsKwVtjkgO93nVITCMEPw=/0x46:2040x1406/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68452999/razer1.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tJf9SL"&gt;Razer released its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/29/20937068/razer-truly-wireless-headphones-hammerhead-bluetooth-5-earbuds-android-gaming-mode-price"&gt;first set of true wireless earbuds&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, with the main appeal being a low-latency mode that made them better suited for mobile gaming. Now, the company is ready with its second pair, the Hammerhead True Wireless Pro, which go on sale today for $199.99 and add active noise cancellation and THX audio certification to the mix. “The Hammerhead True Wireless Pro uses hybrid ANC to nullify both external and unwanted internal noise by generating inverse sound waves simultaneously,” Razer wrote in its press release for the new buds. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BXDYiH"&gt;Passive noise isolation also helps there, and Razer has switched to a proper in-ear design — unlike the AirPods-esque open style of the original Hammerhead True Wireless. (There’s a “quick attention mode” for piping in outside audio when you want to hear what’s happening near you.) Along with the usual silicone options (&lt;em&gt;six&lt;/em&gt; different sets of them), the company is including a set of medium Comply foam ear tips in the box to help you get the most secure, sealed-off fit possible to better enhance sound quality.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zZdQ2GpN9B1kudk5-R462AHDCcM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22141206/tips.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Razer includes six sets of silicone tips and Comply foam right in the box.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MYaFLI"&gt;The Hammerhead True Wireless Pro are rated IPX4 for water and sweat resistance, and Razer says they last up to 20 hours total with the case factored in; the earbuds can make it through four hours of continuous listening, which is about an hour below competitors like the AirPods Pro and Bose QuietComfort Earbuds. There’s also no wireless charging, which is disappointing to see at this level. You control the buds with the touch-sensitive Razer logo button on each one. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KqWlYD"&gt;As for the THX certification, Razer says “fine details such as frequency range and response are evaluated, and the device must be capable of delivering clear, detailed vocals and deep impactful bass with zero distortion at high volumes.” The Hammerhead True Wireless Pro feature 10mm drivers and still include a Game Mode that the company claims can cut latency in half “compared to other true wireless earbuds supporting SBC / AAC codecs.” Razer isn’t alone in offering a low-latency mode; Samsung and OnePlus also reduce the response time for audio effects in games when you use their respective earbuds and phones together. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4MX2h_-KsySc2ZPmaX3xd4U56iM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22141245/razer2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1aF0T9"&gt;The Hammerhead True Wireless Pro have a price fitting of their name, $199.99, which puts them firmly in the upper tier of true wireless earbuds. That’s slightly below the usual cost of Sony’s 1000XM3 earbuds or newer options like the Jabra Elite 85t, but holiday deals and discounts will probably end up putting all of these on equal footing. I’ll be checking them out over the coming days to see how they stack up against the noise-canceling competition for gaming purposes and everything else. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Raise your hand if ‘Cash App launches a clothing line’ was on your 2020 bingo card</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A 3D model wearing a 3D model of the clothing" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/od8VmjNTZq22bRtdKHP9aCYJzUo=/72x0:2604x1688/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68452859/Screen_Shot_2020_12_03_at_4.00.24_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s staring into my soul.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo: Cash App&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="19Y4Xx"&gt;If you’ve ever used Cash App and thought “wow, I wish I could put this on my body...” we may need to talk about your relationship with apps. But also you’re in luck! The payment service announced &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CashApp/status/1334558085621407747"&gt;in a tweet today&lt;/a&gt; that it’s launching its own apparel line, called (what else) Cash. According to its website, the apparel line will follow the standard streetwear release model of “limited edition drops”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBVR2c"&gt;If you follow &lt;a href="http://cashbycashapp.com"&gt;this link&lt;/a&gt; from the tweet, you’ll first be subjected to some creepy 3D models — you can click on them to make them dance — before you actually get to &lt;a href="https://shop.cash.app/"&gt;the shop&lt;/a&gt;. Once there, you can browse the “fits” (as I’ve heard the kids calling them). If you need a new T-shirt, sweatshirt, jacket, or pair of pants, and for some reason don’t mind being a walking billboard for a company that makes money when you spend money, you can, of course, buy one using your Cash Card. You’ll even get an extra 25 percent off if you use its service instead of a credit card. And, if you’re worried about getting chilly from the ice-cold look you’ll soon be rocking, &lt;a href="https://shop.cash.app/product/cash-app-fc-scarf/52?cp=true&amp;amp;sa=false&amp;amp;sbp=false&amp;amp;q=false&amp;amp;category_id=20"&gt;you can even get a scarf.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SGRahI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Your 7-year fear of Americans legally getting to make in-flight calls has come to an end</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="airplane southwest airlines stock 1024" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ogddw14drW6YdXso47Ka2RT0LTc=/0x19:1024x702/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68452820/airplane-southwest-1024.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HTjkxz"&gt;The next time you get on a plane, you’ll probably have plenty of new things to worry about, but having to listen to people talking on the phone won’t be one. Way back in 2013, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/22/5134656/fcc-confirms-it-may-allow-cellular-calls-during-flight"&gt;the FCC announced &lt;/a&gt;that it would be considering removing a ban on passengers making phone calls once the plane was above 10,000 feet. The proposal was unpopular even within the FCC, with &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/chi-fcc-chairman-not-a-fan-of-calls-on-planes-20131122-story.html#axzz2lQkTJIYu"&gt;then-Chairman Tom Wheeler saying&lt;/a&gt; he would prefer people &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; be allowed to make calls on a plane.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hp8X93"&gt;The FCC originally announced that it would be considering the proposal on December 12 (of 2013), but it &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-terminates-onboard-aircraft-proceeding"&gt;took until today&lt;/a&gt; to reach a verdict (&lt;a href="https://boingboing.net/2020/12/03/fcc-cancels-proposal-to-allow-cell-phone-calls-during-flight.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Boing Boing&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;): &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;The decision cites “strong opposition,” especially among pilots and flight attendants, claiming that the proposal “[failed] to address significant safety and national security concerns.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11tnbp"&gt;There are also concerns that the proposal would make flights less pleasant to be on. &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/filing/6017589037"&gt;One of the letters referenced&lt;/a&gt; by the FCC was filed by the Association of Professional Flight Attendants (APFA), and says that the proposal “jeopardize[s] safety and comfort on board our aircraft.” This is also the sentiment I’ve gathered from &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/ecfs/search/filings?proceedings_name=13-301&amp;amp;sort=date_disseminated,DESC&amp;amp;submissiontype_description=COMMENT"&gt;the public comments I’ve read&lt;/a&gt;: who wants to add “many people talking loudly on their phones” to the list of terrible airplane noises?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Comment on the FCC’s website asking if the people making the proposal “are smoking crack”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ClNvWjcXjCBsu8bufb91Q-uXSvw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22143017/Screen_Shot_2020_12_03_at_5.50.43_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Over 1,300 people commented on the proposal, with many expressing that they weren’t interested in having to hear people talk on their phone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="v2C29o"&gt;Even though it took seven years, I’m glad the FCC is taking what seems to be the obviously correct step here. Like the AFPA says, “just because something is technically feasible does not automatically mean it should be considered for public policy.” In other words: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/26/5245354/how-would-in-flight-calling-actually-work"&gt;even if you can&lt;/a&gt;, it doesn’t mean you should. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>You can play Cyberpunk 2077 on December 9th instead of 10th, depending where you live</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8n-PWmagzASMgUnrzBT16x3znUo=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68452756/screen_image_about_768457e5.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: CD Projekt Red&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FndB3K"&gt;The highly-anticipated &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; is just days away from its December 10th release. But depending on where you live and what platform you’re playing on, you might get to play the game a bit earlier than you might have expected given the previous guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n7BWq5"&gt;Developer CD Projekt Red shared exactly when &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; will be available &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1334548241459933188"&gt;in a tweet posted Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. If you’re playing on PC or Stadia, you’ll be able to start the game at 12AM GMT on December 10th no matter where you are in the world. That means, for example, that if you live on the US East Coast, you can jump into the game at 7PM ET on December 9th. If you want to know exactly when 12AM GMT is in your timezone, check the map below. Console players will get access to the game at midnight local time, according to CD Projekt Red.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BaYVyr"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The wait is almost over!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you're looking to play &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Cyberpunk2077?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#Cyberpunk2077&lt;/a&gt; as soon as it's available, here's a map with global release timings. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For PC and Stadia players, the release is simultaneous and scheduled for midnight GMT, and for all console players – midnight local time. &lt;a href="https://t.co/W0QLIFAhH1"&gt;pic.twitter.com/W0QLIFAhH1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Cyberpunk 2077 (@CyberpunkGame) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1334548241459933188?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="PTIOC2"&gt;CD Projekt Red also detailed when you can start preloading &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt; ahead of next week’s launch. On PC, you can preload the game beginning Monday, December 7th. Preloads begin at 12PM CET on GOG and at 5PM CET on Steam and the Epic Games Store. On Xbox One and Xbox Series consoles, you can already preload the game. On PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, preloads begin “two days prior to the release date.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ed1eQw"&gt;It’s been a long wait for people anticipating &lt;em&gt;Cyberpunk 2077&lt;/em&gt;, as the game has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/16/21069016/cyberpunk-2077-new-release-date-date-delay-september-cd-projekt-red"&gt;delayed&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21295705/cyberpunk-2077-delayed-again-release-date-november-19th-bug-fixes-balance-cd-projekt-red"&gt;multiple&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/27/21536662/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-delay-december"&gt;times&lt;/a&gt;. The specifics about release timing seem to suggest that the full game will, at long last, finally be in players’ hands very soon. Technically, the game discs went gold in October and a few of them &lt;a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/cyberpunk-2077s-street-date-has-been-broken/"&gt;are actually already in players’ hands&lt;/a&gt;, but there’s apparently going to be &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Okami13_/status/1334219336383418371?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1334224744741281797%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.videogameschronicle.com%2Fnews%2Fcyberpunk-2077s-street-date-has-been-broken%2F"&gt;a hefty day-one patch&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

Although Kratos is a Sony character, he’s not exclusive to PS4 or PS5 platforms — you’ll be able to buy the Kratos skin on any platform where &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt; can be played, and players on all platforms will be able to see Kratos in-game, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite&lt;/em&gt;-maker Epic Games tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R9VWJA"&gt;We should note that there is one PlayStation-exclusive thing about Kratos, though — if you play a match as Kratos on PlayStation 5, you’ll unlock the Armored Kratos Style:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="uNMMPY"&gt;For 2,200 V-Bucks, &lt;em&gt;Fortnite’s&lt;/em&gt; in-game currency, you get the Kratos skin, a glider, a Mimir back bling, and the Leviathan Axe pickaxe (which comes with an emote). You can also buy the skin and the back bling as a bundle for 1,500 V-Bucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4BHotk"&gt;Sony and Epic Games put together &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteGame/status/1334648614791094274"&gt;a short trailer&lt;/a&gt; to help hype up Kratos’ debut:&lt;/p&gt;

Kratos is a fitting addition to the lineup, though he may not be the only video game crossover we see this season — rumors point to Microsoft icon Master Chief &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/3/22150252/fortnite-halo-infinite-master-chief-leak-microsoft-xbox"&gt;possibly joining the game&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Looking Glass Portrait is a cheaper holographic window to your smartphone photos and more</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_DqsrUPEy2IhKKX4J0uLCPZoe4w=/157x0:1267x740/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68452439/Screen_Shot_2020_12_03_at_10.54.38_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Image: Looking Glass Factory&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="4PqgQl"&gt;Looking Glass Factory, a company that designs &lt;a href="https://lookingglassfactory.com/"&gt;personal holographic displays&lt;/a&gt;, just launched a Kickstarter for its new &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lookingglass/looking-glass-portrait/description"&gt;Looking Glass Portrait&lt;/a&gt;, a smaller, more affordable take on its previous light field display. The new Looking Glass can operate as a standalone device, and in a clever move, supports portrait mode photos from smartphones like the iPhone for creating simple holograms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="RlrXR6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:1523637"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0n5PjF"&gt;The Looking Glass Portrait displays holographic photos, videos and 3D models in a 58 degree viewing cone, which basically amounts to the experience of a 3D video or hologram, but viewable by multiple people without the need for special glasses. Holographic light field tech isn’t new, particularly in smaller sizes like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/9/8/16272838/red-hydrogen-one-holographic-display-leia"&gt;a cellphone screen&lt;/a&gt;. Where Looking Glass Portrait differs from other displays, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/10/15/21518679/sony-spacial-reality-display-hands-on-holographic-elf-sr1"&gt;Sony’s $3,000 Spatial Reality Display&lt;/a&gt;, is with a much lower price point of $349 (without promotional Kickstarter pricing).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XY8Nbf"&gt;Looking Glass Factory says its specific display uses a proprietary combination of light field and volumetric display technologies, meaning the display is both refracting light through glass and projecting it to multiple parts of the screen simultaneously to trick your brain into seeing a 3D image. The Looking Glass Portrait projects 45 to 100 different “views” of 3D scenes to create its holograms, which is great for more detailed captures from light field photography, but for less detailed methods like an iPhone portrait, the results aren’t as impressive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v-GXU84QB5WwZY8k9c8PccFFRoM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142499/fc26246bd878e7789d04f42cc0d4345c_original.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of a camera rail enabling holographic capture with a normal camera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="1ihArr"&gt;The Looking Glass Portrait has a 7.9 inch display at an undisclosed resolution, with HDMI, USB-C, and 3.5 stereo audio jack ports for getting media on and off the device. It’s a more compact and streamlined design than the previous &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/7/24/17607136/the-looking-glass-holographic-display-hologram-3d-image-kickstarter"&gt;$600 and $3,000 Looking Glass displays&lt;/a&gt; we covered in 2018, and notably vertically-oriented where the old model was horizontal. The display needs to be plugged in to a power source, but has a built-in Raspberry Pi 4 for standalone use. With the company’s Holographic Studio software you can also upload your own photos, videos and 3D models to the device. Outside of just photos and videos, the Portrait can also be connected to Microsoft’s Azure Kinect, Intel’s RealSense or a Leap Motion Controller for tinkering with slightly more interactive holograms.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aeX2OZJ_n1MI-Q0ZLLq0o9ssOQ8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22141775/intreactive_looking_glass.gif"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of an interactive hologram using the Leap Motion Controller.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="bpuxQA"&gt;Looking Glass Factory makes the Portrait seem like a device for anyone. Depth mapped photos have only gotten easier to capture and the new lower price feels a lot more approachable for a non-enthusiast. But I have to wonder what using the device is like long-term. Much like trying to find 3D videos for a 3D TV, there’s no single source that’s consistently putting out holographic content. Maybe tossing up holograms of your kids is enough of a novelty, but with the cooler integrations that the Portrait allows, I’d want reassurance there’d be new content for it over time. Looking Glass Factory has cultivated a community &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/ZW87Y4m"&gt;on Discord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://forum.lookingglassfactory.com/"&gt;its forums&lt;/a&gt;, but how much content shared there will actually be of interest remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bt2bMX"&gt;The Looking Glass Portrait is &lt;a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/lookingglass/looking-glass-portrait/description"&gt;available to back on Kickstarter today&lt;/a&gt;, December 3rd, for an Early Bird price of $199, with the display shifting to $249 for the remainder of the campaign tomorrow.  Early Bird orders are expected to be fulfilled in March 2021, with normal campaign orders following in April. The final retail price will be $349.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Hackers are targeting the COVID-19 vaccine supply chain, IBM finds</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/762wgZR1-UI5_IUsvrubIRn05aI=/0x0:2500x1667/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68452340/akrales_160205_0929_A_0016.0.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Amelia Krales&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yykb4S"&gt;A global phishing campaign has been targeting organizations associated with the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines since September 2020, IBM security researchers say. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QcuJJT"&gt;In a &lt;a href="https://securityintelligence.com/posts/ibm-uncovers-global-phishing-covid-19-vaccine-cold-chain/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;, analysts Claire Zaboeva and Melissa Frydrych of IBM X-Force IRIS announced that the phishing campaign spans six regions: Germany, Italy, South Korea, Czech Republic, greater Europe, and Taiwan. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jLQMdT"&gt;The campaign appears to be focused on the “cold chain,” the segment of the vaccine supply chain that keeps doses cold during their storage and transportation. Some vaccines need to stay at &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21537171/temperature-sensors-covid-vaccine-cold-chain"&gt;extremely low temperatures&lt;/a&gt; in order to remain potent. Pfizer, for example, recommends that their COVID-19 vaccine be stored at negative 70 degrees Celsius (&lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/11/17/935563377/why-does-pfizers-covid-19-vaccine-need-to-be-kept-colder-than-antarctica"&gt;colder than winter in Antarctica&lt;/a&gt;). That poses a logistical challenge for the pharmaceutical company, which will need to transport millions upon millions of doses around the world at that temperature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jmIPWo"&gt;The attacks focused on groups associated with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/27/12294726/gavi-alliance-vaccine-immunization-bill-gates-startup"&gt;Gavi,&lt;/a&gt; an international organization that promotes vaccine access and distribution. Specifically, it targeted organizations related to their Cold Chain Equipment Optimization Platform (CCEOP), which aims to distribute and improve technology that can keep vaccines at very cold temperatures. These included the European Commission’s Directorate-General for Taxation and Customs Union, as well as “organizations within the energy, manufacturing, website creation and software and internet security solutions sectors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gG9G5Y"&gt;Per the blog post, the people behind the phishing operation sent emails to the organizations’ executives claiming to be an executive from CCEOP supplier Haier Biomedical. The emails, which purported to request quotations related to CCEOP, contained HTML attachments which asked for the opener’s credentials, which the actor could store and use to gain unauthorized access down the line. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zn35RQ"&gt;“We assess that the purpose of this COVID-19 phishing campaign may have been to harvest credentials, possibly to gain future unauthorized access to corporate networks and sensitive information relating to the COVID-19 vaccine distribution,” reads the blog post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="84GreJ"&gt;It’s not yet clear who’s behind this campaign, but the researchers suspect a nation-state actor rather than a private individual or group. “Without a clear path to a cash-out, cyber criminals are unlikely to devote the time and resources required to execute such a calculated operation with so many interlinked and globally distributed targets,” the blog post reads. “Advanced insight into the purchase and movement of a vaccine that can impact life and the global economy is likely a high-value and high-priority nation-state target.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mYSyqo"&gt;IBM recommends that companies involved in COVID-19 vaccine storage and transport “be vigilant and remain on high alert during this time.” The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) has issued an &lt;a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/current-activity/2020/12/03/ibm-releases-report-cyber-actors-targeting-covid-19-vaccine-supply"&gt;alert&lt;/a&gt; encouraging the organizations to review IBM’s report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ISlahe"&gt;COVID-19 vaccine research and development has been a target of multiple cyberattacks this year. The US government &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/13/21257341/us-government-coronavirus-vaccine-china-theft-spy-accuses-fbi-cisa"&gt;accused China&lt;/a&gt; of funding and operating hacking cells to steal vaccine research from the US and its allies in May, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/21/21332864/us-justice-department-li-xiaoyu-dong-jiazhi-chinese-state-hacking-charges-coronavirus"&gt;charged two Chinese hackers&lt;/a&gt; with stealing data from firms working on COVID-19 treatments and vaccines in July. US, UK, and Canadian authorities &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/16/21327021/russia-hackers-covid19-coronavirus-vaccine-attacks-uk-us-canada"&gt;denounced attacks from a group associated with Russian intelligence services&lt;/a&gt; on organizations involved in vaccine development this summer. In November, Microsoft &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2020/11/13/health-care-cyberattacks-covid-19-paris-peace-forum/"&gt;detected cyberattacks&lt;/a&gt; from nation-state actors in Russia and North Korea on companies with COVID-19 vaccines in various stages of clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3tYeQd"&gt;Multiple companies have submitted COVID-19 vaccines for review to the Food and Drug Administration, including Pfizer / BioNTech and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726554/moderna-covid-vaccine-fda-pfizer-biontech"&gt;Moderna&lt;/a&gt;. The FDA’s vaccine advisory community will review the applications in mid-December; if the vaccines are authorized, distribution will begin shortly after. Moderna expects to have up to 20 million doses of its vaccine by the end of 2020, while Pfizer could provide up to 25 million.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Wristcam is a camera for your Apple Watch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IuTbS44N7kROPw6hfrzfa3bvias=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68451810/WristcamRose_woLogo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Wristcam&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZTlcrQ"&gt;A strap for an Apple Watch equipped with front- and rear-facing cameras is finally launching after nearly four years in development. The Wristcam has an 8-megapixel camera that can shoot 1080p video and take stills in 4K resolution and a 2-megapixel camera for selfies. The company says you’ll also be able to use it as a video walkie-talkie with real-time live-streaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P5Zrfb"&gt;Those might be serviceable cameras, but they’re not likely to replace your iPhone camera. The company sent over a sample of images shot by the Wristcam, which are pretty decent, if a bit underwhelming in the details.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u4dDftbfwDX0_kSlVCBo3NQRkog=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142248/Shot_with_Wristcam___10.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mDfrgZ_xwQVPAlNyzG3bEmzh4eE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22142409/Shot_with_Wristcam___5.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="J8otWd"&gt;Wristcam, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/11/2/13496276/apple-watch-camera-band-cmra-strap-glide"&gt;originally called CMRA&lt;/a&gt;, shows images on the Watch screen but has a separate battery, which the company says can last an entire day. You can take images and video just by pressing a button on the band, and it will sync them to your iPhone automatically when you drop it on its magnetically attached charging cable at night.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vBcC7n"&gt;The device has 8GB of memory for photo and video storage. The camera connects with the Watch via &lt;a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/learn-about-bluetooth/bluetooth-technology/radio-versions/"&gt;Bluetooth Low Energy&lt;/a&gt; (BLE) and with the iPhone via Bluetooth 4.2, 5.0, and Wi-Fi. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Glide / Wristcam&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wristcam comes with two cameras and works independently of the iPhone.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ff2The"&gt;The Wristcam band weighs 23 grams, about &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Feshop.macsales.com%2Fblog%2F29063-spreadsheet-makes-sense-of-price-and-weight-of-all-apple-watch-combos%2F%23%3A%7E%3Atext%3DThe%2520Classic%2520Buckle%2520Apple%2520Watch%2Cas%2520much%2520at%2520125%2520grams.&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2020%2F12%2F3%2F22150955%2Fapple-watch-camera-wristcam-crowdfunding#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;half the weight&lt;/a&gt; of the lightest Apple Watch, and comes in interchangeable colors, including noir, blanc, gray, rose, and sage. Both cameras have LEDs that light up when a photo or video is being shot, so it’s clear when the device is in photo-taking mode. It’s controlled by one multifunctional button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mXrU6T"&gt;According to CEO Ari Roisman, the Wristcam can take up to 20 seconds to share a photo directly from the Watch over Bluetooth but will sync directly with a connected iPhone. The ability to share photos directly from the Watch won’t be available at launch but in a future update, Roisman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="ljdyEn"&gt;Roisman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; the company is focused on shipping units to customers who supported the original &lt;a href="https://support.getcmra.com/hc/en-us/articles/212770625-What-is-the-CMRA-Pre-order-Campaign-"&gt;crowdfunding campaign&lt;/a&gt;, which pre-sold 10,000 units. The lengthy delay stemmed from design challenges, Roisman said, but customers who have stuck with the company should receive their Wristcams by the holidays. Since it’s been four years, the company said it offered refunds to any of the original crowdfunders who wanted their money back. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yVZ5nw"&gt;The Wristcam is taking direct reservations from customers &lt;a href="https://www.wristcam.com/"&gt;on its website&lt;/a&gt; for $299. The first direct-to-customer units will ship in March 2021, the company says. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google Podcasts now supports private RSS feeds so you can listen to the shows you pay to access</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YFPMbeQckkWcQe49mVMAz4Qhc0U=/0x0:820x547/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68451718/googlepodcasts_rss_feed.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Google Podcasts&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bzA9VP"&gt;Google Podcasts is finally getting a feature that’s already standard across most listening apps: private RSS feed support. The head of product for Google Podcasts, Zack Reneau-Wedeen, made the announcement &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ZackRW/status/1334590407850696705"&gt;on Twitter today&lt;/a&gt; and shouted out some networks that are especially reliant on private feeds, including Patreon, Slate, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/29/18522031/redcircle-podcast-service-hosting-analytics-cross-promotion"&gt;Red Circle&lt;/a&gt;, and Supercast.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7jD29G"&gt;To access the feature, tap over to the activity tab in the bottom right-hand corner and slide over to the Subscriptions tab, then tap the plus symbol. You’ll then be prompted to add by RSS feed. You can see the entire process below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="NDZOis"&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Important milestone in our mission to help creators grow their audience and build sustainable businesses — in whichever ways work best for them!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;  Add your own RSS feed on Google Podcasts here: &lt;a href="https://t.co/Koiqsx2Iex"&gt;https://t.co/Koiqsx2Iex&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/RzcVTrt1EB"&gt;pic.twitter.com/RzcVTrt1EB&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Gabe Bender (@GabeBender) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/GabeBender/status/1334593474688126979?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;December 3, 2020&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EchEw2"&gt;This is a relatively standard feature that’s helped prop up the podcasting business for creators. On Patreon, for example, members often pay for access to a subscribers-only feed. To access that content, the creator sends them a private RSS feed they then can insert into their favorite listening app to retrieve the audio. It’s a useful thing to support both for creators and listeners, so it’s not surprising Google would build this in. In fact, it’s been a long time coming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yodYi5"&gt;Still, not every app supports the feature, including, most notably, Spotify. But if Google Podcasts, and even Spotify, wants to become the places where people consume all of their audio, they have to support private RSS feeds, at least for the time being because it’s how creators get their shows out to fans while still getting paid.&lt;/p&gt;
