        &lt;figcaption&gt;Nomad&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hhEfkS"&gt;It’s time for another roundup of this week’s best deals. You may have already seen some of these if you’ve been keeping up with our deals coverage every day, but I’m sure there are some surprises in here. Before that, though, &lt;a href="https://link.theverge.com/click/24672525.29/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cudGhldmVyZ2UuY29tLzIyNTg2MjY0L2JhY2stdG8tc2Nob29sLWdpZnQtaWRlYXMtY29sbGVnZS1kb3JtLWhpZ2gtc2Nob29sLXN1cHBsaWVzLXRlY2gtZ2FkZ2V0cw/60ca3936dba83e5914705c33B27cc4c40"&gt;check out our newly-published Back to School gift guide&lt;/a&gt;. The beginning of August marks when many people who attend school realize how little time they actually have to prepare for the school year ahead. If that describes you or someone you know, I hope that our guide helps you. Otherwise, carry on to see what we’ve brought you this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="zyCmUi"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="dz9eqL"&gt;Get a Nomad case for your MacBook or iPad for half off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="V1ikdI"&gt;Nomad is offering &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;readers an exclusive discount on some of its polyurethane (PU) leather cases and sleeves for the latest MacBook models (both 13- and 16-inch), as well as the iPad Pro and iPad Air tablets. &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/Verge/type/dlg/sid/VergeRoundup08072021/https://nomadgoods.com/collections/pu-case" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Take a look at its offerings&lt;/a&gt;, and if you see something that you like, punch in the code &lt;strong&gt;VERGEDEALS &lt;/strong&gt;at checkout to see its price fall by half.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="POvYiC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10689551"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="yVGwxh"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="wdponA"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; for PS4, PS5 is up to 50 percent off&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WwMGbR"&gt;Whether you have any attachment to &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII&lt;/em&gt; or not, it’s worth picking up the &lt;em&gt;Remake &lt;/em&gt;for PS4 or PS5, as it’s both very good and more affordable than usual for a limited time. You can grab a &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-CUSA07211_00-FFVIIREMAKE00000/"&gt;digital download&lt;/a&gt; or buy the &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZS80PC2/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;disc version&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt; for PS4 (upgradeable to the PS5 version for free with purchase) for $30, down from $60&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XeYHpa"&gt;If you have a PS5, the special edition called Intergrade that includes the new Yuffie episode in addition to the base game is just $50 &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0082-PPSA01903_00-5827003902180177/"&gt;digitally&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08XNRM6QN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;on disc&lt;/a&gt; (usually $70)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="klBXvO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9546364"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="ujHVF2"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="Kssq3u"&gt;A three-pack of Google Wifi routers is $150 at Amazon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="KCIfvF"&gt;One of this week’s most popular deals was, unsurprisingly, this fantastic sale on a three-pack of Google Wifi routers. Normally $200, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08GG9CMLR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;it’s still $150 at Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. Google usually charges $100 for a single router, but you can outfit your home with a whole mesh Wi-Fi system comprised of three routers (each of which has dual gigabit ethernet ports) for just $50 more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HeKQc8"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10472238"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="xcgb2c"&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AWz9nc"&gt;The 40mm Apple Watch Series 6 in red is $300 at Woot&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="WIvIiw"&gt;The best deal currently available on the Apple Watch Series 6 is at Woot, where you can get &lt;a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-13112648?sid=verge&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fapple-watch-series-6-gps-40mm-productred-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the 40mm Apple Watch Series 6 in the all-red colorway for $300&lt;/a&gt; (normally $400). This is the model that we see discounted most often, perhaps because of its divisive color scheme. Just to note: $250 is the lowest price that we’ve seen for this one, and Apple may unveil the successor to the Series 6 at its annual fall hardware event. But, if you need a watch now, this is a solid deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Kc2ufm"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9432291"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Spotify says it plans to add AirPlay 2 to its iOS app — eventually</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DDD20yR_WaPMtNUO2rsOrGSinnc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69690480/acastro_180213_1777_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qolgag"&gt;Spotify still hasn’t added AirPlay 2 support to its iOS app — but despite the delay, it’s still “working to make [it] a reality,” the company tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. Some doubt was cast on AirPlay 2 inclusion when &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/08/06/spotify-pauses-airplay-2-support-for-ios-app/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; spotted a forum post&lt;/a&gt; where a Spotify forum moderator claimed that &lt;a href="https://community.spotify.com/t5/Closed-Ideas/iOS-Airplay-2-Support-for-iOS/idc-p/5244350/highlight/true#M235171"&gt;“audio driver compatibility issues”&lt;/a&gt; might mean the feature wouldn’t be added for the foreseeable future. Spotify now claims that’s wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lIlb4R"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; received the following statement from Spotify regarding AirPlay 2:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="l6Ose4"&gt;A post on one of Spotify’s Community pages contained incomplete information regarding our plans for AirPlay2. Spotify will support AirPlay2 and we’re working to make that a reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="5hM8lP"&gt;AirPlay 2, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/29/17403684/airplay-2-ios-114-stereo-homepod-available-now"&gt;added as part of iOS 11 update&lt;/a&gt;, introduced multiroom audio, Siri voice control, and fairly broad support across a wide swath of speakers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/8/18173637/tv-airplay-2-apple-lg-samsung-sony-vizio-ces-2019"&gt;televisions&lt;/a&gt;, and streaming services. It was a real first for Apple’s “casting” feature, which had previously been somewhat poorly supported outside of Apple’s own devices. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BIY2Ct"&gt;&lt;q&gt;I’m not going to call it petty, but...&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w59IH1"&gt;Spotify has its own way to get audio from its service to other devices in the form of &lt;a href="https://www.spotify.com/us/connect/"&gt;Spotify Connect&lt;/a&gt;, but considering Spotify already supports Google Cast, skipping Apple’s newest streaming protocol would seem like an odd omission. As &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; notes, Apple provides a seemingly simple &lt;a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation/media_playback_and_selection/getting_airplay_2_into_your_app"&gt;four step developer document&lt;/a&gt; explaining how to enable the feature. However, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1423744958541058052?s=20"&gt;developer Marco Arment points&lt;/a&gt; out that the fourth step (adopting a new API that supports enhanced buffering) is a bigger hurdle than it appears. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BhtYf6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;…and that new API:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- is barely documented&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- has no public sample code&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- is full of major gotchas&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- can’t change speeds seamlessly&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- doesn’t provide precise timing&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- requires much more complex logic&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;- is less efficient, which can cause background CPU-overage terminations&lt;/p&gt;— Marco Arment (@marcoarment) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1423744958541058052?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="d6ALoR"&gt;But add in that Spotify has a less-than-friendly relationship with Apple, even going as far as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/13/18263453/spotify-apple-app-store-antitrust-complaint-ec-30-percent-cut-unfair"&gt;filing an antitrust complaint&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22457400/spotify-horacio-gutierrez-apple-app-store-interview-decoder"&gt;publicly calling it a bully&lt;/a&gt;, and a choice to not prioritize incorporating AirPlay 2 makes even more sense. It’s good that it’s still happening, but for any Spotify subscriber on iOS, it’s hard to not feel like you’re caught in the crossfire between two tech giants on the outs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XlsirN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 6th, 6:47PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Changed headline and added statement from Spotify confirming it is working on AirPlay2 support.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2tmCRK"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft’s new Xbox night mode dims your screen, controller, and power button</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nn4Z7kqWuOGTF4uou6FL5fJZzow=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69691100/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="cTGRkI"&gt;Microsoft is working on a new night mode for Xbox consoles. The software giant has started testing this night mode with Xbox Insiders in the &lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/08/06/xbox-insider-release-notes-alpha-skip-ahead-2109-210804-2200/"&gt;Alpha Skip-Ahead ring&lt;/a&gt; today, and it allows Xbox owners to dim their screens, controller LED brightness, and even the Xbox power button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="88GLAW"&gt;The night mode has a lot of customization, including different dimming levels and an optional blue light filter. Microsoft is also allowing Xbox owners to dim the LED brightness on their controllers in this night mode and dim the Xbox power button light or turn it off. You can also set an Xbox to switch to the system dark mode and disable HDR when the night mode is enabled. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v-KsnZIhfZsEUnLZw7NhBErpD50=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22767178/Xbox_Series_S___Xbox_Series_S_2021_08_06_22_27_18.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Xbox night mode lets you dim a controller LED brightness.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="NtT7NJ"&gt;This Xbox night mode can also be set to a schedule, either a manual one or an automatic one that will enable it at sunset and disable it at sunrise. Microsoft is currently testing this with Xbox Insiders, so expect to see it filter through the various testing channels in the coming weeks before arriving on all Xbox consoles soon.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp lead and other tech experts fire back at Apple’s Child Safety plan</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TGtA_nWVkDJWCy43HTsdInDqf6Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69691082/acastro_170731_1777_0006_v4.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I80BZO"&gt;WhatsApp won’t be adopting &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/child-safety/"&gt;Apple’s new Child Safety measures&lt;/a&gt;, meant to stop the spread of child abuse imagery, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1423701473624395784?s=20"&gt;WhatsApp’s head Will Cathcart&lt;/a&gt;. In a Twitter thread, he explains his belief that Apple “has built software that can scan all the private photos on your phone,” and said that Apple has taken the wrong path in trying to improve its response to child sexual abuse material, or CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LoRGi4"&gt;Apple’s plan, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611721/apple-csam-child-abuse-scanning-hash-system-ncmec"&gt;which it announced on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, involves taking hashes of images uploaded to iCloud and comparing them to a database that contains hashes of known CSAM images. According to Apple, this allows it to keep user data encrypted and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reneritchie/status/1423726172849033216?s=20"&gt;run the analysis on-device&lt;/a&gt; while still allowing it to report users to the authorities if they’re found to be sharing child abuse imagery. Another prong of Apple’s Child Safety strategy involves optionally warning parents if their child &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/rsgnl/status/1423389211542032384"&gt;under 13 years old&lt;/a&gt; sends or views photos containing sexually explicit content. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612934/apple-vp-memo-concerns-privacy-new-scanning-photos-images-ios"&gt;An internal memo at Apple&lt;/a&gt; acknowledged that people would be “worried about the implications” of the systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zcRqL1"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I read the information Apple put out yesterday and I'm concerned. I think this is the wrong approach and a setback for people's privacy all over the world.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;People have asked if we'll adopt this system for WhatsApp. The answer is no.&lt;/p&gt;— Will Cathcart (@wcathcart) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1423701473624395784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BOKTKj"&gt;Cathcart &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1423701476841385988?s=20"&gt;calls Apple’s approach&lt;/a&gt; “very concerning,” saying that it would allow governments with different ideas of what kind of images are and are not acceptable to request that Apple add non-CSAM images to the databases it’s comparing images against. Cathcart says WhatsApp’s system to fight child exploitation, which partly utilizes user reports, preserves encryption like Apple’s and has led to the company &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/wcathcart/status/1423701475595755524?s=20"&gt;reporting over 400,000 cases&lt;/a&gt; to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children in 2020. (Apple is also working with the Center for its CSAM detection efforts.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iuhKXJ"&gt;WhatsApp’s owner, Facebook, has reasons to pounce on Apple for privacy concerns. Apple’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405474/apple-app-tracking-transparency-ios-14-5-privacy-update-facebook-data"&gt;changes to how ad tracking works in iOS 14.5&lt;/a&gt; started a fight between the two companies, with Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22178068/facebook-apple-newspaper-ads-ios-privacy-changes"&gt;buying newspaper ads&lt;/a&gt; criticizing Apple’s privacy changes as harmful to small businesses. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/16/22179721/apple-defends-upcoming-privacy-changes-standing-up-for-users-facebook-data"&gt;Apple fired back&lt;/a&gt;, saying that the change “simply requires” that users be given a choice on whether to be tracked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1dseaO"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cathcart calls Apple’s approach “very concerning,” and he’s not alone&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="wLRoUJ"&gt;It’s not just WhatsApp that has criticized Apple’s new Child Safety measures, though. The list of people and organizations raising concerns includes Edward Snowden, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, professors, and more. We’ve collected some of those reactions here to act as an overview of some of the criticisms levied against Apple’s new policy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="TJSuYM"&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZcaWR"&gt;Matthew Green, an associate professor at Johns Hopkins University, pushed back on the feature before it was publicly announced. He tweeted about Apple’s plans and about how the hashing system could be abused by governments and malicious actors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="My9zJN"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;These tools will allow Apple to scan your iPhone photos for photos that match a specific perceptual hash, and report them to Apple servers if too many appear.&lt;/p&gt;— Matthew Green (@matthew_d_green) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/matthew_d_green/status/1423072476888805376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AKpR2F"&gt;The EFF &lt;a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2021/08/apples-plan-think-different-about-encryption-opens-backdoor-your-private-life"&gt;released a statement&lt;/a&gt; that blasted Apple’s plan, more or less calling it a “thoroughly documented, carefully thought-out, and narrowly-scoped backdoor.” The EFF’s press release goes into detail on how it believes Apple’s Child Safety measures could be abused by governments and how they decrease user privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jacoNW"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple's filtering of iMessage and iCloud is not a slippery slope to backdoors that suppress speech and make our communications less secure. We’re already there: this is a fully-built system just waiting for external pressure to make the slightest change. &lt;a href="https://t.co/f2nv062t2n"&gt;https://t.co/f2nv062t2n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— EFF (@EFF) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/EFF/status/1423375818693038084?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p id="Yuo1qD"&gt;Kendra Albert, an instructor at Harvard’s Cyberlaw Clinic, has a thread on the potential dangers to queer children and Apple’s initial lack of clarity around age ranges for the parental notifications feature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="6bBV1n"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The idea that parents are safe people for teens to have conversations about sex or sexting with is admirable, but in many cases, not true. (And as far as I can tell, this stuff doesn't just apply to kids under the age for 13.)&lt;/p&gt;— Kendra Albert (@KendraSerra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KendraSerra/status/1423367106972852228?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="p5xtGT"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;EFF reports that the iMessage nudity notifications will not go to parents if the kid is between 13-17 but that is not anywhere in the Apple documentation that I can find. &lt;a href="https://t.co/Ma1BdyqZfW"&gt;https://t.co/Ma1BdyqZfW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kendra Albert (@KendraSerra) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KendraSerra/status/1423436593696854018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CEqw4k"&gt;Edward Snowden retweeted the &lt;em&gt;Financial Time&lt;/em&gt;s article about the system, giving his own characterization of what Apple is doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="CCaMt8"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple plans to modify iPhones to constantly scan for contraband: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;“It is an absolutely appalling idea, because it is going to lead to distributed bulk surveillance of our phones and laptops,” said Ross Anderson, professor of security engineering. &lt;a href="https://t.co/rS92HR3pUZ"&gt;https://t.co/rS92HR3pUZ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Edward Snowden (@Snowden) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Snowden/status/1423387232963022848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="sceSPL"&gt;Politician Brianna Wu called the system “the worst idea in Apple History.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wB779u"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is the worst idea in Apple history, and I don't say that lightly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It destroys their credibility on privacy. It will be abused by governments. It will get gay children killed and disowned. This is the worst idea ever. &lt;a href="https://t.co/M2EIn2jUK2"&gt;https://t.co/M2EIn2jUK2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Brianna Wu (@BriannaWu) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/BriannaWu/status/1423384759858774026?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="H0QULK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Just to state: Apple's scanning does not detect photos of child abuse. It detects a list of known banned images added to a database, which are initially child abuse imagery found circulating elsewhere. What images are added over time is arbitrary. It doesn't know what a child is.&lt;/p&gt;— SoS (@SwiftOnSecurity) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1423383256003747840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="r1g6Co"&gt;Writer Matt Blaze also tweeted about the concerns that the technology could be abused by overreaching governments, trying to prevent content other than CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="PouZDU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;In other words, not only does the policy have to be exceptionally robust, so does the implementation.&lt;/p&gt;— matt blaze (@mattblaze) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mattblaze/status/1423476875817635840?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rvN3WU"&gt;Epic CEO Tim Sweeney also criticized Apple, saying that the company “vacuums up everybody’s data into iCloud by default.” He also promised to share more thoughts specifically about Apple’s Child Safety system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wfglq3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;It’s atrocious how Apple vacuums up everybody’s data into iCloud by default, hides the 15+ separate options to turn parts of it off in Settings underneath your name, and forces you to have an unwanted email account. Apple would NEVER allow a third party to ship an app like this.&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1423728945225211908?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="kuuOuE"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I will share some very detailed thoughts on this related topic later.&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1423730378234376206?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="7YCGmI"&gt;Not every reaction has been critical, however. Ashton Kutcher (who has done &lt;a href="https://thecnnfreedomproject.blogs.cnn.com/2011/04/14/moore-kutcher-join-our-crusade-to-end-child-sex-trafficking/"&gt;advocacy work to end child sex trafficking since 2011&lt;/a&gt;) calls Apple’s work “a major step forward” for efforts to eliminate CSAM.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="SFDxLg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;I believe in privacy - including for kids whose sexual abuse is documented and spread online without consent. These efforts announced by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Apple?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@Apple&lt;/a&gt; are a major step forward in the fight to eliminate CSAM from the internet. &lt;a href="https://t.co/TQIxHlu4EX"&gt;https://t.co/TQIxHlu4EX&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— ashton kutcher (@aplusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/aplusk/status/1423387418451922950?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;August 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>Amazon warehouse workers in the US are required to wear masks again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="GERMANY-LOGISTICS-AMAZON" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/n0LIFX_QoVHjYmnymk5ncpVclZM=/194x0:4606x2941/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69691038/1232843235.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Ronny Hartmann / AFP via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9MC8zj"&gt;Amazon informed US warehouse employees on Friday that it is once again requiring them to wear masks to work in response to the spread of the more contagious COVID-19 delta variant (via &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/08/06/amazon-resumes-mask-mandate-in-warehouses-amid-rising-covid-cases.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-08-06/amazon-tells-warehouse-workers-to-mask-up-again-as-virus-spreads?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The company says it offers &lt;a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/more-than-half-a-million-amazon-frontline-employees-have-access-to-covid-19-vaccines-through-on-site-vaccination-events"&gt;access to vaccines to over half a million of its employees&lt;/a&gt;, but it will require employees to mask up, regardless of their vaccination status.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NDpp8l"&gt; Amazon confirmed the mask mandate in an email statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="wMnFhi"&gt;In response to the concerning spread of new COVID-19 variants in the U.S. and guidance from public health authorities and our own medical experts, we are requiring face coverings indoors regardless of vaccination status. We are monitoring the situation closely and will continue to follow local government guidance and work closely with leading medical healthcare professionals, gathering their advice and recommendations as we go forward to ensure our buildings are optimized for the safety of our teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="bw6utH"&gt;Non-warehouse employees currently don’t have to deal with Amazon’s policy change. The company recently adjusted its return-to-office plans on August 5th, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611439/amazon-office-employees-postpone-back-to-work-january-2022"&gt;pushing back its return date&lt;/a&gt; to January 2022. Like other companies, Amazon had &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-06-10/amazon-wants-office-workers-back-3-days-a-week-in-september?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;previously considered implementing a hybrid work schedule&lt;/a&gt;, with plans to bring office workers back to offices for at least part of the week starting on September 7th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hod8UR"&gt;Taking the extra precautions for warehouse employees seems like the right idea if it plans to continue having staff work in person. Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/1/21497941/amazon-disclose-workers-contract-covid-19"&gt;reported in October 2020&lt;/a&gt; that 19,816 workers of its 1,372,000 frontline employees across Whole Foods and Amazon had COVID-19 “or where presumed positive” from March 1st to September 19th, 2020. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GJePFy"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1gWfpU"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>There’s a better way for Facebook to resolve its fight with NYU researchers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jxpgVz16oQdKV8BEHYDocU3jGp4=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69690498/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sJ9aYp"&gt;More and more, I find myself wondering why we built a world in which so much civic discourse takes place inside a handful of giant digital shopping malls. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="W7VqNp"&gt;So let’s talk about Facebook’s decision &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/4/22609020/facebook-bans-academic-researchers-ad-transparency-misinformation-nyu-ad-observatory-plug-in"&gt;to disable the pages and personal accounts associated with the Ad Observatory project at New York University&lt;/a&gt;, which took data that had been volunteered by willing Facebook users and analyzed it in an effort to better understand the 2020 election and other subjects in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g1AmUn"&gt;In one corner, you have academic researchers working to understand the platform’s effects on our democracy. In the other, you have a company battered by nearly two decades of privacy scandals and regulatory fines, forever terrified that a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDR8qGmyEQg"&gt;Cambridge Analytica&lt;/a&gt; sequel is lurking somewhere on the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zcEsLr"&gt;I first wrote about this case in October, &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/facebook-blocks-a-browser-extension?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNDEyNjIsInBvc3RfaWQiOjE0MjI0OTQ2LCJfIjoiZHhYckEiLCJpYXQiOjE2MjgwODYxNTUsImV4cCI6MTYyODA4OTc1NSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTc5NzYiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.q94bwlvejRXzgVg-_A5EGw%E2%80%94HSkTBEswHDUnU5-ahME"&gt;when Facebook sent its initial cease-and-desist notice to the researchers&lt;/a&gt;. The issue concerned&lt;a href="https://adobservatory.org/"&gt; a browser extension&lt;/a&gt; created by an NYU team that, if installed, collects data about the ads you see on Facebook, including information about how those ads are targeted. Facebook already makes similar data publicly available through its &lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/ads/library/?active_status=all&amp;amp;ad_type=political_and_issue_ads&amp;amp;country=US&amp;amp;media_type=all"&gt;online ad archive&lt;/a&gt;, but the NYU researchers say it’s incomplete and sometimes inaccurate — among other things, they say, many political ads are never labeled as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wT5JIL"&gt;No one I have spoken to at Facebook believes that NYU’s work is not fundamentally in the public interest. Other mediums for political advertising don’t allow campaigns to target voters with nearly the level of precision that Facebook does, and the lingering belief that Facebook swung the 2016 election to Donald Trump drew heightened scrutiny to the company’s ad practices in 2020. It’s no wonder academics want to study the platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3l3c3R"&gt;Anticipating this interest,&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22248806/facebook-us-2020-election-data-research-political-ad-targeting"&gt; the company established the Facebook Open Research and Transparency platform earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. But like most of the company’s academic partnerships, FORT has been criticized for being too limited in the view of Facebook that it provides. In the case of the election, for example, it will only provide data from the 90 days before Election Day — despite the fact that the presidential campaign lasted well over a year. Moreover, researchers say, FORT requires researchers to access data on a laptop furnished by Facebook, preventing them from using their own machine-learning classifiers and other tools on the data available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="GjZQZi"&gt;&lt;q&gt;when NYC received the cease-and-desist, they planned to ignore it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MaQkBG"&gt;That’s why, when the NYU team received that cease-and-desist last fall, they said they planned to ignore it. “The only thing that would prompt us to stop doing this would be if Facebook would do it themselves, which we have called on them to do,” researcher Laura Edelson&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-seeks-shutdown-of-nyu-research-project-into-political-ad-targeting-11603488533"&gt; told &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZyytPg"&gt;Facebook said it wouldn’t ban NYU until well after the election, and was true to its word. But on Tuesday night, the company dropped the hammer on the NYU team. “We took these actions to stop unauthorized scraping and protect people’s privacy in line with our privacy program under the FTC order,”&lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/08/research-cannot-be-the-justification-for-compromising-peoples-privacy/"&gt; said&lt;/a&gt; Mike Clark, a product management director, referring to Facebook’s&lt;a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2020/04/ftc-gives-final-approval-modify-ftcs-2012-privacy-order-facebook"&gt; consent decree&lt;/a&gt; with the Federal Trade Commission. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ezynjs"&gt;Alex Abdo, an attorney for the NYU researchers, told me that he was taken aback by Facebook’s actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LiHLs5"&gt;“On the one hand, it’s not surprising — on the other hand, it’s totally shocking that Facebook’s response to research that the public really needs right now is to try to shut it down,” he said in an interview. “Privacy in research and social media is a genuinely hard question. But the answer can’t be that Facebook unilaterally decides. And there is not an independent research project out there that is more respectful of user privacy than the Ad Observer.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="rljUDQ"&gt;
&lt;p id="2BYpIG"&gt;So let’s talk about privacy. The Ad Observer was designed to collect data about individual ads and the people they were targeted at, and also to anonymize that data. Mozilla, the nonprofit organization behind the Firefox browser, conducted a review of the extension’s code and its consent flow and ultimately recommended that people use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qdZdYL"&gt;“We decided to recommend Ad Observer because our reviews assured us that it respects user privacy and supports transparency,” Marshall Erwin, the company’s chief security officer, &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/news/why-facebooks-claims-about-the-ad-observer-are-wrong/"&gt;said in a blog post&lt;/a&gt;. “It does not collect personal posts or information about your friends. And it does not compile a user profile on its servers.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2rAvuc"&gt;You probably won’t be surprised to learn that Facebook sees it differently. Despite the lengths to which the researchers have gone here, the company told me, the Ad Observer still collects data that some users may object to. If an individual pays to boost a post, such as for a fundraiser, information including that user’s name and photo winds up in the NYU researchers’ hands. The Ad Observer may also collect similar information from comments on ads. And Facebook says information gleaned from an ad’s “why am I seeing this?” panel “can be used to identify other people who interacted with the ads and determine personal information about them.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r3WBD4"&gt;In any of these cases, the actual harm to the user would seem to be &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; minor, if you can call it a harm at all. But Facebook says it’s against their rules, and they have to enforce those rules, not least because Cambridge Analytica was a story about&lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/apr/24/aleksandr-kogan-cambridge-analytica-facebook-data-business-ventures"&gt; a researcher with seemingly good intentions&lt;/a&gt; who ultimately sold off the data he collected and created arguably the biggest scandal in company history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3zeMsJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cambridge Analytica was about a researcher with seemingly good intentions &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Eh749j"&gt;It’s for that reason that I have at least some empathy for Facebook here. The company is continuously under fire for the way it collects and uses personal data, and here you have a case where the company is trying to &lt;em&gt;limit&lt;/em&gt; that data collection, and many of the same critics who are still bringing up Cambridge Analytica on Twitter three years later are simultaneously arguing that Facebook has a moral obligation to let the Ad Observatory slide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGaio9"&gt;But letting things slide is not really in the spirit of the General Data Protection Regulation, California’s own privacy act, and any number of other privacy regulations. (As one smart person put it in our &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/announcing-sidechannel-a-new-community"&gt;Sidechannel server&lt;/a&gt;: “GDPR does not have a general research exemption.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mfOljf"&gt;Contrary to some earlier reporting, Facebook is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; arguing that Ad Observer violates its FTC consent decree, it told me. But the company has at least some good reasons to prevent large-scale data scraping like the kind represented by the NYU researchers. The&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/21/technology/clearview-ai-valuation.html"&gt; rise of Clearview AI&lt;/a&gt;, a dystopian surveillance company that built facial recognition in part by collecting publicly available photos on Facebook, has made that case in a visceral way this year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="P6uJuD"&gt;
&lt;p id="UQCG1d"&gt;While the fight between NYU and Facebook got ugly this week, I think there are some obvious (though difficult) paths forward.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OilGVz"&gt;One is that Facebook could expand its current data export tools to allow us to contribute our data to projects like the Ad Observer voluntarily, but in an even more privacy-protective way. To hear Facebook tell it, if NYU’s browser extension collected just a handful fewer types of data, it might have been palatable to the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7w3LK8"&gt;If you believe users have a right to discuss their personal experiences on Facebook, I think you should also agree they have a right to volunteer personal data that speaks to that experience. By Facebook’s nature, anyone’s personal experience is going to have a lot of other potentially non-consenting friends’ data wrapped up in it, too. But the company&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/405183566203254"&gt; already lets me export my friends’ data&lt;/a&gt; — when they tag me in comments, send me Facebook messages, and so on. The company is already way closer to figuring out a way to let me share this information with researchers than it may seem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNqzSb"&gt;Another option — rarely used in the United States — is that Congress could pass a law. It could write national privacy legislation, for example, and create a dedicated carveout for qualified academic researchers. It could require platforms to disclose more data in general, to academics and everyone else. It could establish a federal agency dedicated to the oversight of online communication platforms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n9cj4F"&gt;The alternative, as always, is to wait for platforms to regulate themselves — and to continuously be disappointed by the result.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rr4uEL"&gt;The NYU-Facebook spat was always going to end up in the place we find it today: neither side had any good incentive to back down. But we all have reason to hope that researchers and tech companies come to better terms. Too much is at stake for the platforms to remain a black box forever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXKREV"&gt;“You would think they would be able to distinguish between the Cambridge Analyticas of the world, and the good-faith, privacy-respecting researchers of the world,” Abdo told me. “If they can’t do that, then there really is no hope for independent research on Facebook’s platform.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k5nhyc"&gt;If Facebook can’t — or won’t — make that distinction, Congress should make it for them.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Razer will let you sign up to beta test its RGB face mask</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Sb8fAZsq82C-U1WctXeS9vpu5hs=/63x0:1530x978/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69689974/Screen_Shot_2021_08_06_at_11.01.44_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mW1VJT"&gt;Razer &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Razer/status/1423660327762374662?s=20"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt; that its lit-like-a-gaming-PC N95 mask has a new name and a beta program set up ahead of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22524990/razer-hazel-mask-first-launch-early-fourth-quarter-2021-drops"&gt;the planned fourth quarter launch&lt;/a&gt;. The futuristic-looking &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22221344/razer-project-hazel-n95-respirator-mask-coronavirus-chroma-rgb-concept"&gt;Project Hazel&lt;/a&gt; has been christened the Razer Zephyr, and you can sign up to be a beta tester &lt;a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fcampaigns%2Froad-to-zephyr%23signup&amp;amp;sharedid=theverge.com" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;right now on Razer’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oYeszY"&gt;Razer has not provided any additional information on the timing of the Zephyr’s release or when beta testers can expect to receive their masks. Based on &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RMKIkNo-QMg&amp;amp;t=22s"&gt;the video Razer shared alongside its announcement&lt;/a&gt;, beta testers might get a different mask design from what’s been shared up until this point. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kVIsG6"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMKIkNo-QMg?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=22&amp;amp;start=22" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="msCkpD"&gt;The Zephyr seems a tad wider and rounder than Razer’s original Project Hazel, and there’s a grille at the bottom of the mask that’s a lot more visible than previous images and photos have shown. It might be for additional ventilation or to assist in voice amplification, but it definitely wasn’t featured in Razer’s earlier concepts for the face mask.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZYVE6C"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; has reached out to Razer for more details on the beta program and any possible design changes that will ship alongside the Zephyr beta.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6fFKdKiVlkTC6gQz3yBL1xdRRSQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766767/zephyr_teaser_1500x1000_gallery3.jpeg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Zephyr on a real human face. Note the bottom grille.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KR6GOMeCKt3NTuyN5VZqV75liN4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22399320/QTPjtwr.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Razer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The original Project Hazel design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6hVXwt"&gt;We should have a better idea about the design once masks actually make it into beta testers’ hands, but the announcement of the program in the first place does make the Zephyr that much more real. Considering the project went from a fun CES concept to a real thing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22221344/razer-project-hazel-n95-respirator-mask-coronavirus-chroma-rgb-concept"&gt;Razer was intent on making&lt;/a&gt;, every step pushes this mask further from vaporware. Whether it’s actually affordable, enjoyable, or practical to wear is an entirely separate issue.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The FCC finally made a new broadband map of the US</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wS0eUSzhJ-Rxjc9F9g3aolzq1ms=/184x0:1750x1044/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69689876/Screen_Shot_2021_08_06_at_9.06.49_AM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: FCC&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7eTcDY"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-launches-new-mobile-broadband-map"&gt;The Federal Communications Commission has launched&lt;/a&gt; a &lt;a href="https://fcc.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=6c1b2e73d9d749cdb7bc88a0d1bdd25b"&gt;new map&lt;/a&gt; designed to show consumers what kind of cellular coverage they can expect in a given area from AT&amp;amp;T, T-Mobile, US Cellular, and Verizon. It’s been a long time coming, and it doesn’t address &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22418074/broadband-gap-america-map-county-microsoft-data"&gt;home internet availability&lt;/a&gt;, but it looks like an improvement over the agency’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17882842/us-internet-broadband-map-isp-fcc-wireless-competition"&gt;woefully inadequate and inaccurate&lt;/a&gt; past attempts to show gaps in the nation’s broadband coverage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pNVutI"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; editor-in-chief Nilay Patel &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/reckless/status/1423671191210954752?s=20"&gt;pointed out on Twitter&lt;/a&gt;, it shouldn’t have taken this long for this map to be available. The &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2020/3/bill-to-improve-broadband-data-maps-signed-into-law"&gt;law requiring that these maps be made&lt;/a&gt;, known as the Broadband Deployment Accuracy and Technological Availability (DATA) Act, was signed in March 2020, and the lack of details about broadband coverage has created confusion about the so-called digital divide for years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sL7XuU"&gt;It’s also worth noting that the map isn’t based on data that the FCC collected or crowdsourced. FCC acting chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel said in a news release that the data was provided by the carriers who don’t have a great reputation for having the most accurate picture &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22177154/us-internet-speed-maps-competition-availability-fcc"&gt;of where they do and don’t provide broadband&lt;/a&gt; (though the FCC is working on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22345533/fcc-broadband-data-collection-program-fix-the-internet"&gt;getting a better picture of home internet availability&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Consumer Reports&lt;/em&gt; are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22574103/internet-bill-equity-verge-consumer-reports-partnership"&gt;working on examining how cost-effective broadband is&lt;/a&gt;). The map also doesn’t address the issue with home internet availability, which has been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/10/6131759/i-live-in-the-us-and-i-cant-get-home-internet"&gt;a long-running concern&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Xj9r3k-UzIq5KRkXH20J0jatkc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22766633/FCC_Map_Vs.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The FCC’s map (left) versus T-Mobile (right, top), AT&amp;amp;T (right, middle), and Verizon’s (right, bottom).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="w05RVM"&gt;The interactive map lets users select which carrier’s coverage map they want to see, and it provides information about LTE coverage, voice coverage, or both. The FCC says the map is the work of its Broadband Data Task Force. The map is fairly user-friendly; instead of having to flip between &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.t-mobile.com%2Fcoverage%2Fcoverage-map&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F8%2F6%2F22613096%2Ffcc-cellular-broadband-voice-availability-map-data" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;T-Mobile&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.att.com/maps/wireless-coverage.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/verge/https://www.verizon.com/coverage-map/" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Verizon’s&lt;/a&gt; coverage maps, users can see all of the data in one place, overlaid on top of each other. The map also provides a distinction between data availability and voice availability — which is useful, as being able to make a call and being able to get online are obviously two very different things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ylnplN"&gt;One big thing the map is missing is data about 5G coverage, or really any indicator of what kind of speeds users can expect. &lt;a href="https://www.fcc.gov/news-events/notes/2021/08/06/new-mobile-map-preview-whats-come"&gt;In a note about the map’s launch&lt;/a&gt;, Rosenworcel says the network has to provide at least 5Mbps down and 1Mbps up to qualify as 4G data coverage. If one carrier provided an area with 100Mbps speeds and another provided 10Mbps speeds, that could be difficult to distinguish on the map. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="4ogxZB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Data for the map is provided by the carriers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="juNEm2"&gt;Rosenworcel also admits that this map is only a first step in the FCC’s work to improve the information available to consumers, but it’s an important one. It at least lets consumers know the minimum of what mobile coverage they should expect in a given area and gives them the tools to make more informed decisions about their cellular provider. Hopefully the FCC will be able to have a similar effort to map the availability of home internet connections in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D1pnq8"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update August 6th, 5:00PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clarified that this map doesn’t address home internet availability issues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>SEC charges crypto exchange execs for the first time over unregistered token sales</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YPzBdfjvxe1NVLbgdld5glD_SGE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69689495/GettyImages_1230723516.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An employee wearing a protective face mask inspects Sapphire Technology Ltd. AMD graphics processing units (GPU) at the Evobits crypto farm in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, on Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2021. The world’s second-most-valuable cryptocurrency, Ethereum, rallied 75 percent this year, outpacing its larger rival Bitcoin.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Akos Stiller / Bloomberg via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MWEKOa"&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission issued &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2021-145"&gt;its first charges&lt;/a&gt; against the decentralized finance industry Friday, accusing two people of illegally selling over $30 million of securities in unregistered offerings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pE6tlB"&gt;The SEC’s Friday order found that two executives from the Blockchain Credit Partners company used the Ethereum blockchain to sell cryptocurrencies to investors while misleading them about the company’s profitability. Specifically, investors purchased cryptocurrencies using digital assets like ether. The company then promised to pay investors over 6 percent in interest and that the funds would go toward physical investments like car loans to create additional income. The SEC determined that these “real-world” investments wouldn’t generate the income advertised.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="EG3zWd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Full and honest disclosure remains the cornerstone of our securities laws”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="2Rzvh0"&gt;“Full and honest disclosure remains the cornerstone of our securities laws – no matter what technologies are used to offer and sell those securities,” Gurbir S. Grewal, SEC Enforcement Division director, said in a statement Friday. “This allows investors to make informed decisions and prevents issuers from misleading the public about business operations.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JFN6po"&gt;Friday’s charges against the company come as the federal government is preparing to issue new regulations for the decentralized finance and cryptocurrency markets. Earlier this week, SEC Chair Gary Gensler &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/3/22608096/cryptocurrency-bitcoin-sec-gary-gensler-regulation"&gt;called on Congress&lt;/a&gt; to grant the agency more authority in regulating cryptocurrency, lending, and platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tbbsME"&gt;“If we don’t address these issues, I worry a lot of people will be hurt,” Gensler said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hHXhFL"&gt;Congress has so far failed to give the SEC more authority in the cryptocurrency market, opting this week to include language in the bipartisan infrastructure package focusing on taxation of digital assets. On Sunday, Senate negotiators reached a $1 trillion infrastructure deal, including language that would require cryptocurrency brokers to report transactions on their tax returns. But the definition of “broker” was vague and could potentially open miners up to greater taxation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MAWGJI"&gt;It’s unclear &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/6/22612663/infrastructure-bitcoin-tax-blockchain-proof-of-work-stake-ethereum"&gt;how cryptocurrency will fare&lt;/a&gt; under the new infrastructure bill. There are dual amendments in the Senate looking to clarify the language. An amendment authored by Sens. Ron Wyden (D-OR), Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), and Pat Toomey (R-PA) would exempt miners. Another amendment from Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) has gained more popularity amongst lawmakers, but cryptocurrency advocates fear it would hurt the industry by creating uneven reporting requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DnGF7v"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OiBAuT"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best laptop you can buy in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13, Dell XPS 15, HP Elite Dragonfly, Surface Laptop 3, MacBook Pro, and Lenovo Yoga C740." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C554ZjlwY7R1hgqzx9H7bhxKvWA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66770456/VRG_4013_Best_Laptop_Grid.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: William Joel/The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best laptops for you, from ultraportables to high-powered editing machines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="DsiiFD"&gt;The best laptop of 2021 can come with a variety of brands, prices, and features. Here, we’ve got the rest of the best laptops, Windows 10 business notebooks, gaming rigs, Chromebooks, laptops for school, and 2-in-1 convertibles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfv5g0"&gt;Our current pick for the best laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a device that does just about everything right. While it’s certainly not a perfect device, there are no major flaws. It’s a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even light gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNThzL"&gt;We live in a world where smartphones are ubiquitous, tablets are commonplace, and even smartwatches are a thing that people talk about on the regular. But throughout all of these advances, the humble laptop has persevered — and for good reason. When it comes time to work, whether that's editing photos, writing a lot of emails, composing documents, or staying in touch with colleagues and family, we’re here with our top picks to help you find the best laptop for the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31HnuI"&gt;It's getting harder to buy a bad laptop, but what separates the best laptop of 2021 from good laptops is how they balance power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. The top laptop should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad — after all, those are the two biggest reasons you'd choose a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. Its display should be easy on the eyes, bright, and sharp enough that you aren't distracted by jagged edges and visible pixels. It should be powerful enough for most anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. It should be easy to carry around from place to place, and it should be able to last all day without needing to be plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hnoYs"&gt;In our view, the best laptop for budget shoppers is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;. For a sub-$1,000 price, it delivers performance on par with much more expensive laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ABV8A"&gt;Our other picks for the best laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1s of 2021 include the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, the MacBook Pro 16, and the HP Elite Dragonfly. Check out the full list of best laptop picks below or our roundup of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22295181/best-gaming-laptop"&gt;best gaming laptops&lt;/a&gt;, if you’re looking for a powerful machine that doesn’t sacrifice portability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="4mn8ET"&gt;Best Laptops 2021&lt;/h1&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple MacBook Air is the best laptop of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best laptop of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qIDMjX"&gt;The late-2020 MacBook Air, powered by Apple’s M1 processor, is the best laptop you can buy. The base model, which includes 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage, starts at $999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYCzY0"&gt;Appearance-wise, this laptop has a lot in common with the Intel-powered MacBook Air that Apple released earlier this year, including the same 2560 x 1600 screen, Touch ID, 720p webcam, fingerprint sensor, and scissor-switch keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDDWFN"&gt;But the new processor is the star of the show here; it’s fast. In our testing, it handled intense photo- and video-editing workloads better than almost any Intel-powered laptop we’ve tried this year. It was also able to run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at close-to-playable frame rates, which is quite a feat for integrated graphics. At launch, these apps hadn’t yet been optimized for the M1 processor and were running through Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer — but they still worked fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACwNY3"&gt;And the processing power didn’t even weigh down the battery life: we got between eight and 10 hours of sustained work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XZkaRR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10220133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8eGPnz"&gt;Another benefit of the M1 processor is that it enables the MacBook Air to run iPhone and iPad apps natively on macOS. As of this writing, there still isn’t a huge selection of mobile apps available, and some that have been released aren’t quite optimized for the laptop screen. Still, it’s a benefit we can look forward to as time goes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjPO8F"&gt;Overall, there’s no reason that a general-use customer shouldn’t consider the MacBook Air. It’s a reliable device with excellent performance, as well as the excellence in build quality for which Apple is known. Power users who need a MacBook Pro probably know who they are; the Air should be fine for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Spectre x360 14 is one of the best convertible laptops you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O7mXrt"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Spectre x360 14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best Windows laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwIVn"&gt;It’s hard to come up with a single complaint about the Spectre x360 14. It’s a drop-dead gorgeous machine with a sturdy build and a premium look and feel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xL3xF1"&gt;But the Spectre x360 14 isn’t just pretty to look at: it’s also a pleasure to use as a daily work driver. Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors and Iris Xe integrated graphics deliver snappy performance with no slowdown or freezes that we observed. And we got an average of 10 hours of battery life out of the device — one of the best results we’ve ever seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfMa1S"&gt;On the outside, the Spectre includes a roomy 3:2 display, and if FHD resolution doesn’t suit your fancy, there are OLED and 1,000-nit options available. There’s even a packaged stylus, which attaches magnetically to the side of the Spectre — handy if you’re using the device as a tablet. Pretty much every other aspect of this laptop, from its comfortable keyboard and smooth touchpad to its bass-heavy audio and practical port selection, rivals or exceeds the best convertibles on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxTNW9"&gt;Such an exceptional package of features doesn’t come cheap, and many customers will find everything they need in a less expensive product. But the Spectre x360 14 is the new gold standard of Windows convertibles. Overall, it’s the best Windows laptop you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Gram 17 is the lightweight 17-inch laptop to buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best laptop in 2021 for big-screen fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ovDneV"&gt;Even if you’ve used a light laptop before, it’s difficult to explain how light the LG Gram 17 is. It has a massive 17-inch display, but it’s somehow only three pounds. Picking it up messes with your mind; you feel like you’re not holding anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbftFc"&gt;But the Gram 17’s weight isn’t the only standout feature. It also has some of the best battery life you can get, lasting over 12 hours in our testing. Add a great keyboard, a solid port selection, quiet fans, and a fast processor, and there’s very little not to like about this device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvoTCC"&gt;Not everyone needs a 17-inch display, and many folks who do are looking for a heavier-duty workstation that probably doesn’t get moved very often. But if you’d just really like a large screen for your daily office work and Netflixing, you’re the target demographic for this machine. It’s a niche, but truly impressive device without much real competition in today’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7dLyUJ"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IOuDKK"&gt;The best budget laptop in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6ONzJr"&gt;You don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a laptop that looks and feels premium. The HP Envy x360 2020 is the best budget laptop you can buy, thanks to its sturdy and compact build, chic convertible design, and excellent performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TwdF5"&gt;Part of what makes the Envy so great is that HP has ported over a number of elements from its excellent 2019 flagship, the Spectre x360, including the thin-and-light chassis and nearly bezel-free display with an 88 percent screen-to-body ratio. The touchscreen (which supports HP’s MPP2.0 pen) is bright and looks great. (You can choose a 300-nit, 400-nit, or 1,000-nit panel). And HP has added a row of convenient hotkeys to the keyboard, including kill switches for the microphone and webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRbztF"&gt;But the most exciting feature is inside: the new Envy x360 is powered by AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series. The Ryzen 5-4500U in my model did an outstanding job with a fairly heavy load of multitasking. And AMD’s integrated Radeon graphics delivered good gaming performance comparable to what you’d expect from a lower-powered discrete GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best MacBook Pro for everyday users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yUbRrT"&gt;If you’re looking to buy an M1 MacBook for heavier workloads, you’ll want to look at the late-2020 MacBook Pro. It starts at $1,299, which is $300 more than the late-2020 MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNImzP"&gt;The MacBook Pro has a slightly different design and look than the Air, as well as a few additional features like the Touch Bar. But the two have the same processor. The main difference is that the Pro includes a fan (the Air is fanless), which means it can sustain heavy workloads for a longer period of time without needing to throttle its performance. But you won’t notice much of a performance difference between the two MacBooks unless you’re routinely pushing heavy tasks for long periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USngRn"&gt;If that’s you, though, go for the Pro. We were able to run a number of hefty Premiere Pro exports and didn’t see a dip in times. The Pro also achieved a significantly higher score than the Air in a 30-minute loop of Cinebench R23; the scores were closer together after a single run. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is the best convertible you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NKt5f4"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;A great 2-in-1 laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iLNMXR"&gt;If you’re looking for a convertible laptop that does just about everything right, we recommend Dell’s latest XPS 13 2-in-1. It features a sturdy and well-made chassis, a nearly bezel-free 16:10 touch display, and Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dghfZI"&gt;The base model, for $1,099, includes a Core i3-1154G4, 8GB of RAM, a 1920 x 1200 display, and a 256GB SSD. You can spec that up to a 3840 x 2400 display, a Core i7-1165G7, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. There are various add-ons as well: you can pay $50 extra for a white model and $60 to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. Basically, there’s something for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEAGgI"&gt;Dell has made a few minor tweaks to the 2-in-1 since last year’s model. The webcam now supports Windows Hello, and the RAM and microSD reader have been upgraded. But the exciting news is the new chip and, in particular, Intel’s new integrated graphics. The XPS 13 2-in-1 did a better job than any 10th Gen laptop with an iGPU on our Adobe Premiere Pro export test. And you can even play some games on this thing: it broke 60fps on &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and even managed 36fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at its lowest settings. That’s an improvement over the results we saw from 10th Gen systems, and it also beats some 11th Gen systems (including the clamshell Dell XPS 13). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izx3w7"&gt;Of course, it’s not perfect. The port selection is limited (as is customary for modern XPS models) and the keyboard is a bit flat for my taste. But overall, the 2-in-1 excels on the fundamentals: build quality, display, performance, and battery life. What more could you want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best laptop for college&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6xPrkB"&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is a compact and reliable laptop. Its beautiful chassis, excellent 16:10 display, and great performance make it an excellent choice for general-purpose users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik0URk"&gt;This late-2020 model comes with Intel’s new Tiger Lake processors, from a Core i3-1154G4 up to a Core i7-1165G7. It starts at $999, so it’s a bit cheaper than the 2-in-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZCO5H"&gt;My review unit (an i7 model) blew through the work tasks I needed it to do without any slowdown or heat. It did quite well, and handily beat its 10th Gen predecessor in both gaming and media work. It didn’t do as well as the XPS 13 2-in-1, which is why that model is ranked higher on this list. But if you like the look and feel of the XPS 13 and would prefer a clamshell model (or need a bouncier keyboard), this XPS is still a great option. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uN3gSr"&gt;There’s an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22528646/dell-xps-13-oled-2021-review-screen-specs-price"&gt;OLED model&lt;/a&gt; of the XPS 13 as well, which costs $300 more than the FHD model. This model has worse battery life, but does deliver a stunning picture. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;The best gaming laptop in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2eqQM4"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not compromising performance for that portability. The G15 is powered by the top mobile chips AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and pairs thim with a fast 165Hz QHD display. In our testing, the system was able to handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxthwN"&gt;Almost everything else about the G15 is great too: the audio sounds good, the keyboard and touchpad are some of the best on the market, the port selection has just about everything you’d need, and the battery can last over eight and a half hours to a charge. If you’re looking for a high-powered gaming machine that also works great as a daily driver, the Zephyrus G15 should be at the top of your list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TA1Mem"&gt;The best laptop for business travel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XTubRZ"&gt;In many ways, the ThinkPad X1 Nano is a run-of-the-mill ThinkPad. It’s got a solid sturdy chassis, discrete clickers, a physical privacy shutter, a red TrackPoint in the middle of the keyboard, and all kinds of business-specific security and management features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdGWMd"&gt;But the Nano is special because it’s the lightest ThinkPad Lenovo has ever made. It’s also one of the lightest laptops you can buy, at just 1.99 pounds. You’re not sacrificing performance to get that mindblowing weight: The Nano kept up with our heavy testing workloads without any fan noise or noticeable heat. If you’re looking for a reliable business laptop that will feel like nothing in your briefcase, this is the one for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="pLq6K9"&gt;The best 14-inch gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="FBMA49"&gt;The Zephyrus G14 is an astonishingly powerful gaming laptop for a low price (relative to other notebooks with comparable hardware). It pairs AMD’s new Ryzen 9 4900HS with an Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q GPU and a 120HZ display, and it can run demanding games at their highest settings without a problem. It’s also quite light for such a powerful laptop, weighing just over 3.5 pounds. Its battery life is also impressive for a gaming rig; we got almost nine hours of multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWOpxK"&gt;But you don’t need to be a gamer to appreciate the Zephyrus G14. It’s also a great notebook for business and everyday multitasking with a unique retro design. Plus, the keyboard and touchpad are exceptional and quiet enough not to bother officemates. On the flip side, if you need to use your laptop for videoconferences, the G14 would not be a great choice, as it lacks a webcam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2WSPjS"&gt;A great choice for Mac power users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TfAFYg"&gt;The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the best Apple laptop for power users. Apple dealt with the biggest complaints that people have historically had about MacBook Pros, and if you can stomach the price, there’s not a lot else to complain about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIH5ZZ"&gt;Most importantly, the keyboard is good again. The keys have a full millimeter of travel, and while the typing experience isn’t exceptional, it’s a world away from the maligned butterfly keyboard of MacBooks past. It’s fairly quiet, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjExSY"&gt;This MacBook also features the best sound you’ll find on a laptop. Apple has crammed three speakers into each side, including two woofers. The result is balanced audio with audible bass and great stereo separation. For those who need a laptop that can crank through editing video, working with multiple audio tracks, or processing large batches of photos, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is the king of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XU9ktC"&gt;12. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/9/21247274/hp-elite-dragonfly-2020-review-tile-test-specs-price-features"&gt;HP Elite Dragonfly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="t0EL7n"&gt;The best business laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MrOD1p"&gt;If you’re a business professional and money is no object for you or your company, you can’t do better than the HP Elite Dragonfly. The 2020 model is the first Dragonfly that features HP’s super-secure SureView Reflect technology, which tints the screen so that snoops can’t see what you’re doing while you’re working in public. When it’s not tinted, the display gets quite bright (over 700 nits) and has great viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzVcoU"&gt;The new Dragonfly is also the first laptop to include a built-in Tile tracker. That means if you lose the device, you can use the Tile smartphone app to set off an alarm (if it’s in Bluetooth range) or locate it anywhere in the world using Tile’s crowd-finding network. The tracker can work for a limited time even when the laptop is off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXS6n7"&gt;Almost everything else about the Dragonfly is good; it has some of the best battery life of any laptop on the market (we got over 11 hours), a sleek and stunning 2-in-1 design, and an exceptional keyboard. Plus, it incorporates sustainable material, including ocean-bound plastics and recycled DVDs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEHKpz"&gt;The Dragonfly is pricey, and there are cheaper business laptops that will suit the needs of most professionals just fine. But if you’re looking for the best of the best, it’s the unambiguous winner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WpIKDR"&gt;The best laptop for students&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5khaPj"&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is a great convertible laptop for kids, or anyone who wants a reliable secondary driver for browsing and games. It’s a nice-looking, well-made 10-inch device that comes with a detachable keyboard and kickstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV5DZN"&gt;The Duet is tailor-made to be used around the house and on the go, weighing just 2.03 pounds and delivering over 11 hours of battery life. Its MediaTek processor isn’t designed to shoulder heavy loads, but it’s just fine for browsing in a couple tabs, watching Netflix, or playing Android games — it even handles photo editing pretty well. The Duet also features a new “tablet mode” for Chrome OS, which supports an Android-inspired gesture navigation system and a unique Chrome layout optimized for tablet use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiBrWO"&gt;The Chromebook Duet is an absolute steal for its low price, and is the Chromebook to buy if you’re on a tight budget. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Book 13 proves that Razer is cut out for more than just gaming rigs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="g8zMV8"&gt;14. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287698/razer-book-13-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Razer Book 13&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sky6IZ"&gt;A stylish, powerful productivity laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1AVfKp"&gt;Razer is best known for its gaming laptops, but the company is making a big splash in the business and productivity space with its new Razer Book 13. At 0.6 inches thick and 3.09 pounds, the Book 13 is a portable workstation with a gorgeous and sturdy aluminum build. It features a good port selection including Thunderbolt 4, USB-A, HDMI 2.0 and a microSD slot, and it’s one of very few non-gaming laptops out there to come with a per-key RGB keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAI01n"&gt;On the inside, this laptop is even more impressive. Its powerful chip did better than any other Windows laptop of its size on our Premiere Pro media export test. And while the Book 13 isn’t a gaming laptop, it delivers some of the best gaming performance I’ve ever seen from integrated graphics — it can even run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; over 30fps. While the Razer Book 13’s high price means it won’t be ideal for everyone, it’s still an outstanding laptop all around, combining a high-quality chassis with powerful productivity performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DdByBe"&gt;The best multimedia laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="3TMlQz"&gt;Most thin and light laptops share one significant weakness — thin, tinny audio. That’s not the case with the Lenovo Yoga 9i. This 14-inch convertible has a rotating soundbar in its hinge, meaning that no matter how it’s positioned, the speakers face outwards. You can expect clear, booming sound whether you’re using the 9i in tablet, tent, or clamshell mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bd1MYR"&gt;There’s a lot more to like as well. You get an excellent 1080p touch display and a built-in stylus for easy artwork and note-taking. The 11th-Gen processors deliver satisfactory performance and all-day battery life. The audio quality, screen, and convertible form factor all add up to an unbeatable machine for multimedia entertainment. &lt;/p&gt;
