    <title>Digital cash gets a look from the Fed  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="In this photo illustration the United States of America flag seen on a phone with dollar bills behind it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4hrZYJ6xvWFnUYSrhd3t38xJTjw=/0x15:5000x3348/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70419080/1232471340.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xi87gQ"&gt;A digital dollar backed by the US government might lead to faster money transfers, and be more accessible than the current banking system, according to &lt;a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/money-and-payments-discussion-paper.htm"&gt;a new paper from the Federal Reserve&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/20/fed-releases-long-awaited-study-on-a-digital-dollar-but-doesnt-take-a-position-yet-on-creating-one.html"&gt;via CNBC&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8FWPcp"&gt;The paper is meant to act as “the first step in a discussion,” and doesn’t advocate for actually creating a “central bank digital currency” (or CBDC). Still, the creation of a digital dollar would be a massive shift in how big a role the government would play in our finances. Potential downsides could include making commercial banks less attractive to consumers, and affect the Fed’s ability to influence the financial system. &lt;a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/forms/cbdc"&gt;The Fed is now inviting comments&lt;/a&gt;, including on anything the paper may have missed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nSOAHd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There are many other countries and tech firms working in the space the US is considering entering&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nwHVpK"&gt;The paper, a step toward the existence of a digital dollar, comes at a time when around 90 other countries are considering their own digital currencies, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/fed-lays-out-risks-benefits-cbdc-paper-takes-no-policy-stance-2022-01-20/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The European Central Bank is investigating the creation of a digital Euro, and China has been testing a digital yuan, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/4/22866757/china-digital-currency-yuan-iphone-android-apps"&gt;which it’s been working on since 2014&lt;/a&gt;. Meanwhile in the cryptocurrency world, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22757899/us-treasury-stablecoins-regulated-banks-cryptocurrency-yellen-congress"&gt;stablecoins&lt;/a&gt;, some of which tie their value to the US dollar, have been rising in prominence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zdr0w6"&gt;The government is also looking to keep supporting “the dominant international role of the U.S. dollar,” as the paper puts it. Doing its research in public could help the government make it easier for other companies to design systems compatible with the US’s, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-20/fed-takes-key-step-forward-in-deciding-on-digital-coin-issuance"&gt;as &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; points out&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="63XZ6W"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"US Treasury says stablecoins should be regulated like banks","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/1/22757899/us-treasury-stablecoins-regulated-banks-cryptocurrency-yellen-congress"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="pPwC9T"&gt;A digital currency from the central bank could combine some of the benefits of federally-backed cash and privately-controlled digital money, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="FbqP7R"&gt;Fast and easy transfers between people and businesses (even across borders)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nbA79x"&gt;More accessibility for people without bank accounts, who may have difficulties opening accounts at private financial institutions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="nKXJlr"&gt;More safety and consumer confidence — banks can fail or run into liquidity issues, which is less likely with the US government&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="p0Yf2V"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A federal digital currency could massively change the role of the government in our financial lives, depending on its design&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="LOHA3t"&gt;There’s also the potential downsides: the government would have to navigate the market’s reaction to the US taking over a role traditionally served by commercial banks. It would also require citizens to trust the government directly with all their financial info, though the paper does vaguely say this concern could be mitigated by allowing “intermediaries” to address privacy concerns “by leveraging existing tools.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KhES6T"&gt;A digital currency doesn’t have to be blockchain-based. The Fed, in its paper, makes clear that no specific design or technology has been proposed yet, saying it “will continue to explore a wide range of design options.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rbj1eT"&gt;If the central bank were to create a digital currency, it would have to be “privacy-protected, intermediated, widely transferable, and identity-verified,” according to the paper. The reserve is currently experimenting with and exploring centralized, blockchain, and distributed methods of making a currency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OKB74w"&gt;If you’re interested in the future of money, the paper is well worth a read. And if you’ve got expertise or strong opinions about it, you’ll have plenty of room to express them while &lt;a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/apps/forms/cbdc"&gt;going through the 22-point questionnaire&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s where you can buy a Nintendo Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6VMwDr75Sm_0F9dPNdugxlOlu6w=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66793958/switcholedmodel.11.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nintendo Switch OLED model boasts a vibrant, 7-inch display and slate of minor upgrades.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YIrWef"&gt;The Nintendo Switch was, like most consoles during the pandemic, once in short supply. Thankfully, retailers like Best Buy, Amazon, and Walmart now routinely stock the Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite in multiple color configurations and models, giving those who struck out ample opportunity to purchase Nintendo’s versatile console.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DW6Flb"&gt;We’re keeping an eye across the web to find where you can buy a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/1/14772530/nintendo-switch-review-zelda-breath-of-the-wild"&gt;Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/9/19/20873717/nintendo-switch-lite-review-price-specs-features-games-launch-date"&gt;Nintendo Switch Lite&lt;/a&gt; (the portable-only version of the console), and the new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22569208/nintendo-switch-oled-model-hands-on-screen"&gt;Nintendo Switch OLED model&lt;/a&gt;, as well as any bundles that seem like good deals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="ToUhxJ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo 64 games on Nintendo Switch are not too up to snuff","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/26/22746897/nintendo-switch-online-n64-emulation-quality-bad"},{"title":"Nintendo says its next ‘gaming system’ will release in the year 20XX","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/5/22765498/nintendo-next-gaming-system-console-release-year-switch-oled"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="armnCG"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qcOiY9"&gt;Over at Amazon, you can buy an &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YMM3RHZ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;updated Nintendo Switch model with gray Joy-Cons&lt;/a&gt;, plus a 64GB SanDisk microSD card, for $312.49 ($7.49 off). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="CuDXeZ"&gt;If you’re looking for more storage, Amazon is offering two additional bundles, one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YBVJRD7?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;128GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $319.95&lt;/a&gt;, a $15 discount, and one with a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07YMJ4XBP/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;256GB SanDisk MicroSD card for $340.74&lt;/a&gt;, a $10 discount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="Ueoxw3"&gt;If you prefer to pick up the standalone console, you can purchase the updated Nintendo Switch with red and blue Joy-Cons for around $299 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Neon-Blue-Joy%E2%80%91/dp/B07VGRJDFY/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgsDUQOgC4Y" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/768290/2092?subId1=VergeNintendoSwitch072321&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fnintendo-switch-with-neon-blue-and-neon-red-joy-con%2F-%2FA-77464001" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Target&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="feP6W8"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons/dp/B084DDDNRP?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; Edition&lt;/a&gt; of the Nintendo Switch is also available for purchase from Amazon for $299.99.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="fiSvia"&gt;If you’re not against buying a preowned or refurbished console, you’ll want to check out &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;u1=%5B%5Dvg%5Bp%5D21021684%5Bt%5Dw%5Bd%5DD&amp;amp;murl=https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/switch/consoles/products/nintendo-switch-with-gray-joy-con/206007.html?gclid=CjwKCAiAt9z-BRBCEiwA_bWv-HzeKt4-dsaWdi9G9SGmxFTUUEAxrCA4NxZS0xEWCkIacwTZ_cUKPRoCEYUQAvD_BwE&amp;amp;gclsrc=aw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://store.nintendo.com/nintendo-switch/systems.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo’s online store&lt;/a&gt;, where you can often find deals on refurbished Switch consoles. Right now, for instance, GameStop is selling first and second-gen models for up to $20 off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="MZwBhp"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10988261"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="lxqTuB"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch Lite right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="6ustqv"&gt;The Nintendo Switch Lite has a lot in common with the standard Switch, aside from a few key differences. The Lite only functions as a handheld console — meaning you can’t hook it up to your TV — and it’s smaller, lighter, and sturdier than its dockable counterpart. It also features a D-pad and can play all the same games, except those that require detachable Joy-Con controllers (which are very few). Regardless, it's a great handheld system for those who prefer to game on the go.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="ZaaYGt"&gt;Best Buy is currently the only retailer carrying the Nintendo Switch Lite as a standalone console. Right now, you can pick it up in &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1732099797003183412" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;pink for $199.99&lt;/a&gt;, its standard retail price.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="LipduJ"&gt;If you don’t mind paying for a bundle, Adorama is selling the turquoise &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/1181395/1036?subId1=TheVergeWhereToFindNintendoSwitch1202022&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fnihdhsbazaak.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo Switch Lite with &lt;em&gt;Animal Crossing: New Horizons&lt;/em&gt; and a 128GB microSD card for $289.99&lt;/a&gt;. If you prefer a title, the &lt;a href="https://adorama.rfvk.net/c/482924/107512/1036?subId1=VergeBestNintendoSwitchDeals012122&amp;amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.adorama.com%2Fnihdhsbazaae.html" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;same bundle is available with &lt;em&gt;Metroid Dread&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;for $293.97.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div id="WRh9AR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10616596"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Nintendo Switch with OLED screen" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/YzjT6iua8IRxp8FH9VRp8hphoeg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701274/newswitch_kickstand.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Nintendo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tL1zU6"&gt;Where can I buy a Nintendo Switch OLED right now?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FefR8R"&gt;The Nintendo Switch OLED &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;officially went on sale in October&lt;/a&gt; for $349.99, and offers a slew of improvements, most notably a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/7/22566479/oled-nintendo-switch-vs-lite-screen-size" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;vibrant 7-inch OLED display&lt;/a&gt; and an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564942/nintendo-switch-oled-screen-new-kickstand" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;improved kickstand&lt;/a&gt; that offers far greater stability. The speakers get a bit louder and offer a touch more clarity, too, and there’s a wired ethernet port built directly into the dock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ThJrec"&gt;While the supply is starting to catch up with demand, no major retailer is currently selling the Nintendo Switch OLED model at the time of this writing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="iPj5B1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nintendo Switch OLED review: screentime","url":"https://www.theverge.com/games/22711889/nintendo-switch-oled-review"},{"title":"10 great games for your new Switch OLED","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22785298/nintendo-switch-best-games-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h2 id="8hV7z9"&gt;What accessories do I need to buy for the Nintendo Switch?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="hgAR00"&gt;Frankly, the Switch comes with everything that you need to get started and have fun. However, a few extra purchases can help you get a little more out of your console, and in some cases, help it weather the wear and tear that it’ll undoubtedly endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jnXhNd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9556339"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9sHCpf"&gt;First off, a microSD card will help you extend your Switch’s default 32GB of storage, especially with each game ranging in download size from 1GB to tens of gigabytes. At Amazon, a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-512GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GYG5SVQ/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;400GB microSD card will currently cost you around $43.49&lt;/a&gt;, which is nearly 40 percent off the typical price retail price. SanDisk’s microSD cards are also on sale in other size configurations, including a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HCHS64Y?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;200GB model for $24.99&lt;/a&gt;, which is still large enough that you should have little trouble storing several titles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Agp45r"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10397609"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QGdvLy"&gt;Let’s talk quickly about controllers. The Switch Joy-Cons have a somewhat unconventional look. Nevertheless, the Pro Controller is a great alternative to play most Switch games, though some Super Mario Party titles require the Joy-Cons to play. If you are looking for a Switch Pro Controller, &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Pro-Controller/dp/B01NAWKYZ0/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=24348&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fnintendo-switch%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fproducts%2Fnintendo-switch-black-wireless-pro-controller%2F141756.html%3Fgclid%3DCj0KCQjw0emHBhC1ARIsAL1QGNchiWTVbB56sBuEbLjc76K169WZpHUSFCnyWf2W_sbAwyKf3XbqzX0aAiS9EALw_wcB%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;GameStop&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/cgdocaWxzJq" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt; all currently have the controller available for around $69, which is basically the full MSRP.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2BZPIqmUqpLcZoV5GVxdxMULT3I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9537475/akrales_171025_2091_0010.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Switch doesn’t include a screen protector, so make that one of the first things you buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="UODwlY"&gt;Next up, get a tempered glass screen cover. The display on the Switch and Switch Lite is covered in plastic, and it’s just asking to get scratched as soon as you take it out of the box. Save the heartbreak by getting an affordable, easy-to-apply glass cover at Amazon. Right now, for example, you can pick up &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Orzly-Screen-Protectors-compatible-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B01N9RG3XS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;two Orzly glass screen protectors for $9.61.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cx5X9k"&gt;If you want to play online with friends, ensure your data is backed up to the cloud, and get access to a slate of on-demand games from the original Nintendo console and SNES console era, you’ll want to get a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07FV64QLX?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;It’s $19.99 per year for a single user&lt;/a&gt; on a console or &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07KY69YFM/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;$34.99 a year for up to eight users on different consoles&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="naXpZC"&gt;For those looking for more retro gaming, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/15/22728113/nintendo-switch-online-plus-expansion-pack-price-n64-genesis-animal-crossing" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Nintendo recently introduced&lt;/a&gt; the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription tier, which provides access to classic Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis games for an annual fee. An &lt;a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/US/en/membership" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;individual subscription will run you $49.99 a year&lt;/a&gt;, while a &lt;a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/US/en/membership" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;shared family plan will cost you $79.99 a year&lt;/a&gt;. The list of available games is continually growing, but it currently includes the likes of &lt;em&gt;Golden Axe&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Banjo-Kazooie,&lt;/em&gt; and a host of other popular titles from the heyday of both consoles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QMTTL1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10422489"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;aside id="STKJng"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="newsletter" data-anthem-component-data='{"slug":"deals"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="YFtcY7"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;The NLRB will issue a formal complaint against Amazon unless it settles a case with a fired worker | Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3sFsEV"&gt;The National Labor Relations Board is preparing to issue a complaint against Amazon alleging the company illegally fired a worker at one of its New York warehouses, unless the company settles the case first. At issue is whether Daequan Smith, an organizer with the newly-formed Amazon Labor Union (ALU), was fired for trying to organize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NRStdr"&gt;As first reported by&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-01-21/amazon-activist-s-firing-deemed-illegal-by-labor-board-officials?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, NLRB spokesperson Kayla Blado confirmed Friday that the agency’s regional director Kathy Drew King determined allegations by the ALU that Smith was fired illegally had merit and would issue a complaint if the case doesn’t settle. “The complaint would allege a discharge because of union and other protected concerted activities, among other allegations,” Blado said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j23qu2"&gt;Amazon didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bq97n0"&gt;The ALU Is awaiting a hearing on its petition to hold a union election at four of Amazon’s warehouses in Staten Island. Smith was a worker at one of the Staten Island warehouses, and the &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amazonlabor/status/1484638708867514371?s=20"&gt;ALU tweeted Friday &lt;/a&gt;that since his firing, Smith has been left homeless. The NLRB has the authority to reinstate workers fired for organizing, but it’s not yet clear whether it would do so in this case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qN9VNi"&gt;The NLRB ordered Amazon to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22598004/nlrb-officer-new-election-amazon-bessemer-union-drive"&gt;redo a union election&lt;/a&gt; at its warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, after finding the company interfered in the first election in April 2021. That redo, which will be carried out by mail and supervised by the NLRB, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878457/amazon-bessemer-alabama-union-election-redo-february-fourth"&gt;begins February 4th&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>American Airlines suing The Points Guy over app that syncs frequent flyer data</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="American Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner In Greece" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V3wLJqz4cfJysZGTPqocDaC5VbI=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70418633/1235127494.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;American Airlines is suing The Points Guy | Photo by Nicolas Economou/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Bhiueg"&gt;American Airlines has filed a lawsuit against travel tips site The Points Guy, claiming the site has violated the terms of use of its frequent flyer program by offering an app that lets users track airline miles from multiple airlines in one place. It’s seeking an order blocking The Points Guy from accessing or using American Airlines customer data and from allowing its users to access their own accounts through the TPG app or site. American is also seeking to block The Points Guy from displaying the American Airlines logo and other trademarks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="piDCfi"&gt;The TPG app, released in September 2021, purports to “&lt;a href="https://apnews.com/press-release/pr-newswire/lifestyle-technology-travel-media-d1458a6ca22c62f0946c1767f1a884ed"&gt;help users learn about points, miles, and loyalty programs&lt;/a&gt;, while maximizing their earning potential, and discovering how to efficiently burn those earned points and miles to see the world.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypStN8"&gt;The app allows users to link together different frequent flyer accounts. In the case of American Airlines, the TPG app prompts you in-app to enter your AAdvantage number, your password, and your last name. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s0TVr4"&gt;The lawsuit filed by American Airlines alleges that the TPG app encourages members of its AAdvantage program to breach its terms of use en masse by handing over their user logins to an unauthorized third party. The airline says the logins allow The Points Guy to “invade American’s servers, access users’ accounts, and collect and expropriate the proprietary data” in violation of American’s terms and conditions. The complaint accuses The Points Guy of violating the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, an anti-hacking statute, by doing so. In addition, the suit trots out a litany of other offenses, such as breach of contract, trespass, trademark infringement, and copyright infringement (for displaying the American Airlines logo). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="sqaz7D"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The airline says the logins allow The Points Guy to “invade American’s servers”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MZfxSr"&gt;American Airlines representative Amanda Koos said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that The Points Guy parent company Red Ventures “is accessing AA.com and AAdvantage customer account data in a way that does not comply with our standards for use of confidential information.” She added that American Airlines takes “customer data and proprietary information incredibly seriously, and want to make sure it is protected and secure.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A6QFvO"&gt;The Points Guy preemptively sued American Airlines in Delaware after receiving a cease-and-desist letter from the airline, according to a &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/the-points-guy-fights-back-against-american-airlines-to-bring-cost-and-time-saving-tool-to-consumers-301464841.html"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt;, claiming the airline was “attempting to block the media platform from providing the cost and time-saving benefits of The Points Guy App to consumers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JRx097"&gt;“Consumers are always in control of their own data on The Points Guy App — they decide which loyalty programs and credit cards are accessible for the purpose of making their points-and-miles journey easier,” The Points Guy founder Brian Kelly said in a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The site is “choosing to fight back against American Airlines on behalf of travelers to protect their rights to access their points and miles so they can travel smarter,” he added. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cgGPzZ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asked The Points Guy in an email whether the TPG app stores AAdvantage passwords and have not yet received a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fdaa855a892c74b6e00091c92b957a14"&gt;American Airlines is asking the courts to enjoin The Points Guy from allowing users to log in to AAdvantage through the TPG app or website and also from storing AAdvantage passwords and other member information. It is also seeking to legally block The Points Guy from displaying American’s “copyrighted material” — that is to say, the American Airlines logo. The lawsuit requests statutory damages for the trademark and copyright violations and additional unspecified damages to include any “‘ill-gotten revenues and benefits” that The Points Guy may have gained from American’s customers and their data. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WWMSjj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>We’re happy to inform you that Apple isn’t requiring verification for education discounts anymore</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/50TLf-UapZYpyPMwke4yaxsqkbw=/0x0:1768x1179/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70415567/billboard_202101_intro.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Apple&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GIASYa"&gt;At &lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20220108032348/https://www.apple.com/us-edu/store"&gt;some point in the last month&lt;/a&gt;, Apple introduced a new verification process in the US that tried to ensure customers who want to benefit from its discounted education pricing are actually involved in education. Now Apple has removed the verification process, as confirmed in tests by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, and backed up by reports from &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2022/01/21/apple-no-education-verification-requirement/?utm_source=feedly&amp;amp;utm_medium=webfeeds"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2022/01/21/apple-education-store-verification-removed/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Mac&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. When it was in place, customers had to verify that they actually qualified for an education discount using Unidays’ third-party verification service. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y55hu8"&gt;It’s possible that the verification requirement, which was &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/s7g5t6/apple_education_store_now_requires_unidays_and/"&gt;spotted by Reddit users&lt;/a&gt;, will return. Apple already has verification processes in place in other countries, &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/shop/education-pricing?afid=p238%7Cs5Jg5FlGg-dc_mtid_187079nc38483_pcrid_349151339418_pgrid_15144757333_&amp;amp;cid=aos-uk-kwgo-edu%E2%80%94slid%E2%80%94bran-product-"&gt;like the UK&lt;/a&gt;. The company didn’t immediately respond to&lt;em&gt; The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s request for comment on whether the verification requirement’s removal was temporary. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="VQhQZD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Matching a similar policy in the UK&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MOJnNg"&gt;Customers have also noticed Apple placing new limits on how many items you can buy with an educational discount. &lt;a href="https://appletrack.com/apple-tightens-education-discounts-with-account-verification-and-purchase-limits/?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_campaign=twitter"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Track&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt; that users are limited to one desktop computer, one Mac mini, one laptop, two iPads, and two accessories per year. (These limits are &lt;a href="https://www.apple.com/us-edu/shop/browse/open/salespolicies/edu"&gt;still listed on Apple’s site&lt;/a&gt;, despite verification being gone.) Given that it’s more than any student, teacher, or educational staff member is likely to purchase for themselves in a given year, the limit seems to be in place to stop them from acting as a discount broker for all their non-education friends. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZrydR"&gt;Although the change (potentially temporarily) removed a loophole that was previously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/3/27/17169108/apple-education-discount-how-to-new-ipad"&gt;ridiculously easy&lt;/a&gt; to exploit — apparently Apple didn’t even require customers to have a .edu email address — there was surprisingly little outcry over on Reddit, with some pointing out that Apple’s first-party discounts are often beaten by third-party retailers during back to school season. Meanwhile, if you’re looking for a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"&gt;good deal on a MacBook&lt;/a&gt;, we’ve got a page dedicated to that exact purpose &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22399419/apple-macbook-air-pro-mac-mini-imac-deals"&gt;right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KvMGC0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 21st, 4:58PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Updated to reflect that the Unidays’ verification seems to have been removed from Apple’s US education store.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ozzy Osbourne’s NFT project shared a scam link, and followers lost thousands of dollars</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IxRQSsGElGfFuha6INqOMfs2eos=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70417902/acastro_210329_1777_nft_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="3r0BJf"&gt;When a pop-cultural icon like Ozzy Osbourne announces an NFT collection, you can count on the project getting publicity. The launch of the “CryptoBatz” collection, a series of 9,666 digital bats, received coverage in outlets like &lt;a href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/ozzy-osbourne-nfts-cryptobatz-collection-1235014292/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Billboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/exclusive-ozzy-osbourne-announces-nfts-cryptobatz-collection-1276535/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nme.com/news/music/ozzy-osbourne-nft-cryptobatz-collection-preview-video-watch-3135108"&gt;&lt;em&gt;NME&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://hypebeast.com/2021/12/ozzy-ozbourne-cryptobatz-nft-project-info"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hypebeast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/currencies/ozzy-osbourne-nft-collection-cryptobatz-market-concert-1982-tokens-crypto-2021-12"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, among others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K6l8Q7"&gt;But just two days after the tokens were minted, supporters are being targeted by a phishing scam that drains cryptocurrency from their wallets, playing off a bad link shared by the project’s official Twitter account.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ORQRMp"&gt;Like the majority of NFT projects, CryptoBatz uses Discord as a place to organize its community. The official CryptoBatz Discord is now accessed through the short link &lt;a href="https://t.co/c8bUinn1LN"&gt;discord.gg/cryptobatz&lt;/a&gt;. But previously, the project used a slightly different vanity URL at discord.gg/cryptobatznft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IYLOl9"&gt;When the project switched to the new URL, scammers set up a fake Discord server at the old one. But neither CryptoBatz nor Ozzy Osbourne took the precaution of deleting tweets referencing the previous URL, meaning that old tweets from Osbourne himself were left directing followers to a server now controlled by scammers.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Ozzy Osbourne tweet containing link to a scam Discord" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9DS7fG2QgZjZ94QWRwxRv2EbybY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23185024/Osbourne_tweet.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="HgCmeA"&gt;One tweet from CryptoBatz, posted on December 31st, 2021, received more than 4,000 retweets and hundreds of replies. The tweet was only removed on January 21st after CryptoBatz was contacted by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Cryptobatz tweet containing link to a scam Discord" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5rKGTUmjVGiOa0t8kQqpJ8xia0k=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23185029/cryptobatz_tweet.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tOnZFC"&gt;On clicking the scam link, the invite panel for the fake Discord showed the total number of members as 1,330, an indication of the number of people who could potentially have been fooled by the scam.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LF6C35"&gt;Inside the server, a bot spoofing community management service Collab Land asked users to verify their crypto assets to participate in the server — but directed users to a phishing site where they were prompted to connect their cryptocurrency wallets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tY91Ky"&gt;A representative of Collab Land declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Fake Collab Land bot" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LB5IFndoKg55MIA9Rmt9dMY24Ms=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23185140/scam_bot.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D2rK2G"&gt;Tim Silman, a nonprofit employee, is one person who lost money through the scam. Silman estimates that around $300–400 in ETH was drained from his wallet after he visited the fake Discord server through a link posted on the CryptoBatz website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yGv7by"&gt;“I’ve seen at least a dozen people on Twitter voicing this same issue,” Silman told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “If you look at the transactions on Etherscan, others lost a lot more than me.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hj6mgB"&gt;An &lt;a href="https://etherscan.io/address/0xdfbd08a29967f13cc2c143f0e8b71aea6dec3ecb"&gt;Ethereum wallet address&lt;/a&gt; Silman indicated was linked to the scammers had received a series of incoming transactions totaling 14.6 ETH ($40,895) on January 20th and sent it onwards to a wallet containing more than $150,000.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T34cji"&gt;The project had been slow to remove the bad links, even when informed, Silman said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8lQCBk"&gt;“I tagged them a few times in various tweets, as have a few other people, but no response,” he said. “This is an expensive lesson, I suppose.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pilF2B"&gt;Even as the fake link remained present in a prominent tweet, the CryptoBatz project continued to hype the public token mint. As of January 21st, CryptoBatz NFTs were being &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/collection/cryptobatz-by-ozzy-osbourne"&gt;resold on OpenSea&lt;/a&gt; for around 1.8 ETH ($5,046).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="K0XNWu"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“This is an expensive lesson I suppose”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ivFQfY"&gt;Asked whether the project should accept responsibility for leaving the old link online, Sutter Systems, developers of the CryptoBatz NFT, laid blame for the scam squarely with Discord. In an email statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, Sutter Systems co-founder “Jepeggi” emphasized that the compromise was only possible because of the easy setup and maintenance of the scam Discord instance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FuiRPa"&gt;“Although we feel very sorry for the people that have fallen prey to these scams, we cannot take responsibility for the actions of scammers exploiting Discord — a platform that we have absolutely no control over,” Jepeggi said. “In our opinion this situation and hundreds of others that have taken place across other projects in the NFT space could have easily been prevented if Discord just had a better response/support/fraud team in place to help big projects like ours.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L1ocR8"&gt;Discord said that it was aware of the incident and in contact with the affected team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GatYgw"&gt;“Our Trust &amp;amp; Safety team is in touch with the server owners and are investigating the incident,” said Peter Day, senior manager for corporate communications at Discord. “Our team takes action when we become aware of attacks like this one, including banning users and shutting down servers.”&lt;/p&gt;

While first trailer for &lt;a href="https://paramountplus.qflm.net/c/482924/175360/3065?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paramountplus.com%2Fshows%2Fstar-trek-picard%2F&amp;amp;subid1=VergePicard012122"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Picard&lt;/em&gt;’s &lt;/a&gt;second season doesn’t directly answer any of them, it brings back one of the few characters perfectly suited to help guide Picard and his allies through this next chapter of their journeys.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GznznJ"&gt;Beyond getting the recently resurrected Jean-Luc and his fellow explorers back aboard &lt;em&gt;La Sirena &lt;/em&gt;and in the depths of space they long for&lt;em&gt;, Star Trek: Picard&lt;/em&gt;’s second season is also about to send its heroes into the existential deep in as they embark upon a journey spanning across time and space, and seemingly multiple realities that have all been fractured somehow. As disorienting as Picard is when he wakes up in what appears to be the past, it’s the sort of turn of events that Whoopi Goldberg’s Guinan likely sees coming long before her old friend even thinks to come looking for her El-Aurian wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uP0HXF"&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/OyuddrlFajs"&gt;https://youtu.be/OyuddrlFajs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xTdUtO"&gt;Along with Guinan, &lt;em&gt;Picard&lt;/em&gt;’s second season will also see John Delancie’s Q and Annie Wersching as the Borg Queen in the mix, and the show’s decision to lean heavily on familiar characters from &lt;em&gt;Next Generation &lt;/em&gt;makes sense given how this arc’s poised to focus on key moments from the franchise’s history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q5EfXa"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Picard’s &lt;/em&gt;second season hits Paramount+ on March 3th, and premieres internationally on Prime Video from March 4th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>How to protect your PC from ransomware using Windows’ built-in protection</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An illustration of a laptop with three locks, a key, an at sign, a key and colorful pixels all randomly placed around the image." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RRgsb9jYPOE44pbnwQhmerfLH3M=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70417398/VRG_4614_0_Overview.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8nHoix"&gt;Ransomware — malware that prevents you from accessing your files unless you pay the hacker that infected your computer — has been an issue plaguing computer users and businesses for years. Given its prevalence and the fact that a ransomware infection can lead to the loss of valuable files like documents or family pictures, it’s a good idea to make sure you’re protected. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/29/15892658/microsoft-windows-10-controlled-folders-feature"&gt;Starting with Windows 10&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft has added features to its built-in Windows Security software that can help keep your computer safe from ransomware. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bQQe5e"&gt;As far as ransomware is concerned, there are two levels to Windows Security. The first consists of malware scans, which are on by default, and which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22705042/how-to-scan-microsoft-windows-pc-malware-security-antivirus-defender"&gt;you can learn more about here&lt;/a&gt;. While this will work to keep ransomware from being installed on your computer, if a piece of malware &lt;em&gt;does&lt;/em&gt; manage to slip by, the scans won’t be able to protect your files. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="wazhbC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Winning the war on ransomware","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22822884/us-government-department-of-justice-ransomware-digital-extortion-task-force-report-2021"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="wCROiA"&gt;The second level is Windows’ ransomware protection, which you have to turn on manually. However, before you do, it is worth noting that this feature is not on by default for a reason. It works by only letting approved apps make changes to your files — which, in theory, prevents ransomware from encrypting them and locking them away. This, however, can cause some problems with apps that aren’t expecting it, so you may have to do some occasional trouble-shooting if you’ve got ransomware protection turned on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUMYBk"&gt;As a result, as we go over how to enable ransomware protection, it’s worth keeping in mind that there will probably be some tinkering involved with this process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uRvozJ"&gt;How to turn on ransomware protection&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="seP7Wy"&gt;Windows’ built-in ransomware protection is included in its security app. To get to it, either search “Windows Security” from the start menu or go to “Settings”&amp;gt; “Privacy &amp;amp; Security”&amp;gt; “Windows Security.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/uM00HoGU4fWrH_-TH8GyEfuRRS0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183213/2022_01_20_14_46_12_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once you’re in Windows Security, go to “Virus &amp;amp; threat protection,” either by clicking the tile or the button in the sidebar on the left.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SU4BmU"&gt;To turn on ransomware protection, go to “Virus and threat protection” and click “Manage ransomware protection.” &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kWN32CnI5bDMNJzsz_NPOTOb8-0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183233/2022_01_20_14_46_43_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Click on the “Manage ransomware protection” link to get to the Ransomware protection page.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="hgyq7f"&gt;From there, you can turn on a feature called “Controlled folder access,” which will make it so that unapproved apps won’t be able to make changes to your documents, pictures, videos, or music folders. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6aMHrlKuOUyaEKG4eQLVOXfN6Ok=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183270/2022_01_20_14_47_08_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Switching on the “Controlled folder access” feature ensures that unauthorized apps can’t make changes to files in certain protected folders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="cOgUmu"&gt;How to adjust Controlled folder access&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="mYSkkj"&gt;Once you switch Controlled folder access on, you’ll see three more control panes: “Block history,” “Protected folders,” and “Allow an app through Controlled folder access.” By default, Controlled folder access will only allow a list of approved apps to make any changes to files in the Documents, Pictures, Videos, and Music folders on your computer. These apps let you tweak how the system works.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DIcTcT"&gt;You can, for example, add other folders that you want to protect using the “Protected folders” screen and manage which apps are allowed to make changes to protected folders using the “Allow an app through Controlled folder access” screen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yMKZ3M"&gt;Here’s what you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tPcZ-qfAise9-fFDNVrLywsFb4o=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183278/2022_01_20_15_31_53_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The “Ransomware protection” panel.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="21K0lk"&gt;Block history&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Kzaqlv"&gt;According to a statement in one Windows security page, apps “determined by Microsoft as friendly” will always be allowed to make changes to your protected folders, but that doesn’t mean that every app you’ll want to use will be allowed by default. If you see a weird error popping up after turning on Controlled folder access (one common error I found during testing was getting a “This file cannot be found” message when trying to save a file), you may want to check “Block history” to see if Windows Security has been keeping that app from making changes.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nfoVqfNGHmV3gKhoJUya9qlBqKM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183194/2022_01_20_15_16_01_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The block history screen shows you which apps have tried to write to protected folders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="uTuaMr"&gt;“Block history” lets you see what app was blocked and what folder it was trying to write to. If it’s the app you’ve been having issues with, you’ll want to add it to the list of programs that can make changes. (We’ll go over how to do that in a moment.)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ek20dpfNBcGQuFNUauZiDGLyxls=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183170/2022_01_20_15_02_19_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An example of the types of errors you may encounter: FireFox’s download screen said the file I was trying to save could not be found.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="8UoKgI"&gt;Protected folders&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="zBTAaq"&gt;If you want to protect additional folders from ransomware, like your Desktop folder (which isn’t protected by default), you can select “Protected folders” and click the “Add a protected folder” button.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BQemG2EBYG3oDRjm5HvML6AAV-Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183203/2022_01_20_14_50_14_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adding a folder to the protected folder list will keep apps from writing to it without permission.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sJg4HO"&gt;From there, you can navigate to the folder you want to protect and click the “Select Folder” button.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pSQR6cMoAPb8vFDtD2ClB6185JU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183202/2022_01_20_14_51_33_Greenshot.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chose the folder you want to protect, then click the “Select Folder” button.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="tIciSK"&gt;You can remove protection from custom-added folders (but not the default ones) by going back to the “Protected folders” screen, clicking on the folder you added, and clicking the Remove button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="D47dzS"&gt;Allow an app through controlled folder access&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="9GxWct"&gt;If you’re having problems using an app and want to add it to the allowed list of apps, go back to the “Ransomware protection” page and select “Allow an app through Controlled folder access.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FiljGU"&gt;After clicking on the “Add an allowed app” button, you can click “Recently blocked apps” to see a list of the apps that have recently tried to write to your protected folders.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AXqikyVWbjyt9C5UHjfDC8WUxvQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183172/2022_01_20_15_03_28_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clicking “Recently blocked apps” gets you a list of the apps that have tried and failed to make changes to your files.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="pQ7ihV"&gt;You then click on the plus button next to its name to unblock it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kG7UweNSg8kyhgQXj4soRDMWSB0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23183173/2022_01_20_15_03_37_Windows_Security.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Clicking the plus button next to an app’s name will let it make changes to files in your protected folders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="82QKwA"&gt;While you should only have to do this process once per app, it can be frustrating. You can turn off Ransomware Protection at any time, but if you believe that you’re at high risk for infection and don’t have backups, you should think carefully before doing so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="TMLbUS"&gt;Additional ways to protect yourself&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Ar09rE"&gt;While Windows’ ransomware protection is a powerful built-in tool, it’s probably not a good idea to rely on it as your only defense — as with all anti-malware systems, it should be treated as a safety net rather than your first line of defense. Here are some of the things you can do to avoid getting a ransomware infection in the first place and to make sure that your data is safe even if the worst were to happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="l7FgvZ"&gt;Be careful online&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="F9pzxb"&gt;As with any malware, ransomware can spread through a variety of ways, such as being attached to phishing emails, exploiting security holes in out-of-date software, or masquerading as an actually useful program. When you’re online, it’s important to stay vigilant — if someone is trying to get you to download a program from an untrusted source that seems too good to be true, proceed with extreme caution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XyeTkr"&gt;It’s also important to check the extensions of files you’re sent. If someone claims an attachment is a document, but it has a .exe or .msi extension, that file is likely dangerous. If you can’t already see the file’s extension, you can right-click on it, then click “Properties.” Windows will tell you what kind of file it is next to the “Type of file” heading.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="srMlkU"&gt;Microsoft’s &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/protect-your-pc-from-ransomware-08ed68a7-939f-726c-7e84-a72ba92c01c3"&gt;guide to protecting yourself from ransomware&lt;/a&gt; lists some of the things that can lead to your computer being infected:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="11tTnG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• &lt;/strong&gt;Visiting unsafe, suspicious, or fake websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o9Nc9q"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• &lt;/strong&gt;Opening file attachments that you weren’t expecting or from people you don’t know.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h4oBIQ"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;• &lt;/strong&gt;Opening malicious or bad links in emails, Facebook, Twitter, and other social media posts, or in instant messenger or SMS chats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3 id="z8b33C"&gt;Keep your software updated&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="Br8z5b"&gt;It’s also important to make sure that your operating system and any software you use regularly have the latest security patches. Most browsers will update themselves automatically, and Windows usually also installs updates as they become available. To manually check for updates, go to “Settings”&amp;gt; “Windows Update” and click the “Check for updates” button. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KAjqsC"&gt;You can update any apps installed through Windows’ built-in store by going to the Microsoft Store app, clicking the “Library” button in the lower left-hand corner, and then clicking the “Get Updates” button to find any available updates. You can also click the “Update” button on individual apps or the “Update all” button at the top of the page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="1Fnfyx"&gt;Make sure to have backups&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="82qIPA"&gt;While using ransomware protection and having safe browsing habits can help keep you safe, no system is perfect. It’s important to have a backup of your computer’s files so that if you do end up infected by ransomware, you don’t lose your most valuable photos, videos, or documents. Backups can also keep you from losing data if your computer is physically damaged, lost, or stolen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="npwd50"&gt;You can read our guide on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/1/16240630/how-to-back-up-your-computer-time-machine-file-history-windows-mac-external-drive"&gt;how to back up your computer here&lt;/a&gt;. If possible, it’s best to have two different forms of backup: one local and one in the cloud. However, having any kind of backup is much better than not having anything at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="fm3B6W"&gt;What to do if your computer is infected with ransomware&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="W48q9L"&gt;If all your protections have failed, and you discover that your computer is infected with ransomware, there are three important steps to take:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li id="8XvaKN"&gt;Disconnect your computer from Wi-Fi or ethernet — some ransomware can spread to other computers connected to your network, and it’s important to limit the damage. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="deJhOH"&gt;Don’t pay the ransom — doing so &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/21/22685930/treasury-sanctions-cryptocurrency-exchange-ransomware-colonial-pipeline"&gt;could be illegal&lt;/a&gt;, depending on where the hackers trying to extort you are located, and paying does &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; guarantee that you’ll actually get access to your files back. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="DuGULa"&gt;Don’t plug in your backups if you have them — the ransomware will very likely attempt to destroy those files as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p id="jVCZsC"&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/protect-your-pc-from-ransomware-08ed68a7-939f-726c-7e84-a72ba92c01c3"&gt;Microsoft recommends&lt;/a&gt; attempting to do &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/virus-threat-protection-in-windows-security-1362f4cd-d71a-b52a-0b66-c2820032b65e"&gt;a full scan of your computer using Windows Security&lt;/a&gt;. (Another good app to try is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.malwarebytes.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F22889631%2Fwindows-10-11-ransomware-defense-security-how-to" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Malwarebytes&lt;/a&gt;, which is well-known for its ability to scrub a computer of malware and is free for personal use.) If neither of those work, you may need to &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/recovery-options-in-windows-31ce2444-7de3-818c-d626-e3b5a3024da5#bkmk_win11_reset_pc"&gt;fully reset your PC&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMoB6p"&gt;Finally, if you don’t feel confident that you can remove the ransomware yourself, take your computer to a professional — it’s best to make sure that it’s fully clean before trying to recover your backups. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nike’s accessible ACG Gaiadome FlyEase Boot will be for athletes only</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/okdBbH6q9FJgtLZnkqUsbXK9kWU=/0x1934:4480x4921/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70417294/Gaiadome_Boot_Side_original.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nike’s ACG Gaiadome FlyEase Boot feature toggle laces and a zippered back entry.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Nike&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jFh8CJ"&gt;For the upcoming Beijing Winter Olympics, Nike announced Friday that it’s designed inclusive and accessible gear for Team USA Olympians and Paralympians to wear on the medal stand. That includes the new ACG Gaiadome FlyEase Boot, which can be slipped on and secured one-handed. The only issue is it seems to have inherited the FlyEase’s limited availability as well. While the rest of the ‘fit will be available for purchase, the Gaiadome boot will be an athlete exclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzKk36"&gt;“For the official Team USA Medal Stand look in Beijing, we worked closely with the disability community, including current and former winter and summer Paralympians, in our design and testing process, and used inclusive design principles and methods to create gear that ensures every athlete who competes feels support in style from start to finish,” Nike said in a press release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rvWSMK"&gt;Overall, this translates to an outfit that can be easily worn by those with limited dexterity. For example, the jackets include magnetic closures, oversized zipper pulls, and fish-trap pockets. Meanwhile, the ACG Dri-Fit ADV Trail Pants have a quick-release magnetic buckle. For the ACG Gaiadome Boot, the design features a zippered back entry and toggle laces. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oVqJIn"&gt;The Gaiadome FlyEase Boot has a similar design philosophy to the $120 &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/2/1/22260179/nike-go-flyease-shoes-hands-free-pricing-release-day"&gt;Go FlyEase&lt;/a&gt;, which Nike introduced last year. Those sneakers featured a “bistable hinge” that allowed a person to put on and take off the shoe hands-free. While the FlyEase’s accessible design was widely praised, Nike was heavily criticized over how it handled the launch. Limited stock and hype created a resale market around the shoes resulting in prices shooting upwards of $400. The problem &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LeoInLaurent/status/1388739788522627072?s=20"&gt;went viral&lt;/a&gt; on social media, and some accused Nike of &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/03/28/981197687/nike-accused-of-using-disability-to-hype-new-hands-free-sneaker"&gt;using disability as a marketing scheme&lt;/a&gt; without assuring access to those who would most benefit from the sneakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="CYH9dV"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Nike ACG Gaiadome FlyEase Boot|105647" data-volume-uuid="06ae71a8b" data-volume-id="105647" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-213" class="volume-video" data-volume-player-choice="chorus"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EDFAOa"&gt;It’s curious, then, that Nike has decided to make the Gaiadome FlyEase Boot an athlete exclusive. This isn’t the first time Nike has made accessible footwear for Olympic athletes that then became available for consumers. For the Tokyo Summer Games last year, Nike introduced the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/design/2021/7/1/22560002/nike-glide-flyease-olympics-sneakers"&gt;Glide FlyEase&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of the innovative hinge, they featured a flexible heel that would snap into place once a person stepped into the shoe. Both the Go FlyEase and Glide FlyEase are available for retail. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; asked Nike why the Gaiadome FlyEase Boot will be an athlete exclusive but didn’t immediately receive a response.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9B1rUt"&gt;In an ideal world, accessible design would be the default, &lt;a href="https://accessibility.umn.edu/importance-accessibility/benefits-accessible-design"&gt;as it benefits everyone&lt;/a&gt;. Boots are oftentimes difficult for even able-bodied people with full use of their hands. It’s understandable that Nike may be keen to avoid further controversy, but hopefully, we’ll see the Gaiadome FlyEase Boot’s design incorporated on future shoes that &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; available to the public — and not in limited quantities. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Light sensors on wearables struggle with dark skin and obesity</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rPTfh3"&gt;Light sensors used to track heart rate in wearable devices like the Apple Watch Series 5 and the Fitbit Versa 2 don’t work as well on darker skin or people with obesity, according to modeling done in a &lt;a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8713672/"&gt;new study&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KdXiIo"&gt;That’s a problem for features currently built into devices — but it’s also a bad sign for efforts to use light sensors for new applications in wearables, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/16/22677381/smartwatch-blood-pressure-samsung-fitbit-apple"&gt;monitoring blood pressure&lt;/a&gt;, says study author Jessica Ramella-Roman, an associate professor studying bioimaging sensors at Florida International University.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M2QBbg"&gt;“The architecture of the device has to change,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6LmWqd"&gt;The study looked at the photoplethysmography (PPG) signal, a technique that uses changes in how light is reflected to measure blood flow, on three wearable devices: the Apple Watch Series 5, Fitbit Versa 2, and Polar M600. The research team used a model that simulates how light moves through tissue to show how the sensors on those devices would behave with different skin properties. Darker skin has higher melanin and absorbs more light, while skin from people with obesity tends to be thicker, have less water, and have less blood flow than skin from people who are not obese. While previous research on accuracy and bias in wearables has focused on skin tone, Ramella-Roman says that many studies haven’t included a lot of people with obesity despite these physiological differences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qbx7kq"&gt;“That’s why we think it’s necessary to focus there,” she says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9LsrOn"&gt;The PPG signal didn’t change much as skin tone changed, the researchers’ model found: it varied less than 10 percent across the devices. But modeling obesity, both alone and together with skin tone, caused up to a 60 percent variation in the signal. Signal loss appeared to be because of the changes in skin thickness in people with obesity, the authors said in the study. There were changes in the peak of the PPG signal, which is used to calculate heart rate but whose signal strength should not change based on the heart rate value. There were also changes in the shape of the signal — which different groups are using as a way to track blood pressure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9aYqpZ"&gt;“As we increased the BMI level and increased the skin tone, the signal diminished, and then other features started disappearing as well,” she says. The Fitbit, which had fewer sensors, had a more dramatic loss of signal than the Apple Watch, the study found.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ItVTsZ"&gt;This study only modeled how these wearable devices would detect signals in the lab, Ramella-Roman stressed. The team still has to check the devices on actual people in order to confirm the findings. They’re in the process of doing that study now and have enrolled around 100 people so far, she says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cZB5fg"&gt;But the problems revealed by analyses like this complicate projects looking to use wearables to track cardiovascular health for underserved groups, Ramella-Roman says. The new study indicates researchers have to be careful using PPG, particularly for projects aiming to use the devices to help monitor people at higher risk of cardiovascular issues — which includes people with obesity. “The holy grail in this context is looking at blood pressure,” she says. “But many, many studies looking at blood pressure use some combination of PPG and other modalities.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oxSlul"&gt;The findings also suggest that other devices that use light sensors and PPG, like the blood oxygen measures in hospitals or doctors’ offices, might not work as well for people with obesity. There are very few studies that evaluate the devices in those groups. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yRH6uT"&gt;The good news is it should be possible to adjust devices (like by moving around the spacing of the sensors) so that they are more accurate on people with darker skin or with obesity without compromising accuracy for other groups, Ramella-Roman says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qtXEVg"&gt;“The way the systems were designed initially maybe didn’t account for these individuals, but they could definitely make changes,” she says. “I don’t see anything that would limit that.”  &lt;/p&gt;
