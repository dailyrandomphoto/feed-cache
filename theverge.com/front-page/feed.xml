    <title>An actual house is an NFT now</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rfhQZWCxyD1_Senh15QWzvoUupY=/0x205:1216x1016/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69139600/Screen_Shot_2021_04_16_at_12.39.26_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="p0h8YY"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www2.dre.ca.gov/PublicASP/pplinfo.asp?License_id=01968736"&gt;real estate broker&lt;/a&gt; named Shane Dulgeroff decided to take advantage of the NFT hype. He’s selling a house at&lt;a href="https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/221-Dryden-St-Thousand-Oaks-CA-91360/16482013_zpid/"&gt; 221 Dryden Street, in Thousand Oaks, California&lt;/a&gt; along with an NFT of a psychedelic-flavored video of the house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XijYAX"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://dulgeroffnft.com/"&gt;artwork and house&lt;/a&gt; are up for auction &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/2486869023454245507069933349028388716405620900153834793415058191888540499969"&gt;on OpenSea&lt;/a&gt;, with a minimum bid of 48 ETH, or almost $117,000. &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x495f947276749ce646f68ac8c248420045cb7b5e/2486869023454245507069933349028388716405620900153834793415058191888540499969"&gt;No one has bid yet&lt;/a&gt;, and the auction closes in seven days. The house previously sold at $746,000, according to real-estate platform Zillow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;div id="e22w1I"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="aside:10374749"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dkbvQh"&gt;“It’s less about the significance of the art as it is the significance of us using a platform like this to sell a home,” &lt;a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90625777/this-nft-comes-with-an-actual-house"&gt;Dulgeroff told &lt;em&gt;Fast Company.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; “The significance that the art will carry, it’s going to be stored in your digital wallet forever as living proof that you purchased the first home ever that was done through any kind of a crypto platform directly. So that’s where the real value is.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sKSD1h"&gt;NFTs are usually used to support digital goods — for instance: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;art&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353219/gorrilaz-artist-nft-release-environmental-concerns"&gt;music&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22348858/nba-nft-top-shot-dapper-labs"&gt;trading cards&lt;/a&gt;. Currently there are no laws to explain how this might work, or what the taxes will be. “It really is an interesting process navigating the legal side of it, the tax side of it, the transfer side of it to make sure it’s all done correctly,” Dulgeroff told &lt;em&gt;Fast Company. &lt;/em&gt;Perhaps that explains the lack of bids — no one wants to get in trouble with tax collectors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4zQ6g3"&gt;The art that comes with the house was designed by &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fkiiarens.com%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F16%2F22388177%2Fnft-house-real-estate-opensea-thousand-oaks-california" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Kii Arens&lt;/a&gt;. This isn’t the only Arens NFT; &lt;a href="https://opensea.io/collection/to-the-moon-and-beyond-1"&gt;his pop-art confections&lt;/a&gt; inspired by Yusaku Maezawa’s attempted space mission are also up for sale. Maezawa, a Japanese billionaire, announced in 2018 that he &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/17/17869990/elon-musk-spacex-lunar-mission-ticket-moon-passenger-bfr-falcon-yusaku-maezawa"&gt;planned to go to the Moon with artists&lt;/a&gt;. “I want to be on that spaceship as it travels farther than any human has from Earth,” Arens wrote to explain the inspiration for the NFT set.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon’s The Lord of the Rings series to cost $465 million for first season</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (WARNER BROS.)" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KDWrZMh8ww8MvseCP6WUoy0r7bs=/159x0:1020x574/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69139471/desolationofsmaug_promotionalstill_22_1020.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The gold necessary to finance the first season of The Lord of the Rings&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IWQHoJ"&gt;The first season of Amazon’s &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt; TV show is &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/amazons-lord-of-the-rings-cost-465-million-one-season?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; to cost the retail giant a frankly difficult to imagine $465 million to produce. Just to save you from having to re-read that, this price tag is for just one season, and that there is not a missing decimal in the above number. “This will be the largest television series ever made,” New Zealand’s Minister for Economic Development and Tourism&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/politics/300278243/amazon-may-be-on-the-way-to-new-zealand-as-government-signs-subsidy-deal"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YrIvVj"&gt;But this honor was already something of a known quantity, after Amazon &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/13/16644782/the-lord-of-the-rings-amazon-television-show"&gt;spent $250 million to secure the rights&lt;/a&gt; to the franchise in 2017, kicking off a round of stories declaring the not-yet-produced show “the most expensive” television production in history, with the big B number circulating its rumored five-season run. This is perhaps fitting, since another episodic &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Rings&lt;/em&gt;-adjacent production — Peter Jackson’s &lt;em&gt;The Hobbit&lt;/em&gt; trilogy — currently holds the record for the most expensive movie production in history, at some $623 million (after tax credits). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ObrBEP"&gt;To make a more lembas to lembas comparison, here are some other Big Numbers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="khBGoa"&gt;The final and most expensive season of that other fantasy TV series, &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, cost just $90 million, or &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-game-of-thrones-episodes-cost-for-production-2019-4"&gt;$15 million per episode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="6wQADd"&gt;Disney spent “&lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/budget-of-disney-plus-star-wars-series-the-mandalorian-2019-10"&gt;around 100 million&lt;/a&gt;” on the first season of &lt;em&gt;The Mandalorian&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="ZkeDOI"&gt;Disney’s Marvel series are reported to cost as much as &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/bob-iger-bets-company-hollywood-s-future-streaming-1247663"&gt;$25 million per episode&lt;/a&gt; which, considering there are nine episodes of &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, would max out at $225 million. Chump change!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="faB3tS"&gt;Adjusted for inflation, it cost Kevin Costner roughly $300 million in 1995 to build an entire island off the coast of Hawaii for &lt;em&gt;Waterworld.&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="JHXDsm"&gt;The US government plans to spend $451 million in 2021 on lunar exploration, or about one &lt;em&gt;The Lord of the Rings &lt;/em&gt;season.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="aLlLx9"&gt;Of course, being a new show and all, there are some up-front costs to be expected in this first season, like sets and costumes, which may take some of the sting out of future seasons. But that’s really only a concern if you’re thinking as a not-billionaire. With a net worth of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264856/jeff-bezos-worth-amazon-founder-ceo-193-billion-dollars"&gt;$193 billion&lt;/a&gt;, Amazon’s (outgoing) CEO Jeff Bezos can personally ensure the series goes &lt;em&gt;there and back again &lt;/em&gt;(and again and again and again) for some 400 seasons before things start to get a little tight. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook Oversight Board delays decision on Trump ban</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="facebook stock art" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2FoQ2Q4R3ZAbN64uiMFfsJBx_Q0=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69139369/acastro_180928_1777_facebook_hack_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SmfZI9"&gt;The Facebook Oversight Board, the quasi-judicial organization that Facebook set up to review tough moderation choices, announced today that its decision on former President Trump’s ban from Facebook and Instagram will arrive “in the coming weeks.” The decision, which was initially supposed to take 90 days, has been pushed back so the board can review &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/29/22256821/facebook-trump-ban-oversight-board-public-feedback"&gt;the more than 9,000 comments&lt;/a&gt; it’s received about the case. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UNu9BU"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;(2/2): The Board’s commitment to carefully reviewing all comments has extended the case timeline, in line with the Board’s bylaws. We will share more information soon.&lt;/p&gt;— Oversight Board (@OversightBoard) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/OversightBoard/status/1383058864074063874?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 16, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ffXNAt"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook banned Trump from its platforms&lt;/a&gt; after the January 6th insurrection at the Capitol, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg writing that “the risks of allowing President Trump to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great.” Trump has remained banned from the services, and his attempts to appear in videos on his children’s pages have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360483/facebook-trump-ban-interview-daughter-in-law"&gt;also been blocked&lt;/a&gt;. But the ban was always “indefinite,” and it’s now up to Facebook’s new Oversight Board to make a call about when and how Trump might be allowed to return, if ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X0eHz1"&gt;The review of the decision to block the former President is a momentous occasion for the Oversight Board. The board is staffed by an international panel of lawyers and speech experts and is supposed to offer an independent, binding assessment of Facebook moderation decisions. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/13/22381499/facebook-oversight-board-remove-posts-appeals"&gt;Anyone can appeal to the board&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s not a guarantee any case will be taken.) The Board has already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/28/22254155/facebook-oversight-board-first-rulings-coronavirus-misinformation-hate-speech"&gt;ruled on a handful of cases&lt;/a&gt; — some in surprising ways — but a decision to either reinstate Trump or keep him off Facebook will be heavily scrutinized with pressure on Facebook and Mark Zuckerberg to overrule that decision no matter what. If this massive &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/23/21530524/facebooks-new-oversight-board-platform-governance"&gt;experiment in platform governance&lt;/a&gt; is to succeed, this is the first major test, with enormous implications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R8dzWJ"&gt;In the meantime, at least they’re reading the comments.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk’s SpaceX will build NASA’s lunar lander</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ULgb83f4e2CFJZ65WWcmdYCn3yg=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69138580/pacalin_190928_3690_0030.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Pauline Acalin for The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="072kWA"&gt;NASA picked Elon Musk’s SpaceX to receive $2.9 billion to build a lunar lander as part of the Artemis mission to send humans to the Moon by 2024, NASA announced today. It’s a major vote of confidence in SpaceX from NASA — as no other company received money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HA48ae"&gt;There were three major contenders for the project. SpaceX beat out Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, working with a selection of other aerospace companies, and Dynetics, a defense contractor. NASA had previously rewarded all three contenders with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/30/21242837/nasa-spacex-blue-origin-dynetics-human-lunar-landers#:~:text=NASA%20has%20chosen%20SpaceX%2C%20Blue,man%20to%20the%20lunar%20surface."&gt;a combined $967 million&lt;/a&gt; to develop lunar lander concepts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rFtZ8P"&gt;&lt;a href="https://voxmedia.stories.usechorus.com/compose/d3d46dc6-a830-4c10-9f25-fde9b7819c7f"&gt;NASA was expected to pick &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; companies&lt;/a&gt; to receive contracts today on the first Moon landing mission since the Apollo program. So giving the contract to SpaceX &lt;em&gt;alone&lt;/em&gt; is a slap in the face to Blue Origin in particular — and its team, which included Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. In the commercial crew program, for instance, both Boeing and SpaceX received contracts. The redundancy gave NASA options in case one of the companies didn’t deliver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ibsLnH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;No other company received money from NASA&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0h5Mhr"&gt;The SpaceX bid was Starship, the next-generation spacecraft the company is building in Boca Chica, Texas. It’s expected to be able to carry a crew of astronauts and 100 tons of cargo. Starship is supposed to use its main engines to lower itself to a hard surface, such as the Moon or Mars. SpaceX has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22311916/spacex-starship-prototype-landing-successful"&gt;successfully landed Starship once&lt;/a&gt; on March 3rd, though it blew up almost immediately afterward. Another landing attempt, on March 30th, also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358060/spacex-starship-prototype-fail-landing-texas"&gt;ended in flames&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TMA0QD"&gt;“The human landing system is going to allow us to be able to access different parts of the lunar surface,” said Kathy Lauders, the associate administrator for NASA’s Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate, in a NASA livestream. “It also allows us to explore a new technology and capabilities that will help us when we are trying to figure out our next round of technologies to be able to help us land on Mars or other planets out there.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="brgYFu"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22375899/nasa-first-person-of-color-artemis-mission-moon-woman"&gt;The Artemis mission&lt;/a&gt; will land the first woman on the Moon, as well as the first person of color. (So far, only white men have walked on the lunar surface.) In November, the 18 astronauts who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166077/nasa-artemis-astronauts-18-first-woman-moon-mike-pence-space-council"&gt;were part of the Artemis team were introduced&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HnE6Yr"&gt;President Joe Biden’s 2022 budget request includes $24.7 billion meant for NASA, and he’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22337787/biden-nasa-chief-choice-senator-bill-nelson"&gt;nominated former senator Bill Nelson&lt;/a&gt; as NASA chief.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9l4VWR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 4:12PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds NASA confirmation, quote from Kathy Leuders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Amazon drivers may soon build the furniture you purchase</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Amazon Prime Day" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2SshJJmummDYqNCGlwdWh0NQF48=/0x0:3896x2597/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69138576/1155745592.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Paul Hennessy/NurPhoto via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aNYWlg"&gt;Amazon is considering a new service that would have drivers not only deliver but build furniture, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-16/amazon-is-working-on-furniture-assembly-service-to-catch-wayfair?sref=BWbpWjRm"&gt;according to Bloomberg&lt;/a&gt;. The service is meant to help Amazon better compete with Wayfair and brick-and-mortar stores like Home Depot, Lowes, and Best Buy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="51q99f"&gt;Bloomberg says Amazon is planning to introduce the service in Virginia and at least two other markets initially. It’s meant to deal with one of the biggest annoyances of furnishing your house entirely online: giant packages full of pieces you have to then assemble like the world’s heaviest and most complex Lego set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dwlM59"&gt;Wayfair and most other companies in the furniture business already offer a building service for an additional fee. However, Amazon has faced public scrutiny for its treatment of drivers, including &lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/k7amyn/amazon-denies-workers-pee-in-bottles-here-are-the-pee-bottles"&gt;a recent piece by &lt;em&gt;Motherboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;that detailed instances of drivers using everything from water bottles to McDonald’s cups to Pringles cans to relieve themselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrGRDk"&gt;In the presentation Bloomberg saw, the new service required Amazon drivers to deliver the product, remove all packaging, and assemble it. Crucially it would also require drivers to take the product back if the customer wasn’t entirely satisfied, which adds additional labor, and &lt;a href="https://www.news5cleveland.com/rebound/deliverers-and-installers-fear-covid-19-in-peoples-homes-so-heres-what-should-happen"&gt;potential risks during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;, to an already difficult job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9tldoV"&gt;While &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/16/22386992/amazon-is-finally-realizing-it-has-a-labor-problem"&gt;there are signs Amazon is finally starting to address its clear problem with labor&lt;/a&gt;, it’s way too early to look at this potential new delivery service with anything but wariness.

    <title>TikTok teens roast pop-punk group for posting cringe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xcLChqVB_pB0AKyjR47m_NrCBE8=/0x82:730x569/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69138391/Screen_Shot_2021_04_16_at_9.59.49_AM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nFwBb3"&gt;The concept of &lt;a href="https://slate.com/culture/2017/07/the-history-of-calling-artists-sellouts.html"&gt;“selling out” might be over&lt;/a&gt;, but Gen Z teens will still roast you for posting cringe — as the pop-punk band Tramp Stamp is finding out. According to people on TikTok, Twitter, and Reddit, Tramp Stamp are “industry plants.” The giveaway? Their social media is too good.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kwF0dR"&gt;An “industry plant,” &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/tramp-stamps-dr-luke-tiktok-backlash-1156440/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt; helpfully explains&lt;/a&gt;, “is an artist who has label backing but presents themself as self-made.” In 2019, the band’s guitarist, Caroline Baker, &lt;a href="https://musicrow.com/2019/12/caroline-baker-inks-with-prescription-songs/"&gt;appeared in MusicRow&lt;/a&gt;: she signed to Prescription songs, owned by Dr. Luke, aka Lukasz Gottwald. Reddit &lt;a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/mqxh1r/tramp_stamps_id_rather_die/gulb78c/"&gt;resurfaced that report&lt;/a&gt; this week. The Redditors also found that the lead singer, Marisa Marino, &lt;a href="https://musicrow.com/2020/07/marisa-maino-signs-with-prescription-songs/"&gt;also has a Prescription deal&lt;/a&gt;. Oh yeah, and per the credits on their YouTube video, the Tramp Stamps have a deal with Kobalt Music Group, which is partly owned... by Dr. Luke.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XirQid"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tiktok-embed" cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@seapunkhistorian/video/6951151389800156422" data-video-id="6951151389800156422" style="max-width: 605px;min-width: 325px;"&gt; &lt;section&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="@seapunkhistorian" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@seapunkhistorian"&gt;@seapunkhistorian&lt;/a&gt; &lt;p&gt;proves how out of touch and tone deaf some labels are &lt;a title="musicindustry" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/musicindustry"&gt;#musicindustry&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="music" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/music"&gt;#music&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="trampstamps" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/trampstamps"&gt;#trampstamps&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="deathgrips" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/deathgrips"&gt;#deathgrips&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a title="insidious" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/insidious"&gt;#insidious&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;a target="_blank" title="♬ Runway N - Death Grips" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/Runway-N-6756626598729877505"&gt;♬ Runway N - Death Grips&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/section&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async="" src="https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NdZ2xJ"&gt;About Dr. Luke: In 2014, Kesha sued him to void their contract because he “sexually, physically, verbally, and emotionally abused [Kesha] to the point where [she] nearly lost her life,” &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kesha-and-dr-luke-everything-you-need-to-know-to-understand-the-case-106731/"&gt;according to the suit&lt;/a&gt;. After several years, the legal fight ended when New York Supreme Court Judge Jennifer G. Schecter &lt;a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/dr-luke-scores-big-win-kesha-defamation-dispute-949226/"&gt;ruled Kesha had defamed Dr. Luke&lt;/a&gt; in a text message to Lady Gaga, where Kesha accused Dr. Luke of drugging and raping herself and Katy Perry — allegations Perry denied. (Dr. Luke still works with Doja Cat, Kim Petras, and Saweetie under his Tyson Trax pseudonym, &lt;em&gt;Rolling Stone&lt;/em&gt; says.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3IQQnR"&gt;A recurring theme in the “plant” posts: that the Tramp Stamps appear to have a social media team. Their website &lt;a href="https://trampstamps.com/"&gt;looks like it was professionally designed&lt;/a&gt;. They have a robust merch store, including &lt;a href="https://store.trampstamps.com/products/trmpswm0bl-ap"&gt;a black thong&lt;/a&gt; that says “sex” in pink, Sex Pistols lettering. Their Instagram has about 27,300 followers, but many of their posts have less than 3,000 likes. TikTok user &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@hard_cope/video/6950516969971993861"&gt;hardcope pointed out&lt;/a&gt; that their first Instagram post is an animation — a piece of media that’s hard for a DIY band to put together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ybjqUL"&gt;“Everything about this group is so calculated, almost insidiously, insidiously,” says TikTok &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@seapunkhistorian/video/6951151389800156422"&gt;user seapunkhistorian&lt;/a&gt;. “Even down to their hair colors.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NrG5ly"&gt;Another user pointed to a group where the Tramp Stamps were rating whether or not songs were emo; they appeared puzzled when a snippet of a song came on. “Oh my God,” said &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dandydemon/video/6951591000003415301"&gt;TikTok user dandydemon&lt;/a&gt;. “You’re going to co-opt the aesthetic and you don’t even know My Chemical Romance?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FnzFcw"&gt;“It’s so obvious that the people who wrote this song don’t understand punk culture,” said &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@awetheyreuglee/video/6951431146135768326"&gt;TikTok user awtheyreuglee&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z63uc9"&gt;In fact, &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/trampstamps"&gt;the entire TikTok hashtag #trampstamp is filled with people complaining&lt;/a&gt; about the band and their cringey new song, out today, called “I’d Rather Die.” (Chorus: “I’d rather die than hook up with another straight white guy.”)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Z1M6R"&gt;There’s a lesson here. If you’re marketing to a younger, social-media-savvy group, you’re going to have an uphill battle unless the group being marketed is perceived as “authentic.” And teenagers, more than anyone else, have a sharp eye for that.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Six months later, there still isn’t a MagSafe car charger</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Belkin Car Vent Mount Pro with Magsafe in a Ford F-150" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/2eqHThjfDJiN9ysmOQseSCaGoPY=/0x0:5568x3712/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69137951/DSC_9416.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;See, it’s held on with magnets.&lt;/em&gt; | Nilay Patel&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A review of the Belkin Car Vent Mount Pro with MagSafe, which is not a charger&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="5BoG1g"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;Vergecast&lt;/em&gt; listeners know, I am a sucker for car phone mounts and chargers. They are a perfect gadget for the modern age — a design problem with no perfect solution, price points that usually land at the higher end of the impulse-buy zone, and completely well-suited for targeted Instagram ads. “People who have bought a Qi-based car mount in the last year,” the marketing director of a tiny accessory company sternly instructs the Facebook ad-targeting system. “Find them and relentlessly pressure them into buying our product which is at best marginally better than the one they have.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3wxGA1"&gt;Reader, it works.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d11VAF"&gt;All of this means I was very excited when Apple added MagSafe charging to the new iPhone 12 line. A series of magnets aligns a wireless charger to the back of the phone, and has enough attachment strength to — yes — hold the phone on a car mount. A dream: you get in the car, seamlessly &lt;em&gt;dink!&lt;/em&gt; your phone onto the mount, and drive away, laughing at the suckers fumbling with their cradles and motorized friction arms and other unwieldy ideas. &lt;em&gt;Magnets&lt;/em&gt;, baby. &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-agl0pOQfs"&gt;&lt;em&gt;How do they work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Belkin Car Vent Mount Pro with Magsafe in a Ford F-150" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jE4C1x2hBm0nsmPwyzBlmTNRPH4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22448963/DSC_9421.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Nilay Patel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MagSafe attachment plate can pivot independently from the mount&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Belkin Car Vent Mount Pro with Magsafe in a Ford F-150" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q4Hb9wFPRXxh4BodqkSuHOt9rWE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22448960/DSC_9412.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Nilay Patel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note the lack of a USB cable plugged in here, because there isn’t a charger in there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ezba14"&gt;Unfortunately it has been six months since the iPhone 12 was announced, and there is a pitiful shortage of MagSafe car chargers. In fact, there are &lt;em&gt;no&lt;/em&gt; officially-sanctioned MagSafe car chargers. Instead, there is this Belkin Car Vent Mount PRO with MagSafe, which, as the name suggests, allows you to mount a phone to your vents with MagSafe, in, um, a professional way. However, it does not charge your phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J9hVT9"&gt;I have been using a review unit of the Belkin Car Vent Mount PRO with MagSafe, or BCVMPwM, for a couple months now. It is at once supremely satisfying — &lt;em&gt;dink! &lt;/em&gt;— and also tremendously frustrating. Like all vent mounts, the weight of the phone is enough to pull the vent louvers down over time, especially if you have a large phone like my iPhone 12 Pro Max. The magnets are indeed strong enough to hold even that phone in place, but if you go over any particularly huge bumps, something will fall down — the phone off the mount, or the mount off the vent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1mFB16"&gt;“Dammit, BCVMPwM,” you will yell, using the full name of this $40 promise to yourself. “Why aren’t you everything I hoped and dreamed of when I looked at the marketing photos on social media?” Then you will put everything back into place at the next stop light, sheepishly glance at your partner, and slowly realize they have completely stopped paying attention to these sorts of antics anymore. You need new antics. &lt;em&gt;You need to add Linux to your smart home.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Belkin Car Vent Mount Pro with Magsafe in a Ford F-150 with an iPhone 12 Pro Max" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PE0Re-HiVifAlzQsY3fz1PDYaOg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22448961/DSC_9414.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Nilay Patel&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;It’s a clean look, but note that this phone is not charging. Because it’s not a charger.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="SkXxBZ"&gt;Stop it. Have I mentioned that the BCVMPwM does not have C? No, this is not a charger. For that, you still have to plug in a Lightning cable, which sort-of-maybe makes sense if your car does not have wireless CarPlay and you need to plug it in anyway — but there you are, plugging a cable into your phone, which is the complete opposite of the &lt;em&gt;dink!&lt;/em&gt; Magnet Experience. Your old car mount, with the horrible friction arms, had a built-in Qi charger. There are hacky wireless CarPlay adapters! People say they are kinda slow and have audio latency issues, but c’mon — a single &lt;em&gt;dink!&lt;/em&gt; to mount your phone, charge it, and instantly connect to CarPlay? Now that’s the good shit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="GCI6q6"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10450154"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="0fkibY"&gt;Why &lt;em&gt;isn’t&lt;/em&gt; there an approved MagSafe car mount with built-in wireless charging after six months? Why do Apple accessory ecosystems always seem so petrified, in every sense of the word? This is the easiest win of all time, but instead, there is the BCVMPwM. It offers you a glimpse of a dream. Then it falls down. There are better unlicensed ones that might burn your car to the ground that you &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=magsafe+car+charger&amp;amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2"&gt;can buy on Amazon&lt;/a&gt;. It is the paradigmatic Apple accessory. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RXL8dh"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8obgSq"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nobody is flying to join Google’s FLoC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vj9USJ_2U9pacNs_-7sZpxFhMxo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69137731/jbareham_170523_1716_0001_v2.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by James Bareham / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H7Fo0Z"&gt;Google is going it alone with its proposed advertising technology to replace third-party cookies. Every major browser that uses the open source Chromium project has declined to use it, and it’s unclear what that will mean for the future of advertising on the web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WR1nAW"&gt;A couple of weeks ago, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-google-chrome-floc-cookies-cookiepocalypse-finger-printing"&gt;Google announced it was beginning to test a new ad technology inside Google Chrome called the Federated Learning of Cohorts&lt;/a&gt;, or FLoC. It uses an algorithm to look at your browser history and place you in a group of people with similar browsing histories so that advertisers can target you. It’s more private than cookies, but it’s also complicated and has some potential privacy implications of its own if it’s not implemented right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HANyqh"&gt;Google Chrome is built on an open source project, and so FLoC was implemented as part of that project that other browsers could include. I am not aware of any Chromium-based browser outside of Google’s own that will implement it and very aware of many that will refuse. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tKmX0h"&gt;One note I’ll drop here is that I am relieved that nobody else is implementing FLoC right away, because the way FLoC is constructed puts a very big responsibility on a browser maker. If implemented badly, FLoC could leak out sensitive information. It’s a complicated technology that does appear to keep you semi-anonymous, but there are enough details to hide dozens of devils.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="T4Ez4r"&gt;&lt;q&gt;No browser vendor except Chrome is joining the FLoC&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="o6OutW"&gt;Anyway, here’s &lt;a href="https://brave.com/why-brave-disables-floc/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Brave&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “The worst aspect of FLoC is that it materially harms user privacy, under the guise of being privacy-friendly.” And here’s &lt;a href="https://vivaldi.com/blog/no-google-vivaldi-users-will-not-get-floced/"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vivaldi&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: “We will not support the FLoC API and plan to disable it, no matter how it is implemented. It does not protect privacy and it certainly is not beneficial to users, to unwittingly give away their privacy for the financial gain of Google.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O6lUvI"&gt;We’ve reached out to &lt;strong&gt;Opera&lt;/strong&gt; for comment as well, and here’s that company’s statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Rcx0SD"&gt;As you probably know, Opera has a long history of introducing privacy features that benefit our users: it was the first major browser to introduce built-in ad blocking, browser VPN and other privacy-centric features. The significance now is the end of third party cookies, which will reduce the amount of cross-website tracking on the web. While we and other browsers are discussing new and better privacy-preserving advertising alternatives to cookies including FloC, we have no current plans to enable features like this in the Opera browsers in their current form. Generally speaking, we do, however, think it’s too early to say in which direction the market will move or what the major browsers will do. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="DQgfvV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22376110/duckduckgo-privacy-floc-block-chrome-extension-advertising-tech"&gt;DuckDuckGo isn’t a browser&lt;/a&gt;, but it’s already made a browser extension to block it. And the Electronic Frontier Foundation, which is very much against FLoC, has even &lt;a href="https://amifloced.org/"&gt;made a website to let you know if you’re one of the few Chrome users who have been included&lt;/a&gt; in Google’s early tests. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ndbovl"&gt;But maybe the most important Chromium-based browser not made by Google is &lt;strong&gt;Microsoft Edge&lt;/strong&gt;. It is a big test for Google’s proposed FLoC technology: if Microsoft isn’t going to support it, that would pretty much mean Chrome really will be going it alone with this technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1e21CA"&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22351192/tech-ceo-hearing-mark-zuckerberg-jack-dorsey-sundar-pichai-facebook-google-twitter"&gt;grand tradition of Congressional tech hearings&lt;/a&gt;, I asked Microsoft a yes or no question: does it intend to implement FLoC in Edge? And in the same grand tradition, Microsoft answered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="5PE2bT"&gt;We believe in a future where the web can provide people with privacy, transparency and control while also supporting responsible business models to create a vibrant, open and diverse ecosystem. Like Google, we support solutions that give users clear consent, and do not bypass consumer choice. That’s also why we do not support solutions that leverage non-consented user identity signals, such as fingerprinting. The industry is on a journey and there will be browser-based proposals that do not need individual user ids and ID-based proposals that are based on consent and first party relationships. We will continue to explore these approaches with the community. Recently, for example, we were pleased to introduce one possible approach, as described in our PARAKEET proposal. This proposal is not the final iteration but is an evolving document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="2fMS42"&gt;That is a LOT to unpack, but it sounds very much like a “no” to me. However, it’s a “no” with some important context. But before I get too deep into it, let’s talk about a couple of non-Chromium browsers — because one important piece of all of this is that Google’s FLoC technology is still a &lt;em&gt;proposal. &lt;/em&gt;Google is saying it would like to make it a fundamental part of the web, not simply a new feature in its browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JftGAC"&gt;Here’s a statement that a Mozilla spokesperson provided to us on the plans for &lt;strong&gt;Firefox&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="m_-550364295539317878gmail-docs-internal-guid-7f59cbb4-7fff-ed02-d8c4-bc9f826b3e13"&gt;We are currently evaluating many of the privacy preserving advertising proposals, including those put forward by Google, but have no current plans to implement any of them at this time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Aacnfh"&gt;We don’t buy into the assumption that the industry needs billions of data points about people, that are collected and shared without their understanding, to serve relevant advertising. That is why we’ve implemented Enhanced Tracking Protection by default to block more than ten billion trackers a day, and continue to innovate on &lt;a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/blog/2021/02/23/latest-firefox-release-includes-multiple-picture-in-picture-and-total-cookie-protection/"&gt;new ways&lt;/a&gt; to protect people who use Firefox.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jtav2Q"&gt;Advertising and privacy can co-exist. And the advertising industry can operate differently than it has in past years. We look forward to playing a role in finding solutions that build a better web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="BsXnUm"&gt;As for Apple’s &lt;strong&gt;Safari&lt;/strong&gt;, I will admit I didn’t reach out for comment because at this point it’s not difficult to guess what the answer will be. Apple, after all, deserves some credit for changing everybody’s default views on privacy. However, the story here is actually much more interesting that you might guess at first. John Wilander is a WebKit engineer at Apple who works on Safari’s privacy-enhancing &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/24/21192830/apple-safari-intelligent-tracking-privacy-full-third-party-cookie-blocking"&gt;Intelligent Tracking Prevention&lt;/a&gt; features. He was asked on Twitter whether or not Safari would implement FLoC and here’s his reply:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="BzD49q"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We have not said we will implement and we have our tracking prevention policy. That’s it for the time being. Serious standards proposals deserve thinking and I appreciate Brave sharing theirs.&lt;/p&gt;— John Wilander (@johnwilander) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/johnwilander/status/1381699191609561088?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="b488OU"&gt;Wilander’s reply jibes with Microsoft’s statement that “the industry is on a journey” when it comes to balancing new advertising technologies and privacy. But it speaks to something really important: web standards people take their jobs seriously and are seriously committed to the web standards process that creates the open web. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iqRgAK"&gt;I often make light of that process as being slow, contentious, and frustrating. It is all those things. But it’s also the last line of defense against the complete and total fracturing of the web into pages that are only compatible with specific web browsers. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/24/15681958/what-is-web-definition"&gt;That isn’t the web at all&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="S3ubRG"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"And now, a brief definition of the web ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/24/15681958/what-is-web-definition"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="ZZEWzu"&gt;And so what you’d expect to be a hard “no” from Apple (and what will almost surely be a hard “no” in the end) instead becomes a commitment to the web standards process and taking Google’s proposals seriously. Ditto from Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="epybuy"&gt;All of this is happening because every major browser already has or will soon block third-party cookies, the default way of identifying you and tracking you across the web. And every major browser has committed to ensuring that you can’t be personally identifiable to third-party advertisers. Even Google’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22310332/google-privacy-replacing-third-party-cookies-privacy-sandbox"&gt;own ad team has said as much&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JMYZkT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The future of the web is at stake&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EqbreL"&gt;The end of those cookies is called the Cookiepocalypse, and it’s apocalyptic because nobody really knows what advertisers will do once those tracking methods are raptured. And so right now, major browser vendors are proposing different, new solutions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sfsTHW"&gt;Apple, Google, and Microsoft all have ideas for how advertising on the web should work. We’ve discussed Google’s FLoC at length, but you might be surprised to hear that Apple isn’t just trying to stop all ads; it has &lt;a href="https://webkit.org/blog/8943/privacy-preserving-ad-click-attribution-for-the-web/"&gt;privacy-enhancing ad proposals of its own&lt;/a&gt;. And that random reference to PARAKEET in Microsoft’s statement? &lt;a href="https://github.com/WICG/privacy-preserving-ads/blob/main/Parakeet.md"&gt;Another ad proposal&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WfgRiE"&gt;The problem here is that the Cookiepocalypse is already nigh. Many browsers are already blocking third-party cookies. Google Chrome is the big holdout on blocking third-party cookies, but it’s also the browser with the biggest market share. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xp4baO"&gt;Google has committed to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/14/21064698/google-third-party-cookies-chrome-two-years-privacy-safari-firefox"&gt;cutting off third-party cookies in 2022&lt;/a&gt;, but it seems very unlikely that the web standards process will get to an answer by then. In fact, one of &lt;a href="https://www.adweek.com/programmatic/google-shelves-fledge-trials-until-late-2021/"&gt;Google’s other proposals isn’t going to begin testing until late this year&lt;/a&gt; — far too late to be implemented by the ad industry if Google sticks to its original promise. Who knows what advertisers will do then?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0PotSl"&gt;The technology here is complicated, the process is slow, and the outcome is unclear. That’s par for the course for the web. Normally I’d tell you not to worry about it and just let the W3C run its course. But the stakes are very high: your privacy, vast pools of money, and the interoperable nature of the web itself could all go up in a puff of smoke if these browser makers don’t figure out a way to thread all these needles. Cookiepocalypse, indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NLfY70"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update, 2:15PM ET April 16th&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: added statement from Opera.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The Unicode Emoji Subcommittee is back, baby</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GzN9UTgRfhfOLQDldBp7dIke2lE=/300x0:2100x1200/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69137593/final_Android_11_emoji.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Google&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nONfdU"&gt;After pausing its review of emoji submissions, the Unicode Emoji Subcommittee is back with tips for successful submissions, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jenniferdaniel/status/1382758288316502017"&gt;chair Jennifer Daniel announced.&lt;/a&gt; Anything you submit now could come to phones as soon as 2023 — but if you want to fine-tune your emoji, she’s got some suggestions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPFPX1"&gt;A good emoji has multiple uses, can be used with other emoji to create an emoji phrase, represents something new, and is distinct from existing emoji, Daniel writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="erDjSd"&gt;We won’t get new emoji this year; the Unicode Consortium — that’s the panel in charge of emoji releases — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/9/21214865/unicode-emoji-delay-2022-android-ios-mobile-release"&gt;delayed the version release&lt;/a&gt;. The delay was because Unicode relies on volunteers, and last year, the pandemic overwhelmed them. The next planned release is in 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T87NFN"&gt;Our own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21327599/how-to-make-emoji-yawning-face-waffle-proposal-unicode"&gt;Jay Peters has contributed to your emoji vocabulary&lt;/a&gt; with a yawn and a waffle. He submitted his proposal in 2017, and the new emoji hit phones everywhere in 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KNxDfR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Dogecoin is on a run, has escaped the yard, and is headed to the moon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Dogecoin logo" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/px4qoPMrTMFeETFXi7ZGqxDyLZg=/21x0:539x345/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69137451/Dogecoin_logo.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JRJotZ"&gt;Oh, super, Dogecoin is spiking. The joke currency, which as recently as January 27th was worth less than a cent, hit 47 cents this morning, according to Robinhood’s tracker. As I type this, &lt;a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/dogecoin/"&gt;the market cap is more than $51 billion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TGmGWI"&gt;The currency is based on an &lt;em&gt;au-courant-&lt;/em&gt;as-of-2013 meme of a Shiba Inu, and was intended to satirize bitcoin. Well, kids, the joke’s over. It’s now a top-10 cryptocurrency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fe6jgE"&gt;Weird year for finance, honestly. There was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22251427/reddit-gamestop-stock-short-wallstreetbets-robinhood-wall-street"&gt;the Gamestonk&lt;/a&gt; thing which made GameStop stock so valuable, &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gamestop-board-hestia-exclusive-idUSKBN2BV2VW"&gt;a member of the board of directors had to step down&lt;/a&gt; so that he could sell shares without restrictions. (Noted investor David Einhorn accused Elon Musk &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/investor-einhorn-says-palihapitiya-musk-poured-jet-fuel-gamestop-2021-04-15/"&gt;of pouring “jet fuel”&lt;/a&gt; on the January rally;&lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-02-04/elon-musk-s-gamestop-tweets-are-now-a-hedge-fund-signal?sref=M8H6LjUF"&gt; a hedge fund called the top&lt;/a&gt; of the January rally based on the Musk tweet and raked in the dough.) Keith “Roaring Kitty” Gill &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/16/roaring-kitty-stands-to-rake-in-millions-on-his-gamestop-options-bet-friday.html"&gt;stands to make millions&lt;/a&gt;, which he will presumably use to buy fancier headbands. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22310188/nft-explainer-what-is-blockchain-crypto-art-faq"&gt;NFT mania seized the world&lt;/a&gt;, after artist Beeple — aka Mike Winkelmann —  sold an NFT of &lt;em&gt;Everydays: The First 5,000 Days&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/11/22325054/beeple-christies-nft-sale-cost-everydays-69-million"&gt;for $69 million&lt;/a&gt;. Coinbase went public earlier this week, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2021/4/14/22383748/coinbase-nasdaq-ipo-direct-listing"&gt;closed its first day of trading worth more than the company behind the Nasdaq&lt;/a&gt;, the exchange it trades on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XBfbGF"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Doge Barking at the Moon &lt;a href="https://t.co/QFB81D7zOL"&gt;pic.twitter.com/QFB81D7zOL&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1382552587099062272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 15, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="zxZ04u"&gt;Last night, Musk — a shitposter with a hobby of being CEO of Tesla and SpaceX — tweeted “Doge Barking at the Moon.” For those of you fortunate enough to have avoided internet-related brainworms: a bunch of people probably thought this was a reference to a phrase used by internet traders, “to the moon.” Musk, who is known for coming to memes late, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1113009339743100929"&gt;has called dogecoin his favorite cryptocurrency.&lt;/a&gt; In February, he called it “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1357241340313141249"&gt;The People’s Crypto&lt;/a&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kKF1W0"&gt;Look, it’s not my fault that the interest rate is zero percent — that was always gonna make shit weird, because there’s almost nowhere safe to park your money without losing some of it to inflation. That means a lot more money is sloshing around than usual, which is fueling everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21502700/spac-explained-meaning-special-purpose-acquisition-company"&gt;SPACs&lt;/a&gt; to Gamestonk. What worries me is that we could be locked into zero interest rate policy world &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/31/the-fed-could-be-locked-into-zero-rates-for-five-years-or-even-longer.html"&gt;for as long as five years&lt;/a&gt;, which is an awfully long time for memes to mess with actual money. As long as there’s this much money sloshing around, anything goes. Anyway, if you are a hedge fund that called the top on Dogecoin based on an Elon Musk tweet, let me know — I’d love to interview you and find out how that call went.&lt;/p&gt;
