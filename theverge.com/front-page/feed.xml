    <title>Here are the latest accusations Activision Blizzard employees have leveled at the company</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SvzE3g"&gt;More disturbing allegations of Activision Blizzard’s reported culture of sexual harassment and gender-based discrimination have been reported in recent days, following a huge lawsuit filed against the company by California’s Department of Fair Employment and Housing (DFEH) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22588215/activision-blizzard-lawsuit-sexual-harassment-discrimination-pay"&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="883FDU"&gt;Details in these stories may be challenging to read, so we are prefacing them with &lt;strong&gt;a content warning for descriptions of sexual harassment&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RdUGx3"&gt;On Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/29/technology/activision-walkout-metoo-call-of-duty.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; posted a story&lt;/a&gt; of extremely distressing accounts of Activision Blizzard’s culture. Here is one from Shay Stein, a former customer service employee:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="rV3iMZ"&gt;Ms. Stein, 28, who worked at Activision from 2014 to 2017 in a customer service role, helping gamers with problems and glitches, said she had consistently been paid less than her ex-boyfriend, who joined the company at the same time she did and performed the same work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="elkVBU"&gt;Ms. Stein said she had once declined drugs that her manager offered at a holiday party in 2014 or 2015, which soured their relationship and hampered her career. In 2016, a manager messaged her on Facebook, suggesting she must be into “some freaky stuff” and asking what type of pornography she watched. She said she had also overheard male colleagues joking that some women had their jobs only because they performed sexual favors for male superiors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="RanNHC"&gt;And former vice president Lisa Welch shared an account of how an exec asked her to have sex with him “because she ‘deserved to have some fun’ after her boyfriend had died weeks earlier.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dxc9uQ"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3aq4vv/blizzard-recruiters-asked-hacker-if-she-liked-being-penetrated-at-job-fair"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt; published a disturbing report&lt;/a&gt; on Friday about the story of Emily Mitchell, a security researcher, who approached Blizzard’s booth at the Black Hat cybersecurity conference in 2015 and was harassed by Blizzard’s representatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="VPAjvq"&gt;When she got to the table, she said she asked about the penetration testing position. Penetration testing, or pentesting, is the industry term for a security audit. Mitchell said she was wearing a t-shirt made by cybersecurity company SecureState, which had “Penetration Expert” on the front. One of the Blizzard employees first asked if she was lost, another one asked if she was at the conference with her boyfriend, and another one asked if she even knew what pentesting was. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B315Gt"&gt;“One of them asked me when was the last time I was personally penetrated, if I liked being penetrated, and how often I got penetrated,” Mitchell told Waypoint. “I was furious and felt humiliated so I took the free swag and left.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wcBAp4"&gt;Mitchell would later work as the COO at a company called Sagitta HPC (now Terahash), and when Blizzard wanted to hire the company in 2017, she reported the incident to founder and CEO Jeremi Gosney, according to &lt;em&gt;Vice&lt;/em&gt;. Gosney posted his redacted email reply &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jmgosney/status/839727489635209216"&gt;on Twitter in March 2017&lt;/a&gt;, demanding that Blizzard fulfill several conditions if they were to work together, including a “50 percent misogyny tax” where the proceeds would be donated to three charities supporting women in technology, and that Blizzard send a letter of apology to Mitchell.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VqI6Yn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Not going to name-and-shame, but "Don't Be a Dick" is globally applicable. There are repercussions. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/womenintech?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#womenintech&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/InternationalWomensDay?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#InternationalWomensDay&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Wcds3a2bnA"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Wcds3a2bnA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Jeremi M. Gosney (@jmgosney) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jmgosney/status/839727489635209216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;March 9, 2017&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QVbwuO"&gt;Gosney &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jmgosney/status/1421225449351430145"&gt;confirmed Friday&lt;/a&gt; that the redacted name in the email was Blizzard.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oHUS8T"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-activision-blizzards-week-of-reckoning"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt; posted a big feature&lt;/a&gt; Friday detailing enormous challenges women have faced at Activision Blizzard. One harrowing example: men would walk into breastfeeding rooms, because at one point they didn’t have locks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="75wl28"&gt;A source who has since departed Blizzard talked about how the room designated for breastfeeding didn’t have locks. “Men would walk into the breastfeeding room. There was no way to lock the door. They would just stare and I would have to scream at them to leave.” IGN understands that breastfeeding rooms have since been updated, with locks added to doors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="wbg0Mw"&gt;&lt;em&gt;IGN’s&lt;/em&gt; article also added further detail to the allegation in the DFEH’s lawsuit that working at the company was “akin to working in a frat house:”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="KV3h5Y"&gt;Such stories abound at Activision Blizzard, compounded by a drinking culture that until recently was “insane,” a source said. One woman told me she “doggedly avoided” drinking events on campus because of their reputation. Another talked about how it was “much more sexual” in Blizzard’s main office in Irvine circa 2015, with women being subjected to inappropriate touching in the chest area and elsewhere, “sometimes at the holiday party, sometimes not.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="uko3mB"&gt;Activision Blizzard has taken steps to attempt to address the problematic drinking culture by introducing a two drink maximum at company events, according to &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;, a policy that was put in place in 2018, a company spokesperson told the publication.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bvJY8e"&gt;On Wednesday, Activision Blizzard employees walked out in protest of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598410/activision-blizzard-employee-walk-out-protest-sexism-discrimination-lawsuit"&gt;company’s handling of the lawsuit&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597166/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-letter-sexual-harrassment-allegations"&gt;Employees had signed a letter Monday&lt;/a&gt; slamming the company’s initial response. A day later, CEO Bobby Kotick attempted to address the allegations and concerns ahead of the planned walkout, calling Activision Blizzard’s response “tone deaf” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597166/activision-blizzard-ceo-bobby-kotick-letter-sexual-harrassment-allegations"&gt;in a public letter&lt;/a&gt;. Just before the walkout, employees responded to Kotick’s letter in turn, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/28/22598128/activision-blizzard-employees-ceo-letter-response-key-concerns"&gt;saying that it&lt;/a&gt; “fails to address critical elements at the heart of employee concerns.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZLJg1h"&gt;In a small positive step, the &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League, which is owned by Activision Blizzard, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/overwatchleague/status/1421183813221109760"&gt;committed Friday to donating to “worthy causes.”&lt;/a&gt; But the league took that step after &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; League teams the Washington Justice and the Houston Outlaws jointly &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/washjustice/status/1420851121833320450"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Outlaws/status/1420851140422426624"&gt;Thursday&lt;/a&gt; they would be donating to RAINN and Big Sister Little Sister.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0Qy4ka"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;

    <title>After accusations, Twitter will pay hackers to find biases in its automatic image crops  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Twitter bird logo in white against a dark background with outlined logos around it and red circles rippling out from it." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WQp_ZzJR2pggc740UT7tRDi6ITA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69659119/acastro_180827_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="y3zSi5"&gt;Twitter is &lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/insights/2021/algorithmic-bias-bounty-challenge"&gt;holding a competition&lt;/a&gt; in hopes that hackers and researchers will be able to identify biases in its image cropping algorithm — and it’s going to be handing out cash prizes to winning teams (&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/twitter-bug-bounty-contest-algorithm-bias-image-cropping-185634779.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Twitter is hoping that giving teams access to its code and image cropping model will let them find ways that the algorithm could be harmful (such as it cropping in a way that stereotypes or erases the image’s subject).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CXbxoN"&gt;Those competing will &lt;a href="https://hackerone.com/twitter-algorithmic-bias"&gt;have to submit a description of their findings&lt;/a&gt;, and a dataset that can be run through the algorithm to demonstrate the issue. Twitter will then assign points based on what kind of harms are found, how much it could potentially affect people, and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcfeXl"&gt;The winning team will be awarded $3,500, and there are separate $1,000 prizes for the most innovative and most generalizable findings. That amount &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/1421174066849931265"&gt;has caused a bit of a stir&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter, with a few users saying it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gr2m/status/1421179586813960192?s=20"&gt;should have an extra zero&lt;/a&gt;. For context, Twitter’s &lt;a href="https://hackerone.com/twitter?type=team"&gt;normal bug bounty program&lt;/a&gt; would pay you $2,940 if you found a bug that let you perform actions for someone else (like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/6/11/5800370/tweetdeck-vulnerability-lets-attackers-execute-code-remotely"&gt;retweeting a tweet or image&lt;/a&gt;) using cross-site scripting. Finding an OAuth issue that lets you take over someone’s Twitter account would net you $7,700. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="UX44mR"&gt;&lt;q&gt;A competition lets Twitter get feedback from a much broader range of perspectives&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xU7J3v"&gt;Twitter has done its own research into its image-cropping algorithm before — in May, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22444372/twitter-image-crop-racial-gender-bias-research"&gt;it published a paper&lt;/a&gt; investigating how the algorithm was biased, after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323298/twitter-image-cropping-preview-problematic-racial-bias-testing-fix"&gt;accusations that its previews crops were racist&lt;/a&gt;. Twitter’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/5/22421574/twitter-crop-issue-bigger-images-rollout"&gt;mostly done away with&lt;/a&gt; algorithmically cropping previews since then, but it’s still used on desktop and a good cropping algorithm is a handy thing for a company like Twitter to have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6B4n0G"&gt;Opening up a competition lets Twitter get feedback from a much broader range of perspectives. For example, the Twitter team &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ruchowdh/status/1420820892398014464?s=20"&gt;held a space&lt;/a&gt; to discuss the competition during which a team member mentioned getting questions about caste-based biases in the algorithm, something that may not be noticeable to software developers in California.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="IL8DDD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Twitter is also looking for ways its algorithm could be exploited&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SOPLMv"&gt;It’s also not just subconscious algorithmic bias Twitter is looking for. The rubric has point values for both intentional and unintentional harms. Twitter defines unintentional harms as crops that could result from a “well-intentioned” user posting a regular image on the platform, whereas intentional harms are problematic cropping behaviors that could be exploited by someone posting maliciously designed images.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9MZGBA"&gt;Twitter says in its announcement blog that the competition is separate from &lt;a href="https://hackerone.com/twitter?type=team"&gt;its bug bounty program&lt;/a&gt; — if you submit a report about algorithmic biases to Twitter outside of the competition, the company says your report will be closed and marked as not applicable. If you’re interested in joining, you can &lt;a href="https://hackerone.com/twitter-algorithmic-bias"&gt;head over to the competition’s HackerOne page&lt;/a&gt; to see the rules, criteria, and more. Submissions are open until August 6th at 11:59PM PT, and the winners of the challenge will be announced at the Def Con AI Village on August 9th.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mastodon now has an official iPhone app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UuqtDryL8A5gdJtWPwW5ae3Yd54=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69658958/mastodon.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ucykbC"&gt;Decentralized social network Mastodon now has an official iPhone app. The nonprofit behind Mastodon &lt;a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mastodon-for-iphone/id1571998974"&gt;launched the app&lt;/a&gt; on iOS today, supplementing an existing web version and several &lt;a href="https://joinmastodon.org/apps"&gt;third-party apps&lt;/a&gt; for iOS, Android, and other platforms. The app is free and offers a similar feature set to Mastodon’s core service, although it doesn’t include Mastodon’s broad local and federated timelines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TtPWX7"&gt;Mastodon describes the app as particularly geared toward getting new users on board the nontraditional social platform. As we’ve &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/7/15183128/mastodon-open-source-twitter-clone-how-to-use"&gt;outlined before&lt;/a&gt;, Mastodon looks similar to Twitter but is built around &lt;a href="https://joinmastodon.org/communities"&gt;independently run communities&lt;/a&gt; (and the &lt;a href="https://activitypub.rocks/"&gt;ActivityPub&lt;/a&gt; protocol) rather than a single central network. You can create your account on a community of your choice while following and messaging people in other communities as well. It’s an unusual design among modern social platforms, and offering an official iOS entry point could help ease people into it more smoothly. CEO Eugen Rochko confirmed plans for a comparable Android app, but there’s no timeline for releasing it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YDrL1W"&gt;Mastodon’s iOS app supports features like polls and sensitive content filters, and the app page subtly highlights its differences with bigger services like Twitter by mentioning Mastodon’s “ad-free, chronological timeline.” As mentioned above, however, you &lt;em&gt;won’t&lt;/em&gt; find a section for local and federated timelines — Mastodon’s firehose of all public posts from your home community and the communities of people linked with it, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcDHdT"&gt;Rochko tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that those timelines were a “suboptimal” way to discover new content, and excluding them also reduced the potential for conflict with Apple, which has required some social networks to limit what users can find through their apps. (Reddit’s iOS app, for instance, makes you opt into NSFW content through the web.) For a different feature set, you can keep using one of the existing iOS apps — or just log in through the web.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>A Tesla Megapack burst into flames at ‘Victorian Big Battery’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A rendering of the “Victorian Big Battery.”" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/t9ran_NXmsSFkbvZS5RfpF3IXME=/1x0:1999x1332/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69658426/VBB_Our_Battery.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A rendering of what the “Victorian Big Battery” will look like when completed.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Neoen&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QRoUZL"&gt;A Tesla Megapack &lt;a href="https://victorianbigbattery.com.au/incident-at-vbb/"&gt;caught fire&lt;/a&gt; today during initial testing of a highly &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21551342/australia-power-grid-victorian-big-battery"&gt;anticipated new utility-scale battery&lt;/a&gt; in Victoria, Australia. Luckily, there were no injuries or disruptions to the local electricity supply, &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2021/07/30/tesla-megapack-caught-fire-at-victorian-big-battery-site-in-australia.html"&gt;CNBC&lt;/a&gt; reports. The blaze posed no risk of spreading to the nearby community, according to &lt;a href="http://bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-30/fire-erupts-at-tesla-big-battery-in-australia-during-testing?utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cmpid=socialflow-twitter-business&amp;amp;utm_campaign=socialflow-organic&amp;amp;utm_content=business&amp;amp;sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, but it did trigger a toxic smoke warning for residents who were told to stay indoors, the &lt;a href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/the-economy/fire-breaks-out-during-testing-of-victorian-big-battery-near-geelong-20210730-p58eh4.html"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sydney Morning Herald&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; reported. The cause of the fire is still unclear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KZTrBh"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;JUST IN: Fire crews are currently on the scene of a battery fire at Moorabool, near Geelong. Firefighters are working to contain the fire and stop it spreading to the nearby batteries. &lt;a href="https://t.co/5zYfOfohG3"&gt;https://t.co/5zYfOfohG3&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/7NEWS?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#7NEWS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/HAkFY27JgQ"&gt;pic.twitter.com/HAkFY27JgQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— 7NEWS Melbourne (@7NewsMelbourne) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/7NewsMelbourne/status/1420932114296446987?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jczpWD"&gt;The fire affected the aptly named “Victorian Big Battery.” Spanning an area nearly as big as a football stadium, it’s one of the largest in the world. It’s &lt;a href="https://www.neoen.com/var/fichiers/2021-02-25-media-release-vbb-fc.pdf"&gt;scheduled&lt;/a&gt; to be operational by the end of this year, and the 300MW battery should be able to store enough energy to power more than a million homes in Victoria for half an hour. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9Up7O"&gt;That’s supposed to help prevent &lt;a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-01-26/victorian-blackouts-what-caused-them-and-is-this-the-new-normal/10751412"&gt;blackouts&lt;/a&gt; that have affected hundreds of thousands of homes in the region in recent years, especially in the summer when demand for electricity spikes. Giant batteries are also crucial to meeting environmental and renewable energy goals. The state of Victoria aims to get half of its electricity from renewable sources like wind and solar power by 2030. Batteries can fill in the gaps in energy supply when the sun doesn’t shine and winds don’t blow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dbcP7l"&gt;French renewable energy company Neoen is developing the Victorian Big Battery alongside Tesla and energy company AusNet Services. Neoen and Tesla brought another grid-scale battery online &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/1/16723186/elon-musk-battery-launched-south-australia"&gt;in 2017&lt;/a&gt;, which was the largest lithium-ion battery in the world at the time.  Neoen did not immediately respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/TLA4kbFVe5yIvwBFZjqDivBJqpw=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69658113/Google_Apple_App_Dominance2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dNu3A0"&gt;Every Friday, &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; publishes our flagship podcast, &lt;a href="http://theverge.com/the-vergecast"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Vergecast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, where co-hosts Nilay Patel and Dieter Bohn discuss the week in tech news with the reporters and editors covering the biggest stories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eR9GXx"&gt;This week on &lt;em&gt;The Vergecast, &lt;/em&gt;Nilay and Dieter bring back &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;managing editor Alex Cranz and &lt;em&gt;Verge&lt;/em&gt; news editor Chaim Gartenberg to chat about the headlines. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iAzEz0"&gt;It’s earnings week once again. Unsurprisingly, all of the big tech companies made a lot of money this past quarter. Our podcast crew dives into the numbers behind the profits of Google, Microsoft, Samsung, Amazon, and Apple and what it means for each business’s future goals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rq9qnE"&gt;The show also dedicates some time to discuss Intel’s business. Chaim leads the discussion after writing a story about Intel’s worst summer last year and how it’s been fighting its way back since then. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="5i9dTN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4DRLPg"&gt;You can listen to the full discussion here or in your preferred podcast player. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>June heatwave was the ‘most extreme’ on record for North America</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Fires in Lytton, British Columbia" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OGjpyoSwIcznEVGPYfXzTOnoos8=/0x0:5760x3840/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69657783/1233843473.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="2HksXk"&gt;The devastating heatwave that struck the Northwest US and southwest Canada in June was “the most extreme summer heatwave” ever recorded in North America, according to a new &lt;a href="http://berkeleyearth.org/june-2021-temperature-update/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; from nonprofit research group Berkeley Earth. That’s based on the magnitude of the heatwave, or how much warmer it was than normal. Record temperatures in the region reached roughly 20 degrees Celsius (or 36 °F) hotter than average in June. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="t6Km4B"&gt;Canada recorded its &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2021/06/30/canada-record-heat-experts-react/"&gt;hottest temperature ever&lt;/a&gt; on June 29th when the village of Lytton in British Columbia reached an astonishing 49.6 degrees Celsius (121 degrees Fahrenheit). Typical temperatures there in June are closer to 20 to 30 degrees Celsius (68 to 86 degrees Fahrenheit). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="OcqjHk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The consequences of that heat are staggering&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vuyuqh"&gt;The consequences of that heat are staggering. Scorching temperatures fed wildfires, which burned down &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/08/americas/canada-lytton-wildfire-climate-change-indigenous-intl-cmd/index.html"&gt;90 percent of Lytton&lt;/a&gt;. There were at least &lt;a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-heat-dome-sudden-deaths-570-1.6122316"&gt;570 heat-related deaths in Canada&lt;/a&gt; and at least &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/jul/08/pacific-northwest-heatwave-deaths#:~:text=Record%2Dbreaking%20US%20Pacific%20north%2Dwest%20heatwave%20killed%20almost%20200%20people,-Officials%20reported%20116&amp;amp;text=The%20death%20toll%20from%20the,and%2078%20in%20Washington%20state."&gt;194 in the US&lt;/a&gt;. Thousands more people wound up &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/16/22580120/emergency-department-visits-spiked-june-heat-wave-us-northwest"&gt;in emergency departments&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Mz8ei1"&gt;The late June heatwave was a “1,000-year event…hopefully,” according to a preliminary &lt;a href="https://climate.gov/news-features/event-tracker/preliminary-analysis-concludes-pacific-northwest-heat-wave-was-1000-year"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The severity of the heat would have been “virtually impossible” without human-caused climate change, both NOAA and a separate &lt;a href="https://www.worldweatherattribution.org/western-north-american-extreme-heat-virtually-impossible-without-human-caused-climate-change/"&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; from an international team of researchers found. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="id__gejqvpocyna"&gt;For the entire Northern Hemisphere, it was the warmest June on record averaged across all land areas. Nearly 4 percent of the surface of the Earth hit record high average temperatures during the first half of 2021, according to the Berkeley Earth analysis. That’s despite the cooling effect of a La Niña event. Looking at the first six months of the year, “Nowhere has been record cold,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RARohde/status/1421131167210819599"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Berkeley Earth lead scientist Robert Rohde.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="7c6MKA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The odds of more “record-shattering” heatwaves&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yuja40"&gt;Globally, the odds of more “record-shattering” heatwaves like the one that took such a huge toll in the US and Canada in June are likely on the rise. Prolonged, record-breaking extreme heat events are two to seven times more likely to take place from now until 2050 compared to the previous three decades, according to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22594471/heatwaves-prediction-more-study-climate-change"&gt;research&lt;/a&gt; published earlier this week. That estimate is based on a scenario in which greenhouse gas emissions stay high, like they are today. There’s still some hope of avoiding that future — but first, humanity &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22522736/carbon-dioxide-co2-record-climate-change"&gt;will have to stop burning&lt;/a&gt; quite so many&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;fossil fuels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TX2sM4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>‘May be an image’: what it’s like browsing Instagram while blind</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Animation of a blank Instagram post on the left emitting an audio waveform that breaks apart before reaching an ear on the right." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/znhhRhwoXG3kuYzwCPkZfgBYjcU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69657662/VRG_ILLO_4686_Social_Media_A11y_002.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The ridiculous sounds of social sites&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="WWfjrj"&gt;Using a screen reader to navigate Instagram, as some people with low vision do, is a strange patchwork of sounds. It can be overwhelming, especially if you’re used to quickly scanning information with your eyes, to hear a synthetic voice clunkily rattle off usernames, timestamps, and like counts as though they’re all equally important as the actual content of the post. Among all that auditory stimulation, if someone added alt text to their photo, you might hear something like “John and I standing with our ankles in the water at the beach. John is making a distressed face while I menacingly hold out a dead crab and laugh.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iTXr2N"&gt;The image descriptions used by screen readers have to be added by users, and like many accessibility features in social media, those fields are regularly neglected. In those cases, the voice will sometimes recite alt text that Instagram or the user’s device generates automatically. The result, Danielle McCann, the social media coordinator for the National Federation of the Blind, tells me, can be pretty funny. The descriptions that have evolved from &lt;a href="https://tech.fb.com/how-facebook-is-using-ai-to-improve-photo-descriptions-for-people-who-are-blind-or-visually-impaired/"&gt;years of machine learning&lt;/a&gt; still often misidentify what’s happening in photos. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VDNI3j"&gt;Recently, she was scrolling through Instagram when her screen reader said there was a photo of “two brown cats lying on a textured surface.” Her husband informed her that it was actually a bridal shop ad featuring a woman in a wedding dress. “Thank goodness I wasn’t [commenting] like, ‘Oh those cats are cute,’ you know?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wUS7yR"&gt;These kinds of algorithmic misinterpretations are pretty common. Here’s a sampling of descriptions I heard while I browsed Instagram with VoiceOver on my phone: “red polo, apple, unicorn” (a photo of a T-shirt with a drawing of a couch on it), “may be an image of indoor” (a photo of a cat next to a house plant), “may be an image of food” (a photo of sea shells), “may be a cartoon” (almost every illustration or comic panel), and a whole lot of “may be an image of one person” (a variety of photos featuring one or more people).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yyubbx"&gt;As devices have gained accessibility settings like magnification, high contrast, and built-in screen readers, social media has also slowly become more accessible for people who are blind or have low vision: many sites and apps respond to users’ device settings, have options to toggle light and dark modes, and enable users to compose image descriptions. But the existence of those features doesn’t guarantee people with disabilities won’t be excluded online. Social media accessibility is a group effort. People have to know about the features, understand what they are, and actually remember to use them. A platform can have a hundred accessibility options, but without buy-in from every user, people are still left out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iXy3xP"&gt;Even when people use alt text, they often don’t fully think through what’s important to convey to someone who can’t see photos. Some people will write overly simplistic descriptions like “red flower” or “blonde girl looking at sky,” without actually describing what it is about the images that makes them worth sharing. At the other end, multiple paragraphs of text to describe one image can be annoying to navigate with a screen reader. McCann tells friends to think of alt text as a writing exercise: “How do you provide as much information in as few words as possible?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K67Hzr"&gt;“The general rule is to be informative, not poetic,” says the American Foundation for the Blind (AFB). “But on social media, feel free to add some personality — you’re probably sharing that picture of your dog because he has a hilarious quizzical expression, for example, not because he is a black-and-white pitbull mix.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcv144"&gt;While automated image descriptions might eventually improve beyond the level of mistaking a woman in a wedding dress for some cats, they can’t replace the human element. Facebook had an &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/3/20681231/facebook-outage-image-tags-captions-ai-machine-learning-revealed"&gt;image outage&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 that showed all of its users the photo tags that are usually hidden, displaying machine-assigned descriptors like “Image may contain: people standing.” Are the people contained in that image embracing and making goofy faces? Are they standing in front of a breathtaking vista? Social media can feel a lot less social if your access to the content shared within it relies on computers’ conservative interpretations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VKvMyR"&gt;Advocates stress that accessibility should always be a consideration from the start, “not as an add-on to an already-existing platform well after the fact,” says AFB. But most popular platforms, including Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok, didn’t take that route during initial development, and are instead constantly playing catch-up to improve their accessibility. When those improvements roll out, it’s never guaranteed that people will consistently use them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="kwIby5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Just because they’re visual doesn’t mean that they’re immediately not attractive to people who are blind or low vision”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="nuEW73"&gt;One of the biggest barriers is the assumption that blind people just won’t be interested in visual media. “Just because they’re visual doesn’t mean that they’re immediately not attractive to people who are blind or low vision,” says McCann. “I think that’s one big misconception: ‘Oh, well, they don’t care about pictures.’ But we do.” When culture is molded on social networks, it sucks to lose out on a shared social language because you can’t see the images everyone is talking about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HzvxYs"&gt;Christy Smith Berman, a low vision editor at Can I Play That, responded to a TT Games tweet that announced the delay of &lt;em&gt;Star Wars Lego&lt;/em&gt; with text on an image. When she replied with a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/thepuppiesNpink/status/1377987541870243843"&gt;request for alt text&lt;/a&gt;, Smith Berman was met with responses from people expressing disbelief that blind people would even be on Twitter to begin with, let alone care about video games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MPr53L"&gt;Those false assumptions often mean that people are left out of fun cultural moments on social media. Memes usually involve rapidly evolving iterations of undescribed images with tiny words in weird fonts. Viral videos are reposted and shared without any kind of description, through audio or text, of what’s happening on-screen. “Oh, that must be somebody dancing,” thinks McCann when she encounters a TikTok with no audio besides music. “Well, no, it’s actually somebody making a cheesesteak. But I didn’t know that because there’s no audio indication.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1J2rQ"&gt;“A lot of the memes that people share, they don’t add alt text to it,” says Steven Aquino, a legally blind journalist. Aquino doesn’t use a screen reader, instead relying on magnification, but he’s still sometimes left wondering what’s going on in memes. “It’s really hard because I can’t see so well, and I just feel like, ‘Okay, it’s supposed to be funny, but I can’t tell.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zGwgYM"&gt;Beyond a simple neglect of accessibility features, conveying visual humor through text isn’t something everyone has a knack for. The funniest images rely on comedic timing through careful visual composition, prior knowledge of a specific meme, or familiarity with several different cultural references. Writing an image description for an esoteric meme can feel like explaining internet culture to your grandparents: you suddenly don’t know how to describe what exactly made you laugh. The complicated nature of meme literacy isn’t something we can blame on platforms — it’s just not something the average person is used to putting into words. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7KqKMu"&gt;But there are other less complicated factors that can impact the online experiences of people who are blind or have low vision. Aquino points out that people will use special unicode characters in their Twitter display names that are harder to read and aren’t interpreted as letters by screen reading software. A screen reader isn’t technically incorrect if it reads a character as “mathematical bold capital,” but most sighted people will read it simply as a letter with different formatting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You       it's    ℯ to       your tweets and usernames         . But have you          to what it             with assistive technologies like          ? &lt;a href="https://t.co/CywCf1b3Lm"&gt;pic.twitter.com/CywCf1b3Lm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Kent C. Dodds (@kentcdodds) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/1083073242330361856?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 9, 2019&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="WinCPc"&gt;“For people that do use screen readers, this software is only so smart,” says Aquino. “So if you’ve got a clever name, your voiceover or whatever it is that you use is going to fail.” Tweets that include rows of emojis, or a lot of special characters to create an image or convey cursive script, can be &lt;a href="https://youtu.be/ieAkh6rMARc"&gt;hellish to listen to&lt;/a&gt; when they’re read by a screen reader. Posting a screenshot of the tweet with alt text is a workable alternative, but people rarely know to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QRaKBL"&gt;McCann is glad that many sites have improved their accessibility options over the years, but she wishes they were more widely used and wonders why they aren’t better promoted. TikTok has &lt;a href="https://www.tiktok.com/accessibility/en-us/"&gt;text to speech&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612380/tiktok-photosensitive-epilepsy-warning-update-coming"&gt;warns people&lt;/a&gt; when flashing effects in their videos might trigger seizures, so why can’t all social sites have better prompts for encouraging users to add captions, visual descriptions, and alt text? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e8MLce"&gt;“The onus is on the disability community to educate,” she says. “Why isn’t there more education from these mainstream companies?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="hU0uVJ"&gt;McCann wishes it were easier for her to join the party when things like TikTok videos go viral. “Unless I have someone sit with me and explain to me what’s going on, I definitely feel like I can’t have a conversation about it with someone,” she says. “It is exclusionary to a point, because I like jokes. I like pasta recipes. I want to know that stuff! I’m still a part of the social fabric.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RIgILf"&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk calls Apple’s App Store fees a ‘de facto global tax on the Internet’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Saturday Night Live - Season 46" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/K8qmgti1mlml3NmF5TTdl1BeUAU=/0x1:3000x2001/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69657521/1232778207.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="WC23UO"&gt;Elon Musk has had a busy Friday on Twitter. After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/30/22602017/elon-musk-tim-cook-apple-ceo-demand-tesla-acquisition"&gt;flatly denying that he has ever spoken to Apple CEO Tim Cook&lt;/a&gt; in response to a wild story alleging he demanded to take over as the company’s CEO as part of an acquisition offer, Musk has now tweeted his support of Epic Games’ fight against Apple over App Store policies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypPcEN"&gt;“Apple app store fees are a de facto global tax on the Internet,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421152540394143746"&gt;he said&lt;/a&gt;. “Epic is right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="tgM4kg"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Apple app store fees are a de facto global tax on the Internet. Epic is right.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421152540394143746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mmbDWB"&gt;Epic is currently embroiled in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22410877/epic-games-apple-app-store-antitrust-trial-lawsuit-news"&gt;a legal battle with Apple&lt;/a&gt;, arguing that its App Store rules, which allow Apple to take a 30 percent commission on many transactions on the App Store, are unfair and anti-competitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RiXz6b"&gt;Perhaps aiming to take advantage of the massive spotlight Musk is bringing to the fight by tweeting about it to his 58.7 million followers, CEO Tim Sweeney, who has been a vocal opponent of Apple on Twitter, posted his latest salvo against the iPhone maker just 25 minutes after Musk’s tweet. “In the future all physical goods will have a digital presence, and Apple will tax and gatekeep world commerce,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1421156142047170567"&gt;Sweeney said&lt;/a&gt;. “Apple must be stopped.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="nhEBpM"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;The Apple Tax is far more pernicious than many realize. “It only applies to digital goods accessible on iOS”, they say — but in the future all physical goods will have a digital presence, and Apple will tax and gatekeep world commerce. Apple must be stopped.&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Sweeney (@TimSweeneyEpic) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1421156142047170567?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xS2O2V"&gt;Apple has not replied to a request for comment. Epic pointed &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to Sweeney’s tweet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gTt2vb"&gt;Epic faced off with Apple in court for much of the month of May, and while we’re still awaiting a verdict on the lawsuit, the trial itself &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;revealed all sorts of interesting information&lt;/a&gt;. Epic has also filed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/22/22583467/epic-fortnite-google-play-store-lawsuit-amended-complaint-filed"&gt;an antitrust suit against Google&lt;/a&gt; over Play Store policies, though that case is moving more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Jnkh7y"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 30th, 3:28PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added that Epic pointed us to Sweeney’s tweet.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk and Apple deny wild story that he tried to replace Tim Cook </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla CEO Elon Musk Testifies In SolarCity Trial" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PB8X5BB1v1lSmOKT3NMpA6tkUZE=/0x0:5167x3445/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69657090/1233956452.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="h6GRyd"&gt;Tesla CEO Elon Musk reportedly demanded to become Apple’s CEO in a 2016 phone call with current Apple CEO Tim Cook, according to an upcoming book about Tesla. The story, shared by &lt;a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2021-07-30/power-play-tesla-book-review"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, comes from &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Power-Play-Tesla-Elon-Century-ebook/dp/B08MQ4KWWR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Power Play: Tesla, Elon Musk, and the Bet of the Century&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; reporter Tim Higgins.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J05FIO"&gt;As the book tells it, Cook suggested to Musk that Apple acquire Tesla, and Musk said he wanted to be CEO. Cook reportedly agreed, but Musk clarified that he wanted to be the CEO of Apple. “According to a former aide who heard (Musk’s) retelling of the exchange,” Cook said “Fuck you” before hanging up the phone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F3B4B3"&gt;But Musk and Apple have both suggested that the conversation couldn’t have happened because Musk and Cook have never spoken.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMiQC5"&gt;Musk, in a tweet on Friday, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421150913075503112"&gt;flat out said that&lt;/a&gt; “Cook &amp;amp; I have never spoken or written to each other ever.” He also said that he attempted to meet with Cook about Apple acquiring Tesla, a meeting that Cook refused. (Musk previously discussed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195959/elon-musk-tesla-tim-cook-apple-sale-meeting-acquisition-refused"&gt;this attempted meeting in December&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="gpC1X4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Cook &amp;amp; I have never spoken or written to each other ever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There was a point where I requested to meet with Cook to talk about Apple buying Tesla. There were no conditions of acquisition proposed whatsoever. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He refused to meet. Tesla was worth about 6% of today’s value.&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421150913075503112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="saX9fM"&gt;When asked for comment about the reported conversation, Apple pointed to remarks Cook made during an interview with &lt;em&gt;The New York Times’&lt;/em&gt; Kara Swisher where he denied having ever spoken to Elon. “You know, I’ve never spoken to Elon, although I have great admiration and respect for the company he’s built,” &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/05/opinion/apples-ceo-is-making-very-different-choices-from-mark-zuckerberg.html?showTranscript=1"&gt;Cook said&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TXM0qp"&gt;Musk also claims that much of the book is false. “Higgins managed to make his book both false *and* boring,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421145405530771458"&gt;Musk said in a tweet on Friday&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="QTfPhv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Higgins managed to make his book both false *and* boring   &lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421145405530771458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gG8JnF"&gt;And Musk apparently tried to dash cold water on the book while it was being written, telling Higgins that much of the book was “nonsense,” according to the &lt;em&gt;Los Angeles Times&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="InHm3k"&gt;Musk apparently did not participate in the creation of “Power Play.” In an author’s note at the end, Higgins writes that Musk “was given numerous opportunities to comment on the stories, facts, and characterizations presented in these pages. Without pointing to any specific inaccuracies, he offered simply this: ‘Most, but not all, of what you read in this book is nonsense.’”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Hpddym"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timkhiggins/status/1421156081041088512"&gt;Higgins says&lt;/a&gt; that Musk had “plenty of opportunities” to comment and that the story of the conversation with Cook “comes from Musk’s own account of the conversation, according to people who heard the retelling at the time.” In an earlier tweet, he also characterized the story of Musk and Cook’s conversation &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timkhiggins/status/1421138332814303233?s=21"&gt;as one that was&lt;/a&gt; “told inside Tesla as the company struggled with the Model X.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fbkLaC"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Musk was given plenty of opportunities to comment on this. He didn’t. This anecdote comes from Musk’s own account of the conversation, according to people who heard the retelling at the time. &lt;a href="https://t.co/GRKZRBsaeR"&gt;https://t.co/GRKZRBsaeR&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Higgins (@timkhiggins) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timkhiggins/status/1421156081041088512?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="T4Bjev"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;As detailed in POWER PLAY, this is a story that was told inside Tesla as the company struggled with the Model X, according to people who heard it, and as some hoped for a white knight to save the day. Musk’s message was clear: Tesla’s fate was in their own hands. &lt;a href="https://t.co/4e0KJb3CD2"&gt;https://t.co/4e0KJb3CD2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Tim Higgins (@timkhiggins) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timkhiggins/status/1421138332814303233?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 30, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="choHTi"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/timkhiggins/status/1421138447595675651?s=21"&gt;He also says that Apple&lt;/a&gt; “was given several opportunities to comment prior publication and declined.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VBMLtg"&gt;Higgins has not replied to a request for comment. A representative for the book’s publisher pointed to Higgins’ Twitter feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v9HdbE"&gt;Shortly after tweeting that he has never met Cook, Musk tweeted in support of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22454959/epic-apple-trial-recap-video-tim-cook-xbox-playstation-business"&gt;Epic’s fight against Apple and its rules on the App Store&lt;/a&gt;. “Apple app store fees are a de facto global tax on the Internet,” &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1421152540394143746"&gt;Musk said&lt;/a&gt;. “Epic is right.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6C7Y6P"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update July 30th, 3:47PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added response from the book’s publisher.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is facing a subpoena for millions of documents in Google’s antitrust case</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q2Mk6w1XOp2h85tl1TBikvV0bgc=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69656859/acastro_210121_1777_google_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7bYHJu"&gt;The sweeping federal antitrust case against Google has given rise to a significant fight over data held by Microsoft, and the company is now facing a subpoena for millions of documents that could shed light on its attempts to compete with Google’s search engine. Having initially cooperated with prosecutors in building an antitrust case against Google, Microsoft could be obligated to produce millions more documents at the request of Google’s defense team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FwFB3H"&gt;At a status hearing on Friday morning, Judge Amit Mehta heard arguments from both Google and Microsoft on the issue, but ultimately found more information was required before the court could give guidance as to how much internal data Microsoft would be required to produce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="OtQ38e"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“No third party is more central to this litigation than Microsoft”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="M62YXy"&gt;“These are hard issues for any judge to resolve in a way that’s objective and meaningful,” Mehta told attorneys, “and that’s particularly so given that, with respect to the additional custodians, I don’t have any sense of the volume that would produce … or what that volume would mean for the timing of production.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZTnd6"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-sues-monopolist-google-violating-antitrust-laws"&gt;Filed in October 2020&lt;/a&gt;, the Department of Justice’s antitrust case against Google focuses on anti-competitive behavior in search and search advertising, alleging among other claims that the company’s exclusivity agreements on Android and iOS shut out competing search engines. Separate antitrust cases against Google have also been filed focusing on the company’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/16/22333848/google-antitrust-lawsuit-texas-complaint-chrome-privacy"&gt;browser privacy settings&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22186994/google-search-antitrust-lawsuit-colorado-nebraska-state-ags"&gt;alleged manipulation of search results&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2J1V9J"&gt;In advance of the Department of Justice filing charges, Microsoft provided more than 400,000 documents to civil investigative demands from prosecutors. In a filing before today’s hearing, Google &lt;a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/21020163-google-microsoft-subpoena-compliance"&gt;argued&lt;/a&gt; that participation entitles the company to a similar range of documents that might be helpful to its defense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="zdCpz4"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“These executives cover issues at the core of the case,” says Google&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="x3Ii7K"&gt;“No third party is more central to this litigation than Microsoft. The DOJ and Colorado Complaints refer to it or its products dozens of times,” Google’s filing reads. “Having so obviously pressed for and cooperated in the preparation of the present Complaints to be filed against Google, Microsoft cannot credibly avoid significant discovery in these cases.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ki2vR7"&gt;Google first issued a subpoena to Microsoft in April, seeking “older documents that will shed light on whether Microsoft was actually restrained from competing with Google, or whether it simply failed to compete successfully on the merits.” But Microsoft agreed to only eight of the 27 executives to be searched, and drastically limited the search strings to which they would be subject. Google is now asking for a more powerful court order to compel the production of documents from Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nQP43v"&gt;In an appendix to its filing, Google listed 19 current and former Microsoft executives who may hold communications relevant to the case, including former Windows Phone chief Andrew Lees and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/12/4515830/terry-myerson-microsoft-windows-reorganization"&gt;former Windows head Terry Myerson&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kmcIXV"&gt;“These executives cover issues at the core of the case: the development and distribution of Microsoft’s various search engines, Microsoft’s search advertising business, and Microsoft’s effort to market devices that would give it yet more search access points beyond the ever-present Windows desktop,” the filing reads. “Google simply seeks discovery commensurate with Plaintiffs’ allegations, which reach back two decades.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Drctt9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/18552824/169/united-states-of-america-v-google-llc/"&gt;In its own filing&lt;/a&gt;, Microsoft pushed back against this logic, arguing Google is filing unnecessarily broad requests in an effort to additionally delay the case. “In the past nine days, in fact, Google has proposed seventeen&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;additional custodians,” Microsoft’s filing claims, “including nine on July 19, five on July 26, and three today, July 27. Google has not explained why it believes searching these additional twenty-eight custodians ... is necessary.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KVYq9s"&gt;Weighing the two arguments, the court seemed to slightly favor Google’s side of the case, but ultimately asked for more data on the burden required to produce the documents. “The description of the people [Google has] identified as additional custodians certainly struck me as not reaching,” Judge Mehta said, “and I haven’t heard Microsoft say today that there’s minimal chance that they’re likely to have records at all that are responsive and relevant.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JT7QOM"&gt;However, the court ultimately found there was insufficient information about the burden posed by production, and the dispute is likely to continue at least until August 20th, the deadline set for further filings on the subject.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1kh5UE"&gt;“The best I can do for you today is to give you a deadline by which to get back to me with concrete information,” Judge Mehta told the parties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iRUtgj"&gt;The finding is one more turn in what is likely to be a long and contentious discovery period for the antitrust case. Microsoft says it believes the first phase of its own document production will last until at least October of this year. Trial proceedings for &lt;em&gt;US v. Google&lt;/em&gt; are scheduled to begin on September 12th, 2023.&lt;/p&gt;
