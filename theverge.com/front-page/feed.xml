    <title>Watch a bipedal robot run a first ever 5K</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DGbWGGx1yQUIQj5rId6MmlkWKnE=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69643610/cassie_5k.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="5RNvAE"&gt;Researchers from Oregon State University have coaxed a bipedal robot off the couch to successfully complete the &lt;a href="https://today.oregonstate.edu/news/bipedal-robot-developed-oregon-state-makes-history-learning-run-completing-5k"&gt;first ever robotic 5 kilometer outdoors run&lt;/a&gt;. The bot, Cassie, completed the route in 53 minutes, untethered and on a single battery charge. So next time you’re out for a jog, remember: that’s the time to beat if you want out-pace the killer robots. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hUomg3"&gt;(For now.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GHMo9Q"&gt;Cassie is the creation of OSU spin-off Agility Robotics, which has been pushing the commercial case for bipedal robots for a while. Cassie itself was the company’s first product, manufactured between 2017 and 2019, and now embraced by research labs. Agility does sell an updated bipedal bot, Digit, which has arms to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21050322/bipedal-robot-digit-agility-robotics-on-sale-delivery-inspection-ces-2020"&gt;handle packages&lt;/a&gt; and has been used by Ford as part of a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/self-driven/meet-digit-self-driving-delivery-last-mile-solution-418d9995bb97"&gt;research project into autonomous delivery robots&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PlGYGG"&gt;Bipedal machines are a tricky sell, though. Their big advantage is they can easily navigate spaces made for humans, like stairs and tight corridors. But their bipedalism means they’re inherently less stable, especially compared to quadrupedal robots like those made by Boston Dynamics. It’s just harder to knock something over when it’s standing on four legs.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gSS_1FevUUuOeJqDIeDC_7NaHNY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745258/Screen_Shot_2021_07_28_at_12.53.48_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://today.oregonstate.edu/news/bipedal-robot-developed-oregon-state-makes-history-learning-run-completing-5k" target="_blank"&gt;OSU&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cassie the robot was controlled and chaperoned on its 5K run. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kO1Jr5"&gt;The team behind Cassie say this might change as new deep learning techniques allow bipedal robots to develop new ways to stabilize themselves during locomotion. These methods aren’t flawless, though. Cassie fell twice during its 5K run, for example — once because its controlling computer overheated, and the other because its controller directed it to take a corner too quickly. (Yes, Cassie did not run under its own directions.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rjzGUM"&gt;OSU robotics professor and Agility Robotics co-founder Jonathan Hurst is still confident bipedal bots will become the norm, blending in with humans in our natural environment. “In the not very distant future, everyone will see and interact with robots in many places in their everyday lives, robots that work alongside us and improve our quality of life,” said Hurst in an OSU &lt;a href="https://today.oregonstate.edu/news/bipedal-robot-developed-oregon-state-makes-history-learning-run-completing-5k"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rud4KV"&gt;Who knows, maybe you’ll even see them out on your morning run. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Poco’s latest high-performance phone is the $299 X3 GT</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GYcao46lxLmIxrh9ooVfJ3lWrNw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69643530/DSCF7729_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Poco X3 GT looks very similar to the Chinese version of Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 10 Pro.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="8COsr8"&gt;Xiaomi spin-off Poco has announced yet another X3 phone. The X3 GT follows the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/22/22344126/poco-f3-x3-pro-snapdragon-860-870-announced-specs"&gt;X3 Pro&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/8/21426866/xiaomi-poco-x3-nfc-hands-on-price-specs-release"&gt;X3 NFC&lt;/a&gt;, this time focusing on performance with a fast 120Hz screen and a new MediaTek processor. It’s mostly a rebranded version of &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/xiaomi_redmi_note_10_pro_(china)-10930.php"&gt;Xiaomi’s Redmi Note 10 Pro&lt;/a&gt;, which was released last month in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AHyhTy"&gt;MediaTek is often associated with lower-end devices, but its Dimensity processors for 2021 feature configurations of Arm cores that aren’t too far off what you’d find in a Qualcomm Snapdragon 888. The 6nm Dimensity 1100 in the Poco X3 GT has four A78 cores at 2.6GHz and four lower-power A55 cores at 2GHz — compare that to the Snapdragon 888’s single 2.84GHz X1, three 2.42GHz A78s, and four 1.8GHz A55s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JJAMcv"&gt;We found the similar Dimensity 1200 to be a capable performer in our &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22586815/oneplus-nord-2-5g-review-specs-price-camera-screen"&gt;review of the new OnePlus Nord 2&lt;/a&gt;. The main difference between that chip and the 1100 is that one of its A78 cores is clocked to 3GHz.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/D1p8YLZUojD4vfrhtudsB997qdA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745168/DSCF7732_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The Poco X3 GT runs Xiaomi’s MIUI.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="EHXr2S"&gt;The X3 GT is the fastest charging Poco phone to date, with a 5,000mAh battery that fills up at 67W at a claimed 0-100 percent for a full charge. The primary camera has a 64-megapixel sensor, and there’s also an 8-megapixel ultrawide and a 2-megapixel macro lens.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BPVZVm"&gt;Other standout features include a proper linear motor for flagship-level haptic feedback, as well as a 6.6-inch 1080p 120Hz LCD display. Since the screen is an LCD, the fingerprint sensor is located on the sleep/wake button on the side, as opposed to under the display as is common with OLEDs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8BqBQD"&gt;Poco hasn’t provided full release details just yet, but the X3 GT’s starting MSRP is listed at $299, which of course is likely to differ across various markets. It’ll be released first in regions including southeast Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa, and will come with 8GB of RAM and either 128GB or 256GB of storage.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PkzZGDDed11lv9m_-iJR-bX2BNA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745169/DSCF7731_2.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;The X3 GT has a 64-megapixel primary camera.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>WhatsApp reportedly developing iOS to Android transfer option for chat history</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Iy6Yt808NRLeJ9SaWuUheTTq95w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69643512/acastro_210119_1777_whatsapp_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NbQWNL"&gt;WhatsApp is developing a way for its users to transfer their chat histories from iOS to Android, according to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WABetaInfo/status/1420313526757957636"&gt;reports from &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/07/26/whatsapp-chat-android-ios-data-transfer-tool/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The feature could fix one of the biggest annoyances with the Facebook-owned messaging service, which is that it’s not officially possible to transfer a backup of your messages between iPhone and Android, only between phones running the same operating system. Details of the in-development feature have been appearing in WhatsApp’s software &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-to-allow-chat-history-migration-between-ios-and-android/"&gt;since at least April&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0XAEJC"&gt;Screenshots shared by &lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; show a new “Move chats to Android” option in WhatsApp’s iOS app. A second screenshot shows a screen prompting users to keep their iPhone unlocked with WhatsApp open while the transfer is taking place. So far, most of the evidence has pointed towards an iOS to Android transfer feature, but &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-to-support-chat-history-migration-to-a-different-phone-number/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo &lt;/em&gt;has previously reported&lt;/a&gt; that the opposite will also be possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="jVeFq3"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Thank you &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/xdadevelopers?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@xdadevelopers&lt;/a&gt; for your recent discovery about the "Switch to Android" app, to migrate WhatsApp chat history from iOS to Android.  &lt;br&gt;These screenshots show how the process works. This feature is under development and it will be available in a future update. &lt;a href="https://t.co/FmZbXi33L2"&gt;https://t.co/FmZbXi33L2&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/w7GiCUHSuS"&gt;pic.twitter.com/w7GiCUHSuS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— WABetaInfo (@WABetaInfo) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/WABetaInfo/status/1420313526757957636?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 28, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="0SW91f"&gt;WhatsApp’s new transfer tool could form part of a new “Switch to Android” iOS app under development from Google, &lt;a href="https://www.xda-developers.com/google-preparing-switch-to-android-ios-app/#update1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt; reports&lt;/a&gt;. Similar to the “Move to iOS” app that Apple offers to help users migrate from Android to iOS, Switch to Android could make it easier to migrate to Google’s operating system. Code in Google’s app suggests it might integrate with WhatsApp’s unreleased transfer tool, according to &lt;em&gt;XDA Developers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFwWEp"&gt;News of the migration feature comes as WhatsApp is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/14/22577594/whatsapp-multi-device-e2e-facebook"&gt;beta testing multi-device support&lt;/a&gt;, allowing users to access their conversations from multiple devices, without needing to route everything through a single phone. As well as transferring chat histories between platforms, &lt;a href="https://wabetainfo.com/whatsapp-to-support-chat-history-migration-to-a-different-phone-number/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;WABetaInfo&lt;/em&gt; has also reported&lt;/a&gt; that WhatsApp is developing a way of transferring them between different phone numbers. It’s currently unclear when any of these features might be widely available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfaOc4"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oelo5e"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>ZTE’s newest under-display selfie camera looks slightly improved</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nM2raYUHV0eGZkqzuYfIyf_5K6A=/0x0:800x533/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69643337/axon_zte_30.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;ZTE’s Axon 30.  | Image: ZTE&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="rDdvfn"&gt;Last year’s Axon 20 5G from ZTE was the world’s first commercially-available phone to put a front-facing camera underneath its display. It was an impressive step forward for phone technology but there was one big problem: &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;the camera sucked&lt;/a&gt;. It took lousy pictures and the module distorted the display in certain settings. Now, ZTE is trying again with &lt;a href="https://www.zte.com.cn/global/about/news/20210727e1.html"&gt;the updated Axon 30&lt;/a&gt;, which seems to offer some improvements over its predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="B0SLBp"&gt;First, a little spec dump. The Axon 30 has a 6.92-inch AMOLED screen with 120Hz refresh rate and FHD+ resolution, all powered by Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 870 5G chipset. There’s a four-camera array on the rear of the device, with a 64-megapixel main, 8-megapixel 120-degree wide-angle, 5-megapixel macro lens, and an additional depth-of-field lens. The battery has a 4200mAh capacity and 55W fast charging, and, as per &lt;a href="https://www.gsmarena.com/zte_axon_30_5g_brings_a_secondgen_ud_camera_snapdragon_870_and_55w_charging-news-50255.php"&gt;&lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, you have the options of 6GB / 8GB / 12GB of RAM and 128GB / 256GB of UFS 3.1 storage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gddVE9"&gt;But the most interesting updates for the Axon 30 are to the under-display camera. For these under-display modules to work, you have to use transparent materials in that area of the screen, which are a fairly recent development and so lower-quality compared to regular display tech. For the Axon 30, ZTE says it’s doubled the pixel density in this area from 200 PPI to 400 PPI, which should make for a more seamless integration with the display. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_K7PyqiX_ag4Emg6XyhYg34RMIo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745212/gsmarena_011.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.gsmarena.com/zte_axon_30_5g_brings_a_secondgen_ud_camera_snapdragon_870_and_55w_charging-news-50255.php" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ZTE via GSMArena&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A comparison of the Axon 20 (left) and Axon 30 (right) under-display screens. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RKuy1r"&gt;ZTE says it’s also improved the under-display camera itself. You can see in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/21/22191459/zte-axon-20-5g-under-display-camera-hands-on"&gt;our hands-on with the Axon 20&lt;/a&gt; last year that pictures from this camera were hazy and soft in good lighting, and introduced a ton of noise in bad lightning. The camera was a great technical achievement, sure, but not on par with regular front-facing lenses. Based on the shot below, though, from popular phone informant Ice Universe (aka @&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/universeice"&gt;UniverseIce&lt;/a&gt;), there may be some improvements with the Axon 30.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="0iOsD4"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;This is a selfie with plenty of light outdoors. &lt;a href="https://t.co/24xEir7E8r"&gt;pic.twitter.com/24xEir7E8r&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ice universe (@UniverseIce) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1419993869911924740?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="gTYLjn"&gt;We’ll obviously have to wait to try the phone ourselves to give you a full evaluation, but don’t hold your breath for any miracles. As Ice Universe notes, the picture above was taken outdoors with plenty of light, an in response to a Twitter user suggesting they need to try out the camera in worse conditions, Ice Universe &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1419996698449911810"&gt;responds&lt;/a&gt;: “Such a poor performance.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1iCdyZ"&gt;Another photo from Ice suggests the under-display camera is also visible when the screen is turned off, but that’s hardly a big deal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HTIfQK"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ZteAxon30?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#ZteAxon30&lt;/a&gt;  But the camera is not completely invisible. When the screen is off, you can see it, just like we can see the fingerprint sensor under the sun. &lt;a href="https://t.co/sNNvReVf3p"&gt;pic.twitter.com/sNNvReVf3p&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Ice universe (@UniverseIce) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/UniverseIce/status/1420001203321139209?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 27, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="P4FCjt"&gt;The ZTE Axon 30 is launching in China first, with &lt;em&gt;GSMArena&lt;/em&gt; reporting that sales will begin on August 3rd. Price start at CNY 2,198 ($338) for the 6GB / 128GB model and CNY 3,098 ($476) for the 12GB / 256GB version. Global availability and pricing will be coming later. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Krispy Kreme is selling Xbox doughnuts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gvpBkiyHTcawgLgX8s6W5VlfSIo=/0x0:5940x3960/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69643295/xboxdoughnut.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Krispy Kreme’s new Xbox doughnut.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Krispy Kreme&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Iie5Bl"&gt;Krispy Kreme has created an Xbox doughnut. The fluffy doughnut is a marketing collaboration with Microsoft to celebrate 20 years of Xbox, and will be sold at Krispy Kreme stores, cabinets, and online across the UK and Ireland between August 2nd and August 22nd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lilyX6"&gt;The doughnuts won’t come equipped with CPUs, GPUs, or SSDs, but you might be able to win that type of hardware in the form of an Xbox Series S. As part of this marketing campaign, Krispy Kreme is also giving away Microsoft’s latest mini Xbox. You’ll need to purchase a dozen of the new Xbox doughnuts for a chance to win a console, and Krispy Kreme will include a month of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with every dozen doughnuts bought.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Spotify’s paid subscribers hit 165M as podcast listening ‘improved modestly’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SgaxrdrqN27uz0lbDW3Kdj5uYkg=/48x0:648x400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69643254/image__12_.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spotify’s latest subscriber numbers.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="OrmdUj"&gt;Spotify now has 165 million premium subscribers and 365 million monthly active users according to &lt;a href="https://investors.spotify.com/financials/press-release-details/2021/Spotify-Technology-S.A.-Announces-Financial-Results-for-Second-Quarter-2021/default.aspx"&gt;a new earnings report&lt;/a&gt; released today. It’s a year-over-year increase of 20 percent and 22 percent respectively, and up from the 158 million subscribers and 356 million MAUs seen last quarter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KJXPLu"&gt;Rivals Apple Music and Amazon Music don’t regularly release comparable numbers, but their most recent public figures &lt;a href="https://musically.com/2020/02/19/spotify-apple-how-many-users-big-music-streaming-services/"&gt;compiled by &lt;em&gt;Music Ally&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; put them at 60 million and around 55 million paying subscribers, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8pS4Sj"&gt;Spotify’s interest in podcasts has showed no signs of slowing this quarter, as it’s continued to make acquisitions and investments in both podcasting content and technology. The company recently acquired the exclusive rights to two podcasts, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/15/22534981/spotify-exclusive-podcast-call-her-daddy-alex-cooper"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Call Her Daddy&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22432286/dax-shepard-armchair-expert-spotify-exclusive"&gt;Dax Shepard’s &lt;em&gt;Armchair Expert&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, as well as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/18/22539794/spotify-podz-acquisition-machine-learning-podcast-discovery"&gt;company Podz&lt;/a&gt; whose technology automates the process of creating preview clips that feature key moments from podcasts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="TR8yOp"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The Joe Rogan experience “continues to perform above expectations”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nqa2c9"&gt;According to Spotify, the percentage of monthly active users engaged with podcast content last quarter “improved modestly” compared to the last two quarters when about 25 percent of all MAUs engaged. Podcast listening hit an all-time high in Q2 in terms of its share of consumption hours on the platform. Spotify also says that &lt;em&gt;The Joe Rogan Experience &lt;/em&gt;“continues to perform above expectations.” There are now 2.9 million podcasts available on Spotify, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/spotify-adds-fewer-total-users-than-expected-11627466400"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt;, up from 2.6 million last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kDGDTq"&gt;As well as acquiring exclusive rights to podcasts, Spotify is also enticing other creators onto its platform with paid subscription features. It announced its own &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22404273/spotify-podcast-subscriptions-monetize-subscriber-shows"&gt;podcast subscription feature in April&lt;/a&gt;, and yesterday said it will allow paid shows &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595013/spotify-open-access-podcasts-paid-access"&gt;from platforms like Slate and Acast&lt;/a&gt; to stream through its service. Features like these should make Spotify a more attractive and profitable platform for podcast creators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iPwuB3"&gt;Spotify’s average revenue per user increased this quarter, reversing recent trends. The figure now sits at €4.29 (around $5.07) per premium subscriber, which is up from €4.12 last quarter. The increase comes after the service &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/26/22403813/spotify-price-increase-subscriptions-2021"&gt;increased its subscription prices&lt;/a&gt; in the UK and US this quarter. The figure is still down by 3 percent year-over-year however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qMSGM"&gt;Overall, the company made a net loss of €20 million, compared to a net loss of €356 million it made in the same quarter the previous year. Executives have said that the company’s focus is on growth rather than turning a profit on a quarterly basis, the &lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; notes, while the previous loss was mainly due to taxes the company had to pay related to its Swedish workforce.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IaGLYa"&gt;Today’s release hasn’t yet offered any more details about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295273/spotify-hifi-announced-lossless-streaming-hd-quality"&gt;Spotify HiFi&lt;/a&gt;, the service’s forthcoming lossless streaming tier. Despite announcing the new tier in February with a provisional release date of later this year, Spotify is yet to announce an official launch date or pricing. In the months since its announcement, competitor Apple Music &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440090/apple-music-lossless-audio-dolby-atmos-support-audio"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/7/22523228/apple-music-lossless-spatial-audio-dolby-atmos-features"&gt;then released&lt;/a&gt; its own lossless audio streaming feature, which is available at no additional cost. (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/17/22440058/amazon-music-hd-price-cut-apple-lossless-audio"&gt;Amazon also dropped the premium&lt;/a&gt; it previously charged for its own lossless streams on the same day.) Whether Spotify likes it or not, the lossless streaming market is now a lot more competitive than it was in February.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Halo Infinite’s first multiplayer beta begins on July 29th</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I_C7hKtO4BseqlasYb6xy5CoQuc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69642988/a47427df_9cef_4831_85d0_9fa989ce4560.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="qtFMT0"&gt;The first &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; multiplayer technical preview will start tomorrow, July 29th. The beta will run until Sunday August 1st, offering a short chance for those invited to test &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s multiplayer aspects. It’s the first of many technical previews for &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;, as Microsoft prepares to launch the free multiplayer game mode later this year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xVmDoN"&gt;The first preview will include testing gameplay against AI bots, with a bot arena to “gather feedback on Bot behavior and online performance,” &lt;a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/news/inside-infinite-july-2021"&gt;according to 343 Industries&lt;/a&gt;. This arena will include the slayer mode across three maps, and a variety of challenges throughout the weekend. “The Bots still have their quirks, which is why we’re flighting them, but they certainly aren’t pushovers. Be prepared,” warns 343 Industries.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Md0aMWAQtc0ymTQB3wIgW6TAMhU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22745132/4k_haloinfinite_livefire_02_watermarked_bda22d6032e945fb93e52eaff91d5bc7.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Live Fire map for Halo Infinite.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MWj58X"&gt;Players will also be able to try the Weapon Drills part of &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; this weekend. It’s a way to test weapons before entering arena battles, in a simple firing range. There will be a variety of guns to test, including snipers, pistols, the classic needler, and the MA40 AR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vRe4cp"&gt;343 Industries is also testing the UI of Halo Infinite, including how players unlock battle passes, interact with challenges, and use the store inside the game. “This technical preview will feature a truncated Battle Pass and a small fraction of the Customization options planned for launch,” according to 343 Industries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="tD3zde"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Here’s everything we know about Halo Infinite’s free multiplayer ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/14/22533317/halo-infinite-multiplayer-customizations-game-modes-weapons-features"},{"title":"Here’s a first look at Halo Infinite’s multiplayer mode ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/13/22531861/halo-infinite-e3-2021-trailer-demo-release-date"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="3rtBo1"&gt;This testing will also include the new Halo Waypoint web and mobile app, where you can customize a spartan or view battle pass progress and challenges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xwcDf0"&gt;343 Industries is planning to share more details on the &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt; technical preview during a live stream later today at 5PM ET / 2PM PT. If you’re interested in testing &lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite &lt;/em&gt;then you’ll need to &lt;a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/en-us/community/halo-insider"&gt;sign up to be a Halo Insider&lt;/a&gt;, and receive an invite to participate in testing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dS6xL9"&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5lRwyV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Halo Infinite&lt;/em&gt;’s multiplayer mode will launch alongside the campaign later this year, and will be a free part of the game open to anyone on Xbox or PC. The game will run at up to 120fps in this mode on the Xbox Series X, and offer classics game modes like capture the flag with new abilities like using a grapple hook to pick up objects. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo is shutting down its Dr. Mario mobile game</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XlRH_T9_vcNazpoXBJPNxEi-wm8=/0x0:1820x1213/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69642606/Untitled.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jrIlew"&gt;Nintendo has &lt;a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/support/information/2021/0728.html"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;em&gt;Dr. Mario World&lt;/em&gt;, a mobile take on the puzzle game series, will go out of service on November 1st, with sales of its in-app “diamond” currency ending today. The game was launched a little over two years ago, and is the first of Nintendo’s mobile games to be shut down, unless you count the Mii-themed social network &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16930822/nintendo-miitomo-closing-down-date"&gt;Miitomo&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mtL2NP"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://sensortower.com/blog/nintendo-revenue-one-billion"&gt;data from SensorTower&lt;/a&gt; collected around six months after its launch, &lt;em&gt;Dr. Mario World&lt;/em&gt; was by far the worst performing Nintendo smartphone game in terms of revenue performance. That includes &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Run&lt;/em&gt;, whose disappointing sales prompted Nintendo to pursue freemium models in the first place. &lt;em&gt;Fire Emblem Heroes&lt;/em&gt; remains the company’s biggest mobile hit by a huge distance, generating more revenue than its other games combined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iCgtS1"&gt;Nintendo did go out of its way to make &lt;em&gt;Dr. Mario World&lt;/em&gt; a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/8/20685938/dr-mario-world-candy-crush-puzzle-game-mobile-free-to-play-loot-box"&gt;potential monetization machine&lt;/a&gt; rather than a direct translation of the NES-era gameplay, but ultimately it seems like not enough players got hooked for it to be worth continually operating. Mobile games still account for a tiny portion of Nintendo’s overall earnings; last year the company attributed just 3.24 percent of its revenue to “mobile and IP related income,” which includes licensing deals. Almost everything else comes from the Switch.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Read Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick’s letter addressing the harassment allegations</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Activision Blizzard CEO Robert Kotick" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IudgEoxxhvwI8sQgxgEwSvhoDCQ=/0x0:4200x2800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69642330/532417098.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by J. Emilio Flores/Corbis via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="9hwZvr"&gt;The evening before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22595922/activision-blizzard-employees-walk-out-sexual-harassment"&gt;a proposed employee walkout at Activision Blizzard&lt;/a&gt;, one that at least part of the company &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22596957/blizzard-pto-sexual-harassment-walkout"&gt;is now actively encouraging by providing paid time off&lt;/a&gt;, company CEO Bobby Kotick has issued a letter to all employees — &lt;a href="https://investor.activision.com/news-releases/news-release-details/letter-ceo-bobby-kotick-all-employees"&gt;and investors&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210727006194/en/A-Letter-From-CEO-Bobby-Kotick-to-All-Employees"&gt;the public&lt;/a&gt; — who are watching the company struggle with allegations of sexual harassment and workplace discrimination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VckUfx"&gt;At last count, nearly one-third of the company’s employees signed an open letter condemning Activision Blizzard’s initial response to those allegations, and Kotick’s letter addresses that head-on: “Our initial responses to the issues we face together, and to your concerns, were, quite frankly, tone deaf,” he writes. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="orgpea"&gt;Kotick says a law firm, WilmerHale, will immediately review the company’s policies “to promote a respectful and inclusive workplace,” that Activision Blizzard “will continue to investigate each and every claim and will not hesitate to take decisive action,” that it will fire anyone “found to have impeded the integrity of our processes for evaluating claims,” and that it will ensure hiring managers are considering diverse slates of candidates for open jobs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OLgt2X"&gt;Also, the company plans to change its games. “We have heard the input from employee and player communities that some of our in-game content is inappropriate. We are removing that content,” writes Kotick. Blizzard announced earlier today &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/27/22597006/blizzard-world-of-warcraft-activision-remove-references-harassment-lawsuit"&gt;that &lt;em&gt;World of Warcraft&lt;/em&gt; would remove “references that are not appropriate for our world,”&lt;/a&gt; without specifying any particular ones. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R5ks15"&gt;The whole situation strongly reminds of Ubisoft, whose CEO Yves Guillemot &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21312022/ubisoft-internal-changes-allegations-employee-misconduct-ceo"&gt;also announced the company would be cleaning house&lt;/a&gt; after an insufficient response to the initial allegations of sexual misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="19KkKq"&gt;You can read the full letter below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="mvLVKr"&gt;July 27, 2021&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YaK2JZ"&gt;This has been a difficult and upsetting week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6oaIei"&gt;I want to recognize and thank all those who have come forward in the past and in recent days. I so appreciate your courage. Every voice matters - and we will do a better job of listening now, and in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CK68Wy"&gt;Our initial responses to the issues we face together, and to your concerns, were, quite frankly, tone deaf.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pxMzMp"&gt;It is imperative that we acknowledge all perspectives and experiences and respect the feelings of those who have been mistreated in any way. I am sorry that we did not provide the right empathy and understanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8OgWtH"&gt;Many of you have told us that active outreach comes from caring so deeply for the Company. That so many people have reached out and shared thoughts, suggestions, and highlighted opportunities for improvement is a powerful reflection of how you care for our communities of colleagues and players – and for each other. Ensuring that we have a safe and welcoming work environment is my highest priority. The leadership team has heard you loud and clear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5riRaj"&gt;We are taking swift action to be the compassionate, caring company you came to work for and to ensure a safe environment. There is no place anywhere at our Company for discrimination, harassment, or unequal treatment of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LJtjXv"&gt;We will do everything possible to make sure that together, we improve and build the kind of inclusive workplace that is essential to foster creativity and inspiration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="leqFbh"&gt;I have asked the law firm WilmerHale to conduct a review of our policies and procedures to ensure that we have and maintain best practices to promote a respectful and inclusive workplace. This work will begin immediately. The WilmerHale team will be led by Stephanie Avakian, who is a member of the management team at WilmerHale and was most recently the Director of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission’s Division of Enforcement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uj9iPI"&gt;We encourage anyone with an experience you believe violates our policies or in any way made you uncomfortable in the workplace to use any of our many existing channels for reporting or to reach out to Stephanie. She and her team at WilmerHale will be available to speak with you on a confidential basis and can be reached at &lt;a href="mailto:ATVI@wilmerhale.com"&gt;ATVI@wilmerhale.com&lt;/a&gt; or 202-247-2725. Your outreach will be kept confidential. Of course, NO retaliation will be tolerated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2tEwp"&gt;We are committed to long-lasting change. Effective immediately, we will be taking the following actions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uF3J1v"&gt;Employee Support. We will continue to investigate each and every claim and will not hesitate to take decisive action. To strengthen our capabilities in this area we are adding additional senior staff and other resources to both the Compliance team and the Employee Relations team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PdHA9V"&gt;Listening Sessions. We know many of you have inspired ideas on how to improve our culture. We will be creating safe spaces, moderated by third parties, for you to speak out and share areas for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fXB2Wv"&gt;Personnel Changes. We are immediately evaluating managers and leaders across the Company. Anyone found to have impeded the integrity of our processes for evaluating claims and imposing appropriate consequences will be terminated.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2OFWjD"&gt;Hiring Practices. Earlier this year I sent an email requiring all hiring managers to ensure they have diverse candidate slates for all open positions. We will be adding compliance resources to ensure that our hiring managers are in fact adhering to this directive.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Workers at a repair facility used by Apple compare conditions to sweatshops</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="eKwK9I"&gt;Workers at a Houston, Texas facility that processes repairs for Apple, Dell, and Lenovo reportedly say they are working in “sweatshop” conditions, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-repair-workers-sweatshop-csat-solutions-2021-7"&gt;according to a story from &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Workers’ toilets are reportedly unsanitary and insufficient, they say they lack air conditioning, and they claim their pay is low at CSAT Solutions, a company that acts as a repair partner for tech companies like Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TlrWzk"&gt;In the report, which is &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-repair-workers-sweatshop-csat-solutions-2021-7"&gt;worth reading in its entirety&lt;/a&gt;, employees also reportedly say there aren’t enough bathrooms or parking spots for the number of workers, and that they’re not allowed to use their phones while working, even in the case of family or personal emergencies. One employee told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; that she got off work to discover that her son had been taken to the hospital after being burned. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Su658a"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some employees expected an environment that reflected the prestige of the Apple brand&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="V4E92a"&gt;The working conditions alleged at CSAT took some employees by surprise, according to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, as they expected an environment reflective of the prestige that comes with the Apple brand. Instead, they reportedly faced quotas that were difficult to meet, and pay that ranged from $12 to $14 an hour, with little hope for raises or promotions. Some employees told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; that they had to work 60 hours a week just to make ends meet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uUWPKl"&gt;CSAT Solutions did not immediately comment in response to an emailed inquiry from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. CSAT representatives told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; that the company has high standards for its workplace, and that it investigates employee complaints. In a statement to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, which can be read in full below, Apple said that it will be investigating the allegations, and that its focus is “making sure that everyone in [its] supply chain is protected and treated with dignity and respect.” Dell and Lenovo didn’t immediately respond to request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="73XQaj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Employees reportedly felt like their requests and concerns were unaddressed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kKaZ4E"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, employees felt as if their previous concerns and reports to management had been ignored. Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;that it has assessed CSAT’s Houston location multiple times in recent years, but didn’t discuss its findings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="veJanZ"&gt;The practice of Apple visiting and inspecting suppliers’ facilities, however, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupplier-responsibility%2Fpdf%2FApple-Supplier-Code-of-Conduct-and-Supplier-Responsibility-Standards.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22596784%2Fcsat-solutions-repair-facility-texas-apple-macbook-dell-lenovo-working-conditions-employees" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;seems to be routine&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) to the point that suppliers may be able to paint themselves in a more positive light. &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;’s report includes stories from multiple employees about being asked to carry out work in a more by-the-book fashion when Apple’s auditors were around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ypoowl"&gt;Apple told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that it has the highest standards in the industry, and it has a page on its website &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupplier-responsibility%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22596784%2Fcsat-solutions-repair-facility-texas-apple-macbook-dell-lenovo-working-conditions-employees" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;dedicated to talking about supplier responsibility&lt;/a&gt;. Still, the company’s suppliers have faced accusations of poor factory working conditions, with three stories about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/29/22204920/lens-technology-uighur-forced-labor-xinjiang-amazon-apple-tesla"&gt;forced labor&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166286/apple-china-labor-violations-temporary-workers"&gt;labor law violations&lt;/a&gt; (where Apple allegedly turned a blind eye), and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/13/22172383/workers-protest-wistron-iphone-se-plant-india-pay"&gt;protests of pay reduction&lt;/a&gt; coming out in December 2020 alone. There’s also recently been the issue of Apple’s own employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22453302/apple-culture-secrecy-leak-antonio-garcia-martinez-letter"&gt;fighting for the ability to work remotely&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="WVeMCI"&gt;&lt;q&gt;CSAT also does work for Dell and Lenovo&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VFy9NR"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; report also raises concerns about CSAT’s usage of temp agencies to hire workers. According to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupplier-responsibility%2Fpdf%2FApple-Supplier-Code-of-Conduct-and-Supplier-Responsibility-Standards.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22596784%2Fcsat-solutions-repair-facility-texas-apple-macbook-dell-lenovo-working-conditions-employees" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s Supplier Code of Conduct and Responsibility Standards&lt;/a&gt; (PDF), its standards also apply to subcontractors, and Apple’s suppliers are responsible for ensuring that the companies they hire are also in compliance. The responsibility, however, is not Apple’s alone — according to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, CSAT also does work for Dell and Lenovo. In particular, Dell’s logo shows up frequently &lt;a href="https://www.csat.com/about/"&gt;in the promotional video atop CSAT’s website&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7d0adt"&gt;Employee reviews for CSAT Solutions on sites like &lt;a href="https://www.indeed.com/cmp/Csat-Solutions/reviews"&gt;Indeed&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/CSAT-Solutions-Reviews-E483310.htm"&gt;Glassdoor&lt;/a&gt; echo some of the concerns brought up by &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;, with many &lt;a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-CSAT-Solutions-RVW38166423.htm"&gt;comparing working conditions to sweatshops&lt;/a&gt;, warning prospective employees about &lt;a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-CSAT-Solutions-RVW47647065.htm"&gt;low pay&lt;/a&gt;, and expressing dissatisfaction with &lt;a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-CSAT-Solutions-RVW46375146.htm"&gt;working hours&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-CSAT-Solutions-RVW45963998.htm"&gt;quotas&lt;/a&gt;. A few reviews also back up the claims about the cleanliness and availability of the bathrooms, the heat, and broken air conditioners, as well as the strict no-cellphone rules. There are a fair number of positive reviews as well, but many of them are from non-repair employees. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="odHgic"&gt;&lt;q&gt;60-hour workweeks are often mentioned in CSAT employee reviews&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="As7HOc"&gt;A job listing for a computer repair technician position at CSAT, found on the company’s website, says that candidates must be willing to work overtime, without saying how much. &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fsupplier-responsibility%2Fpdf%2FApple-Supplier-Code-of-Conduct-and-Supplier-Responsibility-Standards.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F7%2F27%2F22596784%2Fcsat-solutions-repair-facility-texas-apple-macbook-dell-lenovo-working-conditions-employees" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Apple’s standards&lt;/a&gt; (PDF) state that workweeks have to be restricted to 60 hours, including overtime.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The job listing includes the line “This position will require the candidate to have some knowledge of computer components and be willing to work overtime.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-Gn2i89r01_cYZNsp7M7tIaMmO8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22744454/Screen_Shot_2021_07_27_at_2.10.30_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A job listing from CSAT’s website.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="C22ptY"&gt;Here’s Apple’s full statement:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="NcrptJ"&gt;We uphold the highest standards in the industry and regularly assess our suppliers to ensure they comply. We have undertaken three assessments at CSAT in Houston in recent years, and Apple members regularly visit the site. We take all allegations seriously and will investigate. As always, our focus is on making sure that everyone in our supply chain is protected and treated with dignity and respect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
