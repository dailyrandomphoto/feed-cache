    <title>Matt Gaetz’s antifa-detecting facial recognition story is complete nonsense</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="XaBtbp"&gt;Yesterday, a mob of Trump supporters overran the US Capitol, causing widespread chaos in an attempt to nullify the results of the 2020 presidential election. In the wake of the attacks, several Republican politicians have claimed the attackers were anti-fascist activists, in spite of the widespread Trump paraphernalia and triumphant social media posts by Trump supporters. But there’s no evidence antifa played a notable role in the riot, and one of the most widely cited examples has already fallen apart.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D9vPdz"&gt;In a widely heard House speech on Wednesday, Rep. Matt Gaetz (one of 147 Republican Congress members who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218285/twitter-facebook-trump-coup"&gt;voted to overturn the 2020 presidential election results&lt;/a&gt;) claimed that the mob had been infiltrated by antifa. But Gaetz cited confusing, unverifiable facial recognition evidence from a company that now calls the original article defamatory — and says it identified neo-Nazis, not antifa supporters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rwA433"&gt;&lt;a href="https://youtu.be/jQ0ok4iJ25s?t=7859"&gt;In a speech&lt;/a&gt; during the process of certifying President-elect Joe Biden, Gaetz claimed there was “some pretty compelling evidence from a facial recognition company” that some Capitol rioters were actually “members of the violent terrorist group antifa.” (Antifa is not a single defined group, does not have an official membership, and has not been designated a terrorist organization, although President Donald Trump has described it as one.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="l45AWC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The story cites an unidentified “retired military officer”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="VJFh8u"&gt;Gaetz attributed this claim to a short &lt;em&gt;Washington Times&lt;/em&gt; article published yesterday. That article, in turn, cited a “retired military officer.” The officer asserted that a company called XRVision “used its software to do facial recognition of protesters and matched two Philadelphia antifa members to two men inside the Senate.” The &lt;em&gt;Times &lt;/em&gt;said it had been given a copy of the photo match, but it didn’t publish the picture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a5K6dX"&gt;There is no evidence to support the &lt;em&gt;Times’&lt;/em&gt; article, however. An XRVision spokesperson linked &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;a href="https://apelbaum.wordpress.com/2021/01/07/statement-about-the-washington-times-false-claim-that-xrvision-detected-antifa-in-the-capital-building-riots/"&gt;a blog post by CTO Yaacov Apelbaum&lt;/a&gt;, denying its claims and calling the story “outright false, misleading, and defamatory.” (Speech delivered during congressional debate, such as Gaetz’s, is &lt;a href="https://library.cqpress.com/cqresearcher/document.php?id=cqresrre1952042500"&gt;protected from defamation claims&lt;/a&gt;.) The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; article was apparently deleted a few hours after Apelbaum’s post.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DxJgxCqU76eWUjMZgC2zasm8LB8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22219799/the_pois_from_the_capital_building_1_7_2021_thumb.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: XRVision&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;XRVision image purportedly analyzing photograph from the riots on Capitol Hill.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="R5aBmG"&gt;“XRVision didn’t generate any composites or detections for the &lt;em&gt;Washington Times&lt;/em&gt; or for any ‘retired military officer,’ nor did it authorize them to make any such claims or representations,” Apelbaum wrote. According to his post, XRVision did analyze video footage of the riots, and the company identified “several individuals” in a composite it shared with a “handful” of outsiders. However, they were not linked with antifa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="Wfdasd"&gt;We concluded that two of the individuals (Jason Tankersley and Matthew Heimbach) were affiliated with the Maryland Skinheads and the National Socialist Movements. These two are known Nazi organizations; they are not Antifa. The third individual identified (Jake Angeli) is an actor with some QAnon promotion history. Again, no Antifa identification was made for him either.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="HzBrMT"&gt;Angeli, who frequently appears at protests in a horned helmet and face paint, is known as the “Q Shaman” and is affiliated with the conspiracy movement QAnon. Angeli previously participated in a documentary called “The Patriots,” in which he espoused an extreme pro-Trump ideology rather than anything aligned with antifa.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="i16thv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;You've likely seen photos of shirtless, horned/fur hat Jake Angeli, aka QAnon Shaman, storming the U.S. capitol. Some say he's antifa. He's not. He was part of doc "The Patriots" from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ruelaswritings?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;@ruelaswritings&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; me. Embedded a clip from the doc. Link to see entire &lt;a href="https://t.co/52GovxYPnS"&gt;https://t.co/52GovxYPnS&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/Qj2GNJirAs"&gt;pic.twitter.com/Qj2GNJirAs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— David Wallace (@DavidWallce) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DavidWallce/status/1347224024644927490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="21aQT7"&gt;These names tally with earlier evidence posted by critics of the &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; piece. The Twitter account Respectable Lawyer, for instance, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RespectableLaw/status/1347055072530853890"&gt;posted a long thread&lt;/a&gt; debunking the claims of antifa involvement. That account noted that Tankersley and Heimbach’s photos &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; appear on a Philadelphia antifa site, but only because the site was identifying them as neo-Nazis. However, while that thread identified Tankersley by his tattoos, it &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/RespectableLaw/status/1347081503025614851"&gt;did not definitively place Heimbach&lt;/a&gt; at the riot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TDXQri"&gt;Even after Apelbaum’s update, it’s not actually clear if XRVision’s technology works or how statistics like the “match rate” on the composite were calculated. &lt;a href="http://www.xrvision.com/"&gt;XRVision’s website&lt;/a&gt; offers little information about its software. In &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fcontent%2Fdam%2Fen-zz%2Fen_sg%2Fai-innovation-day-2019%2Fassets%2Fpdf%2F3_AI-based-Video-Content-Analytics-for-Safety-and-Security.pdf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F7%2F22218601%2Fmatt-gaetz-antifa-capitol-hill-riot-xrvision-facial-recognition-washington-times-story-false#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;a slideshow&lt;/a&gt; from a 2019 Nvidia AI Innovation Day presentation in Singapore, XRVision suggested it could perform advanced facial recognition and complex computer vision analysis on a security camera or smart device footage. &lt;a href="https://onezero.medium.com/claims-antifa-embedded-in-capitol-riots-come-from-a-deeply-unreliable-facial-recognition-company-459603c0d073"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;OneZero&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, however, the company has apparently &lt;a href="https://pages.nist.gov/frvt/html/frvt11.html"&gt;not submitted&lt;/a&gt; algorithms for testing by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology. Apelbaum posted his statement after activists and journalists had already identified Angeli and Tankersley.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ahY9TY"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Even the best facial recognition software can misidentify suspects&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6VDR0y"&gt;At best, facial recognition remains a flawed technology that can easily misidentify targets. Amazon’s Rekognition system, which was used by US law enforcement &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/10/21287101/amazon-rekognition-facial-recognition-police-ban-one-year-ai-racial-bias"&gt;until 2020&lt;/a&gt;, erroneously &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/26/17615634/amazon-rekognition-aclu-mug-shot-congress-facial-recognition"&gt;matched 28 members of Congress&lt;/a&gt; with criminal mugshots. Last month, a New Jersey man sued after being &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/29/technology/facial-recognition-misidentify-jail.html"&gt;falsely identified and arrested&lt;/a&gt; based on an incorrect facial recognition match.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v6PmRW"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; article was apparently deleted without a correction after Gaetz already widely spread its thinly sourced myth about antifa-identifying facial recognition tech. And it’s part of a much broader false theory that “antifa infiltrators” caused the widespread chaos during yesterday’s riot. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/KenPaxtonTX/status/1346954747996205062"&gt;quoted a tweet&lt;/a&gt; speciously claiming a “bus load” of “antifa thugs” had infiltrated the demonstrations, stating that “these are not Trump supporters.” In reality, “antifa buses” are a well-known hoax that led one group of Washington townspeople to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/5/21281581/antifa-bus-hoax-trump-misinformation-protests-police"&gt;terrorize a family on a camping trip&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CmOJ2K"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/2020-election-misinformation-distortions?smid=tw-nytimes&amp;amp;smtyp=cur#antifa-capitol-mob"&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The New York Times&lt;/em&gt; notes&lt;/a&gt;, there is no evidence that antifa or other left-wing figures had a substantial presence at the riot. &lt;em&gt;Washington Times&lt;/em&gt; author Rowan Scarborough did not immediately respond to a request for comment, nor did the office of Rep. Gaetz.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer’s latest gaming monitors include its first with HDMI 2.1</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Acer Nitro XV28" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yqvloJ59jS-fXEeGf-ZgUD1qeDw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68633315/nitroxv28.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Nitro XV28 is Acer’s first monitor with HDMI 2.1&lt;/em&gt; | Acer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZpmSWx"&gt;As the first part of Acer’s CES 2021 announcements, the company shared that it has three new gaming monitors releasing in May. In terms of specs, the standout product is the new Nitro XV28, a 28-inch 4K monitor with an IPS display and a 144Hz refresh rate with FreeSync Premium. It’s Acer’s first gaming monitor to use HDMI 2.1 ports, giving it the spec (assuming you’re using an HDMI 2.1-compliant cable) to support up to 4K gaming at 120 frames per second with variable refresh rate (VRR). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K7Gg3I"&gt;So, not only is this a solid option for PC gamers hoping to squeeze the most out of their &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;Nvidia RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21571414/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-review"&gt;AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT&lt;/a&gt;, it’s an option about which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21550146/sony-playstation-5-ps5-review"&gt;PS5&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21548987/xbox-series-x-review"&gt;Xbox Series X&lt;/a&gt; owners can be equally excited. In terms of port selection, this one has two HDMI ports (both are 2.1), one DisplayPort, one USB-C port capable of 65W PD charging, four USB Type-A 3.0 ports, and a USB Type-B port to power those USB ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rlRu3w"&gt;Acer will sell the XV28 for $899, which certainly isn’t cheap, though not out of the ordinary for a 4K screen with fast refresh rates. If you want one that actually fits on your desk, it could be worth it. Though it’s hard not to think that, for around the same price during a sale, you could get a 55-inch &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/6/21504781/vizio-oled-smartcast-4k-hdr-tv-now-available"&gt;Vizio 4K OLED TV&lt;/a&gt; that also supports HDMI 2.1 — though &lt;a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/vizio/oled-2020"&gt;there are reports&lt;/a&gt; that its advertised VRR doesn’t yet work. Meanwhile, Acer claims the XV28 will have “hassle-free support” for the latest consoles at 4K 120Hz with VRR.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Predator XB27" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/skkDn7Hx7n7DYdhbyfnJ8HlWL14=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22219667/xb27.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Acer’s Predator XB27 with a 1440P display and G-Sync.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="xs28DJ"&gt;Acer’s other two monitor announcements aren’t any more affordable, but they do have some high-end features missing from the Nitro XV28. The Predator XB27 costs $1,099 and features a 27-inch QHD IPS panel with HDR400 capability, the lowest rung on the DisplayHDR standard that can reach 400 cd/m2 peak brightness — effectively 400 nits, dim enough that it shouldn’t be your choice if you’re actually buying for HDR. It can run at a native 240Hz refresh rate with overclocking up to 275Hz, and it has a 0.5ms response time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vm5qHb"&gt;It comes with an Nvidia G-Sync module built in. In addition to the various benefits that it yields for keeping your Nvidia GPU-powered gameplay looking smooth, in this case it allows for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418080/nvidia-g-sync-reflex-360hz-refresh-rate-gaming-monitors-alienware-msi-asus-acer"&gt;Nvidia’s Reflex tech&lt;/a&gt; that analyzes and optimizes latency across all of your connected accessories. This monitor has two HDMI ports, one DisplayPort, a trio of USB Type-A 3.0 ports, a single USB Type-A 2.0 port, and a USB Type-B port for powering the USB ports.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Acer Predator XB32" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zNiqoz1T46gafjuofIKvJ592Rdo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22219668/xb32.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Despite appearing the same size as the monitor mentioned above, the Predator XB32 is 31.5 inches.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="m4ZliX"&gt;Finally, the Predator XB32 is a 31.5-inch 4K IPS display that’s G-Sync compatible (an update from GeForce Experience will make it play better with modern Nvidia GPUs). It has a native 144Hz refresh rate and also HDR400, if you want that slightly more vibrant image in apps that support it. This model will sell for $1,199. It features two HDMI ports, one DisplayPort, a single USB-C port with 65W PD charging, and four USB Type-A 3.0 ports with a USB Type-B port for powering them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdnmK0"&gt;These each seem like solid, albeit pricey picks if you’re really into gaming and want features that can boost the visual fidelity in different ways. The Nitro XB23 and Predator XB27 are the most appealing from a technical level, each with a few great features that set them apart from what’s currently out there. We don’t have the full spec sheets yet, though, and given that they will each release in May, there may be some competitive models on the market by then.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Acer unveils its AMD-powered Chromebook Spin 514</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Three business workers have a meeting, one of which is using the Acer Chromebook Enterprise Spin 514." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8LfKosut1_FhfNMlYajNarsXsRM=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68633328/Chromebook_Enterprise_Spin_514_High_06.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Acer&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="t64IOQ"&gt;CES is just days away, but plenty of laptop companies are already unveiling their 2021 lineups. One of Acer’s first new releases is the Chromebook Spin 514, powered by AMD’s Ryzen 3000 mobile processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDQZKK"&gt;You can spec the Spin 514 up to 16GB of DDR4 DRAM and 256GB of storage. Acer claims you’ll get up to 10 hours of battery life. The 14-inch FHD touch display has a 78 percent screen-to-body ratio, and all models have two USB-C ports, two USB 3.2 Gen 1 ports, and a microSD card reader. Some configurations include an HDMI port as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7lYp5p"&gt;It’s not the lightest Chromebook around, at 3.42 pounds (1.55 kg) and 0.68 inches (17.35 mm) thick. But Acer says it delivers “military-grade durability” and can withstand up to 132 pounds of downward force. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Acer Chromebook Spin 514 at a slight angle from the right side." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GDB3TXYKWcMcYPdSt1nrjE4ZMrM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22219850/Acer_Chromebook_Spin_514_CP514_1H_left_facing.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Acer&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yp1fbu"&gt;There’s also a business version, the Chromebook Enterprise Spin 514, which runs the enterprise version of Chrome OS. These models can come with up to 16GB of DDR4 DRAM and 256GB of storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="svFnLp"&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 514 will be available in North America in February, starting at $479.99. The Enterprise Spin 514 is coming in March, and starts at $749.99. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kuJuI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony’s 2021 TV lineup runs Google TV and fully embraces HDMI 2.1</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kvJClMMi-UYl_dx4PJUBssN1bLU=/0x0:3000x2000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68633318/X95J_65_CCW.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I2rDnP"&gt;Last year’s TV lineup from Sony &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/8/3/21348598/ps5-sony-tv-playstation-5-ready-4k-8k"&gt;took a bit of criticism&lt;/a&gt; since several sets were unable to take advantage of next-gen gaming features on the PlayStation 5 that shipped in November. &lt;a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/articles/00246472"&gt;Even if you look right now&lt;/a&gt;, the spread of HDMI 2.1 features is pretty sad. Sony never really acknowledged this as a mistake, believing that customers purchase its TVs for different reasons and not everyone needs every box checked off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w6fhiO"&gt;What a difference a year makes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IxQeVZ"&gt;In 2021, Sony is correcting course: all of its premium “Bravia XR” 4K (and yes, 8K) TVs support 4K at 120Hz, VRR (variable refresh rate), ALLM (auto low latency mode), and eARC. No asterisks or gotchas or promises to add stuff later with firmware updates. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="rt0y69"&gt;Beyond getting on board with 4K120, Sony is making a big deal over what it calls “cognitive intelligence” in these TVs. Powered by a new Cognitive Processor XR chip, Sony says its new system goes beyond traditional signal processing — which Sony’s TVs already excelled at — and beyond the artificial intelligence analysis in most TVs. “While conventional artificial intelligence (AI) can only detect and analyze picture elements like color, contrast and detail individually, the new processor can cross-analyze an array of elements at once, just as our brains do,” Sony’s press release on the TVs says. “By doing so, each element is adjusted to its best final outcome, in conjunction with each other, so everything is synchronized and lifelike — something that conventional AI cannot achieve.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vMmQd7dOi3F1zKymXquSzGqhtEU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22219990/insitu_65X90J_TVOutsideHighStand_05.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Sony&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="QkBaqm"&gt;Sony is also talking up what the XR processor can do for sound. A “Sound-from-Picture Reality” feature is claimed to “align the position of the sound with the images on the screen to offer a uniquely lifelike experience.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22215172/samsung-neo-qled-4k-8k-tv-announced-specs-ces-2021"&gt;Samsung has promised similar results&lt;/a&gt; for its own 2021 Neo QLED TVs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uuN9tl"&gt;The two Master Series TVs (8K LCD and 4K OLED) have a new sensor for detecting the color temperature of the ambient light in your room, and this lets them automatically adjust the TV’s white balance to match. (This setting can be turned off for you purists, of course.) More important is that the A90J Master Series OLED also has brighter output than Sony’s past OLEDs thanks to a new aluminum heat shield attached to the panel. Making OLEDs brighter is a big deal since that’s a key area where LCD sets still tend to win out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aer8nP"&gt;As one of the earliest TV makers that got on board with Android TV, it seems appropriate that Sony will be among the first to transition to Google TV. All of these TVs will offer a software experience that’s incredibly similar to the latest Chromecast: Sony still has its own customizations in the settings menu (and for quick shortcuts like your HDMI inputs), but everything else — the personalized For You page, content recommendations, etc. — is basically unchanged from Google’s latest streaming device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhWFJu"&gt;Sony has also focused on small touches, like adjustable legs that can be configured to allow enough space for a soundbar in front of the TV without obstructing the picture. Going down the lineup, you lose certain niceties (like an antireflective coating exclusive to the 8K set), but all of the TVs support Dolby Vision HDR. And again, you’ve got all the HDMI 2.1 standards accounted for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jYOAKX"&gt;Rather than move to new display technology like Mini LED, Sony seems to be evolving its current strategy of full-array local dimming and iterating upon its excellent OLED sets. The company doesn’t share how many dimming zones its TVs have or really talk about peak brightness, believing that competitors get too hung up on those numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yQPnNI"&gt;Pricing and specific availability info will be announced this spring. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Platforms take action against Trump after Capitol mob attack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The President and First Lady arrive on the South Lawn of the White House after returning from Florida, on December 31 in Washington, DC." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KHfLFXTi182bDqrlcrP2ZX2wEEs=/0x0:2942x1961/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68633275/1230388043.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Keep up with all the developments here&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="8zuTUk"&gt;Online platforms have taken action against President Donald Trump in response to his encouragement of a pro-Trump mob that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217411/capitol-building-lockdown-protesters-trump-supporters"&gt;attacked the US Capitol&lt;/a&gt; on January 6th. That day, Facebook and Twitter removed some of Trump’s social media posts, a video, and instituted short-term bans on Trump’s accounts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ngqRae"&gt;But on January 7th, platforms began taking more drastic action, with Facebook deciding to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;ban Trump&lt;/a&gt; “indefinitely,” and Shopify &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218776/shopify-trump-store-disable-campaign-ecommerce-sites-capitol"&gt;taking down Trump’s campaign store&lt;/a&gt; (which sold Make America Great Again hats). More actions may follow. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z56WHr"&gt;We’ll be following the situation closely, and you can keep up with all of the developments right here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>YouTube says it will punish Trump and other channels that continue to spread election lies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="President Trump Addresses Protesters In D.C. Via Video Statement" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WHrNqlSqjuRanr5ROEIqCTNbt5A=/0x1:5636x3758/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68633170/1230456036.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TfS9fz"&gt;YouTube will temporarily restrict channels that post videos containing widespread misinformation about 2020 election results — including the channel of President Donald Trump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66dVUc"&gt;Instead of simply removing videos that spread misinformation, any channel that post videos with false claims about the election will now receive a strike, temporarily preventing them from uploading videos. This includes Trump’s channel. A YouTube spokesperson did not say how long the suspension would last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXcjyh"&gt;In December, YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165355/youtube-biden-election-victory-misinformation-rules-remove-content-oan"&gt;issued a new policy&lt;/a&gt; prohibiting any content designed to spread misinformation about the outcome of the 2020 election by promoting false theories about fraudulent votes or other unverified claims. Since then, the company has removed thousands of videos, according to a company spokesperson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpGZkN"&gt;Prior to yesterday’s events, a grace period was in place allowing YouTube to remove videos without applying strikes to channels. This often happens when YouTube institutes new policies, and it’s designed as an effort to be fair to creators while they adjust to the new rules. The grace period was set to expire on January 21st, following Inauguration Day, according to YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ln7kLF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Prior to yesterday, YouTube was removing videos without applying strikes to channels as a temporary measure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MknGIJ"&gt;YouTube’s teams made the decision following “the extraordinary events that transpired yesterday, and given that the election results have been certified&lt;em&gt;,” &lt;/em&gt;according to a YouTube spokesperson. The company removed one of Trump’s videos that addressed a mob attack on the Capitol and also contained widespread misinformation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217743/trump-capitol-attack-youtube-video-removed-twitter-facebook-moderation"&gt;about the election results&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, any channel that receives three strikes within a 90-day period will be terminated in accordance with YouTube policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3XW1v"&gt;This means that channels spreading misinformation about the election results will see strikes applied to their channels if they continue. For example, channels like OANN, a right-wing news organization &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21550180/youtube-oann-video-election-trump-misinformation-voting-final-results-facebook-twitter"&gt;that has perpetuated statements&lt;/a&gt; made by the president that he won the election, could receive a strike on top of having videos deleted if it were to continue uploading similar statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5bogF"&gt;Over the last 24 hours, several companies have taken stricter stances against the president’s content. Twitter suspended &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;Trump’s account for 12 hours&lt;/a&gt;, threatening to ban the president outright if he posted another tweet violating the company’s policies or inciting violence. Facebook initially prevented Trump from posting to Facebook and Instagram for 24 hours, before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced even stricter measures&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday morning that include indefinitely suspending his account for at least the next couple of weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9bf4f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKrBBH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Shopify takes down Trump’s campaign store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Shopify" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PHyNEiTgT7MgD0kNDuW8Ffh_l1Q=/0x7:4870x3254/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68632900/1211910116.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ALcRuF"&gt;Shopify has taken down e-commerce sites from the Trump Organization and Trump campaign in response to Wednesday’s violence at the US Capitol building, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/shopify-takes-trumpstore-com-offline-in-response-to-riot-11610035673"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; reported.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPVH7n"&gt;Both &lt;a href="http://trumpstore.com/"&gt;TrumpStore.com&lt;/a&gt; and the Trump campaign’s &lt;a href="http://shop.donaldjtrump.com/"&gt;Shop.DonaldJTrump.com&lt;/a&gt;, which sold Make America Great Again hats and other merchandise, were both offline Thursday morning. Shopify didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but a spokesperson told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; that the company’s trust and safety team had determined the president had violated company policy against promoting or supporting violence in his Wednesday comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XV1GJ6"&gt;“Shopify does not tolerate actions that incite violence,” the company said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DaveLeeFT/status/1347222086511546369"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. Actions by the president “violate our Acceptable Use Policy, which prohibits promotion or support of organizations, platforms or people that threaten or condone violence. As a result, we have terminated stores affiliated with President Trump.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zb03Xb"&gt;Shopify is the latest platform to block or remove the president after he incited a mob attack on the US Congress. Following the attack, Trump continued to tweet false claims about the November presidential election and told the rioters who attacked the Capitol building to “go home,” while also calling them “special people.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;Twitter implemented a 12-hour ban&lt;/a&gt; late Wednesday, and on Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook expanded&lt;/a&gt; what was originally a 24-hour ban into a two-week suspension that could become permanent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Esco57"&gt;Ottawa-based Shopify, which helps merchants set up e-commerce operations, saw huge growth during the coronavirus pandemic. On &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195719/amazon-antitrust-wsj-investigation-competition-marketplace-sellers"&gt;Black Friday, it had more than $5 billion&lt;/a&gt; in aggregate sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWkJiL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 7th 12:06PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds statement from Shopify&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Google’s union is a big deal </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bt25TvgVqNtxp2OrCzD_1858bDE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68632784/GooglesUnion_Textless.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kQORpX"&gt;On January 4th, 2021, Google workers and contractors announced they were forming a union with the Communications Workers of America. It’s the latest move in an ongoing fight between Google workers and management, and it could have big implications for the future of the tech industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJvaNG"&gt;But we didn’t get here overnight. Google workers have been standing up against executives for years. They’ve protested &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/03/06/google-is-quietly-providing-ai-technology-for-drone-strike-targeting-project/"&gt;Google’s decision to work with the Pentagon on targeted drone strikes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/google-s-project-dragonfly-censored-search-engine-triggers-protests-n960121"&gt;build a censored search engine for China&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage"&gt;pay Android founder Andy Rubin $90 million in severance&lt;/a&gt; after he was accused of sexual harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJiQ9m"&gt;Now, the union hopes to create a structure for all of those demonstrations. Crucially, it wants to unite the interests of Google contractors with those of full-time employees. To really understand how this came together and what it could mean for the future of tech, we have to look at the big picture. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook bans Trump ‘indefinitely’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/krija0kzMxGSmYTLSgX3JLwWdv0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68632641/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r7tiOB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10112681480907401"&gt;In a blog post Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would ban President Donald Trump from its platforms “indefinitely” following a pro-Trump attack on the US Capitol this week. The ban will not be lifted before Inauguration Day, according to  Zuckerberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OiELAB"&gt;“The shocking events of the last 24 hours clearly demonstrate that President Donald Trump intends to use his remaining time in office to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power to his elected successor, Joe Biden,” said Zuckerberg. “We are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yiLzNu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We believe the risks of allowing President Trump to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great, so we are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks. &lt;a href="https://t.co/JkyGOTYB1Z"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JkyGOTYB1Z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Facebook Newsroom (@fbnewsroom) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1347211647245578241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pca6Hr"&gt;Facebook’s decision to ban Trump is an unprecedented escalation in the platform’s approach to moderating the president’s posts. As rioters stormed the Capitol Wednesday, Facebook removed a video from Trump responding to the violence. In it, Trump made false claims about the 2020 election results, and told rioters to “go home” hours after the initial invasion began. Facebook cycled through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217788/facebook-remove-trump-video-emergency-situation-mob-violence"&gt;three different labels&lt;/a&gt; on the video before the platform decided to remove it outright around an hour after it was posted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dG208K"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guyro/status/1346950532372393985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1346950532372393985%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F6%2F22217788%2Ffacebook-remove-trump-video-emergency-situation-mob-violence"&gt;In a statement Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook’s vice president of integrity, Guy Rosen, declared the Capitol riot as “an emergency situation.” He continued, “We removed [Trump’s video] because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RMcnjM"&gt;Twitter locked Trump’s account Wednesday evening, but has not issued any longterm ban on the outgoing president. In a tweet thread Wednesday, Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;announced the block&lt;/a&gt; as a response to three tweets that violated its policies. Once Trump removed those tweets, the 12 hour lockout period began. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOYdy7"&gt;“Future violations of the Twitter Rules... will result in permanent suspension of the @realDonaldTrump account,” said Twitter’s policy account after putting the block in place.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk passes Jeff Bezos to become the richest person on Earth</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HzofYK"&gt;Elon Musk has become the wealthiest person on the planet, surpassing Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, thanks to the continued rise in Tesla’s stock price. Musk is now worth around $188 billion, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3OBk7f"&gt;“How strange,” Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1347204459147902978?s=21"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Thursday. “Well, back to work ...” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbxEyt"&gt;Musk eclipsing Bezos’ own extravagant personal wealth of around $187 billion marks the latest development in a years-long rivalry between the two tech magnates — one that often centers on the accomplishments of their respective businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXBtHJ"&gt;Bezos was reportedly so envious of Musk’s success in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/8/10937076/tesla-gigafactory-battery-factory-nevada-tax-deal-elon-musk"&gt;securing a $1.3 billion incentive package&lt;/a&gt; for Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada that it served as the genesis for Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-03/amazon-s-hq2-fiasco-was-driven-by-bezos-envy-of-elon-musk?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;beauty pageant-style search for its second headquarters&lt;/a&gt;. Bezos has a spaceflight company in Blue Origin much like Musk does with SpaceX. The two men have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/21/10641840/jeff-bezos-congratulatory-rocket-landing-tweet-spacex-clinical-shade"&gt;traded&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/669194136248041472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;barbs&lt;/a&gt; about their rockets and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/24/4553652/jeff-bezos-and-elon-musk-battle-for-nasa-space-shuttle-launchpad"&gt;fought over hallowed NASA real estate&lt;/a&gt;. (SpaceX won that fight and is the only of the two companies to successfully reach orbit.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vB1L0R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Musk and Bezos have been rivals of sorts for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dmq9YQ"&gt;Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612410/elon-musk-overtakes-bill-gates-to-become-worlds-second-richest-person-behind-jeff-bezos"&gt;only just passed Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt; in November to become the second-richest person in the world. The Tesla CEO saw his personal wealth skyrocket in 2020 to the tune of more than $150 billion, in large part because Musk owns a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of Tesla stock — about 20 percent of the company, in fact. And Tesla’s stock has grown incredibly valuable over the last year or so, too, as Musk pulled the company out of so-called “production hell” and dramatically increased sales of its electric vehicles, thanks to the more affordable Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV. That coincided with an &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/retail-investors-pocket-gains-with-eye-toward-bumpy-year-end?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;incredible rise of retail investors&lt;/a&gt; who were &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-12-24/bloomberg-wealth-the-investors-who-became-millionaires-with-just-one-stock?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;more willing to fully buy into Tesla’s story&lt;/a&gt; than many on Wall Street once were. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="719ZIv"&gt;The billionaire CEO’s stock stash continues to grow, especially after he signed a major &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17147678/elon-musk-tesla-ceo-compensation-award-plan"&gt;10-year compensation package&lt;/a&gt; with the company in 2018 that further tied his earnings to Tesla’s stock price and revenue goals. He is awarded a raft of company stock options every time a new milestone is hit; the first tranche, which he received earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273882/elon-musk-tesla-compensation-plan-stock-award-dollars"&gt;was worth some $800 million&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqpqS6"&gt;Like most billionaires, Musk has only seen his overall wealth increase during the coronavirus pandemic. But unlike that peer group, Musk claimed in court to be “&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-techs-cash-poor-billionaire-11588967043"&gt;cash poor&lt;/a&gt;” and “financially illiquid” in 2019 and said last year that he would sell “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1256239554148724737"&gt;almost all physical possessions&lt;/a&gt;,” including his mansions. He takes loans against the stock that makes him so wealthy and plows that money back into his companies, like when he dumped &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-16/musk-s-boring-co-raises-113-million-for-tunnels-and-hyperloop?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;around $100 million into The Boring Company in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Musk has a long history of using his own personal wealth to fund new endeavors, too, as he funded Tesla and SpaceX after becoming a millionaire running Zip2 and PayPal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1ORIj"&gt;Musk may now be the richest man on Earth by the standards of money-focused outlets like &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;, though they tend to focus on calculating knowable assets. However, authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin and Mohammed bin Salman are both extremely personally wealthy in &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-putin-spends-his-mysterious-fortune-2017-6"&gt;ways that are harder to calculate&lt;/a&gt; and also have unchallengeable access to the vast wealth of their nations.&lt;/p&gt;
