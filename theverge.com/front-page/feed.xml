    <title>Now all of Battlefield 2042’s next-gen digital editions include cross-gen access</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6nn6tUAKcot57owHJSsJQGa7I4k=/63x0:738x450/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69956068/RevealScreenshot_15_VistaBorderline_3840x2160_NoLogo.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A screenshot from &lt;/em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: EA&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="DplA7l"&gt;EA is making &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; a little bit more accessible across generations. The company &lt;a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/Battlefield-Announcements/Cross-Gen-Bundle-Added-to-the-Digital-Standard-Edition-for/m-p/10802679#M525"&gt;announced Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; that the digital Standard Edition of &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; on PS5 and Xbox Series X / S now includes the Cross-Gen Bundle, which gives you access to both the PS4 and the PS5 or Xbox One and Xbox Series X / S versions of the game. Previously, the Cross-Gen Bundle was only available with the more expensive digital Gold and Ultimate editions of &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9Aj1jO"&gt;It’s important to note that this cross-gen benefit has only been added to the digital Standard Editions for next-gen consoles. If you buy the digital Standard Edition on PS4 or Xbox One, where it is $10 cheaper than it is on the PS5 and Xbox Series X / S, you won’t get the Cross-Gen Bundle. The Cross-Gen Bundle is also not an option for any physical copy of the game. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="07B6uD"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The game supports full cross progression&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="UuRvhY"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; supports full cross progression, though, so no matter where you play it, as long as you’re playing on profiles that connect to the same EA Account, your progress will carry over. If you’re considering picking up a next-gen console in the future but want to start playing &lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; on your PS4 or Xbox One before you do, you might want to pick up the next-gen digital Standard Edition so that you have free access to the next-gen version of the game down the road.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nv2ruT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Battlefield 2042&lt;/em&gt; will be released on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676330/battlefield-2042-release-date-delay"&gt;November 19th&lt;/a&gt;. If you want to try it ahead of launch, EA is &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/open-beta?utm_campaign=bf2042_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_tw-open-beta&amp;amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;cid=70479&amp;amp;ts=1633462226611"&gt;hosting a beta&lt;/a&gt; that runs from October 6th through the 9th. People who preordered the game or are an EA Play member will be able to play it first, starting on October 6th at 3AM ET. The beta will open up for everyone on October 8th at 3AM ET. More details can be found in &lt;a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/faq"&gt;this FAQ on EA’s website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Scroll is shutting down in ‘approximately’ 30 days to become part of Twitter Blue</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aT03Xi3ua5C22hXDbc_fLTlIdxg=/55x0:1369x876/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69955763/Screen_Shot_2021_10_05_at_2.45.15_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="skBV0d"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21111865/scroll-ad-free-website-subscription-launches"&gt;Scroll’s ad-free subscription web service&lt;/a&gt; is shutting down as an independent entity in “approximately” 30 days, the company announced in an email to subscribers. The service — which was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/4/22417852/twitter-buying-scroll-subscription-service-news-revue-newsletter"&gt;purchased by Twitter earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; — will instead be rolled into the burgeoning Twitter Blue premium subscription as “Ad-Free Articles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jrPSNb"&gt;In its current form, &lt;a href="https://scroll.com/sites"&gt;Scroll is a $5-per-month service&lt;/a&gt; that offers ad-free browsing to hundreds of websites, including &lt;em&gt;The Atlantic&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;BuzzFeed News&lt;/em&gt;, G/O Media, &lt;em&gt;USA Today, &lt;/em&gt;and&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;Vox Media — which, full disclosure, includes &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt; It works by using a combination of third-party cookies and browser extensions to stop websites from showing ads to paid subscribers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="VkR4B5"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Aw man, Twitter is shutting down Scroll. It was a great little service that let me read The Verge, The Atlantic, and so many other sites ad-free while contributing dollars to journalism via my attention. Bring on Twitter Blue I guess &lt;a href="https://t.co/AP9G8GEIiG"&gt;pic.twitter.com/AP9G8GEIiG&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Casey Newton (@CaseyNewton) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1445457953285234689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="uTq31c"&gt;Scroll was bought by Twitter in May, at which point it stopped accepting new sign-ups while the company figured out its plans for the ad-free service; today’s announcement that Scroll’s service will be added to Twitter Blue seems to provide the answer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfQzvq"&gt;&lt;a href="https://blog.twitter.com/en_us/topics/company/2021/introducing-twitter-blue"&gt;Twitter Blue&lt;/a&gt; currently offers a variety of bonus features for the service, including an “undo send” feature for quickly retracting your tweets, a bookmarks folder for grouping and saving tweets, and a reader mode that converts long threads into a single, cohesive block of text. It also adds some cosmetic changes, including color themes and custom app icons. But the addition of Scroll’s ad-free service would mark one of the biggest features to come to Twitter Blue yet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="if5IiU"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Scroll makes hundreds of websites ad-free for $5 per month","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/28/21111865/scroll-ad-free-website-subscription-launches"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="hW6o6J"&gt;There’s not a lot of details in Scroll and Twitter’s announcement of what the changeover will look like, practically speaking. The two companies have yet to clarify how existing Scroll customers will transition over to Twitter Blue (assuming there’s a direct path to switch at all), when Scroll’s service will be available on Twitter Blue, or even a concrete day that the standalone service’s shutdown will be. The company is promising more information in the coming weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_VaR_OyLv0FwONnmd_gXIqkwP-I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22903140/Screen_Shot_2021_10_05_at_3.06.46_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://twitter.com/CaseyNewton/status/1445457953285234689" target="_blank"&gt;Casey Newton&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="sg9WSM"&gt;Also absent from the news is any information on price and availability. One of the selling points for Scroll was that its $5-per-month fee would go (at least in part) towards funding the journalism that subscribers read: Scroll kept $1.50, while the other $3.50 per month was divvied up amongst sites based primarily on how much a reader was reading them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1CPMJ0"&gt;Twitter hasn’t said if it’ll be changing that price, either — currently, Twitter Blue is only available in Australia and Canada for $3.49 CAD or $4.49 AUD, with a rumored $2.99 price tag for the US. Adding Scroll in its current form to that service without raising the price would mean a big change in how sites get paid. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7VqFNH"&gt;Additionally, Twitter Blue is currently only available in Australia and Canada so far, meaning that unless the service expands greatly in the next month, it could be some time before existing Scroll customers are able to get back their ad-free experience — assuming that Twitter’s implementation of its “Ad-Free Articles” is still the same Scroll experience. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook runs the coward’s playbook to smear the whistleblower</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/lp8PQWck4HjdiQflrj_DbqM-I68=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69955721/acastro_072121_4674_zuckerberg_3.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge Photo by Justin Sullivan / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="peMMK1"&gt;Facebook has chosen to respond to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710539/facebook-whistleblower-hearing-instagram-child-safety-congress"&gt;whistleblower Frances Haugen&lt;/a&gt; in the most cowardly way possible: by hiding Mark Zuckerberg, the man ultimately responsible for Facebook’s decisions, and beginning the process of trying to smear and discredit Haugen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2vwnAk"&gt;This is some Big Tobacco bullshit — precisely what sleazeball PR guru &lt;a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/magazine/1996/05/wigand199605"&gt;John Scanlon was hired&lt;/a&gt; to do when Jeffrey Wigand blew the whistle on tobacco company Brown and Williamson. Scanlon’s task was to change “the story of B&amp;amp;W to a narrative about Wigand’s personality.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dlD9pd"&gt;Of course, that strategy “backfired completely,” &lt;em&gt;Vanity Fair &lt;/em&gt;reported in 2004. It probably won’t work here, either. One senator, Edward Markey of Massachusetts, has already called Haugen “a 21st-century American hero,” adding that “our nation owes you a huge debt of gratitude.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="BLhed7"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Zuckerberg has decided he is above it; he is on vacation&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8e8Pug"&gt;Like Wigand, Haugen has receipts: internal documents and data from Facebook’s own researchers, all of which make for serious and supported claims about the platform’s harms and choices the company made to maximize profit and engagement in ways that would increase those harms. It is possible to contend with her allegations on the merits, but Facebook is too immoral for that — and Zuckerberg has decided he is above it, instead going on vacation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Hz03cc"&gt;Let’s read through today’s Facebook statement on the Haugen hearing together, shall we?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CQ1HANMS4-1633458071.281500-thread-list-threads-flexpane_1633458212.282000"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook PR: “Today a Senate Commerce subcommittee held a hearing with a former product manager at Facebook who worked for the company for less than two years, had no direct reports, never attended a decision-point meeting with C-level executives — and testified more than six times to not working on the subject matter in question.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="jrmxUj"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Translation: Today, a peon testified in Congress; she is too unimportant to name&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Nl4rSf"&gt;Translation: Today, a peon testified in Congress; she is too unimportant to name. Nothing she says is worthwhile because she is not fancy enough. And even though she had access to multiple internal research documents supporting her claims, you can’t trust her testimony on them — despite her subject matter expertise and years of experience in the field — because she didn’t write them herself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QugElG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook PR: “We don’t agree with her characterization of the many issues she testified about.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6tLFIq"&gt;Translation: We think she’s lying but won’t say how, or about what, specifically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="thB4GR"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook PR: “Despite all this, we agree on one thing; it’s time to begin to create standard rules for the internet. It’s been 25 years since the rules for the internet have been updated, and instead of expecting the industry to make societal decisions that belong to legislators, it is time for Congress to act.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Oh95FV"&gt;&lt;q&gt;If Facebook had evidence, it would show it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AA46W3"&gt;Translation: It is time to change the subject to something we like better, even though Haugen herself said Facebook is presenting false choices when it comes to privacy and free speech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6pplnp"&gt;Now, let’s all notice what’s missing. Though Facebook disputes Haugen’s characterizations of the research in question, it doesn’t provide its own interpretation. Nor does it engage any of the claims Haugen makes — which are, incidentally, supported by internal Facebook research Haugen provided. If Facebook had evidence, it would show it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fqUK21"&gt;But the funniest part is the absence of Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook’s CEO and the only shareholder with the power to replace himself. Zuckerberg started Facebook as a Hot-or-Not clone — which almost certainly would negatively affect teen girls’ self-esteem. (At least he is consistent, I guess.) The decisions Haugen alleges, which put profits ahead of morals, have also enriched him more than anyone else. The buck stops, quite literally, with him. So where is he?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JWx2gI"&gt;If the best Facebook can come up with is this disgusting attempt at character assassination, Haugen is telling God’s own truth. We should listen to her.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xvHXjS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft is giving away free Windows 11 ice cream in NYC today</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/eRhDEOPTSMNTU-0EUnTbJ5NQPLY=/0x0:4096x2731/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69955641/windows11icecream.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberry is a limited edition ice cream at Mikey Likes It.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Mikey Likes It Ice Cream&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JRp864"&gt;Microsoft has teamed up with Mikey Likes It Ice Cream in New York City to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/MikeyLikesItNY/status/1445447586450587651"&gt;give away free frozen dessert&lt;/a&gt; today. The collaboration marks the release of Windows 11 and part of what would normally, before the pandemic, include a Windows launch party in New York City. The “Bloomberry” (not to be confused with Bloomberg) ice cream looks like a frozen mix of the default Bloom Windows 11 wallpaper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KXrcqj"&gt;The blueberry flavored ice cream is free at &lt;a href="https://mikeylikesiticecream.com/pages/hours"&gt;Mikey Likes It locations&lt;/a&gt; in the East Village and Harlem until stocks freeze up. We’re not sure if there are any entry requirements to getting this Windows 11 ice cream, like having to enable TPM 2.0 at the door, so please get in touch if you have to turn Secure Boot on to get your free ice cream. Please also get in touch if you experience a human Blue Screen of Death (brain freeze) while you devour your blueberry ice cream. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pz8ANd7i1qcp47RYMyInUlvS2UA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22903089/windows11icecream2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not bad for free ice cream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Kj6aBU2m-5vaF-FRIx-xLYSx8Oc=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22903090/windows11icecream3.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Yup, it’s definitely Windows 11 ice cream.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="yX2Gbg"&gt;Free ice cream isn’t the only way Microsoft is celebrating the release of Windows 11 in New York City. The Bloom wallpaper has also graced the famous screens at Times Square today, marking the launch of Windows 11. Microsoft is fond of launching products in New York City, with the company choosing the city for both its Windows 7 and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/9/17/3347088/windows-8-launch-new-york-october-25th"&gt;Windows 8 launches&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/14/9322809/microsoft-surface-pro-4-lumia-950-october-6th-event"&gt;new Windows 10 devices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fjCWIm"&gt;Windows 11 is available on new devices today or for eligible existing hardware. Microsoft is taking a gradual approach to rolling out this new operating system, but it’s available as a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22708478/microsoft-windows-11-upgrade-free-os-how-to-download"&gt;free upgrade for eligible Windows 10 devices&lt;/a&gt;. If you don’t see the Windows 11 upgrade just yet, there’s even a way to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22683953/windows-11-upgrade-how-to-download-install"&gt;skip the line&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="TCrG92"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Windows 11 release is Times Square-official   &lt;a href="https://t.co/1ehKWVvJfo"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1ehKWVvJfo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Katie Anderson (@AndeKat101) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AndeKat101/status/1445210124281331714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;

    <title>How to use snap layouts in Windows 11</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bdslg0JlE-_tthhLPCHZXUj-dAk=/300x0:3540x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69955619/Screenshot__73_.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="FWzwaI"&gt;Windows 11 may not be exactly revolutionary, but there are some features that are just plain useful, and snap layouts are one of them. Replacing the drag-and-drop snap assist feature of Windows 10, snap layouts let you arrange your apps quickly and neatly on your desktop, making it much simpler to see all and use all at once. (Certainly, it’s a lot better than the constant Alt-Tab switching between apps that many of us are used to.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zfvLtP"&gt;Here’s how you set it up:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="qGVfCP"&gt;Hover your cursor over the maximize icon in the upper right corner of an app or press Win-Z. You’ll see four (or six if you have a large monitor) different grid layouts that you can choose from. Each layout will have several zones in a different configuration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="8jgEPt"&gt;Choose a layout and hover over the zone you want your active app to be in. That zone will turn blue; click on it. Your app will then snap into that position.&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="gJaoqr"&gt;If you had other apps open, they may appear as thumbnails in another of the zones. Alt-Tab to each open app, and choose which zone you want that app to be in. You can also simply click on the app if it’s in the zone you want it to be in. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="When you choose a zone for one app, the others may appear as thumbnails in another zone.

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5DTPtl"&gt;(Note: Sometimes, while you’re rearranging, one app can overlap the other. If things get confusing, use Alt-Tab to see where each app is or find them in the taskbar.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lo3FAF"&gt;And you’re ready to go!&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snap layouts arranges your windows into a neat grid pattern.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="rmxZmG"&gt;Your snap layout will be reflected in the taskbar as well. If you go to the taskbar and hover over the icon for one of the apps in your layout, you will see a thumbnail for both the app and for the layout group it’s part of; you can click on either.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Hover over an apps taskbar icon, and you’ll see both the app alone and its layout grouping." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HlszeAYyXER3kTMDSNahX0RnQ-g=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22903030/Screenshot__68_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Hover over an apps taskbar icon, and you’ll see both the app alone and its layout grouping.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="ipK62i"&gt;Need to maximize an app? Just click on the maximize icon. Click on it again, and the app will snap back into its former configuration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C89aJ0"&gt;Adjust layout settings&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="0YkN0n"&gt;You can adjust the snap layouts by going to “Settings” &amp;gt; “System” &amp;gt; “Multitasking.” You have a variety of options that you can enable or disable. For example, you can choose not to have the snap layout feature appear when you hover over the maximize symbol or when you hover over your app icon in the taskbar. You can arrange for the other windows to automatically resize when you manually resize one. And, of course, you can disable the feature entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Go to the multitasking section in your setup to tweak your snap layout features." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Eu4Kc0CaeKBQ5qIWgkoZ7BKR5-8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22902896/Screenshot__69_.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Go to the multitasking section in your setup to tweak your snap layout features.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="81CVH8"&gt;Learn how to use it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FN773E"&gt;When you first start to use snap layouts, it may take a little getting used to, especially when it comes to deciding which app goes where. Once you’re set, however, you may find that snap layouts make it a lot easier to, say, monitor your Twitter or Slack account while working on a document or watching a video. Admittedly, if you have a smaller display, having more than two apps open at the same time could make things a bit crowded, but it’s worth experimenting a bit to see what works for you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Yubico announces security keys with fingerprint readers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/JUwBfmdoPPrxLJQ-Nt0tcmDtAAc=/0x167:1000x834/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69955613/bio_comp_use.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Yubico&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jF13ay"&gt;&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yubico.com%2Fblog%2Fput-your-finger-on-the-pulse-of-whats-new-with-the-yubikey-bio-series%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22710987%2Fyubikey-fido-biometric-fingerprint-reader-usb-c-a" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Yubico has announced&lt;/a&gt; a new line of security keys that lets you unlock accounts with a fingerprint. With older YubiKeys, logging in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sI7yWHim-2Y"&gt;requires putting in a PIN&lt;/a&gt; and then tapping the key, but the new version can authenticate with &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yqgl2yuzCNE"&gt;just the tap&lt;/a&gt; (though the option to put in a PIN is still available if you’re wearing gloves or your fingers are wet). The convenience does come at a premium — the USB-A version of &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yubico.com%2Fproduct%2Fyubikey-bio%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22710987%2Fyubikey-fido-biometric-fingerprint-reader-usb-c-a" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the YubiKey Bio&lt;/a&gt; costs $80, and the USB-C version costs $85. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a0GyMi"&gt;The YubiKey Bio series acts like a regular security key, so it can help you either log on to services &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yubico.com%2Fsolutions%2Fpasswordless%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22710987%2Fyubikey-fido-biometric-fingerprint-reader-usb-c-a" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;without having to deal with passwords&lt;/a&gt; or act as a second factor in addition to something like a password or authentication code from your phone. Either use style can help you avoid phishing attacks, and the YubiKey Bio &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yubico.com%2Fworks-with-yubikey%2Fcatalog%2F%3Fseries%3D10%26sort%3Dpopular&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22710987%2Fyubikey-fido-biometric-fingerprint-reader-usb-c-a" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;can be used&lt;/a&gt; with a wide range of applications and services, including 1Password, Google Chrome, Microsoft accounts, Twitter, and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hIyCYt"&gt;In technical terms, it supports FIDO Universal Second Factor and FIDO2/WebAuthn, so anything that supports those standards should be good to go with it. Yubico &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yubico.com%2Fblog%2Fput-your-finger-on-the-pulse-of-whats-new-with-the-yubikey-bio-series%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F5%2F22710987%2Fyubikey-fido-biometric-fingerprint-reader-usb-c-a" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;does say&lt;/a&gt;, though, that its Bio keys currently don’t support the OTP or Smart card standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="RNvOFd"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The YubiKey Bio supports tons of services but is more limited in device support&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mDyDSC"&gt;It’s worth noting that the Bio keys also don’t support NFC, so iPhone may want to consider other options to avoid carrying a USB-to-Lightning dongle. Yubico offers its 5C NFC key for $55, though it doesn’t support bio-authentication. Google &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22617183/google-usb-c-titan-security-lineup-nfc-password-protection"&gt;also offers a USB-C/NFC key&lt;/a&gt; for $35, though &lt;a href="https://store.google.com/us/config/titan_security_key?hl=en-US"&gt;it’s currently out of stock&lt;/a&gt;. However, for those who want a security key that lets them log in with a fingerprint, YubiKeys are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/22/18235173/the-best-hardware-security-keys-yubico-titan-key-u2f"&gt;widely regarded&lt;/a&gt;, and now, there’s an even more convenient option. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What is BGP, and what role did it play in Facebook’s massive outage</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KUX_U2aTbKaCicm0z-2jikMkx6s=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69950766/acastro_200512_1777_socialDistance_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="06o5Y9"&gt;On Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;Facebook was completely knocked offline&lt;/a&gt;, taking Instagram and WhatsApp (not to mention &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709123/facebook-outage-down-detector-cloudflare"&gt;a few other websites&lt;/a&gt;) down with it. Many have been quick to say that the incident had to do with BGP, or Border Gateway Protocol, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/briankrebs/status/1445147230244061184?s=21"&gt;citing sources from inside Facebook&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jgrahamc/status/1445065270272434176?s=20"&gt;traffic analysis&lt;/a&gt;, and the gut instinct that “it’s always DNS or BGP.” Facebook is back up and has since &lt;a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details/"&gt;released an explanation&lt;/a&gt; detailing how BGP was just a part of its woes (and saying that it more or less worked as intended), but this all raises the question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="bSASsz"&gt;What is BGP?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="qhAt0P"&gt;At a very basic level, BGP is one of the systems that the internet uses to &lt;a href="https://blog.cdemi.io/beginners-guide-to-understanding-bgp/"&gt;get your traffic to where it needs to go as quickly as possible&lt;/a&gt;. Because there are tons of different internet service providers, backbone routers, and servers responsible for your data making it to, say, Facebook, there’s a ton of different routes your packets could end up taking. BGP’s job is to show them the way and make sure it’s the best route.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OBANNl"&gt;I’ve heard BGP described as a &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;system of post offices&lt;/a&gt;, an &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjkU7Hw2TY4"&gt;air traffic controller&lt;/a&gt;, and more, but I think my favorite explanation was one that likened it to a map. Imagine BGP as a bunch of people making and updating maps that show you how to get to YouTube or Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dsS9q9"&gt;&lt;q&gt;BGP is like a map telling your computer whose bridges it has to cross to get to Facebook&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="TGE7t8"&gt;When it comes to BGP, the internet is broken up into big networks, known as autonomous systems. You can sort of imagine them as island nations — they’re networks that are controlled by a single entity, which could be an ISP, like Comcast, a company, like Facebook, or some other big organization like a government or major university. It would be extremely difficult to build bridges connecting every island to all the others, so BGP is what’s responsible for telling you which islands (or autonomous systems) you have to go through to get to your destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tVV2vk"&gt;Since the internet is always changing, the maps need to be updated — you don’t want your ISP to lead you down an old road that no longer goes to Google. Because it’d be a massive undertaking to map the entire internet all the time, autonomous systems share their maps. They’ll occasionally talk to their island neighbors to see and copy any updates they’ve made to their maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="QFYfuw"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Turn left into the river&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iPwhMP"&gt;Using maps as a framework, it’s easy to imagine how things can go wrong. Back when consumers first got access to GPS, there were always jokes about it having you drive off a cliff or into the middle of the desert. The same thing can happen with BGP — if someone makes a mistake, it can end up leading traffic somewhere it’s not supposed to go, which will cause problems. If it isn’t caught, that mistake will end up on everyone’s map. There are other ways this can go wrong, but we’ll get to those in a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="tt174N"&gt;Yeah, yeah, maps. Give me an example.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="xn2Yhp"&gt;Of course! This is massively simplified, but imagine you want to connect to an imaginary tech news website called Convergence. Convergence uses the ISP NetSend, and you use DecadeConnect. In this example, DecadeConnect and NetSend can’t talk directly to each other, but your ISP can talk to Border Communications, which can talk to Form, which can talk to NetSend. If that’s the only route, then BGP would make sure that you and Convergence could communicate through it. But if alternatively, both DecadeConnect and NetSend were connected to ThirdLevel, BGP would likely choose to route your traffic through it, as it's a shorter hop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="k1vLb7"&gt;Okay, so BGP is like maps that detail all the fastest ways from you to a website?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="XJHByP"&gt;Right! Unfortunately, it can get even more complicated because the shortest doesn’t always equal best. There are plenty of reasons why a routing algorithm would choose one path over another — &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;cost can be a factor as well&lt;/a&gt;, with some networks charging others if they want to include them in their routes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="1M9KLB"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Mapping unchanging roads is hard; imagine mapping the internet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="RKHu1I"&gt;Also, maps are super tricky! I discovered this just recently trying to &lt;a href="https://palousetocascadestrail.org/maps.html"&gt;plan a trip&lt;/a&gt; where roads existed on one map and not another or were different between maps. One road even had three different names across three maps. If it’s that hard to pin down for a “town” that has all of five roads, imagine what it’s like &lt;em&gt;trying to connect the entire internet together&lt;/em&gt;. Real roads don’t change that often, but websites can move from one country to another or change, add, or subtract service providers, and the internet just has to deal with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="3p1hup"&gt;I remember something like this from my algorithms and data structures class — trying to build algos to find the shortest route.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="6tUWdq"&gt;I’ll take your word on that. I dropped out as soon as I heard about graphs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VqmwFa"&gt;But Facebook didn’t! In fact, it’s built its own BGP system, which lets it do “fast incremental updates,” according to &lt;a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/nsdi21-abhashkumar.pdf"&gt;a paper presented earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;. That said, the system the company describes there is meant for communication &lt;em&gt;within&lt;/em&gt; data centers — at this point, it’s hard to say what caused Facebook’s problems on Monday, and it’d take someone smarter than me to say whether Facebook’s datacenter communications could cause this kind of issue. Cybersecurity reporter &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/briankrebs/status/1445147230244061184?s=21"&gt;Bryan Krebs claims&lt;/a&gt; that the outage was caused by a “routine BGP update.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xoGOJr"&gt;&lt;a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/04/networking-traffic/outage/"&gt;In Facebook’s engineering update&lt;/a&gt;, the company said that the issue was caused by “configuration changes on the backbone routers that coordinate network traffic between our data centers.” That then led to a “cascading effect on the way [Facebook’s] data centers communicate, bringing [its] services to a halt.” At least to my eye, it reads like the problem was Facebook communicating within itself, not to the outside world (though that can obviously cause a worldwide outage, given &lt;a href="https://domainnamewire.com/2016/04/14/facebook-now-owns-domain-name-registrar/"&gt;how much of its own network stack&lt;/a&gt; Facebook controls).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="wo7RY5"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wHfYUbKNEyc?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h1 id="xoON2I"&gt;What does DNS have to do with all this?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="FGuWsc"&gt;To borrow &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/bgp-hijacking/"&gt;an explanation from Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;: DNS tells you where you’re going, and BGP tells you how to get there. DNS is how computers know what IP address a website or other resource can be found at, but that knowledge itself isn’t helpful — if you ask your friend where their house is, you’re still probably going to need GPS to get you there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="T1Pfe6"&gt;Cloudflare also has a &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/"&gt;great technical rundown&lt;/a&gt; of how BGP errors can also mess up DNS requests — the article is specifically about Monday’s Facebook incident, so it’s worth a read if you’re looking for an explanation of what it looked like from an autonomous system’s perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="SX5gSi"&gt;What can go wrong with BGP?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="ulglag"&gt;Many things. &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;According to Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;, two notable incidents include a Turkish ISP accidentally telling the entire internet to route its traffic to its service in 2004 and a Pakistani ISP accidentally banning YouTube worldwide after trying to do so only for its users. Because of BGP’s ability to spread from autonomous system to autonomous system (which, as a reminder, is one of the things that makes it so darn useful), one group making a mistake can cascade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="opwgjA"&gt;&lt;q&gt;BGP is sometimes called the duct tape of the internet&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cAmSlc"&gt;One group getting owned can also cause problems — in 2018, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/24/17275982/myetherwallet-hack-bgp-dns-hijacking-stolen-ethereum"&gt;hackers were able to hijack requests to Amazon’s DNS&lt;/a&gt; and steal thousands of dollars in Ethereum by compromising a separate ISP’s BGP servers. Amazon wasn’t the one hacked, but traffic meant for it ended up somewhere else. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUS9AS"&gt;Or, you can mess up a configuration and delete your entire service off the internet with a bad BGP update. BGP is lovingly called the duct tape of the internet, but no adhesive is perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="5nLdTL"&gt;So what happened to Facebook?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="FZM7pm"&gt;It turns out that BGP played a part in Facebook's issues but wasn’t the root cause. In its &lt;a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details/"&gt;detailed explanation, released on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;, the company says that a command issued as part of routine maintenance accidentally disconnected all of Facebook’s data centers (oops!). When the company’s DNS servers saw that the network backbone was no longer talking to the internet, they stopped sending out BGP advertisements because it was clear that something had gone wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ava2Rm"&gt;To the wider internet, this looked like Facebook telling everyone to take its servers off their maps. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jgrahamc/status/1445065270272434176"&gt;Cloudflare’s CTO&lt;/a&gt; reported that the service saw a ton of BGP updates from Facebook (most of which were route withdrawals or erasing lines on the map leading to Facebook) right before it went dark. One of Fastly’s tech leads tweeted that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ryan505/status/1445072241256013828"&gt;Facebook stopped providing routes to Fastly&lt;/a&gt; when it went offline, and &lt;em&gt;KrebsOnSecurity&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/10/what-happened-to-facebook-instagram-whatsapp/"&gt;backed up the idea&lt;/a&gt; that it was some update to Facebook’s BGP that knocked out its services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ksYqld"&gt;I’d recommend &lt;a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/october-2021-facebook-outage/"&gt;Cloudflare's explanation&lt;/a&gt; if you want nitty-gritty technical details of what it looks like when BGP goes wrong. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eqYJ9j"&gt;In summary, though, yes: Facebook’s BGP system essentially took its service off the map. However, it only did so because the company’s infrastructure was down for other reasons — the Facebook island the maps pointed to more or less no longer existed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="Qx49q6"&gt;If BGP had been the problem, how would Facebook fix it?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="oggKOH"&gt;If it took down Facebook’s internal networks, it wouldn’t have been easy. Facebook detailed the difficulties it had bringing its systems back up in its Tuesday blog post, and there were reports of Facebook employees &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sheeraf/status/1445099150316503057"&gt;being locked out from badge-protected doors&lt;/a&gt; and of employees struggling to communicate. In situations like these, you not only have to figure out who has the knowledge to solve the problem, and who has the permissions to solve the problem, but how to connect those people. And when your entire company is essentially shut down, that’s no easy task — &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709575/facebook-outage-instagram-whatsapp"&gt;received reports&lt;/a&gt; of engineers being physically sent to a Facebook data center in California to try to fix the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5uLo2x"&gt;If the problem had been a BGP misconfiguration, Facebook would have needed to make sure that it was advertising the correct records and that those records were picked up by the internet at large. In other words, it’d need to make sure its maps were right and that everyone could see them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="j4Msf9"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Locked out and totally down: Facebook is scrambling to fix massive outage","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709575/facebook-outage-instagram-whatsapp"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;h1 id="ETZccb"&gt;Would Web3 solve this problem?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="TSKifo"&gt;Stop it. I will cry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b3JHHM"&gt;But to quickly answer the question, probably not — even if Facebook hopped on the decentralized train, there’d still have to be some protocol telling you where to find its resources. We’ve seen that it’s possible to &lt;a href="https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/09/30/defi-money-market-compound-overpays-15m-in-comp-rewards-in-possible-exploit/"&gt;misconfigure or mess up blockchain contracts&lt;/a&gt; before, so I’d be a bit suspicious of anyone who said that a contract and blockchain-based internet would be immune to this kind of issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="7sIC21"&gt;Sure was fishy timing on that outage given all the bad Facebook news, huh?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p id="CjEq4n"&gt;Right, so obviously, the fact that this all happened while &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;a whistleblower was going on TV and airing out Facebook’s dirty laundry&lt;/a&gt; makes it really easy to come up with alternative explanations. But it’s just as possible that this is an innocent mistake that some (very, very unfortunate) person on Facebook’s IT staff made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Uimo91"&gt;For what it’s worth, that’s Facebook’s explanation. It lays the blame on a “faulty configuration change” that it made, not any devious hacks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wxu2O4"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 10:44PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with information from Facebook’s official engineering post.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="e4Fl6n"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 5th, 2:33PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with explanation from Facebook’s new engineering post, which detailed that an incorrect command that brought down its network was the root cause of the issue, and its BGP system’s role in the outage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook explains the backbone shutdown behind its global outage on Monday</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/c3FDkE07cRhR3lPbjLLn4ol8PnI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69955447/acastro_180806_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="wiux5N"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708989/instagram-facebook-outage-messenger-whatsapp-error"&gt;massive outage&lt;/a&gt; that took down Facebook, its associated services (Instagram, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709669/facebook-outage-whatsapp-signal-telegram-encrypted"&gt;WhatsApp&lt;/a&gt;, Oculus, Messenger), its platform for businesses, and the company’s own internal network all started with routine maintenance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k8jQFA"&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2021/10/05/networking-traffic/outage-details/"&gt;infrastructure vice president Santosh Janardhan&lt;/a&gt;, a command issued during maintenance inadvertently caused a shutdown of the backbone that connects all of Facebook’s data centers, everywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZFpNTp"&gt;That by itself is bad enough, but as we’ve already explained, the reason you couldn’t use Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709260/what-is-bgp-border-gateway-protocol-explainer-internet-facebook-outage"&gt;is that the DNS and BGP routing information pointing to its servers suddenly disappeared&lt;/a&gt;. According to Janardhan, that problem was a secondary issue, as Facebook’s DNS servers noted the loss of connection to the backbone and stopped advertising the BGP routing information that helps every computer on the internet find its servers. The DNS servers were still working, but they were unreachable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="a1HLnv"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Yesterday’s outage across our products was a bad one, so we’re sharing some more detail here on exactly what happened, how it happened, and what we’re learning from it: &lt;a href="https://t.co/IXRt572h4c"&gt;https://t.co/IXRt572h4c&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Schroepfer (@schrep) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/schrep/status/1445444372804161536?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 5, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vaEavJ"&gt;The lack of network connections and loss of DNS cut off the servers from engineers trying to fix the issue and disabled many of the tools they normally use for repair and communication — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709575/facebook-outage-instagram-whatsapp"&gt;just as we heard yesterday&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="IjFOjO"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"What is BGP, and what role did it play in Facebook’s massive outage?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709260/what-is-bgp-border-gateway-protocol-explainer-internet-facebook-outage"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="SJwWdp"&gt;The blog post notes that the engineers had additional hurdles due to the physical and system security around this crucial hardware. Once they did “activate the secure access protocols” (this is apparently not a code word for “cut open the server door with an angle grinder), they were able to get the backbone online and slowly restore services in gradually increasing loads. That’s part of the reason it took some people longer to get access back yesterday, as the power and computing demands of turning everything on at once might have caused more crashes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CPTwv0"&gt;So that’s it. No conspiracy theories, and no techs taking axes to secure facilities to turn Mark Zuckerberg’s baby back on. Just a bug in a command that an audit tool missed, and for six hours, services that connect billions of people disappeared. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook is back online after a massive outage that also took down Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and Oculus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dG0Qx5icf91JlXCq-1SEPtG9q6w=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69948694/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="yQnrks"&gt;Just as Facebook’s Antigone Davis was live on CNBC&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;defending the company over a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/3/22707860/facebook-whistleblower-leaked-documents-files-regulation"&gt;whistleblower’s accusations&lt;/a&gt; and its handling of research data &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/29/22701445/facebook-instagram-mental-health-research-pdfs-documents"&gt;suggesting Instagram is harmful to teens&lt;/a&gt;, its entire network of services suddenly went offline. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpmd6V"&gt;The outage started just before noon ET and took nearly six hours &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709654/instagram-facebook-outage-whatsapp-oculus"&gt;before it was resolved&lt;/a&gt;. This is the worst outage for Facebook since a 2019 incident &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265185/facebook-instagram-whatsapp-outage-2019-return-back"&gt;took its site offline for more than 24 hours&lt;/a&gt;, as the downtime &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/14/18265002/facebook-instagram-outage-ad-revenue-lost"&gt;hit hardest on the small businesses and creators who rely on these services&lt;/a&gt; for their income. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8dY4v4"&gt;Facebook &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709806/facebook-says-the-six-hour-outage"&gt;issued an explanation for the outage on Monday evening&lt;/a&gt;, saying that it was due to a configuration issue. On Tuesday afternoon, Facebook engineers offered more detail, explaining that the company’s backbone connection between data centers shut down during routine maintenance, which caused the DNS servers to go offline. These two factors combined in making the problem more difficult to fix, and they help explain why services were offline for so long.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="7yxrxr"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Facebook explains the backbone shutdown behind its global outage on Monday","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710963/facebook-dns-bgp-outage-backbone-maintenance"},{"title":"What is BGP, and how might it have helped kick Facebook off the internet?","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709260/what-is-bgp-border-gateway-protocol-explainer-internet-facebook-outage"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="2qvcSC"&gt;&lt;a href="http://instagram.com/"&gt;Instagram.com&lt;/a&gt; was flashing a 5xx Server Error message, while the Facebook site merely told us that something went wrong. The problem also affected its virtual reality arm, Oculus. Users could load games they already have installed, and the browser works, but social features or installing new games didn’t.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jC6Rko"&gt;After failing all tests for most of Monday, a test of ISP DNS servers via &lt;a href="http://DNSchecker.org"&gt;DNSchecker.org&lt;/a&gt; showed most of them successfully finding a route to &lt;a href="http://Facebook.com"&gt;Facebook.com&lt;/a&gt; at 5:30PM ET. A few minutes later, we were able to start using Facebook and Instagram normally; however, it may take time for the DNS fixes to reach everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="edlDtv"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Facebook engineers were dispatched to the company’s US data centers to try and fix the problem&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="e7AlIx"&gt;On Twitter, Facebook communications exec Andy Stone &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/andymstone/status/1445058088436908045"&gt;says&lt;/a&gt;, “We’re aware that some people are having trouble accessing our apps and products. We’re working to get things back to normal as quickly as possible, and we apologize for any inconvenience.” Mike Schroepfer, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/22/22688510/facebook-cto-andrew-boz-bosworth-chief-technology-officer"&gt;who will step down from his post as CTO next year&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/schrep/status/1445114730151043073"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt;, “We are experiencing networking issues and teams are working as fast as possible to debug and restore as fast as possible.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BdUNeh"&gt;Inside Facebook, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709575/facebook-outage-instagram-whatsapp"&gt;the outage broke nearly all of the internal systems employees use to communicate and work&lt;/a&gt;. Several employees told &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;they resorted to talking through their work-provided Outlook email accounts, though employees can’t receive emails from external addresses. Employees who were logged into work tools such as Google Docs and Zoom before the outage can still use those, but any employee who needs to log in with their work email was blocked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ht1q2C"&gt;On Monday we learned that Facebook engineers were sent to the company’s US data centers to try and fix the problem, according to two people familiar with the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="l3G5TB"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Is Facebook down right now? This global outage is tough on everyone","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22709123/facebook-outage-down-detector-cloudflare"},{"title":"Twitter is up, Facebook is down, and Jack Dorsey is laughing ","url":"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/2021/10/4/22709235/twitter-jack-dorsey-dunk-facebook-outage-dns"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;div id="x5968t"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;*Sincere* apologies to everyone impacted by outages of Facebook powered services right now.  We are experiencing networking issues and teams are working as fast as possible to debug and restore as fast as possible&lt;/p&gt;— Mike Schroepfer (@schrep) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/schrep/status/1445114730151043073?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 4, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CmqBiE"&gt;A peek at &lt;a href="https://downdetector.com/status/facebook/"&gt;Down Detector&lt;/a&gt; (or your Twitter feed) reveals the problems were widespread. While it’s unclear exactly why the platforms were unreachable for so many people, their DNS records show that, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702876/slack-is-down-outage-morning-disruption-work-chat"&gt;like last week’s Slack outage&lt;/a&gt;, the problem is apparently DNS (&lt;a href="https://imgur.com/WmRbmf5"&gt;it’s always DNS&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JXykPn"&gt;Cloudflare senior vice president Dane Knecht &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/dok2001/status/1445056572703625218"&gt;notes&lt;/a&gt; that Facebook’s border gateway protocol routes — &lt;a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-bgp/"&gt;BGP&lt;/a&gt; helps networks pick the best path to deliver internet traffic — were suddenly “withdrawn from the internet.” While some have speculated about hackers, or an internal protest over the whistleblower testifying before Congress, Facebook has blamed the problem on a bug that occurred during routine maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JhSAXC"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 3:37PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added additional information about the outage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtXsyU"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 4:15PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statement from Facebook CTO Mike Schroepfer, along with internal Facebook updates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JQ06Jm"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 5PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Noted outage is still ongoing, added information about the 2019 outage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zNGZJ3"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 5:35PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;DNS updates suggest Facebook is closing in on a solution.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Av16YP"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 6:08PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://Facebook.com"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Facebook.com&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; is back online.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZMoEdQ"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 4th, 10:29PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about Facebook’s explanation.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KZ83GO"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 5th, 2:29PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added more background details on the backbone network problem that caused the outage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple’s healthcare division leaned on misleading data, report alleges</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iZ93EsHt1XJiciYHKVkgpQsj-AI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69955506/acstro_190902_apple_event_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="bEcnjw"&gt;Apple employees raising concerns that misleading data was used to support new health products were dismissed or met with hostility, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-health-employees-backlash-misled-executives-2021-9"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt;. In addition, a lack of structure within the health group, along with other organizational problems, is slowing and frustrating the company’s ambitions to push into healthcare, current and former Apple employees told &lt;em&gt;Insider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zDZBVX"&gt;Some concerns focused on clinics Apple set up to both provide healthcare to employees and develop ways to integrate data collected from Apple devices into care. One doctor involved with the project, Will Poe, said in a resignation letter to CEO Tim Cook that he was concerned that members of the team were giving misleading and too-rosy information to Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams, who oversees the company’s health effort, former employees told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. Poe was concerned that team members told&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Williams that the clinics provided “high-quality” care, even though the quality of care wasn’t being measured in a standardized way, &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; reported. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JBlaTQ"&gt;Other employees raised similar concerns to Cook and Williams, &lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;reported, but the company didn’t take any action. “The company does not want help. It is completely happy with the current status quo,” a former employee told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JCUSpb"&gt;Apple claims that parts of the &lt;em&gt;Insider &lt;/em&gt;story are based on “outdated” information. The company is still in the “early innings of our work in health technology,” Fred Sainz, a senior director of corporate communications for Apple, said in a statement to &lt;em&gt;Insider.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJH1Uw"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22536623/apple-primary-care-project-data-watch-app"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt; report&lt;/a&gt; from June&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;also outlined issues with the internal health clinics and said that employees were concerned about the way data was collected and presented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QItFMt"&gt;The Apple hardware team’s focus on creating apps and products for consumers, not for medicine, also complicated work by the health team to build a more robust primary care program through the internal clinics, &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; reported. The company began to think of the clinics and their work as a way to drive Apple Watch sales, rather than as their own project, people familiar with the approach told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cVL2DQ"&gt;Current and past employees told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt; there is no clear strategy for the health team and that internal culture doesn’t allow for feedback. One doctor working with the clinic’s team had her direct reports removed after speaking up about the clinic’s care and pushing back on Sumbul Desai, vice president of health at Apple and head of the project, in a meeting. A senior engineering program manager was fired soon after saying in a meeting that “some people in the organization preferred telling good stories over accurately representing the data,” former employees told &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wMbn0u"&gt;​“Any and all allegations of retaliatory behavior are investigated thoroughly and handled with appropriate corrective actions,” Sainz said in the statement to &lt;em&gt;Insider&lt;/em&gt;. “All health leaders encourage employees to always do what’s right, speak up and raise questions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="925hYg"&gt;The revelations come as Apple’s overall culture is &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22700898/apple-company-culture-change-secrecy-employee-unrest"&gt;starting to shift&lt;/a&gt;, with more employees speaking out about the workplace and pushing for executives to take concerns seriously. “The overarching desire...is that employees want to feel heard,” Zoe Schiffer wrote in &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
