    <title>Italian authorities fine Google $120 million for   an Android Auto issue that’s already solved</title>

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mfg0Dw"&gt;The Italian Competition Authority (ICA) &lt;a href="https://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2021/5/A529"&gt;handed Google&lt;/a&gt; an approximately $120 million (€100 million) fine today for not letting a third-party charging app on Android Auto in 2019 (&lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/05/13/google-android-auto-fine-italy/"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). The case started with a probe into the search giant’s automotive software business, which &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2020/10/introducing-android-for-cars-app-library.html"&gt;until October 2020&lt;/a&gt; had limitations around what kinds of apps were allowed to be developed and released for use while driving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BBvnS6"&gt;Enel Group, an Italian energy company, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/17/18629912/google-android-auto-italy-antitrust-probe-enel-group"&gt;originally complained&lt;/a&gt; in 2019 that Google wouldn’t allow its Enel X Recharge app on Android Auto. The app can help find charging locations for electric cars, a feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/16/17983986/google-maps-electric-car-charging-tesla-superchargers"&gt;Google first added to Google Maps&lt;/a&gt; in 2018. Today’s ICA fine is focused on &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.enelx.com%2Fro%2Fen%2Felectric-mobility%2Fproducts%2Fprivates%2Fjuicepass-app&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F13%2F22434373%2Fitalian-antitrust-fine-google-android-auto-enel-x-juicepass" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Enel X JuicePass&lt;/a&gt;, which is &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.enelx.com%2Fit%2Fen%2Fnews-media%2Fnotizie%2F2019%2F07%2Fapp-enelx-juicepass-new-name-new-energy&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F5%2F13%2F22434373%2Fitalian-antitrust-fine-google-android-auto-enel-x-juicepass" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the renamed version&lt;/a&gt; of the same app with the same EV features. Along with the fine, the ICA is ordering Google to open up Android Auto to more developers (something the company has already done) and let Enel Group onto the platform:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="lV81Ml"&gt;The Authority has therefore ordered Google to make available to Enel X Italia, as well as to other app developers, tools for the programming of apps that are interoperable with Android Auto and will monitor the effective and correct implementation of the imposed obligations through an independent expert to whom Google must provide all cooperation and information requested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="Pe44Ug"&gt;Before changing what apps it allows, Google required Android Auto apps to include some kind of messaging or media playback option, and limited navigation to Waze and Google Maps. Since the company changed course, similar charging apps to JuicePass, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409310/chargepoint-android-auto-electric-vehicle-charging-network"&gt;like ChargePoint&lt;/a&gt;, have launched on the platform, seemingly without any issues. Since the ICA began its investigation before Google eased up its restrictions, there’s a possibility Enel’s complaints helped motivate the change in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8sqqyU"&gt;For its part, Google says it disagrees with the ICA’s decision and provided this statement in response:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="ro12BR"&gt;The number one priority for Android Auto is to ensure apps can be used safely while driving. That’s why we have strict guidelines on the types of apps which are currently supported and these are based on driver-distraction tests and regulatory and industry standards. Thousands of applications are already compatible with Android Auto, and our goal is to allow even more developers to make their apps available over time. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="sMDVkE"&gt;The company also says that Enel is able to integrate its app into Android Auto using one of the &lt;a href="https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/04/start-your-engines-launch-new-android.html"&gt;navigation or booking templates&lt;/a&gt; it already provides.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eJ2BFd"&gt;As &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/3/22150166/android-auto-expands-countries-europe-africa-asia"&gt;Android Auto becomes more common&lt;/a&gt; and Google develops direct relationships with European automakers &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537200/google-android-auto-volvo-polestar-2-hands-on-demo-io-2019"&gt;like Volvo for Android Automotive&lt;/a&gt;, the concern that the company wields too much control over its platform isn’t ridiculous. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Renewable energy won’t make Elon Musk love bitcoin again</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla And Bitcoin Stock Pictures" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/35O-AIPDvnT_ctmHdreebLFvDZM=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69282442/1231424737.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GuAl4W"&gt;Elon Musk shouldn’t hold his breath waiting for bitcoin to become environmentally friendly enough for Tesla to take it as payment. Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433153/tesla-suspend-bitcoin-vehicle-purchase-cryptocurrency-elon-musk"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; yesterday that Tesla was walking away from the cryptocurrency because of the fossil fuels used for bitcoin mining and transactions. In the announcement, he left the door open for Tesla to accept bitcoin again if mining the cryptocurrency eventually runs on “more sustainable energy.” But some experts caution that renewable energy is not a silver bullet for bitcoin’s sustainability problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dP7Cl6"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Tesla &amp;amp; Bitcoin &lt;a href="https://t.co/YSswJmVZhP"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YSswJmVZhP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1392602041025843203?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;May 12, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="u8w3gz"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;spoke with Alex de Vries, a digital currency economist who has consistently called out bitcoin’s growing greenhouse gas emissions. He runs the blog &lt;a href="https://digiconomist.net/bitcoin-energy-consumption"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Digiconomist&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which keeps a running tab on bitcoin’s estimated energy use and emissions. While some other &lt;a href="https://www.coincenter.org/estimating-bitcoin-electricity-use-a-beginners-guide/"&gt;researchers&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/8/22373524/cryptocurrency-climate-accord-bitcoin-carbon-footprint"&gt;blockchain enthusiasts&lt;/a&gt; have been more optimistic about the potential for renewable energy to slash bitcoin’s emissions, de Vries has &lt;a href="https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(19)30087-X"&gt;published papers&lt;/a&gt; arguing that the climate calculations just don’t add up. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; spoke with de Vries about why he’s still skeptical about bitcoin going green through renewables, other ways the cryptocurrency could cut its pollution, and how bitcoin compares to alternatives like Dogecoin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X3Q87I"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FVO7g0"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you have any reaction to the &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/9/22275243/teslas-bitcoin-purchase-clashes-climate-change-mission"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;news in February&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt; that Tesla was going to accept bitcoin for payments?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qTgJMw"&gt;I was shocked at the time because bitcoin isn’t an ESG-friendly currency. We know that a big part of the mining is done by using Chinese coal; that’s something that isn’t new information. Mining itself is a really big lottery where the machines that are participating are just generating useless computations all the time so they’re literally wasting resources for making new blocks for this blockchain. It’s really weird that a company that has a mission statement that involves decarbonizing the planet gets involved with a currency that ultimately involves the waste of natural resources, specifically fossil fuels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="xJn0Ne"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“I was shocked at the time”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xVoCkz"&gt;The bitcoin network is responsible for 55 million metric tons of CO2 annually, which is as much as a nation like Singapore. Ironically, it’s also &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/digieconomist/status/1389521169657868288?s=21"&gt;more than the entire estimated net gains from deploying electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SUuzNj"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What was your reaction to yesterday’s news that Elon decided to backtrack on that?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OvH4Os"&gt;Well, my initial response was better late than never. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6rx4f4"&gt;In his statement, Elon Musk says that they’re doing this because of an increasing amount of fossil fuels used for bitcoin mining. Now in all honesty, there hasn’t been that much change. Let’s be real, Tesla announced that it would accept bitcoin two months ago, and not that much has changed since then. The total amount of resources going into the network has gone up by a bit, but we already knew that was primarily Chinese coal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="H7G1jk"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;It’s interesting that Musk says Tesla will go back to bitcoin “as soon as mining transitions to more sustainable energy.” Do you think that can happen? Why or why not?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yd85Lc"&gt;In all honesty, it makes no sense. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="P77109"&gt;In the past few years, miners have only been getting renewables from the south of China, that has been their only major source of renewables. And it doesn’t last. It lasts for only four months a year and because the production is seasonal. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="uFFjYz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“In all honesty, it makes no sense”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="SGtDj7"&gt;That’s the problem with renewable energy sources in general: they can’t provide these machines with 24/7 power all year long. For example, it was recently argued that &lt;a href="https://github.com/ARKInvest/SolarBatteryBitcoin"&gt;miners could be using solar power&lt;/a&gt; for bitcoin mining, which sounds like a great idea. But if you read what should happen to do that, bitcoin miners would need to be shut down during half the day in order to make that work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="R6x9ji"&gt;That makes no sense if you’re an investor in these machines, because you’re paying a whole lot of money for a device that the moment you get, it starts becoming obsolete. If you miss out on half a day, you’re missing out on a level of income that’s just never going to come back. You want to have these machines running 24/7 if you want to maximize your profit, which is a lot easier if you’re running on Chinese coal than if you’re running on solar power for half a day — so there’s no real incentive to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qUH2vS"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You published a paper that argued that renewable energy will not solve bitcoin’s sustainability problem — can you walk me through why? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjHCt4"&gt;A big amount of bitcoin miners can always cause problems no matter what type of energy they’re using. It can lead to outages if mining becomes really popular in the particular spot. What also might be happening is that you’re using renewable energy that you could have used a different way to clean up the grid elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iMJjUV"&gt;Even if, hypothetically speaking, this whole network was running on renewable energy. Still, it doesn’t solve the sustainability issues of bitcoin. Bitcoin uses excessive amounts of hardware. You have a bunch of specialized equipment that can only do bitcoin mining. The moment they become unprofitable, there’s nothing you can do with them. You can’t repurpose them, you can’t use them as a home computer. It’s trash. And they don’t last very long, on average maybe one and a half years. So you’ve got millions of devices that are becoming obsolete extremely fast. That just results in a big pile of electronic waste down the line. It’s already the case that a single bitcoin transaction is equivalent to throwing away an iPhone 12 mini in terms of materials, that’s already how bad it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1lqJaE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there better solutions to bitcoin’s sustainability problem? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cUYCEB"&gt;The good thing is that Elon Musk did mention the alternative cryptocurrencies that don’t have the same environmental impact. This is a very important point because the energy consumption issue in bitcoin relates to the proof of work algorithm. That is a specific part of the bitcoin software that is not necessarily present in alternative cryptocurrencies because there’s different ways to do the block creation process. In bitcoin, it depends on computational power, but there are alternatives. Proof of stake is the most popular one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="pus0uh"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Cryptocurrencies that don’t have the same environmental impact&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="duZu1x"&gt;The second largest cryptocurrency of the moment, Ethereum, is right now running proof of work but is planning to change that to proof of stake. What that does is it makes the block creation process depend on wealth, rather than computational power, so there’s no incentive to have energy-hungry specialized hardware. That fixes both the energy need, as well as the hardware need. If you have something running on proof of stake, it wouldn’t even be 0.1 percent of the energy needed to run bitcoin. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SjE85M"&gt;If Ethereum can turn to proof of stake, theoretically, so can bitcoin, which would actually fix the environmental issues. But so far there has been no move inside the community to make such things happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9bT1x4"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Musk has also talked up Dogecoin in the past. How does Dogecoin compare to bitcoin? Do you see it becoming as bad for the climate as bitcoin? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HLPFwe"&gt;The thing is, if something runs on proof of work, which is the case in Dogecoin, then it’s just as bad as bitcoin. The impact that Dogecoin has currently is a lot smaller than bitcoin, but that’s because the value of Dogecoin is a lot less and these things are directly related with each other. That’s kind of been the essence of my work over the past few years. There is a direct relationship between the value of these assets, how much money is being earned by the miners, and how much they’re spending on electricity. Very simply said, the more valuable an asset, the more money will be made by miners, the more they will spend on resources like hardware and energy. So, the fact that Dogecoin has a smaller impact than bitcoin is just because the value is a lot less, but if they were the same size, the impact would be equally bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="xge3lH"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“Just as bad as bitcoin”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="oPVeXG"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;We’ve already started to see the value of bitcoin drop after Musk’s announcement. Are we starting to see emissions or energy use fall as well?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J4S7wb"&gt;No. The price has gone down by maybe 15 percent. That does reduce the potential future emissions of the network. But it doesn’t reduce today’s emissions because, right now, bitcoin mining is extremely profitable. As it stands, the network’s impact will still continue to increase, unless the price goes down by a lot more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBOJgE"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How much more would it take to see a decline in emissions?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SYzIIg"&gt;I wrote about that in a &lt;a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/349952553_Bitcoin_Boom_What_Rising_Prices_Mean_for_the_Network's_Energy_Consumption"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; recently. The current price is still around $50,000 per coin today, although I haven’t checked it for the past hour. Below $30,000, that’s where the current energy consumption would start to go down, so it has a long way to go. That’s kind of the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vaccinated people can ditch masks and social distancing in most places, CDC says </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A woman receives her Covid-19 vaccination at a vaccination..." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/MLGBCtWXZsTVRlpugaQn30J0eDw=/0x0:5000x3333/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69282332/1232851574.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A woman receives a vaccine in a Pennsylvania clinic. | Photo by Preston Ehrler/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="I9qF7b"&gt;People who are fully vaccinated can shed their masks and gather indoors or outdoors without worrying about social distancing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/fully-vaccinated.html"&gt;announced today&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hTBiPw"&gt;“If you were fully vaccinated, you can start doing the things that you had stopped doing because of the pandemic. We have all longed for this moment, when we can get back to some sense of normalcy,” CDC director Rochelle Walensky said in a press conference today.   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UtkYhb"&gt;There are a few caveats. Vaccinated people who are immunocompromised should talk to their doctor before getting rid of their masks, Walensky said. Certain settings will still require a mask, including health care settings, public transit, and on planes or trains. And if someone develops symptoms, they should mask back up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LOpKdb"&gt;She also cautioned that if the situation with the pandemic gets worse in the US, the guidance might change, too — if there is a spike in cases, or a new outbreak, masks and social distancing measures may return. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8uCb33"&gt;The new announcement is a shift from just a few weeks ago, when the CDC &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/27/22405869/covid-vaccine-mask-guidelines-cdc"&gt;relaxed its masking recommendations&lt;/a&gt; for fully vaccinated people in some situations, mostly outdoors. At the time, it continued to encourage people to wear masks during most indoor activities. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4gSlB"&gt;More than 46 percent percent of adults in the United States are fully vaccinated. Studies have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358085/covid-vaccines-effective-real-world-infection-protection-cdc"&gt;repeatedly shown&lt;/a&gt; that vaccines not only protect people from the virus that causes COVID-19, but that vaccinated people are unlikely to pass it to someone else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lCFLPt"&gt;As of this week, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22395472/covid-vaccine-pfizer-kid-ages-12-15-fda-authorization"&gt;vaccines are authorized for people 12 years and older&lt;/a&gt; in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5lGDKd"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Developing...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best laptop you can buy in 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Dell XPS 13, Dell XPS 15, HP Elite Dragonfly, Surface Laptop 3, MacBook Pro, and Lenovo Yoga C740." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C554ZjlwY7R1hgqzx9H7bhxKvWA=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66770456/VRG_4013_Best_Laptop_Grid.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: William Joel/The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best laptops for you, from ultraportables to high-powered editing machines&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="x1Etox"&gt;The best laptop of 2021 can come with a variety of brands, prices, and features. Here, we’ve got the rest of the best laptops, Windows 10 business notebooks, gaming rigs, Chromebooks, laptops for school, and 2-in-1 convertibles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="lfv5g0"&gt;Our current pick for the best laptop of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air&lt;/a&gt;. It’s a device that does just about everything right. While it’s certainly not a perfect device, there are no major flaws. It’s a great pick for productivity, browsing, and even light gaming. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SNThzL"&gt;We live in a world where smartphones are ubiquitous, tablets are commonplace, and even smartwatches are a thing that people talk about on the regular. But throughout all of these advances, the humble laptop has persevered — and for good reason. When it comes time to work, whether that's editing photos, writing a lot of emails, composing documents, or staying in touch with colleagues and family, we’re here with our top picks to help you find the best laptop for the job. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="31HnuI"&gt;It's getting harder to buy a bad laptop, but what separates the best laptop of 2021 from good laptops is how they balance power, efficiency, portability, and comfort. The top laptop should have a fantastic keyboard and trackpad — after all, those are the two biggest reasons you'd choose a laptop over a smartphone or tablet. Its display should be easy on the eyes, bright, and sharp enough that you aren't distracted by jagged edges and visible pixels. It should be powerful enough for most anything short of intensive video editing and advanced gaming. It should be easy to carry around from place to place, and it should be able to last all day without needing to be plugged in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hnoYs"&gt;In our view, the best laptop for budget shoppers is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 13&lt;/a&gt;. For a sub-$1,000 price, it delivers performance on par with much more expensive laptops.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7ABV8A"&gt;Our other picks for the best laptops, Chromebooks, and 2-in-1s of 2021 include the Asus ROG Zephyrus G14, the MacBook Pro 16, and the HP Elite Dragonfly. Check out the full list of best laptop picks below. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Apple MacBook Air is the best laptop of 2020.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oTToOm"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21569603/apple-macbook-air-m1-review-price-specs-features-arm-silicon"&gt;MacBook Air (late 2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rE8ByG"&gt;The best laptop of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="qIDMjX"&gt;The late-2020 MacBook Air, powered by Apple’s M1 processor, is the best laptop you can buy. The base model, which includes 8GB of RAM and 256 GB of storage, starts at $999. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GYCzY0"&gt;Appearance-wise, this laptop has a lot in common with the Intel-powered MacBook Air that Apple released earlier this year, including the same 2560 x 1600 screen, Touch ID, 720p webcam, fingerprint sensor, and scissor-switch keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iDDWFN"&gt;But the new processor is the star of the show here; it’s fast. In our testing, it handled intense photo- and video-editing workloads better than almost any Intel-powered laptop we’ve tried this year. It was also able to run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at close-to-playable frame rates, which is quite a feat for integrated graphics. At launch, these apps hadn’t yet been optimized for the M1 processor and were running through Apple’s Rosetta 2 translation layer — but they still worked fine. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ACwNY3"&gt;And the processing power didn’t even weigh down the battery life: we got between eight and 10 hours of sustained work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="XZkaRR"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10220133"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="8eGPnz"&gt;Another benefit of the M1 processor is that it enables the MacBook Air to run iPhone and iPad apps natively on macOS. As of this writing, there still isn’t a huge selection of mobile apps available, and some that have been released aren’t quite optimized for the laptop screen. Still, it’s a benefit we can look forward to as time goes on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NjPO8F"&gt;Overall, there’s no reason that a general-use customer shouldn’t consider the MacBook Air. It’s a reliable device with excellent performance, as well as the excellence in build quality for which Apple is known. Power users who need a MacBook Pro probably know who they are; the Air should be fine for everyone else. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Spectre x360 14 is one of the best convertible laptops you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="O7mXrt"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22264792/hp-spectre-x360-14-laptop-stylus-oled-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Spectre x360 14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="N7xEV5"&gt;The best Windows laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="4nwIVn"&gt;It’s hard to come up with a single complaint about the Spectre x360 14. It’s a drop-dead gorgeous machine with a sturdy build and a premium look and feel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xL3xF1"&gt;But the Spectre x360 14 isn’t just pretty to look at: it’s also a pleasure to use as a daily work driver. Intel’s latest 11th Gen processors and Iris Xe integrated graphics deliver snappy performance with no slowdown or freezes that we observed. And we got an average of 10 hours of battery life out of the device — one of the best results we’ve ever seen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yfMa1S"&gt;On the outside, the Spectre includes a roomy 3:2 display, and if FHD resolution doesn’t suit your fancy, there are OLED and 1,000-nit options available. There’s even a packaged stylus, which attaches magnetically to the side of the Spectre — handy if you’re using the device as a tablet. Pretty much every other aspect of this laptop, from its comfortable keyboard and smooth touchpad to its bass-heavy audio and practical port selection, rivals or exceeds the best convertibles on the market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xxTNW9"&gt;Such an exceptional package of features doesn’t come cheap, and many customers will find everything they need in a less expensive product. But the Spectre x360 14 is the new gold standard of Windows convertibles. Overall, it’s the best Windows laptop you can buy.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The LG Gram 17 is the lightweight 17-inch laptop to buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="SoHxJX"&gt;3. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22364183/lg-gram-17-2021-intel-11th-gen-iris-xe-graphics-performance-battery-review"&gt;LG Gram 17 (2021)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aOmcws"&gt;The best laptop in 2021 for big-screen fans&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="ovDneV"&gt;Even if you’ve used a light laptop before, it’s difficult to explain how light the LG Gram 17 is. It has a massive 17-inch display, but it’s somehow only three pounds. Picking it up messes with your mind; you feel like you’re not holding anything. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AbftFc"&gt;But the Gram 17’s weight isn’t the only standout feature. It also has some of the best battery life you can get, lasting over 12 hours in our testing. Add a great keyboard, a solid port selection, quiet fans, and a fast processor, and there’s very little not to like about this device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BvoTCC"&gt;Not everyone needs a 17-inch display, and many folks who do are looking for a heavier-duty workstation that probably doesn’t get moved very often. But if you’d just really like a large screen for your daily office work and Netflixing, you’re the target demographic for this machine. It’s a niche, but truly impressive device without much real competition in today’s market.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Envy x360 is the best laptop you can buy for under $1,000.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="7dLyUJ"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21319378/hp-envy-x360-2020-amd-review-price-specs-features"&gt;HP Envy x360 (2020)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="IOuDKK"&gt;The best budget laptop in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6ONzJr"&gt;You don’t need to spend $1,000 to get a laptop that looks and feels premium. The HP Envy x360 2020 is the best budget laptop you can buy, thanks to its sturdy and compact build, chic convertible design, and excellent performance. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5TwdF5"&gt;Part of what makes the Envy so great is that HP has ported over a number of elements from its excellent 2019 flagship, the Spectre x360, including the thin-and-light chassis and nearly bezel-free display with an 88 percent screen-to-body ratio. The touchscreen (which supports HP’s MPP2.0 pen) is bright and looks great. (You can choose a 300-nit, 400-nit, or 1,000-nit panel). And HP has added a row of convenient hotkeys to the keyboard, including kill switches for the microphone and webcam. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xRbztF"&gt;But the most exciting feature is inside: the new Envy x360 is powered by AMD’s Ryzen 4000 series. The Ryzen 5-4500U in my model did an outstanding job with a fairly heavy load of multitasking. And AMD’s integrated Radeon graphics delivered good gaming performance comparable to what you’d expect from a lower-powered discrete GPU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="lYrZ3f"&gt;The best MacBook Pro for everyday users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="yUbRrT"&gt;If you’re looking to buy an M1 MacBook for heavier workloads, you’ll want to look at the late-2020 MacBook Pro. It starts at $1,299, which is $300 more than the late-2020 MacBook Air. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gNImzP"&gt;The MacBook Pro has a slightly different design and look than the Air, as well as a few additional features like the Touch Bar. But the two have the same processor. The main difference is that the Pro includes a fan (the Air is fanless), which means it can sustain heavy workloads for a longer period of time without needing to throttle its performance. But you won’t notice much of a performance difference between the two MacBooks unless you’re routinely pushing heavy tasks for long periods of time. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="USngRn"&gt;If that’s you, though, go for the Pro. We were able to run a number of hefty Premiere Pro exports and didn’t see a dip in times. The Pro also achieved a significantly higher score than the Air in a 30-minute loop of Cinebench R23; the scores were closer together after a single run. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 is the best convertible you can buy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="NKt5f4"&gt;6. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21575308/dell-xps-13-2-in-1-2020-review-tiger-lake-specs-price-features"&gt;Dell XPS 13 2-in-1&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="Ucqsb1"&gt;A great 2-in-1 laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="iLNMXR"&gt;If you’re looking for a convertible laptop that does just about everything right, we recommend Dell’s latest XPS 13 2-in-1. It features a sturdy and well-made chassis, a nearly bezel-free 16:10 touch display, and Intel’s newest 11th Gen processors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dghfZI"&gt;The base model, for $1,099, includes a Core i3-1154G4, 8GB of RAM, a 1920 x 1200 display, and a 256GB SSD. You can spec that up to a 3840 x 2400 display, a Core i7-1165G7, 32GB of RAM, and a 1TB SSD. There are various add-ons as well: you can pay $50 extra for a white model and $60 to upgrade to Windows 10 Pro. Basically, there’s something for everyone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BEAGgI"&gt;Dell has made a few minor tweaks to the 2-in-1 since last year’s model. The webcam now supports Windows Hello, and the RAM and microSD reader have been upgraded. But the exciting news is the new chip and, in particular, Intel’s new integrated graphics. The XPS 13 2-in-1 did a better job than any 10th Gen laptop with an iGPU on our Adobe Premiere Pro export test. And you can even play some games on this thing: it broke 60fps on &lt;em&gt;Rocket League&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;League of Legends&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;, and even managed 36fps on &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; at its lowest settings. That’s an improvement over the results we saw from 10th Gen systems, and it also beats some 11th Gen systems (including the clamshell Dell XPS 13). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="izx3w7"&gt;Of course, it’s not perfect. The port selection is limited (as is customary for modern XPS models) and the keyboard is a bit flat for my taste. But overall, the 2-in-1 excels on the fundamentals: build quality, display, performance, and battery life. What more could you want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="w7TWDY"&gt;The best laptop for college&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6xPrkB"&gt;The Dell XPS 13 is a compact and reliable laptop. Its beautiful chassis, excellent 16:10 display, and great performance make it an excellent choice for general-purpose users. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ik0URk"&gt;This late-2020 model comes with Intel’s new Tiger Lake processors, from a Core i3-1154G4 up to a Core i7-1165G7. It starts at $999, so it’s a bit cheaper than the 2-in-1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MZCO5H"&gt;My review unit (an i7 model) blew through the work tasks I needed it to do without any slowdown or heat. It did quite well, and handily beat its 10th Gen predecessor in both gaming and media work. It didn’t do as well as the XPS 13 2-in-1, which is why that model is ranked higher on this list. But if you like the look and feel of the XPS 13 and would prefer a clamshell model (or need a bouncier keyboard), this XPS is still a great option. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="nxYz9i"&gt;The best gaming laptop in 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="2eqQM4"&gt;At just over four pounds, the Zephyrus G15 is one of the lightest 15-inch gaming laptops you can buy. But you’re not compromising performance for that portability. The G15 is powered by the top mobile chips AMD and Nvidia have to offer, and pairs thim with a fast 165Hz QHD display. In our testing, the system was able to handle even the toughest AAA titles at QHD resolution. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SxthwN"&gt;Almost everything else about the G15 is great too: the audio sounds good, the keyboard and touchpad are some of the best on the market, the port selection has just about everything you’d need, and the battery can last over eight and a half hours to a charge. If you’re looking for a high-powered gaming machine that also works great as a daily driver, the Zephyrus G15 should be at the top of your list. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="TA1Mem"&gt;The best laptop for business travel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="XTubRZ"&gt;In many ways, the ThinkPad X1 Nano is a run-of-the-mill ThinkPad. It’s got a solid sturdy chassis, discrete clickers, a physical privacy shutter, a red TrackPoint in the middle of the keyboard, and all kinds of business-specific security and management features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WdGWMd"&gt;But the Nano is special because it’s the lightest ThinkPad Lenovo has ever made. It’s also one of the lightest laptops you can buy, at just 1.99 pounds. You’re not sacrificing performance to get that mindblowing weight: The Nano kept up with our heavy testing workloads without any fan noise or noticeable heat. If you’re looking for a reliable business laptop that will feel like nothing in your briefcase, this is the one for you.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 is a brilliant gaming laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="JUpNYn"&gt;10. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21197761/asus-rog-zephyrus-g14-review-gaming-laptop-specs-features-price"&gt;Asus ROG Zephyrus G14&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="pLq6K9"&gt;The best 14-inch gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="FBMA49"&gt;The Zephyrus G14 is an astonishingly powerful gaming laptop for a low price (relative to other notebooks with comparable hardware). It pairs AMD’s new Ryzen 9 4900HS with an Nvidia RTX 2060 Max-Q GPU and a 120HZ display, and it can run demanding games at their highest settings without a problem. It’s also quite light for such a powerful laptop, weighing just over 3.5 pounds. Its battery life is also impressive for a gaming rig; we got almost nine hours of multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWOpxK"&gt;But you don’t need to be a gamer to appreciate the Zephyrus G14. It’s also a great notebook for business and everyday multitasking with a unique retro design. Plus, the keyboard and touchpad are exceptional and quiet enough not to bother officemates. On the flip side, if you need to use your laptop for videoconferences, the G14 would not be a great choice, as it lacks a webcam.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The MacBook Pro is an excellent laptop for video editing. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="HfyKBe"&gt;11. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/21/20974649/apple-macbook-pro-16-inch-laptop-review-keyboard-test-specs-price-features"&gt;MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019)&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2WSPjS"&gt;A great choice for Mac power users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="TfAFYg"&gt;The 16-inch MacBook Pro is the best Apple laptop for power users. Apple dealt with the biggest complaints that people have historically had about MacBook Pros, and if you can stomach the price, there’s not a lot else to complain about. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cIH5ZZ"&gt;Most importantly, the keyboard is good again. The keys have a full millimeter of travel, and while the typing experience isn’t exceptional, it’s a world away from the maligned butterfly keyboard of MacBooks past. It’s fairly quiet, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hjExSY"&gt;This MacBook also features the best sound you’ll find on a laptop. Apple has crammed three speakers into each side, including two woofers. The result is balanced audio with audible bass and great stereo separation. For those who need a laptop that can crank through editing video, working with multiple audio tracks, or processing large batches of photos, the 16-inch MacBook Pro is the king of the hill.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The HP Elite Dragonfly is a great business laptop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="XU9ktC"&gt;12. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/9/21247274/hp-elite-dragonfly-2020-review-tile-test-specs-price-features"&gt;HP Elite Dragonfly&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="t0EL7n"&gt;The best business laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="MrOD1p"&gt;If you’re a business professional and money is no object for you or your company, you can’t do better than the HP Elite Dragonfly. The 2020 model is the first Dragonfly that features HP’s super-secure SureView Reflect technology, which tints the screen so that snoops can’t see what you’re doing while you’re working in public. When it’s not tinted, the display gets quite bright (over 700 nits) and has great viewing angles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzVcoU"&gt;The new Dragonfly is also the first laptop to include a built-in Tile tracker. That means if you lose the device, you can use the Tile smartphone app to set off an alarm (if it’s in Bluetooth range) or locate it anywhere in the world using Tile’s crowd-finding network. The tracker can work for a limited time even when the laptop is off. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yXS6n7"&gt;Almost everything else about the Dragonfly is good; it has some of the best battery life of any laptop on the market (we got over 11 hours), a sleek and stunning 2-in-1 design, and an exceptional keyboard. Plus, it incorporates sustainable material, including ocean-bound plastics and recycled DVDs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IEHKpz"&gt;The Dragonfly is pricey, and there are cheaper business laptops that will suit the needs of most professionals just fine. But if you’re looking for the best of the best, it’s the unambiguous winner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="WpIKDR"&gt;The best laptop for students&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="5khaPj"&gt;Lenovo’s Chromebook Duet is a great convertible laptop for kids, or anyone who wants a reliable secondary driver for browsing and games. It’s a nice-looking, well-made 10-inch device that comes with a detachable keyboard and kickstand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="FV5DZN"&gt;The Duet is tailor-made to be used around the house and on the go, weighing just 2.03 pounds and delivering over 11 hours of battery life. Its MediaTek processor isn’t designed to shoulder heavy loads, but it’s just fine for browsing in a couple tabs, watching Netflix, or playing Android games — it even handles photo editing pretty well. The Duet also features a new “tablet mode” for Chrome OS, which supports an Android-inspired gesture navigation system and a unique Chrome layout optimized for tablet use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XiBrWO"&gt;The Chromebook Duet is an absolute steal for its low price, and is the Chromebook to buy if you’re on a tight budget. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Book 13 proves that Razer is cut out for more than just gaming rigs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="g8zMV8"&gt;14. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22287698/razer-book-13-review-design-specs-price-features"&gt;Razer Book 13&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="sky6IZ"&gt;A stylish, powerful productivity laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="1AVfKp"&gt;Razer is best known for its gaming laptops, but the company is making a big splash in the business and productivity space with its new Razer Book 13. At 0.6 inches thick and 3.09 pounds, the Book 13 is a portable workstation with a gorgeous and sturdy aluminum build. It features a good port selection including Thunderbolt 4, USB-A, HDMI 2.0 and a microSD slot, and it’s one of very few non-gaming laptops out there to come with a per-key RGB keyboard. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cAI01n"&gt;On the inside, this laptop is even more impressive. Its powerful chip did better than any other Windows laptop of its size on our Premiere Pro media export test. And while the Book 13 isn’t a gaming laptop, it delivers some of the best gaming performance I’ve ever seen from integrated graphics — it can even run &lt;em&gt;Shadow of the Tomb Raider&lt;/em&gt; over 30fps. While the Razer Book 13’s high price means it won’t be ideal for everyone, it’s still an outstanding laptop all around, combining a high-quality chassis with powerful productivity performance.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Razer Blade Pro 17 is a powerful gaming laptop with few compromises.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="zaTcIA"&gt;15. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21405760/razer-blade-pro-17-2020-review"&gt;Razer Blade Pro 17&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="DdByBe"&gt;The best 17-inch gaming laptop&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="S5SM7Z"&gt;Usually, if you want a 17-inch laptop that can pull playable frame rates out of today’s most demanding games, you’d expect some compromises on portability and design. Notebooks of this size often weigh north of seven pounds and require multiple power bricks to charge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Whz2V3"&gt;But while the Blade Pro 17 doesn’t have quite the gaming chops of some bulky desktop replacements, it makes up for that by sporting the compact and attractive design that’s a trademark of the Razer Blade line. At just over six pounds, it’s not too difficult to move around (as 17-inch workstations go). You get an RTX GPU (up to Nvidia’s 2080 Super Max-Q) an eight-core CPU (Intel’s Core i7-10875H) and either a 300Hz screen or a 120Hz touchscreen. There’s even an RGB keyboard with color effects tailored to the game you’re playing. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The cast for the first Knives Out sequel is shaping up to be pretty awesome</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SZBpc2"&gt;At the end of March, Netflix acquired the rights &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/31/22360964/netflix-knives-out-sequels-2-3-deal-rian-johnson-daniel-craig"&gt;to two &lt;em&gt;Knives Out&lt;/em&gt; sequels&lt;/a&gt; in a blockbuster deal reportedly worth more than $400 million, and the cast for the first sequel is quickly shaping up to be as epic as the one for the original movie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vVxw2M"&gt;We got the first inkling about the new cast on Monday, when &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/05/dave-bautista-daniel-craig-rian-johnsons-knives-out-2-netflix-1234752608/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reported&lt;/a&gt; that Dave Bautista was joining the cast of the film. (He talked about his role with &lt;em&gt;Polygon’s&lt;/em&gt; Tasha Robinson in &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/movies/22430923/dave-bautista-knives-out-2-cast-interview-army-of-the-dead"&gt;an interview published on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt;.) Then, on Tuesday, &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; had another scoop, reporting that &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/05/knives-out-2-edward-norton-daniel-craig-rian-johnson-1234752619/"&gt;Ed Norton has signed on as well&lt;/a&gt;. On Wednesday, &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt; said that musician and actress &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/janelle-monae-knives-out-sequel-1234950252/"&gt;Janelle Monáe is joining the cast&lt;/a&gt;. And on Thursday, &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt; reported that Kathryn Hahn, who you might know from her excellent role in &lt;em&gt;WandaVision&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/05/knives-out-2-kathryn-hahn-1234755151/"&gt;will be appearing in the next &lt;em&gt;Knives Out film&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1q2OMo"&gt;They’ll all appear alongside Daniel Craig, who will reprise his delightful role as Detective Benoit Blanc in both sequels. Director Rian Johnson will also be back to helm the two new movies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X11W7M"&gt;I saw the original &lt;em&gt;Knives Out&lt;/em&gt; for the first time last year, and I absolutely loved it. A large part of my enjoyment of the film was because of its fantastic ensemble cast, which included Ana de Armas, Chris Evans, Jamie Lee Curtis, LaKeith Stanfield, and Christopher Plummer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PfW55P"&gt;Plot details for the new movies haven’t been revealed just yet, but given the A-list talent that’s already coming together for the first sequel, I’m guessing Johnson has something good in the works. Production on the movie will begin in Greece this summer, &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/05/dave-bautista-daniel-craig-rian-johnsons-knives-out-2-netflix-1234752608/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Deadline&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1qa8P1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update May 13th, 2:27PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Added that Kathryn Hahn is reportedly joining the cast.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nokia’s nostalgia-invoking 2720 Flip is coming to the US on Verizon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qkXUUsZjtBn0NvNApvxQgmXBE0Y=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69282174/jporter_191001_3703_0007.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The 2720 Flip is a feature phone with a classic design and access to modern apps.&lt;/em&gt; | Photo by Jon Porter / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="RKpZG0"&gt;Have you been dreaming of consciously uncoupling from your smartphone? Ready to embrace a digital detox lifestyle but want to stay connected to your friends? Are you nostalgic for the days of tapping out messages in T9? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zdxuST"&gt;Dream no more — HMD’s Nokia-branded 2720 Flip is arriving in the US soon. It’s an updated take on the classic flip phone, offering 4G connectivity and compatibility with modern apps like WhatsApp, Google Maps, and Facebook. Two years after its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/9/5/20850793/nokia-2720-flip-phone-hmd-800-rugged-110-feature-phones-ifa-2019"&gt;launch in 2019&lt;/a&gt;, it’s coming to the US on Verizon on May 20th for $80.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="Pgrvw7"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Nokia 2720 Flip review: proof you can’t opt out of the smartphone generation","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/4/20896976/nokia-2720-flip-phone-review-specs-features-price"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="QUVsIM"&gt;While in concept the 2720 Flip sounds appealing if you’d like to spend less time staring at your smartphone, in practice we found it to be more frustration than it’s worth. Keeping up with WhatsApp conversations via T9 is difficult, and lack of compatibility with password managers and banking apps make it challenging to live with the Flip as your primary phone in 2021. Still, HMD and Verizon have reason to think that there are US customers for this phone, so nostalgia lives on for now. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Friends reunion will premiere on HBO Max May 27th</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="KoUMMt"&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; reunion special finally has a release date: Thursday, May 27th. The episode was was meant to launch with HBO Max in May 2020 but was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/18/21186045/friends-reunion-special-delayed-hbo-max-streaming-coronavirus-pandemic"&gt;delayed due to the pandemic&lt;/a&gt;. It will feature all six original cast members, as well as guest stars like Malala Yousafzai, Lady Gaga, and BTS, &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/friends-reunion-trailer-hbo-1234952671/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The Hollywood Reporter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UVG68z"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; was previously available on Netflix, but HBO bought the streaming rights for &lt;a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/friends-officially-leaving-netflix-warnermedias-streaming-service-1223151"&gt;an eye-watering $425 million&lt;/a&gt;. HBO Max seems to be trying to set itself up as the streaming service for ’90s nostalgia. It’s also hosted a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/15/21566042/trailers-fresh-prince-breach-black-beauty-happiest-season-pixar-netflix-hulu-hbo-disney"&gt;reunion for &lt;em&gt;The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and is the streaming home of both that show, &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt;, and movies like &lt;em&gt;The Matrix &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Pulp Fiction&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dLvCPs"&gt;HBO has even released a teaser for the &lt;em&gt;Friends&lt;/em&gt; reunion, which certainly teases by showing almost nothing (though it gets at least some cleverness points for its inclusion of “The one where they get back together”).&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Xbox is testing accessible chat options like transcription and speech synthesis</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/v-Zsx2XnnirSRXerDoLY-BZofG4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69281910/acastro_190530_1777_xbox_0003.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Desl66"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/05/12/introducing-party-chat-speech-transcription-and-synthesis/"&gt;Microsoft has announced&lt;/a&gt; new text-to-speech and speech-to-text features for Xbox Party Chat, which aim to help make communication on the platform more accessible. The features are currently being tested through the Xbox Insider program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dIW5x7"&gt;The speech-to-text feature puts a window on the screen with automatic transcriptions of what people in the voice chat are saying, along with an indicator of whether the message was typed or spoken aloud. This could help people who are hard of hearing to participate in the chat, even if the other participants are speaking instead of typing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/6fdinfxdUGWBBKR5dWYqTwWeXJk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22512069/image_1_1.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Microsoft&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The window in the top right shows transcribed text from voice chat.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="5JLNYa"&gt;The text-to-speech feature goes the other way, reading out a user’s typed messages for the rest of the party chat members to hear. The user is also able to choose from a list of voices to better customize what their messages sound like to others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oP02ed"&gt;Microsoft has recently been pushing accessibility with Xbox: it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/16/22286216/microsoft-xbox-games-tested-accessibility-guidelines"&gt;started a program earlier this year&lt;/a&gt; to help developers make their games more accessible, and it has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/31/21117342/xbox-adaptive-controller-freedom-wing-adaptor-wheelchair-joystick"&gt;made the Xbox Adaptive Controller&lt;/a&gt; to help gamers with a wide range of motor abilities. It’s good to see them continuing that work, especially around voice chat. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="d3TT7G"&gt;If you’re an Xbox Insider, you can enable the features by going to Settings &amp;gt; Ease of Access &amp;gt; Game and chat transcription, or by going to Options &amp;gt; Ease of Access settings while in a chat.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Preorders for the modular Framework Laptop are now open, starting at $999</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="A Framework Laptop angled slightly to the right, seen from above. The screen displays mountains and a valley. On either side are a number of modules." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fNtB0J1yE83m0E-XNMAyEI6T-Zo=/0x0:6000x4000/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69281854/studio_image_01.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Framework&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jY13pv"&gt;The modular Framework Laptop is now available for preorders, with prices starting at $999 for a fully assembled computer or $749 for the DIY Edition, which adds the option of paying less upfront if you’re willing bring your own RAM, SSD, charge, and Wi-Fi card. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OaJv9E"&gt;For prebuilt systems, Framework is offering three starting configurations. There’s the entry level, $999 Base, which offers a Core i5-1135G7 processor, 8GB of RAM, a 256GB NVMe SSD, and Wi-Fi 6. The Performance model, starting at $1,399, ups the processor to a Core i7-1165G7 and doubles the RAM and SSD storage. And the Professional configuration, starting at $1,999, has a Core i7-1185G7, 32GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and Windows 10 Pro. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1Sh97"&gt;Whether fully prebuilt or DIY, the Framework features a 13.5-inch 2256 x 1504 screen, a 1080p 60fps webcam, a 55Wh battery, and a 2.87-pound aluminum chassis. Ports are handled through a customizable expansion card system, which allows users to select up to four from a selection of USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, DisplayPort, and microSD slots. There’s also the option to add extra storage through removable USB-C SSDs, too, and Framework promises more port options in the future. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Ot9ovvJ26VTz3z89BbaizbFfLao=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22512128/766f6b5c_5af2_4e2c_a60b_72849c79afe3_Blog21011___Pre_Orders_Open___img02.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="RVi01U"&gt;To preorder, Framework is only asking that users put down a $100 deposit, with the first laptops set to ship at the end of July. Preorders are only available in the US for now; Canada is promised in “the next few weeks,” and European and Asian availability is set for later this year. Additionally, Framework warns that due to the ongoing global supply shortages, it’ll have limited supply at launch but plans to do its preorders in batches that should ship throughout the year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RP64DU"&gt;Framework is obviously a new company with an untested platform here. It is offering a 30-day return guarantee and a one-year limited warranty, though, which might help anyone deciding whether to plunk down the cash for a new computer.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Colonial Pipeline reportedly paid the hackers nearly $5 million, despite suggestions to contrary</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="US-IT-OIL-CRIME-HACKING-PIPELINE-EPA" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/8Os-FKeD7_0TWUtTJfUq9k0PQWk=/12x0:6048x4024/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69281586/1232843570.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="QWrpNV"&gt;After &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22429433/colonial-pipeline-cyber-security-ransomware-attack"&gt;a devastating and deeply embarrassing cyberattack&lt;/a&gt; on one of the United States’ largest oil pipelines, one that forced many gas stations to shut down and reportedly caused average national gas prices to &lt;a href="https://wlos.com/news/local/78-of-gas-stations-without-fuel-in-region-gas-prices-rise-above-3-nationally"&gt;rise above $3 for the first time since 2014&lt;/a&gt;, the oil is flowing again. But &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-13/colonial-pipeline-paid-hackers-nearly-5-million-in-ransom?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bloomberg &lt;/em&gt;is reporting&lt;/a&gt; that Colonial Pipeline had to pay a nearly $5 million ransom to get there, and it paid that ransom within mere hours. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5qIOkB"&gt;That’s striking, because it’s the opposite of what &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/colonial-pipeline-has-no-plan-pay-ransom-hackers-sources-2021-05-12/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/05/12/politics/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-payment/index.html"&gt;CNN&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;and others reported in the wake of the attack. “Sources familiar with the company’s response,” a phrase often used when the company itself is responding but doesn’t want to be named, suggested the pipeline had no plans to pay hackers. CNN’s sources insisted Colonial Pipeline had not yet paid the ransom, and would probably not &lt;em&gt;need &lt;/em&gt;to pay, suggesting it had already “managed to retrieve the most important data that was stolen” with help from the US government. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="44pPXX"&gt;The news is also a little worrying because of how a successful ransom might encourage hackers in future. Over the years, we’ve heard reports of smaller companies and local government entities paying ransoms to regain access to their computers, but this is perhaps one of the most high-profile examples of ransomware yet, and the news might inspire copycats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IfyjIM"&gt;On the plus side, a digital forensics expert who spoke to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; suggested that $5 million isn’t a particularly large sum of money for something like this: “Ransom is usually around $25 million to $35 million for such a company. I think the threat actor realized they stepped on the wrong company and triggered a massive government response,” LIFARS CEO Ondrej Krehel told the publication. On Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/10/22428996/colonial-pipeline-ransomware-attack-apology-investigation"&gt;the Colonial Pipeline hackers apologized for the “social consequences”&lt;/a&gt; and promised to ransom less controversial targets in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TandVF"&gt;It’s not clear which parts of the Colonial Pipeline were at risk: a spokesperson suggested there was no evidence the company’s operational systems were compromised; CNN&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;had three sources yesterday say that the pipeline shut down because its billing system was affected, and the company wasn’t sure it’d be able to charge properly for fuel. &lt;a href="https://zetter.substack.com/p/ransomware-infection-on-colonial"&gt;Reporting by cybersecurity journalist Kim Zetter&lt;/a&gt; suggests the decision was likely more complicated than that, as other entities in the oil distribution system were also worried the ransomware could spread to their computers as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4HOLaz"&gt;Yesterday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22433266/biden-executive-order-cybersecurity-government-infrastructure-colonial-pipeline-solarwinds-hafnium"&gt;President Biden signed an executive order aimed at improving national cybersecurity&lt;/a&gt;, with the White House specifically naming the Colonial Pipeline, the SolarWinds hack, and the Microsoft Exchange server vulnerabilities as the kinds of infrastructure failures the government hopes to address.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nW8iLmOH2HqYJ6T5xWQTPBEdWrQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22512044/colonial_pipeline_restart.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="eb28XF"&gt;The Colonial Pipeline &lt;a href="https://www.colpipe.com/news/press-releases/media-statement-colonial-pipeline-system-disruption"&gt;began resuming operations on Wednesday evening&lt;/a&gt;, with President Biden saying it should be “reaching full operational capacity as we speak” in a briefing early Thursday afternoon. Oil supplies should be “seeing a region-by-region return to normalcy beginning this weekend,” he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mw2ZMw"&gt;Still, he warns, “this is not like flicking on a light switch — this pipeline is 500,000 miles long, it had never been shut down in its history... it’s going to take some time, and there may be some hiccups along the way here.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GIbIDo"&gt;Biden says the US isn’t blaming Russia directly: “We do not believe the Russian government was involved in this attack, but we do have strong reason to believe that the criminals who did the attack are living in Russia,” he says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HOEDHL"&gt;He also announced a specific measure against ransomware: “Our Justice Department has launched a new task force dedicated to prosecuting ransomware hackers to the full extent of the law.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8PS2O8"&gt;President Biden declined to comment on whether Colonial Pipeline paid the ransom. &lt;/p&gt;
