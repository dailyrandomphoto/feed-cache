    <title>Only one person showed up to the pro-Trump protest outside Twitter’s San Francisco HQ</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/GZm6SDx-Q8bGaID_348OK8S6298=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68652818/vpavic_210111_4366_0039.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rare pro-Trump protester Rebecca Brooks came to show her discontent toward Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey who is “silencing conservative voices.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;30 police officers were there to monitor the scene&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="JrPhIK"&gt;It’s the second week of 2021. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/9/22221669/what-just-happened-this-week-trump-social-media-capitol-twitter-facebook-parler"&gt;Last week&lt;/a&gt; began with an insurrection, siege of the US Capitol building, and rejection of democracy, and it ended with all major social media companies banning the one-time impeached 45th president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yymacB"&gt;One of those companies was Twitter. On the Donald.win forum, Trump supporters announced a plan to show their discontent by protesting in front of the San Francisco headquarters earlier today. The building was empty, with Twitter employees working from home to prevent the spread of COVID-19, but there was still a heavy police presence to protect against mob violence. What happened instead was a fairly quiet event, with just a single pro-Trump protester in evidence — and two counter-protesters there to applaud Twitter’s decision to deplatform the outgoing president.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sony promises streaming quality nearly as good as 4K Blu-ray on Bravia Core movie service</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xFgWHD7ft8cVShIB782neCN1o5Y=/174x0:1269x730/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68652657/Screen_Shot_2021_01_11_at_5.34.08_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YZTEu6"&gt;Sony’s new line of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218693/sony-tv-lineup-8k-4k-z9j-a90j-a80j-x95j-x90j-ces-2021"&gt;Bravia XR television sets&lt;/a&gt; will allow customers to watch and stream movies at some of the highest quality available in the consumer market through its new Bravia Core platform, according to the company. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CFDnzU"&gt;Bravia XR owners will be able to choose from a number of Sony Pictures titles and watch them using Sony’s “Pure Stream” technology, which achieves “near lossless” ultra high-definition, Blu-ray disc quality, according to Sony. Pure Stream also allows for streaming of up to 80 megabits per second. To compare, most streaming services recommend maintaining an internet speed &lt;a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/columnist/2017/12/10/youre-buying-4-k-tv-how-much-internet-bandwidth-do-you-need/933989001/"&gt;between 15 and 25 megabits per second&lt;/a&gt; to achieve proper 4K Ultra HD streaming quality. If Sony’s numbers are accurate, that’s better than a lot of the competition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6B5a91"&gt;The platform comes preloaded on all new Bravia XR models (MASTER Series Z9J 8K LED, MASTER Series A90J and A80J OLED, and X95J and X90J 4K LED) and effectively uses a voucher system. Depending on the model that someone purchases, they’re given a number of credits. Those credits can be cashed in for a number of new titles. It’s unclear if people can keep those titles after they’re purchased with the credits, but &lt;em&gt;The Verge &lt;/em&gt;has reached out to Sony for more information. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXVZNI"&gt;On the streaming front, Sony’s website states that customers can stream a number of titles “anytime and as many times as you like, in up to 4K HDR quality,” but there are limits to this, too. Time periods for streaming availability are depending on the Bravia XR model purchased, according to the site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BpIp5E"&gt;Bravia Core isn’t going to replace Netflix, but it seems like it was specifically designed to show customers the ultimate capabilities of their new TV set. Kind of like when you buy a TV with true 4K HDR capabilities, and you play the best 4K YouTube channels to try to see the difference between your new set and that old clunker you just tossed. Bravia XR TVs also have “the largest IMAX Enhanced movie collection,” according to Sony. It’s unclear exactly how many movies that works out to, though. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RaqRQE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>PopSockets are going MagSafe</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/oqLxpCKYCBBhu2JRX1hanIDgQxw=/0x20:552x388/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68652647/1.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: PopSockets&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="iUXKXO"&gt;PopSockets is announcing that it’s &lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/popsockets-unveils-innovation-at-ces-2021-including-magsafe-solutions-301205556.html"&gt;making its iconic phone holders compatible with MagSafe&lt;/a&gt;. When Apple announced that accessories would be able to attach to the iPhone 12 with MagSafe, many people immediately thought of PopSockets — including &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/10/13/popsockets-is-working-on-magsafe-compatible-iphone-accessories/"&gt;the company itself&lt;/a&gt;, which announced it was working on adding compatibility. Now, it’s finally at the point where it’s putting out an announcement and a release window.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="keD1sS"&gt;PopSockets is planning on bringing MagSafe to quite a few of its products, but first, of course, is the famous &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsockets.com%2Fshop%2Fpopgrip&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F11%2F22225701%2Fpopsockets-magsafe-accessory#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;PopGrip&lt;/a&gt;. Now, if you want to charge your phone wirelessly, you won’t have to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/7/21048205/popsockets-poppower-home-wireless-charger-popgrip-ces-2020"&gt;buy PopSockets’ specialized wireless charger&lt;/a&gt;. The MagSafe version will have a larger base than many PopSockets users may be used to, which is probably to provide space for the “no-slip” rubber bottom. Hopefully, that will keep the PopSocket from sliding off when going in and out of your pocket, like Apple’s own MagSafe wallet is somewhat infamous for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wm7Iga"&gt;Speaking of wallets, PopSockets is also announcing a magnetic version of its PopWallet Plus, which is essentially a wallet with a PopSocket built in. Like Apple’s version, it will include a shield meant to protect any cards that are liable to get erased by magnets. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CRW3XF"&gt;In addition, PopSockets is unveiling two mounts that will use MagSafe: one for home (dubbed “Multi-Surface) and one for the car. The company notes that the new PopGrips will work with existing PopSocket mounts, but the new mounts will work magnetically, though it’s not clear if they’ll also use the PopSocket as an extra mechanical grip.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PiGw4z"&gt;The press announcement had some other notable products, including an antimicrobial version of the PopGrip (it’s a sign of the times), and a multitool PopGrip that’s a collaboration with famed knifesmith SOG. The PopGrip and PopWallet Plus for MagSafe are slated to launch in spring of 2021, and the PopMounts should be coming in the summer. No word has been released on pricing.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mode aims high for the perfect puff of weed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/q3hG-tA3EM0WUJz6dBrScf9HbXo=/0x55:1292x916/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68652641/Mode_smart_cannabis_dosing.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Mode says its smart cannabis device lets you control your dosage | Mode&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="u4yswc"&gt;For people who use cannabis for medicinal purposes, such as pain management, anxiety, and sleep, vaping the drug can be a bit of a trial-and-error process since you can’t be totally sure of the exact dose you’re getting like you can with a standard edible or pill. The makers of the Mode smart cannabis device say it solves the dosing problem, using a high-res pressure sensor to determine how much a user is inhaling and a prediction algorithm that determines how many micromilligrams a user is getting per puff based on the cartridge. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qG4j8t"&gt;The company says it’s run hundreds of cannabis cartridges through its testing machines to identify each one’s unique characteristics, and the device has an accuracy rate of over 75 percent even without letting the app know which cartridge you’re using. (It’s in the high 80 percent range for known cartridges, the company claims.) Mode is compatible with thousands of standard 510 threaded cannabis cartridges, and it can be locked manually or remotely with the companion app. The company says the algorithm is still improving, and you'll be able to download a new version to the device over Bluetooth. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tQIa9b"&gt;People treat many different medical conditions with cannabis, some using different varieties to treat more than one condition. For example, a user may need a different dose — and likely a different blend — of cannabis to treat anxiety during the day than they would use as a sleep aid at night. That’s why being able to fine-tune the number of milligrams would come in handy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="okYNO6"&gt;“This is not just another vape device you’re hitting and blowing out clouds all day,” Mode co-founder Izzy Kirsch said in a demonstration over Zoom during the Consumer Electronics Show. “You can get a milligram pill, so to speak, and go on with your day.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1BiIdd"&gt;So let’s say you’re using cannabis for sleep and you know what dosage you want. Put your cartridge into the Mode device, set it to a dosage between 1 and 5 milligrams, and inhale. The device turns off its heater and vibrates, giving haptic feedback, when you’ve reached your desired dosage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="dAPKA1"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/493919648?byline=0&amp;amp;badge=0&amp;amp;portrait=0&amp;amp;title=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="laT267"&gt;Mode co-founder Mark Wagner said during the CES demo that the company is software-oriented, so rather than building a special sensor to measure dosage, it’s working on fine-tuning the algorithm, which was developed in part by a former data science lead at Jawbone. In addition to a pressure sensor, Mode has temperature, motion, and orientation sensors that help create the ideal dose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LyLpjF"&gt;The device also has a mobile app that lets users track their dosage over time, which is helpful information if you’re testing out a new strain or if you decide your dosage is too strong or too weak. The device bases its measurements on the cartridge manufacturer’s information. For people buying cartridges at a dispensary where the product is a known quantity, the Mode device relying on manufacturer info seems reasonable. However, it’s worth noting that black market and counterfeit cartridges may not provide the same level of accurate info (&lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/potential-culprits-in-mystery-lung-illnesses-black-market-vaping-products/2019/09/24/cb5b708e-d98d-11e9-ac63-3016711543fe_story.html"&gt;and can potentially lead to serious illness&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tPOUZT"&gt;In the relatively new medical cannabis marketplace, patients can end up going through a lot of trial and error finding a strain and a cartridge that gives them the amount they need — even the batteries used with standard cannabis cartridges can vary wildly in how they deliver your dosage. So a device that gives more user control over how much you’re consuming is a welcome addition. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wcqxtu"&gt;Mode says its device is made with medical-grade materials, including a tear-resistant silicone air passageway that goes all the way from the bottom of the device through to the cartridge, separate from all its electronics except for the pressure sensor. It uses high-grade stainless steel on the heat shield in the tube, and the outer case is raw ABS plastic; the company says it’s staying away from paint, which can lead to emissions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L72fYu"&gt;Mode uses USB-C charging, with a 385mAh custom battery. It can provide between a week and two weeks of battery life for a user taking 5 to 20mg per day, “not someone who’s continually crushing through cartridges,” Kirsch notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="fcQeYV"&gt;&lt;a href="https://mode.co/"&gt;Mode is available for preorder&lt;/a&gt; and will retail for $100 when it’s available later this year. The company's targeting early summer. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="M9Pu8i"&gt;Sony is getting into the drone business, with the company showing off a brief first look at its new &lt;a href="https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/airpeak/"&gt;Airpeak&lt;/a&gt; drone at CES 2021. The new drone is said to be the smallest drone capable of carrying an Alpha camera and is designed for video content creation and professional photography. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aPqK74"&gt;There are very few concrete details about the new drone system right now, although Sony mentioned that it’s been exploring using the drones to film landscape and city shots. It showcased the Airpeak working as a chase camera for footage of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/8/21056404/sony-vision-s-electric-concept-prototype-first-look-ces-2020"&gt;Vision-S concept car&lt;/a&gt; from last CES. The model shown off at CES 2021 is a quadcopter design and features two landing gear extensions that retract upward during flight (so as not to spoil your footage).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="9reHJI"&gt;While Sony hasn’t dabbled in drones before, its cameras are among the best in the industry — so much so that market leader DJI already offers camera mounts for Sony Alpha products. And the idea of Sony bringing that expertise to bear with bespoke drone-focused products is certainly an intriguing one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vR1Lah"&gt;Sony had originally announced the &lt;a href="https://www.sony.net/SonyInfo/News/Press/202011/20-091E/"&gt;Airpeak brand in late 2020&lt;/a&gt;, with a planned “spring 2021” release window. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iBuyPower’s compact Revolt 3 MK3 PC case packs in a handle and lots of ventilation</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Revolt 3 MK3 will come in black or white." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_iMc8eRpgXNqj97bn8-TbiOI7Dk=/0x0:3240x2160/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68652415/revolt3mk3hero.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;iBuyPower&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="H4HNL3"&gt;iBuyPower announced a new 18.34-liter small form factor PC case at CES 2021 called the Revolt 3 MK3. I’m not sure what I find so enthralling about it, but it’s the kind of case I’d find myself staring at for an embarrassing amount of time if I were in the market to upgrade my build. (Maybe I am, &lt;em&gt;after all.&lt;/em&gt;) If you’re a fan of minimalist cases like me, with next to no added LEDs, you might find yourself under the spell of this case, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GawHR1"&gt;Okay, I also really like its top-mounted handle. It’s not like I move my PC around a lot, though it would make it far easier and safer to carry this around when I need to give it a deep cleaning or swap some of the tech inside. Beyond the handle’s utility, it reminds me of the Nintendo GameCube — if the handle were attached to a chassis that’s far more refined than that &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/olafurw/status/1166267668414046208"&gt;console’s actual devkit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The Revolt 3 MK3 will come in black or white." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bVW_7d1JcMnDyH3h82kDfOX43yY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228743/revolt3mk3hero.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: iBuyPower&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MIqeb8"&gt;This case design isn’t entirely original. The &lt;a href="https://lian-li.com/product/pc-tu150/"&gt;Lian Li TU150&lt;/a&gt; is a beloved small form factor (mini ITX) option for people who want a small PC with a handle on top, and it’s not like there aren’t other solid choices that arrive sans handle (Velocity Micro, Silverstone, and Sliger, to name a few). The Revolt 3 MK3’s huge amount of ventilation gives it a unique look. Beyond how it looks, each side of the machine can be removed for cleaning, and to make cable management easier to manage. The Revolt 3 MK3’s retractable headphone hook is a thoughtful feature, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="616Pfl"&gt;You’ll be able to purchase this case sometime in the second quarter of the year filled with some pre-selected components from iBuyPower, including a 700W 80 Plus Gold SFX-L power supply that’s &lt;em&gt;just &lt;/em&gt;below the suggested 750W for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21435926/nvidia-geforce-rtx-3080-review"&gt;Nvidia RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21571414/amd-radeon-rx-6800-xt-review"&gt;AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT&lt;/a&gt; and cards below in both AMD and Nvidia’s field should be covered with this power supply for the pre-built crowd. At launch, the company hasn’t actually shared what other specs you’ll be able to have crammed in. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="iBuyPower Revolt 3 MK3" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/P8sbysQ3DC8CSqkfAFlnZs72o5M=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228749/revoltmk3exploded.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: iBuyPower&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An exploded view of the Revolt 3 MK3 shows that it’s likely very good at catching dust.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="yU9eJE"&gt;Alternatively, you’ll have the option to purchase just the case alone in black or white (it supports swappable parts so you can mix white and black how you please), and you can fit an ITX motherboard inside with all of the components you desire. It can actually fit GPUs as big as Nvidia’s RTX 3090, so you can make yourself a powerful machine in this case if you have the right power supply. The company hasn’t shared a price for the case by itself. &lt;a href="https://www.ibuypower.com/gaming-pcs/signatures/revolt-series"&gt;You can find even more specs for the case on iBuyPower’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vuzix’s new microLED smart glasses look like tech you’d actually want to wear on your face</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/g0S-Oi3F3Kd66zBBoPvBM2ey5mc=/151x0:1747x1064/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68652338/Screen_Shot_2021_01_11_at_4.24.00_PM.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Vuzix&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="mj8mck"&gt;Wearable tech and augmented reality provider Vuzix is back at CES 2021 with another pair of its smart glasses, this time with a new advancement. The latest pair is powered by microLED technology, thanks to a &lt;a href="https://ir.vuzix.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1853/vuzix-confirms-that-it-has-entered-into-a-joint"&gt;partnership with the Chinese firm Jade Bird Display&lt;/a&gt;. MicroLED displays have emerged in recent years as viable alternatives to OLED screens, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22166062/samsung-110-inch-microled-4k-tv-announced-features"&gt;driving advancements mostly in the television space&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="C9Rj02"&gt;Yet, the tech in this context allows for ultra small but powerful display projectors to be fitted into both sides of the smart glasses, which, to Vuzix’s credit, look pretty close to something you’d be comfortable wearing out in public on a daily basis. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cWfkrX"&gt;Combined with Vuzix’s waveguide tech and its display engine optics for mapping the image onto the inside of the glass, the result is an impressive-looking gadget that can project a stereoscopic monochrome or color image onto both lenses at a variety of pixel densities and resolutions, depending on the software requirements. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/EvkMiKMeC_db5ukM9dcrR5tTlNM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228701/Screen_Shot_2021_01_11_at_4.32.18_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Vuzix&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Similar to Google Glass, Vuzix’s smart glasses are more heads-up displays than true augmented reality devices and are designed to mirror information from a paired smartphone. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="vSf9DD"&gt;There are a few other bells and whistles with this device. Vuzix says the device will support Wi-Fi and optional LTE as well as stereo speakers and noise-canceling microphones. There will also be Android and iOS-supported gesture-based touch controls, presumably for controlling companion mobile apps using just the sides of the smart glasses. Unlike Vuzix’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/3/18166018/vuzix-blade-ar-consumer-version-available-pricing-release-date-features-ces-2019"&gt;previous $1,000 Blade model&lt;/a&gt;, this new version doesn’t have an official product name or a price yet, though the company is aiming for a summer release date, &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/11/vuzixs-new-microled-powered-smart-glasses-will-arrive-this-summer/"&gt;reports &lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VwUgTK"&gt;Of course, given the nature of the virtual CES this year, we haven’t been able to try these smart glasses as we normally would on the show floor, so we can’t say much about the quality of the image, the comfort or design of the frames, or any of the software support. But Vuzix isn’t really targeting the consumer market with a Google Glass-style device, which would necessarily warrant getting an early, hands-on impression of how well they work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="dlGSmJ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Vuzix’s glasses look impressive, but we’re unable to try them out for ourselves right now&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="6VnqY4"&gt;Vuzix’s smart glasses, which are more in the realm of heads-up displays than true AR, are aimed more toward the enterprise, especially after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/5/7493439/intel-buys-stake-in-google-glass-rival-vuzix"&gt;Intel acquired a 30 percent stake in the Rochester, New York-based company&lt;/a&gt; back in 2015. The shift toward workplace-focused AR and VR products has been accelerated by slow adoption of consumer-geared headsets and glasses as well as an overall lack of breakthrough advancements in the fundamental tech that would facilitate an iPhone-style moment for the field. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nk7Bw4"&gt;That’s why we’ve seen and heard so little about Microsoft’s HoloLens, the second-generation Google Glass, and Magic Leap’s AR goggles in the years since those gadgets made their splashy debuts, all while Facebook quietly continues pumping money into Oculus and remaining one of the very few large tech companies still actively engaged in VR. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZZk5if"&gt;The tepid consumer reception to AR and VR products hasn’t stopped some bigger names from trying their hand at consumer smart glasses. Amazon has since &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22197463/amazon-echo-frames-review-alexa"&gt;entered the smart glasses market with its Echo Frames&lt;/a&gt;, and Facebook is also &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/16/21439929/facebook-ar-smart-glasses-ray-ban-announcement"&gt;working on its first pair&lt;/a&gt; in partnership with Ray-Ban. Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/19/21296674/apple-vr-ar-headset-glasses-external-hub-jony-ive-bloomberg-go-read-this"&gt;rumors continue to percolate&lt;/a&gt; around Apple’s plans to release an AR headset or a pair of smart glasses (or both) sometime in the near future. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook says it’s banning the phrase ‘stop the steal’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/U_O8xj8ZbTyJJRejlOMY4xcUQoU=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68652255/acastro_170329_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tUgMbx"&gt;Facebook is cracking down on potentially violent sedition ahead of the January 20th inauguration of President-elect Joe Biden, including a widespread temporary ban on phrases associated with the mob that attacked the Capitol building on January 6th. The policy, detailed in &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/01/preparing-for-inauguration-day/"&gt;a post published Monday&lt;/a&gt; by Facebook vice presidents Guy Rosen and Monika Bickert, includes any content containing the words “stop the steal,” an unusually aggressive policy that appears to still be rolling out across the network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LsYw5k"&gt;“We are treating the next two weeks as a major civic event,” the post reads. “We are now removing content containing the phrase ‘stop the steal’ under our Coordinating Harm policy from Facebook and Instagram... With continued attempts to organize events against the outcome of the US presidential election that can lead to violence, and use of the term by those involved in Wednesday’s violence in DC, we’re taking this additional step in the lead up to the inauguration.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="hrNEr3"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“We took down... anything that was taking about possible violence last week”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fCiFUW"&gt;“It may take some time to scale up our enforcement of this new step,” the post continues, “but we have already removed a significant number of posts.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="O5WzPo"&gt;Confirming that enforcement is still spotty. &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; was able to post text containing the phrase “stop the steal” without any content being immediately removed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BFmksN"&gt;Facebook will also keep in place a number of policies it had established in advance of the election, including automatically disabling comments on any posts in groups pages “that start to have a high rate of hate speech.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OKvZch"&gt;There are already signs that the days leading up to the inauguration may bring violence from supporters of President Trump. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/JoshMargolin/status/1348672731286532096"&gt;The FBI has warned&lt;/a&gt; that “armed protests” are planned at all 50 state capitals as well as Washington, DC. As many as 15,000 National Guard troops will be deployed in Washington during the inauguration in case of any civil unrest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MBCBTH"&gt;In the immediate aftermath of the Capitol raid, Facebook blocked a string of posts from Trump before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;suspending his account indefinitely&lt;/a&gt;. The platform has also taken a harsher approach toward Stop the Steal accounts in the wake of those actions, treating them as likely to incite violence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hrGfUv"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/11/sandberg-says-us-capitol-riot-was-not-organized-on-facebook.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&amp;amp;par=sharebar"&gt;an interview with &lt;em&gt;Reuters&lt;/em&gt; this week&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg argued that Facebook’s aggressive moderation had largely forced violent groups off of the platform. “We again took down QAnon, Proud Boys, Stop the Steal, anything that was taking about possible violence last week,” Sandberg said. “I think these events were largely organized on platforms that don’t have our abilities to stop hate, don’t have our standards and don’t have our transparency.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Targus announces an antimicrobial keyboard light and backpack</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sEbt0Y08-IstlMd97Qt0ZBiJdYk=/21x182:616x579/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68652214/20_340___Press_Release_UV_C_Light_1024x1024.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Targus&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="GOj2h2"&gt;Targus is an accessory manufacturer that’s been around for a long time, and its &lt;a href="https://content.targus.com/ces21/"&gt;slate of CES products&lt;/a&gt; this year center on three main themes: portability, sustainability, and, of course, staying healthy during a pandemic (&lt;a href="https://www.engadget.com/targus-uv-light-antimicrobial-backpack-150036748.html"&gt;via &lt;em&gt;Engadget&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/RCt1tqFmUL4zDqcth4vEOsydmL0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228534/20_340___Press_Release_UV_C_Light_1024x1024.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Targus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The UV-C LED Disinfection light uses UV light to kill microbes on anything in its cleaning area.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="AfR7vV"&gt;The company’s banner products for pandemic health are the 2Office antimicrobial backpack and the &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.targus.com%2Fblogs%2Fpress-room%2Fstrong-targus-named-ces-2021-innovation-awards-honoree-for-its-uv-c-led-disinfection-light&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F11%2F22225509%2Ftargus-anti-microbial-keyboard-light-and-backpack-ces-pandemic#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;UV-C LED Disinfection Light&lt;/a&gt;. The light is designed to sit above your keyboard and mouse and bathe them in UV-C light to help eliminate microorganisms that may be kicking around on your high-touch accessories. It automatically turns on for five minutes every hour, but you shouldn’t have to worry about it interrupting your work: it uses motion sensors to detect if you’re using your computer, and will wait to begin its cleaning cycle until you’re away. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wZSeKF"&gt;If you’re not interested in a UV light to clean off your keyboard and mouse (though, really, it could be used for anything), Targus also announced that it’s working on antimicrobial mice and keyboards.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kaZrGBbH56DwluJjaD6NHjUJARw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22228597/c8bb423b_tbb615gl_70_detail2_10pa0p80pa0i600002e028.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Targus&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The backpack and tablet cases promise to kill microbes on “key touchpoints.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MSBt62"&gt;The 2Office backpack, which can hold laptops that are up to 17.3 inches, has an antimicrobial coating on “key touchpoints.” The bag could be useful if you have to go out in a pandemic, but I can think of other uses for an antimicrobial bag when travel starts back up again. (Who else has felt weird hanging their backpack on a bathroom door?) If you’re not looking for an entirely new backpack, the company also announced antimicrobial tablet cases, along with antimicrobial privacy screens for select computer monitors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pQbnXC"&gt;The company has also announced a dock and rugged case for the Samsung Galaxy Tab Active 3. The dock uses &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/29/20837263/samsung-dex-note-10-plus-palm-foleo-motorola-atrix-celio-redfly"&gt;Samsung’s DeX software&lt;/a&gt; that lets you connect the tablet to a monitor for a more desktop-like experience. For iPad owners, Targus has also announced an EcoSmart case, which is made out of recycled materials.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3hYbyl"&gt;Finally, Targus has announced new &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fus.targus.com%2Fcollections%2Fprivacy-screens&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F11%2F22225509%2Ftargus-anti-microbial-keyboard-light-and-backpack-ces-pandemic#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;antimicrobial privacy screens&lt;/a&gt;, which cost anywhere between $35 and $185, depending on the devices they are meant for. The screens are available now, with the rest of the announced devices coming this spring. Currently, no prices or exact dates have been provided for those. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s ThinkPad X12 Detachable has a 12-inch screen that’s, well, detachable</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Detatchable in laptop mode, angled to the left side." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IoPozd3QEHV1mTLhJzC2dcS-QA4=/0x84:2000x1417/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68652122/03_Thinkpad_X12_Hero_Front_Facing_Right.0.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Pt5ZdU"&gt;Lenovo is introducing a new ThinkPad — with a twist. The ThinkPad X12 Detachable is a 12.3-inch business laptop with a screen that you can pop off and use as a tablet. It’s one of several new ThinkPads Lenovo has launched this week, which are powered by Intel’s newest 11th Gen vPro processors.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AuAOX1"&gt;Take a look at this thing, and you’ll see that it’s a similar idea to Microsoft’s Surface Pro line. The display is essentially a 12.3-inch Windows tablet that you can attach to and detach from a folio keyboard. It has a kickstand on the back, which is how it stands up on its own, and it’s compatible with Lenovo’s Precision Pen and Digital Pen. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2wXBRG"&gt;The form factor is meant to offer extra versatility to business users. If you’re in a meeting or class, for example, and need to read presentation notes off your computer, you can pop the screen off without having to lug the keyboard up with you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Clwiqx"&gt;Even with the keyboard attached, though, portability is still a selling point. The tablet is less than 9 mm thick and weighs just over 2.5 pounds with the keyboard attached. It also supports LTE Cat9 for on-the-go work, and Lenovo says it’s undergone MIL-SPEC 810G testing to certify that it’s durable enough to withstand drops and jostles during travel.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad X12 Detatchable in tablet mode, being written on with a stylus." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_fq5wgnlqZEBw-sJNUkkyFH68JA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223439/05_Thinkpad_X12_Screen_Hero_Front_Facing_Right.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MBfbsd"&gt;But despite its tablet-esque form factor, the ThinkPad X12 is still very much a laptop because it has laptop chips inside. It’s powered by Intel’s 11th Gen Core vPro processors (up to a Core i7 ) and Iris Xe integrated graphics. Intel’s vPro platform brings a number of security features for business users. In terms of other specs, you can get up to 16GB of LPDDR4x memory and 1TB of NVMe SSD storage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eLtOD3"&gt;In terms of ports, don’t get too excited: there’s a whopping one Thunderbolt 4, one USB 3.2 Type-C, one NanoSIM, and one audio jack. Remember that one of those ports will sometimes hold the charger, so if you’re buying the X12 and will need to plug other things in, you’ll probably want a dock of some sort (such as Kensington’s new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22219031/kensingtons-sd5700t-thunderbolt-4-dock-90w-charging"&gt;SD5700T Thunderbolt 4 station&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="The ThinkPad X12 Detatchable in laptop mode, seen from the back with the kickstand unfolded." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5uodAMeGuIeFsL-9PusxILxoDHw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22223441/04_Thinkpad_X12_Hero_Rear_Facing_Right.png"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="OpIudm"&gt;A feature I’m quite excited about is the aspect ratio. The X12 has a 3:2 display, the same dimensions as the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/21/20923662/microsoft-surface-pro-7-review-tablet-specs-features-price-usb-c-windows-10"&gt;Surface Pro 7&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21271796/microsoft-surface-book-3-review-price-specs-features-13-5-screen"&gt;Surface Book 3&lt;/a&gt;. It’s been nice to see manufacturers across the board abandon the cramped 16:9 aspect ratio, and 3:2 is my favorite kind of screen to use. It gives you a bunch of extra space for multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6qty4Q"&gt;I recently reviewed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22175087/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-fold-review"&gt;Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Fold&lt;/a&gt;, another device built like a tablet that comes with a keyboard. It’s a very cool device, but at $2,499, it’s too expensive for me to recommend any human actually buy. The X12 Detachable is what I’d call a more pragmatic implementation of the X1 Fold. It’s not as fancy (for one, the screen doesn’t fold in half) but it’s significantly less expensive with a starting price of $1,149, and it looks like it comes with a full-sized keyboard rather than the tiny cramped one that came with the Fold. For many users looking for a convertible ThinkPad, the X12 Detachable may be a more sensible choice (though I’ll have to see how it performs before making an official recommendation).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="L9LrNt"&gt;The ThinkPad X12 Detachable is expected to be available in January 2021, starting at $1,149.&lt;/p&gt;
