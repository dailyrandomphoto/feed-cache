    <title>Peugeot reveals a wicked wingless hypercar </title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3atKBbarmQH5vhvcwzMcDNdUWms=/26x0:2375x1566/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69547732/3115466_c76lrw4ipm.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Peugeot’s new hypercar, the 9X8.&lt;/em&gt; | Images: Peugeot&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JPjpyu"&gt;French automaker Peugeot has &lt;a href="https://int-media.peugeot.com/en/node/90087880"&gt;revealed the new hybrid hypercar&lt;/a&gt; that it will race in the World Endurance Championship series and the 24 Hours of Le Mans next year. Not only does it look extremely cool — it truly “looks fast standing still,” as they say in motorsports — but it’s missing the typical rear wing, meaning Peugeot’s designers and engineers are making a huge bet that they can create the kind of aerodynamic downforce required to compete with Toyota, the dominant player in prototype racing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BovL3y"&gt;The new car, named the 9X8, is also just the latest reason to start following the top sports car racing series in the world, as it’s a sign that automakers of various stripes are taking the new Le Mans Hypercar class seriously and — crucially — are willing to put a ton of effort into designing vehicles that are genuinely interesting and different. Not only will Peugeot race this radical car starting next year, joining Toyota and single-car team Glickenhaus, but &lt;a href="https://sportscar365.com/lemans/wec/ferrari-announces-factory-lmh-program/"&gt;Ferrari is entering a car&lt;/a&gt; starting in 2023. It will be the Italian sports car manufacturer’s first prototype-class racing car in more than a half century.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="HUUNWd"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10639777"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="BTt8Hr"&gt;The Le Mans Hypercar class was created a few years ago as Audi and Porsche dropped out of what was then the top prototype class in endurance racing, Le Mans Prototype 1, citing high costs. (Audi and Porsche &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/28/16055120/porsche-racing-quit-wec-formula-e-electric"&gt;opted instead to focus on Formula E&lt;/a&gt;, the upstart all-electric racing series that is far less expensive — though Audi has &lt;a href="https://the-race.com/formula-e/why-audi-is-walking-away-from-formula-e/"&gt;since announced it’s leaving that sport&lt;/a&gt;.) As a result, Toyota dominated the series in the interim as basically the lone entrant in the top class. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="JngX89"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The new hypercar class is turning into the shakeup that endurance racing’s top class needed&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="vgY71N"&gt;Creating a whole new class let the sport’s governing body, the FIA, address the cost issue while also giving potential entrants a new set of technical challenges to try to conquer. The new class is also supposed to be a little slower than LMP1, and involve more technology typically found in road cars.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="woXUtq"&gt;Still, Peugeot’s new car is a beast. Per the regulations, it will marry a 680 horsepower V6 engine with a 200kW electric motor that pulls its power from a 900-volt battery pack that Peugeot is co-developing with French company Saft. Interestingly, since the regulations only allow a maximum of 680 horsepower at any given time during a race, the Peugeot’s powertrain will have to dynamically balance the power output of these two sources, since they can create &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/this-is-the-engine-that-will-power-peugeots-le-mans-hyp-1845876398"&gt;more than that in tandem&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eDxq2J"&gt;Clever technical solutions like that are one of the reasons to watch sports like endurance racing in the first place, but — for now at least — the new Le Mans Hypercar class doesn’t seem too prescriptive. In fact, it’s the existence of ample wiggle room in the rules that makes the wingless design possible in the first place, according to Peugeot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cyeTGo"&gt;“The greater flexibility allowed by the sport’s new technical rules regarding aerodynamics permits radical new thinking that favours the emergence of innovative cars, with scope for the design teams to make an even bigger contribution,” Peugeot Sport &lt;a href="https://int-media.peugeot.com/en/node/90087880"&gt;said in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. “Peugeot’s engineers and designers effectively took advantage of this opportunity to invent new creative processes and break away from established codes to produce a Hypercar of a completely new genre.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The best Chromebook for 2021</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Best Chromebooks 2020: Acer Chromebook Spin 713" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HDV4yWEUjQt1tPQn1vixjNoG1V4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/66976144/mchin_181029_4126_0011.0.6.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The best Chromebooks for every user&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="oqi8dk"&gt;The best Chromebooks aren’t just laptops that run a few Google apps anymore. Chromebooks can cover a wide variety of computing needs now, and a good Chrome OS laptop or two-in-one can be more useful than a mediocre &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21231636/windows-10-pc-user-guide-how-to-microsoft"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21281530/macos-mac-imac-user-guide-how-to-os-tips"&gt;MacOS&lt;/a&gt; laptop. That’s why our pick for the best Chromebook of 2021 is the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21355769/acer-chromebook-spin-713-review-best-chromebook-to-buy"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;, which does just about everything right. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xnwyna"&gt;The best Chromebooks are known to deliver good value. The message that many people actually want &lt;em&gt;good &lt;/em&gt;Chromebooks — rather than just cheap ones — has gotten through to manufacturers. Many are around $500 or $600, though there are good options in the higher and lower ranges as well. The extra money goes a long way toward getting something you’ll be happy with. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vUTNYw"&gt;For the first time, the quality of the best Chromebooks in this range has been consistent. There are so many similarities between the offerings from Asus, Lenovo, Google, HP, Dell, and Samsung that a conspiracy-minded person might suggest they’re all sourcing their components from the same factory. That’s great news if you’re comparison shopping; the majority of this list would be good buys if you can find them at a discount. They can even rival some of the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops"&gt;best laptops&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21528540/budget-windows-10-chromebook-systems-acer-lenovo-cheap"&gt;best budget laptops&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21369381/best-student-laptops-school-high-college"&gt;best student laptops&lt;/a&gt; on the market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cMCGia"&gt;Our pick for the best Chromebook is the Acer Chromebook Spin 713, and we’ve selected the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt; for shoppers on a budget. Other picks for the best Chromebooks of 2021 include the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20931476/google-pixelbook-go-review-the-price-of-simplicity"&gt;Google Pixelbook Go&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16550908/google-pixelbook-review-chromebook-android-laptop"&gt;Google Pixelbook&lt;/a&gt;, the HP Chromebook x360, and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22217002/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-price-release-date-hands-on-chrome-os-photos-video"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ch4TuU"&gt;What most buyers want in the best Chromebook are likely the same things they want in any laptop: a good keyboard, solid build quality, long battery life, a nice screen, and enough power to do the things you want. More Chromebooks can meet those qualifications than ever before, but these are the ones that rise above the rest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="YECpuA"&gt;Best Chromebook 2021&lt;/h1&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Acer Chromebook Spin 713 is the best Chromebook of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="KQRVus"&gt;1. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22451261/acer-chromebook-spin-713-2021-review"&gt;Acer Chromebook Spin 713&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="BfZy92"&gt;Best Chromebook of 2021&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="LpXHDz"&gt;Acer’s Chromebook Spin 713 is, hands-down, the best Chromebook you can buy. With a gorgeous 3:2 screen that rivals some more expensive competitors, you’ll have a ton of extra vertical space for your work and multitasking. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zarhIJ"&gt;The keyboard is excellent with a comfortable, quiet feel, and nice backlighting. There’s even an HDMI port, which you don’t see on a thin Chromebook every day. And (most importantly) the 11th-Gen Intel processors can handle a heavy load of tabs with no problem. The Spin’s speakers aren’t great, and there’s no biometric login, but those are reasonable sacrifices to make for a laptop of this quality at this low of a price. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GX2USx"&gt;In a market where the main differences between Chromebooks in this price range boil down to their screens and maybe an included stylus, Acer sets itself apart by making an affordable laptop that’s excellent in almost every way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="WtaeAS"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505954" data-anthem-component-data='{"layout":"full_with_square_img"}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;img alt="Best Chromebook 2021: Lenovo Chromebook Duet" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pDnq5iKvs1snl7mnQ956GJOyu90=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19978538/mchin_200512_4018_0003.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;For students or anyone looking for a small secondary device, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet is a great affordable pick.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="RGZEpN"&gt;2. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262694/lenovo-chromebook-duet-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Lenovo Chromebook Duet&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="P8MGAD"&gt;Best Chromebook on a budget&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="xJq778"&gt;If you’re looking for an affordable device for on-the-go work, the Lenovo Chromebook Duet delivers excellent value for its low price. It’s an ultra-portable 10.1-inch 2-in-1 device with a detachable keyboard and kickstand cover. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XfnBmb"&gt;The Duet contains a MediaTek Helio P60T processor, 4GB of RAM, and up to 128GB of storage, and it performs well if you’re just browsing and don’t plan on using a super heavy load. It also uses a version of Chrome OS that’s made for its convertible form factor, including the first version of Chrome that’s optimized for tablet use. When detached from its keyboard, the Duet supports an Android-esque gesture navigation system that makes switching between apps a breeze. But the most impressive feature is battery life; I got close to 11.5 hours of fairly heavy use.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="93jX9I"&gt;Of course, there are drawbacks. The touchpad and keyboard are quite small, there’s no headphone jack (and only one USB-C port), and the 16:10 screen is a bit dim. But those are reasonable trade-offs to make for such an affordable price. It makes a great secondary device for schoolwork or on-the-go browsing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zyoOMu"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9505920"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="h53Xe7"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Best Chromebook 2021: HP Chromebook x360 14" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/V_ywzr_RXTQ5_V71rLE_aoXdE6I=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/19138761/vpavic_190731_3630_0083_result.jpg"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you’re looking for a larger device with more power, one of the best Chromebooks you can buy is the HP Chromebook x360 14.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C2SoIE"&gt;3. HP Chromebook x360 14&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="rtrWbQ"&gt;Powerful Chromebook with a sleek design&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="E2rGvI"&gt;If you’re looking to get more power and you don’t mind getting a slightly larger laptop, the HP Chromebook x360 14 is a great choice. HP has several configurations that fall under this name, but we suggest the model we tested with 8GB of RAM and 64GB of storage to go along with the i3 processor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="alUDxQ"&gt;While we picked the Asus because of its elegant design, there isn’t much to complain about on the slightly larger HP. It has the same ports, RAM, and storage. The keyboard is great, and it also sounds slightly better because the speakers are up on the keyboard deck instead of on the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="epP0CZ"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9508136"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Monica Chin / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;If the Chomebook Duet isn’t enough, the Chromebook Detachable CM3 brings some new perks to the detachable form factor, for an extra cost.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h2 id="FxguZ6"&gt;4. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22526743/asus-chromebook-detachable-cm3-review-tablet-chromebook-chrome-os-price"&gt;Asus Chromebook Detachable CM3&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="CrrPVI"&gt;Best detachable Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="canZPK"&gt;The Chromebook Detachable CM3 is Asus’s attempt to compete with Lenovo’s highly praised Chromebook Duet. Like the Duet, the CM3 is a 10.5-inch, 16:10 Chrome OS tablet with a fabric cover, a kickstand, and a keyboard that pops on and off. It’s a bit more expensive than the Duet, but also has a few extra features. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uNgQvV"&gt;One unique perk is that the kickstand folds multiple ways: You can fold it the long way to stand the tablet up like a laptop, or fold it the short way and stand the tablet up horizontally. We’re not sure how practical this functionality actually is, but it’s there if you have a use case in mind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SlTu0z"&gt;The CM3 also comes with a built-in USI stylus, and roomy keys with a surprising amount of travel. But the thing we found most impressive was the battery life: We averaged close to 13 hours of continuous work on the device. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="11a1Pz"&gt;The CM3 won’t be the best Chromebook for everyone: It only has two ports (one USB-C and one audio jack) and its MediaTek processor was a bit sluggish compared to more expensive offerings. But if you’re looking for a convertible Chrome OS device and find that the Duet doesn’t quite suit your needs, you’re likely the CM3’s target audience. &lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2 one of the best Chromebooks of 2021.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="AZSrVU"&gt;5. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22301481/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-2-review"&gt;Samsung Galaxy Chromebook 2&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="yloceu"&gt;Best midrange Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="IqMUru"&gt;Samsung’s first &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/6/21206151/samsung-galaxy-chromebook-review-android-laptop"&gt;Galaxy Chromebook&lt;/a&gt; shot for the moon, with a $1,000 price tag, an OLED display, a packaged stylus, and a premium build. The Galaxy Chromebook 2 isn’t so much a sequel to that device as it is a pared-down, more affordable alternative. There’s no fingerprint sensor, no stylus, and no OLED — but it’s quite functional, and with a sub-$600 starting price it’s a much more reasonable purchase. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SMshkm"&gt;The Chromebook 2’s highlight feature is its finish: It comes in a bright “fiesta red” that will certainly stand out wherever you’re using it. (There’s a gray option as well, if you’d prefer something subtle.) It’s also the first Chromebook ever to feature one of Samsung’s QLED panels. QLED isn’t OLED — it’s just a fancier LED — but it still makes for one of the most gorgeous displays I’ve ever seen on a Chromebook. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="91mDFz"&gt;Nice screens sometimes wreck battery life, but that’s not the case here. I averaged about seven hours and 21 minutes of continuous work on the Chromebook 2, which means you shouldn’t need to plug it in &lt;em&gt;too &lt;/em&gt;too often. And while the Core i3 processor isn’t the most powerful chip you can get in a Chromebook, it’s just fine for everyday work use. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="s4tmgA"&gt;Best Google Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="WMItcT"&gt;The Google Pixelbook Go is a handsome, no-nonsense 13.3-inch laptop that weighs just 2.3 pounds. It has a sturdy magnesium chassis, and a ridged grip on the bottom to keep itself from slipping on slanted surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M72CDq"&gt;Not only is the Pixelbook Go portable and stylish, but it delivers solid performance, and supports fast charging through either of its USB-C ports. Battery life is also impressive. The Go lasted over eight hours in our testing, and it should get you through a full workday with no problem. But its standout feature is the keyboard, which is quiet with good travel and a springy feel. &lt;em&gt;Verge &lt;/em&gt;editor Dieter Bohn found it to be his “favorite thing to type on by a long shot.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wCvQ3C"&gt;The Go is an expensive product, as Chromebooks go, and it doesn’t top our list because the Chromebook Flip C434 offers similar specs and features for a slightly lower price. But we think plenty of shoppers who value long battery life and lightweight build might prefer to spend a bit more on this device instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="URZefw"&gt;7. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22424783/lenovo-thinkpad-c13-yoga-review-price-specs-features-amd"&gt;Lenovo C13 Yoga Chromebook&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="U2ykf7"&gt;Best premium Chromebook&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="nT7MLq"&gt;Many modern Chromebooks are oriented towards kids and students, but not this one. The C13 Yoga Chromebook is a sturdy, pricey, convertible Chromebook for grown-ups. It’s part of Lenovo’s renowned ThinkPad business line, and has all kinds of ThinkPad perks including a red Trackpoint, discrete touchpad clickers, a fingerprint sensor, a webcam shutter, and an aluminum design. Put this Chromebook next to any number of Windows ThinkPads, and we might not be able to pick it out. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="iLVSSi"&gt;The C13 is also unique in that it’s the first Chromebook to include AMD’s Ryzen 3000 Mobile C-series processors, which are marketed specifically for Chromebooks. The chips run all kinds of programs — even mobile games — quite smoothly. We do wish the battery life was a bit better — we only averaged just over six hours on one charge. We averaged seven and a half hours from our top pick, the Chromebook Spin 713, and plenty of the devices here break eight hours with no problem&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="sajnTX"&gt;Premium 2-in-1 with a built-in stylus&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="6nUXhF"&gt;It’s a bit heavy as Chromebooks go, but the 3.99-pound Inspiron 14 is still a sturdy convertible device with brushed aluminum chassis that gives it a premium look. It has a spacious backlit keyboard and a nice 1920 x 1080 display with accurate colors. With an 8th Gen Core i3 processor, 4GB of RAM, and 128GB of storage, it delivers snappy performance for streaming, browsing, multitasking, and even more demanding artistic tasks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kX7aDx"&gt;Speaking of artists, the Inspiron 14 comes with a stylus, which lives in a dedicated socket inside the chassis so you don’t have to worry about losing it. Thanks to electromagnetic resonance technology (EMR), it doesn’t need batteries or any kind of charge. &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id="YGLlQl"&gt;Best Chromebook for kids&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="S71N4L"&gt;The Lenovo Flex 3 is ideal for someone on a tight budget who wants a small, lightweight device. It’s most useful as a portable companion for travel or school: It lasted us close to nine hours one a charge, and also juices up pretty quickly with its 45W power brick. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jMomXG"&gt;There are some other perks as well. It has one of the better keyboards we’ve ever used on a Chromebook, let alone a Chromebook in the $350 price range. And it has excellent connectivity, including four modern USB ports and a microSD reader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="V0kBcV"&gt;All that said, this isn’t the device for things beyond basic tasks. The tiny screen (11 inches) doesn’t have a lot of room for multitasking, and the Intel Celeron processor isn’t designed to handle many demanding apps or too many Chrome tabs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="Kg36s4"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10639822"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

    <title>Microsoft Teams tries out Together Mode for smaller groups</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/83s0WDydSX57VabwOWK8PsN7D4Y=/173x0:1748x1050/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69547452/2021_07_06_09_41_12_TechSmith_Camtasia_2021.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EbIBmA"&gt;Microsoft is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/amandassterner/status/1410591387184242691"&gt;adding support for smaller gatherings&lt;/a&gt; to its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/8/21317526/microsoft-teams-together-mode-dynamic-view-new-features"&gt;Together Mode feature of Teams&lt;/a&gt;, which uses AI to place all of the participants in a meeting into virtual environments (&lt;a href="https://www.onmsft.com/news/microsoft-teams-makes-together-mode-available-for-all-meeting-sizes"&gt;via OnMSFT&lt;/a&gt;). Sports fans may recognize the feature from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/24/21337326/nba-microsoft-teams-together-mode-basketball-virtual-experience-fans"&gt;the NBA’s use of it during the pandemic&lt;/a&gt; to provide a crowd-like experience for basketball games. The change to allow smaller crowds is somewhat the opposite of that and is currently in beta. Given Microsoft’s focus on &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/24/22549191/skype-windows-11-microsoft-teams"&gt;Teams as a personal communications app&lt;/a&gt; as well as a corporate one, it’s not necessarily surprising that Together Mode will be able to work for family gatherings as well as company-wide all-hands.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sEBp0Y"&gt;At the moment, the feature’s availability seems to be limited to people using the Teams Developer Preview. In theory, &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro"&gt;joining is easy&lt;/a&gt;: you just go to Teams, click on the ellipsis next to your profile picture in the top-right corner, go to About, then check Developer Preview. If you’re using a work account, though, you may not have the option; &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/dev-preview/developer-preview-intro"&gt;Microsoft says&lt;/a&gt; the ability to turn previews on or off is controlled by your organization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n0weOC"&gt;It being in preview also puts an asterisk on the “together” part. When I was testing with one client running on the preview, and one not, the Together interface only showed up on the computer running the preview. On the computer that wasn’t, it just looked like a normal Teams call.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hGAPAHrxZaKY5kd8-lcJBcifCTY=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701739/2021_07_06_09_40_00_TechSmith_Camtasia_2021.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Alone at the coffee shop.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="4DJQUk"&gt;It also appeared to work for one person, for those who’d like to sit alone at the cafe from the comfort of their own home. As with any features in preview, how it works is subject to change by the time it gets released to the general public. It’s good to see that Microsoft is at least planning on allowing smaller groups to use this feature, as it can be fun for gatherings big and small.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>macOS 101: how to force quit a Mac app</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/nm-CwgHR_wOY-d-ceXSgL4epemc=/0x34:1058x739/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69547450/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_2.08.39_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oTrMbb"&gt;Apps on macOS are usually well-behaved, but there are times when they can stop working or freeze and slow down your entire Mac. If that happens to you (and it might happen often if you’re &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22558991/macos-monterey-how-to-install-public-beta"&gt;playing with the latest Monterey betas&lt;/a&gt;), it’s time to quit the app. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yu7SMu"&gt;The first thing to do, of course, is try to quit the app normally:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="224zXf"&gt;Right-click on the app’s icon in the menu bar and select “Quit,” or...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="33lfCZ"&gt;Press the Command-Q keys.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="DdcZYn"&gt;However, if the app is frozen or just won’t go away, then you need to force a quit. Again, there are a couple of ways to do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="LYQa97"&gt;Click on the Apple icon in the top-left corner and look for a choice that says “Force Quit” or...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="lpmgTD"&gt;Press Command-Option-Esc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You may be able to find “Force Quit” in the Apple drop-down menu." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vGxWEJCREgbEqgl5I-HhcupWLPU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701867/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_10.51.06_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You may be able to find “Force Quit” in the Apple drop-down menu.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="byeFag"&gt;Either way, this will bring up the “Force Quit Applications” box, which will have a list of currently active apps. Highlight the troublesome app, and click on the “Force Quit” button. A pop-up will ask if you’re sure; click on “Force Quit” to finally quit the app.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Use the “Force Quite Applications” menu to shut down an erring app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/yedHKjJbMVDbcF4Rv0fbv4N4JeQ=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701870/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_10.51.30_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Use the “Force Quite Applications” menu to shut down an erring app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="XHmqw7"&gt;If for any reason you can’t access the “Force Quit” menu, there is another way to quit the app using the Activity Monitor, which lists all of the active processes on your Mac. To get to the Activity Monitor:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="rF7rhW"&gt;Use Spotlight Search to find “Activity Monitor,” or...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="4X1teS"&gt;In your Finder, click on Applications in the left-hand menu. In the resulting list of apps, double-click on Utilities to open the folder, and then double-click on Activity Monitor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="You’ll find Activity Monitor in the Applications Utility folder." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KvDa75zQOI0DwTY5DW0vxkRhhz4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701873/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_11.56.14_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;You’ll find Activity Monitor in the Applications’ Utility folder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li id="FZwqc2"&gt;You’ll see a list of active processes, which should include your misbehaving app. It’s going to be a long list, so you can click on the “Process Name” heading to alphabetize the list for an easier find. If you suspect that the app is stressing your CPU, you might try clicking on the “% CPU” heading, which may put the app at the top of the list.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Once you’ve found the app, click the “x” icon at the top of the list." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_CMmuCURZUgQZz6vrf9_GYtYx94=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701874/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_11.57.47_AM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Once you’ve found the app, click the “x” icon at the top of the list.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="Nt5G6I"&gt;Highlight the app you want to quit, and click on the “x” icon at the top of the window.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QzaPws"&gt;Click on “Force Quit.”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="Now you can either quit or force quit the app." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QbRG3yXrKPupi5QFry73TVRQz_U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701875/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_12.03.03_PM.png"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now you can either quit or force quit the app.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="kBldLk"&gt;And if you’re still having difficulties, you can always shut down your system. You may lose some of what you’re currently working on, but it will close the app that’s driving you nuts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="368Xap"&gt;Hold down your power button (or the Touch ID button if your Mac has a Touch Bar) until you see the Apple logo on your display.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="vFZxsK"&gt;Let go, and allow the system to restart.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="uA3HUE"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="avlTqC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Welcome to Simulation City, the virtual world where Waymo tests its autonomous vehicles</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XiwJExqeWfobcoDWwCtfrjCxzss=/348x0:1571x815/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69547270/Screen_Shot_2021_07_06_at_1.58.04_PM.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;The Alphabet company is doubling up on simulation as it gets closer to commercialization&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Q8ClOp"&gt;A light gray cube with a thin blue top glides down a darkened highway, beset on all sides by dozens of green cubes. The green cubes bounce between lanes in an attempt to pass the gray cube, but the gray cube maintains a steady speed as the blackened landscape slips past into the artificial night. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2gK1zK"&gt;This is Simulation City, the virtual world where Waymo, an offshoot of Google, tests its autonomous vehicles in preparation for real-world experiences. The gray cube with the blue top represents one of the company’s autonomous semi-trailer trucks, while the green cubes are all the other vehicles on the artificial highway. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KFcwDT"&gt;Waymo is unique among autonomous vehicle operators in that it has not one but two simulation programs it uses to train its vehicles. The first is &lt;a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/08/inside-waymos-secret-testing-and-simulation-facilities/537648/"&gt;CarCraft&lt;/a&gt;, which has been in use since at least 2017, and in which Waymo says it has driven over 5 billion miles. Simulation City is the latest virtual world in which the company trains, tests, and validates its “Waymo driver” software in order to ensure its vehicles are better prepared to meet all of the challenges of the open road. Waymo is sharing details about Simulation City for the first time exclusively with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="NX3wOP"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Waymo is unique among autonomous vehicle operators in that it has not one, but two simulation programs&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="n1RYi5"&gt;The company decided it needed a second simulation program after discovering “gaps” in its virtual testing capabilities, said Ben Frankel, senior product manager at the company. Those gaps included using simulation to validate new vehicle platforms, such as the Jaguar I-Pace electric SUV that Waymo has recently begun testing in California, and the company’s semi-trailer trucks outfitted with sensing hardware and the Waymo driver software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="uDFb06"&gt;
&lt;div data-analytics-viewport="video" data-analytics-action="volume:view:article:middle" data-analytics-label="Waymo's Simulaiton City|102867" data-volume-uuid="6702603bc" data-volume-id="102867" data-analytics-placement="article:middle" data-volume-placement="article" data-volume-autoplay="false" id="volume-placement-101" class="volume-video"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="OrMn97"&gt;The company has also been using Simulation City to run tests in new operating domains to better prepare its vehicles to launch in new cities. Right now, Waymo has vehicles operating autonomously in the suburbs outside of Phoenix, Arizona, and in San Francisco and Mountain View, California. The company also has manually driven vehicles gathering mapping data in Los Angeles. To date, Waymo said it has tested its vehicles in over two dozen cities, most of which are in California. But expansion has been &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/05/why-hasnt-waymo-expanded-its-driverless-service-heres-my-theory/"&gt;going slowly&lt;/a&gt;, and Waymo is hoping that Simulation City can provide help as it seeks to expand to new locations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2kC8zl"&gt;“The way that I would hope that this platform evolves is such that you could get a sense of the rates of different incidents and events inside a city that we haven’t driven in before, before we have to put boots on the ground in that city,” Frankel said, “and get a read on whether the Waymo driver is good or not already for a particular city — and being able to do that for lots of lots of cities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="AeOA1d"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“You could get a sense of the rates of different incidents and events inside a city that we haven’t driven in before”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="w5QTnV"&gt;Simulation City is well-suited to gaming out “end-to-end” robotaxi trips, such as a 20-minute “rider only” trip across San Francisco. “Rider only” is Waymo parlance for autonomous vehicles without a human driver behind the wheel. The company has approximately 600 vehicles as part of its fleet. More than 300 vehicles operate in Arizona in an approximately 100-square-mile service area that includes the towns of Chandler, Gilbert, Mesa, and Tempe — though its fully driverless cars are restricted to an area that is only half that size. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kerxMc"&gt;“There’s a set of things that we needed to have better tooling to support,” Frankel said, “and Simulation City filled in that grid of capabilities that we needed, and makes it possible to do what was challenging before with the existing simulation tools.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fht3fc"&gt;Simulation is a critical piece of the puzzle for autonomous vehicles. These programs allow Waymo’s engineers to test — at scale — common driving scenarios and safety-critical edge cases, the learnings from which it then feeds into its real-world fleet. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iWbnIRAohLEicX_RX2Am1hXgK4s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22701958/SensorSim.gif"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Waymo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Simulation is a critical piece of the puzzle for autonomous vehicles.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="wTGuBq"&gt;The key word is “scale” because these simulators allow Waymo to far exceed the distances its vehicles travel on public roads. As of 2020, Waymo said it’s simulated 15 billion miles of driving, compared to just 20 million miles of actual driving. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gJo3zK"&gt;In Simulation City, those real-world miles are now informing the miles driven in simulation, meaning the company has more confidence in the validity and reliability of the virtual situations it constructs for its vehicles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="712LkU"&gt;“Once that relationship is established in an increasingly strong way, we need fewer additional miles driven in the real world to basically say what we learned in simulation is correct,” Frankel said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="HRAlE8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Simulation City is also computationally more advanced than Waymo’s previous virtual world testing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="EEEmC4"&gt;Simulation City is also computationally more advanced than Waymo’s previous virtual world testing in the level of detail it can create. For example, Waymo’s engineers can simulate something as small as raindrops or as complex as late afternoon solar glare. In the past, these situations have been known to confuse an autonomous vehicle’s perception hardware, which can make it difficult to read critical signage like traffic lights. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UILOK5"&gt;In addition to its own real-world testing, Waymo is using a variety of data sources to help build out the driving scenarios for the simulator, including the &lt;a href="https://www.nhtsa.gov/data/crash-data-systems"&gt;National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s crash data systems&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="http://www.trb.org/StrategicHighwayResearchProgram2SHRP2/Public/Blank2.aspx"&gt;Transportation Research Board’s naturalistic driving study data&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8kdOaE"&gt;The company is also using artificial intelligence and sensor data collected by its self-driving vehicles to generate realistic camera images for simulation. They call this technique SurfelGAN (surfel is an abbreviated term for “surface element,” while GAN stands for generative adversarial network, a machine learning term). &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/im7q3nhoPjS1jDO68sc9rkwbIq8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/13601824/vpavic_181127_3122_0042.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="MMLnru"&gt;SurfelGAN was created out of a realization that current sensor simulators often use gaming engines, such as Unreal or Unity, which require manual creation of environments and other objects like cars and pedestrians. Waymo’s engineers discovered that these gaming engines were hard to scale and often failed to produce realistic approximations of camera, lidar, and radar data without a ton of extra work. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="DWfy01"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Inside Waymo’s strategy to grow the best brains for self-driving cars","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/9/17307156/google-waymo-driverless-cars-deep-learning-neural-net-interview"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="Z7pAKI"&gt;So they developed SurfelGAN, which uses texture-mapped surface elements to reconstruct scenes and camera viewpoints for positions and orientations. The use of artificial intelligence helps scale the product, making it easier and more efficient to develop. The technique was outlined in &lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.03844"&gt;a recent paper&lt;/a&gt; co-authored by Waymo researchers, including principal scientist Dragomir Anguelov.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eUMZLn"&gt;There is a risk in using these new simulation techniques, said Huei Peng, professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan and the director of Mcity, the proving ground for autonomous vehicles. The main one is that flawed input data will produce entirely useless results — known in computational science circles as “garbage in, garbage out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="Z86Ujs"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There is a risk in using these new simulation techniques&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="rwWvFk"&gt;“You have to do some kind of correlation to say, ‘My simulation is not junk, there is a very close correlation between what my simulation tells me and what the real testing tells me, even if they are not quantitatively 100 percent,’” Peng said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TUMxhd"&gt;But Frankel says that Waymo has already improved upon what Anguelov and his co-authors outlined in their paper last year. “The maturity of the sensor simulation has grown quite a lot since the time that we published that,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AgZKX2"&gt;Waymo is ramping up its simulation work at a rather &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22423489/autonomous-vehicle-consolidation-acquisition-lyft-uber"&gt;precarious time for the company&lt;/a&gt;. Earlier this year, John Krafcik &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22364317/waymo-ceo-john-krafcik-stepping-down-self-driving-cars-google-alphabet"&gt;announced that he was stepping down as CEO of Waymo&lt;/a&gt; after helping lead the company since 2015. Experts say that Waymo still has a commanding lead in the pursuit of autonomous vehicles, but diminished expectations about the future of self-driving cars are affecting its valuation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="al8qnW"&gt;Of course, these are business problems, not technical ones. And earlier this year, Waymo showed how simulation can be used to make a better case to the public for its autonomous vehicles. In a bid to prove that its robot drivers are safer than humans, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22315361/waymo-autonomous-vehicle-simulation-car-crash-deaths"&gt;Waymo simulated dozens of real-world fatal crashes&lt;/a&gt; that took place in Arizona over nearly a decade. The company discovered that replacing either vehicle in a two-car crash with its robot-guided minivans would nearly eliminate all deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yuklto"&gt;Waymo has been conservative in the rollout of its robotaxis, refusing to expand the service area in Arizona and holding back on launching a similar service in the Bay Area until it’s sure that its software is up for the task of a much denser and more complex urban environment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vcotMY"&gt;But Frankel said that Simulation City has helped contribute to the growing “maturity” of its autonomous vehicles that will better prepare them for wider-scale use in the near future. “It’s a level of maturity that I think it’s worth picking our heads up and saying, ‘Hey, world, we’re doing this cool new thing,” he said. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Netflix’s Witcher prequel gains Michelle Yeoh as... a sword-elf</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon: Sword of Destiny" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fDh1Nfl75SpreeE0VKGyDsyAE1M=/0x0:5117x3411/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69547220/crouching_netflix_yeoh.0.0.jpeg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="b1echG"&gt;Michelle Yeoh is joining the cast of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/27/21340050/netflix-the-witcher-blood-origin-live-action-prequel-announced"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher: Blood Origin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Netflix’s six-part spinoff of its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/20/21026537/the-witcher-netflix-review-henry-cavill"&gt;live-action television adaptation&lt;/a&gt; of the novels by Andrzej Sapkowski. The streaming service &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/witchernetflix/status/1412411286349045771?s=20"&gt;announced that the blockbuster film veteran will play “Scían,”&lt;/a&gt; bringing some star power and action skills to her role as the last remaining member of a tribe of “sword-elves.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QUmrgG"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/netflixgeeked/status/1412436058608971783?s=21"&gt;According to Netflix&lt;/a&gt;, Scían is on a quest to retrieve a stolen sacred sword, which probably leads to her crossing paths with &lt;a href="https://deadline.com/2021/03/the-witcher-blood-origin-casts-vikings-actor-laurence-ofuarain-lead-1234722496/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blood Origin&lt;/em&gt;’s other announced cast member&lt;/a&gt;, Laurence O’Fuarian as Fjall. &lt;em&gt;Blood&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Origin &lt;/em&gt;is focused on the creation of the first prototype Witcher (mutant monster hunters for those out of the loop) and the events that lead to the “Conjunction of the Spheres,” a cosmic occurrence that brought the world of elves colliding into a bunch of other realms — creating the magic- and monster-ridden continent of the original novels, &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjnq6zD_s7xAhUWqJ4KHTJeApMQFnoECCUQAw&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2015%2F5%2F12%2F8586515%2Fwitcher-3-wild-hunt-review-ps4-xbox-one-game&amp;amp;usg=AOvVaw1mIaDtSkW4xgZjWiCCc64Y"&gt;CD Projekt Red video games&lt;/a&gt;, and Netflix series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fRV9Dn"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Michelle Yeoh is joining the cast of THE WITCHER: BLOOD ORIGIN as the sword-elf Scian, whose deadly quest to retrieve a stolen sacred sword will lead her on a journey that will change the outcome of the Continent. &lt;a href="https://t.co/YzTo3yvTic"&gt;pic.twitter.com/YzTo3yvTic&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Netflix Geeked (@NetflixGeeked) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NetflixGeeked/status/1412436058608971783?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;July 6, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K4razB"&gt;Yeoh’s most recent television project was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/9/25/16359132/star-trek-discovery-review-cbs-all-access-sonequa-martin-green-michelle-yeoh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: Discovery&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and her long career in Hollywood has spanned everything from &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/18/17690280/crazy-rich-asians-trope-rom-com-modern-statement"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crazy Rich Asians&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;to James Bond. But she might best be known for her extensive filmography in Hong Kong where she notably did many of her own stunts&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The actress has battled plenty of bad guys, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KrE4slKDtRo"&gt;large machinery&lt;/a&gt;, and even a &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BNS0rOr-Bs"&gt;stop-motion skeleton&lt;/a&gt;. Her background in stellar on-screen fight scenes is what makes whatever blade-based business Scían gets up to most exciting. If you haven’t seen &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI0v72_wFqc"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wing Chun&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Reign of Assassins, &lt;/em&gt;it’s generally a good idea to give Michelle Yeoh a sword. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jNSezk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Witcher: Blood Origin &lt;/em&gt;is likely still a way off, but Netflix has more Witcher news to share this week: the streaming service is &lt;a href="https://www.witchercon.com/en#welcome"&gt;hosting a virtual WitcherCon &lt;/a&gt;alongside game developer CD Projekt Red on July 9th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DaBGNv"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>America used fewer fossil fuels in 2020 than it has in three decades</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Brent oil price dives below $20 per barrel" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m8pCMv7HRgAhxDcyY2A5JJd3PvQ=/0x1:4580x3054/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69547187/1210618127.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;NEW JERSEY, USA - APRIL 21: Phillips 66 oil refinery is seen in New Jersey, United States on April 21, 2020. Brent crude oil dived below the threshold of $20 per barrel as the novel coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic ramped up oil oversupply amid low global consumption. | Photo by Tayfun Coskun/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="m1Przo"&gt;Americans gobbled up fewer fossil fuels in 2020 than they have in three decades, &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=48596#"&gt;according to the US Energy Information Administration&lt;/a&gt; (EIA). Consumption of petroleum, natural gas, and coal dropped by 9 percent last year compared to 2019, the biggest annual decrease since the EIA started keeping track in 1949.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2NG2WB"&gt;The COVID-19 pandemic was responsible for much of the fall as people stayed home to curb the spread of the virus and used less gas. In April 2020, oil prices &lt;a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/20/oil-prices-sink-to-20-year-low-as-un-sounds-alarm-on-to-covid-19-relief-fund"&gt;nosedived below zero&lt;/a&gt; because there was so little demand. The US transportation sector alone used up 15 percent less energy in 2020 compared to the year before. &lt;a href="https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=47976"&gt;Higher temperatures last winter&lt;/a&gt; also helped to cut energy demand for heating, according to the EIA. As a result, greenhouse gas emissions from burning fossil fuels &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575347/united-states-greenhouse-gas-emissions-historic-plummet"&gt;plummeted to a near 40-year low&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="KTGFGW"&gt;&lt;q&gt;That downward trend will have to continue&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="I21q5X"&gt;That downward trend will have to continue in order to stave off the climate crisis. Upon rejoining the Paris climate agreement, President Joe Biden committed the US to slash its planet-heating pollution &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/22/22394366/joe-biden-pledge-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-2030"&gt;in half this decade&lt;/a&gt; from near-peak levels it reached in 2005. That’s part of a global effort to keep global warming from surpassing a point that life on Earth would struggle to adapt to, a global average temperature that’s roughly 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SdG9cJ"&gt;To hit that goal, there should be no further investments in new fossil fuel projects, according to a recent landmark &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/pathway-to-critical-and-formidable-goal-of-net-zero-emissions-by-2050-is-narrow-but-brings-huge-benefits"&gt;report&lt;/a&gt; from the International Energy Agency. The oil and gas industries are already &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/26/22455387/big-oil-gas-shell-exxon-chevron-climate-change"&gt;feeling the crunch from lawsuits and activist investors&lt;/a&gt; forcing them to move faster toward more sustainable forms of energy. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nOKxhk"&gt;Renewable energy — particularly solar and wind — is on the upswing. Despite the pandemic, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/11/22430465/renewable-energy-solar-wind-iea-2020-exceptional-growth"&gt;renewable sources of electricity grew at a faster pace last year&lt;/a&gt; than they have since 1999. After making up an impressive 90 percent of the global power sector’s growth, the International Energy Agency expects renewable energy to maintain the same “exceptionally high” growth through 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="lWMtFq"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Renewable energy — particularly solar and wind — is on the upswing&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="mkX6JN"&gt;Despite the momentum moving in green energy’s favor, cutting pollution from fossil fuels at a fast enough pace to avoid climate catastrophe is still an uphill battle. As economies opened back up after their pandemic lull, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/2/22309374/global-china-carbon-dioxide-emissions-rising"&gt;CO2 emissions came roaring back&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RRErF4"&gt;“The rebound in global carbon emissions toward the end of last year is a stark warning that not enough is being done to accelerate clean energy transitions worldwide,” Fatih Birol, IEA executive director, said in a March &lt;a href="https://www.iea.org/news/after-steep-drop-in-early-2020-global-carbon-dioxide-emissions-have-rebounded-strongly"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="GFgnfb"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LeEKti"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pentagon cancels Microsoft JEDI contract, will ask for new cloud computing bids</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Pentagon" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/I2pqE3x7O-QjIulkGYVY79_zqcw=/59x0:4750x3127/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69546954/1223814797.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo By Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="VVFuOX"&gt;The US Defense Department has canceled the $10 billion JEDI cloud computing project it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/25/20700698/microsoft-pentagon-contract-jedi-cloud-amazon-details"&gt;awarded to Microsoft&lt;/a&gt; in 2019, saying the controversial program’s design “no longer meets its needs.” The department will replace JEDI with another cloud infrastructure contract and plans to solicit bids from Microsoft as well as Amazon — which sued over losing the original contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hMOh9"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/07/06/pentagon-cancels-10-billion-jedi-cloud-contract.html"&gt;CNBC reported&lt;/a&gt; the news earlier today. “Due to evolving requirements, increased cloud conversancy, and industry advances, the JEDI Cloud contract no longer meets its needs,” reads a Defense Department press release sent to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “JEDI was developed at a time when the department’s needs were different and both the CSPs technology and our cloud conversancy was less mature,” said acting Defense Department chief information officer John Sherman as part of the statement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eAsASV"&gt;The release also announced a multi-vendor contract called the Joint Warfighter Cloud Capability contract to provide many of the services offered by JEDI. CNBC says the Defense Department considers Amazon and Microsoft the only companies capable of providing the necessary infrastructure, although it says it will perform market research to see if other competitors could fit the bill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bxB1yO"&gt;JEDI would have seen Microsoft provide cloud services for data storage as well as artificial intelligence tasks and other computing requirements, although some Microsoft employees &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/17/17990534/microsoft-amazon-letters-medium-rekognition-jedi-military"&gt;protested the decision&lt;/a&gt; to submit a bid. Microsoft beat Amazon to secure the contract, and Amazon filed a lawsuit claiming former President Donald Trump’s animus against it had improperly influenced the decision. The suit &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/13/21136641/amazon-microsoft-pentagon-contract-jedi-10-billion-paused"&gt;placed JEDI on pause&lt;/a&gt;, and this spring, a judge &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/29/22409245/amazon-microsoft-jedi-contract-reject-motion-dismiss-trump-influence"&gt;allowed the case&lt;/a&gt; to proceed to trial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g6rmkL"&gt;In a statement to Congress in January, the Defense Department had &lt;a href="https://www.nextgov.com/media/gbc/docs/pdfs_edit/ng_infopaper_jedi_litigation_01282012.pdf"&gt;suggested that&lt;/a&gt; a protracted dispute with Amazon could &lt;a href="https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/"&gt;jeopardize JEDI’s future&lt;/a&gt;, thanks to an “urgent, unmet requirement” for cloud computing. “We remain fully committed to meeting these requirements, we hope through JEDI, but these requirements transcend any one procurement,” said Defense Department press secretary John Kirby in May. “And they’re going to have to be met one way or the other.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dmdMgK"&gt;An Amazon spokesperson told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; that “we understand and agree with” the department’s decision today. “Unfortunately, the contract award was not based on the merits of the proposals and instead was the result of outside influence that has no place in government procurement. Our commitment to supporting our nation’s military and ensuring that our warfighters and defense partners have access to the best technology at the best price is stronger than ever. We look forward to continuing to support the DoD’s modernization efforts and building solutions that help accomplish their critical missions.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xE4lxN"&gt;Microsoft &lt;a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2021/07/06/microsofts-commitment-to-the-dod-remains-steadfast/"&gt;responded to the decision&lt;/a&gt; with a blog post. “The DoD faced a difficult choice: Continue with what could be a years-long litigation battle or find another path forward,” it reads in part. “Because the security of the United States through the provision of critical technology upgrades is more important that any single contract, we respect and accept DoD’s decision to move forward on a different path to secure mission-critical technology.” The post says Microsoft is “ready to support the DoD as they work through their next steps and its new cloud computing solicitation plans.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bqVBBL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 4PM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Added statements from Amazon and Microsoft.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;It has a bigger OLED screen, but not much else has changed&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p id="OfKiQP"&gt;Nintendo has just revealed &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;a new Nintendo Switch&lt;/a&gt;, and it brings some nice upgrades to the four-year-old console. The most notable is a larger 7-inch 720p OLED screen, but it also has improved speakers, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22564942/nintendo-switch-oled-screen-new-kickstand"&gt;a Microsoft Surface-like kickstand&lt;/a&gt;, 64GB of internal storage, and a new dock with an included ethernet port.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9U3WjN"&gt;The new Switch won’t support displaying 4K graphics when connected to a TV, despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/3/22312559/new-nintendo-switch-oled-screen-holiday-release-report"&gt;rumors that had suggested otherwise&lt;/a&gt;, and there &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22565118/nintendo-oled-switch-cpu-ram-bluetooth-audio-headphones-dock-no-4k"&gt;aren’t major changes to the CPU or RAM&lt;/a&gt;. But even though this OLED Switch is a lot like the old one, there’s still a lot to dig into about it. You can catch up on all of our coverage of the new console right here.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo never needed to fix the Switch; it’s not broken</title>
    <content type="html">

      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/u8JLbPQSvkpFY4vPh2h5Ck2Qft4=/125x0:1475x900/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69546873/NintendoSwitchOLEDmodel_02.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Nintendo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="88lBVH"&gt;Nintendo finally did it! There’s a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/6/22456337/nintendo-switch-oled-model-specs-date-price"&gt;new Nintendo Switch coming in October&lt;/a&gt;! Over a year of rumors have amounted to the Nintendo Switch OLED model, featuring a slightly larger OLED display, “improved audio,” a built-in ethernet port, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22328983"&gt;a better kickstand&lt;/a&gt;. All of that hype has brought us a device that’s a mere step or two above the product launched back in March 2017. It sort of reminds me of that half-decade where Apple seemed to be stuck with the same generation of Intel CPUs in its laptops. The incremental improvements are nice, but we were all kind of hoping for more (like an end to Joy-Con drift?). Only Nintendo has never needed to give us more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bxz0wa"&gt;I’ve spent the last year and a half using a Nintendo Switch Lite and rereading rumors about the “Switch Pro” that seemed to promise a fix for every single issue I and others had with the original product. I thought a lot about how cool it would be to play games on my TV in 4K or marvel at improved frame rates or just pair my Bluetooth headphones without using some kind of dongle. With the 4K HDR-capable PS5 and Xbox Series X tucked into my entertainment center, I’ve gotten used to familiar games being tweaked for the TVs actually made in 2021 and would like to experience &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; the same way I’m currently experiencing &lt;em&gt;Final Fantasy VII Remake&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AGXPBE"&gt;That’s not going to happen. The latest Switch will not incorporate HDR. It won’t do 4K or 120 frames per second, either. Instead, it will cap out at 1080p when attached to a TV, and its 7-inch OLED display will do just 720p. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22268805/motorola-moto-g-power-2021-review"&gt;A $200 smartphone&lt;/a&gt; has better pixel density than the incoming Switch. I could get a cheap Android phone, a controller, and a subscription to Stadia and have a higher-resolution experience on my TV than I could with the Nintendo Switch OLED model. But I won’t be doing that. I will be patiently waiting for preorders on the OLED Switch instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="e6lGqS"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Nintendo is a toy company first, a tech company a distant second&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="K1fnr5"&gt;Because as much as many of us wanted something that could compete with Sony and Microsoft and give us &lt;em&gt;Breath of the Wild&lt;/em&gt; in 4K, Nintendo doesn’t actually need to cater to us. Its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/6/22422451/nintendo-annual-earnings-switch-84-59-million"&gt;console sales were up&lt;/a&gt; 44 percent year over year in the first three months of 2021. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/7/20951926/nintendo-doug-bowser-interview-switch-lite-sales-3ds-support-consoles"&gt;It wants new owners&lt;/a&gt; — not necessarily to convert old ones. It can put out something with as minor upgrades as the Nintendo Switch OLED model, and we will buy it! Heck, it can have the audacity to actually officially call &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1412407485298790409"&gt;the thing the Nintendo Switch (OLED model)&lt;/a&gt;, and we will buy it! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1a2N8M"&gt;Nintendo makes really good games, and it produces truly innovative hardware. It’s a toy company first, a tech company a distant second. It’s never had to compete with Sony or Microsoft on specs, and historically, when it tried, it lost badly. Why get dragged into an arms race and take &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/3/22264242/playstation-5-sales-loss-manufacturing-costs-msrp-sony"&gt;massive losses on console sales&lt;/a&gt; when &lt;a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/79180/xboxes-arent-profitable-but-the-nintendo-switch-certainly-is/index.html"&gt;it’s already selling the Switch at a profit&lt;/a&gt; and will likely be able to sell the OLED Switch at an even higher profit?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="u0hA0E"&gt;While frame rate-counting nerds like myself have groaned about the Switch’s technological limitations versus the much more expensive (and harder-to-find and buy) PS5 and Xbox Series X, the vast majority of people don’t notice the occasional frame rate hiccup or care that &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-23/nintendo-to-use-new-nvidia-graphics-chip-in-2021-switch-upgrade"&gt;a new custom Tegra chip inside a Switch Pro could theoretically use Nvidia’s DLSS technology&lt;/a&gt; to improve graphics via machine learning. Losing out on these things won’t matter to them as much as having a better display or drift-free Joy-Con. (Nintendo has neither confirmed nor denied that.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="MP5xr5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Doing a mid-cycle processor refresh leads to a lot of confusion&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="lJYZEm"&gt;Honestly, losing out on these things doesn’t bother me as much as I thought it would, either. After the initial disappointment over the lack of 4K and a better CPU, I was excited! This new model really was addressing my biggest complaints and coming in at a price I could stomach. I primarily play the Switch in handheld mode, and my main issue with both it and the Switch Lite has been the extremely ugly 720p LCD. OLEDs typically have better color accuracy and contrast than an LCD. So an OLED, even one with as dinky a resolution as 720p, is going to likely be a major improvement. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="j0lrDU"&gt;And as we saw with the last generation of Sony and Microsoft hardware, doing a mid-cycle processor refresh &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/23/21335984/microsoft-xbox-series-x-exclusive-next-gen-promise"&gt;leads to a lot of confusion&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-xbox-one-x-is-the-perfect-console-for-lazy-pc-gamer-1820083982"&gt;blurs the line between console and PC gaming&lt;/a&gt;. The appeal of console gaming is you buy the console and the game, and things just work. You shouldn’t have to worry about patches to introduce all of the features on the box. Sony and Microsoft have tried, and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/5/10/15600272/sony-microsoft-playstation-4-pro-project-scorpio-nielsen-study"&gt;often bungled&lt;/a&gt;, to communicate the difference between all of their offerings. Nintendo has only been a little better. Remember the DS and DSi? &lt;a href="https://retrogamebuyer.com/nintendo-ds-vs-ds-lite-vs-dsi/"&gt;Nintendo had to make an entire chart&lt;/a&gt; to explain all of the differences. Or what about the 3DS and the New 3DS? &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/4/6/8353503/xenoblade-chronicles-3d-new-nintendo-3ds-review"&gt;Some games&lt;/a&gt; didn’t even work on the original 3DS!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RundS7"&gt;But there’s no need for charts or careful PR pushes to explain the difference this time. You can get a Switch for $299, a mobile-only Switch Lite for $199, or you can wait for a little while and get the illustratively named Switch (OLED model) for $349. The games should work. The display should be improved. The ethernet should be built in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EeJ1f6"&gt;Nintendo could have given us a mid-cycle refresh to compete with all of those powerful PC consoles by Sony and Microsoft. But instead, it went &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/13/21562549/nintendo-game-and-watch-super-mario-bros-next-gen-consoles"&gt;the Nintendo route&lt;/a&gt;. No confusion, no 4K, and my basic butt waiting to preorder anyway.&lt;/p&gt;
