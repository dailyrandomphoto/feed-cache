    <title>Why social networks need better blocking tools</title>
    <content type="html">

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;h2 id="MRscL3"&gt;I.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="DOTSMN"&gt;Blocking is having a moment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ingr8K"&gt;Last month, Tracy Chou &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/block-party-launch/"&gt;announced that she had raised a little under $1.5 million&lt;/a&gt; to launch &lt;a href="https://www.blockpartyapp.com/"&gt;Block Party&lt;/a&gt;, an anti-harassment startup that helps people filter abuse out of their social media experiences. On Monday, &lt;a href="https://www.blocknyt.com/"&gt;Block the &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a tool to block 800 &lt;em&gt;Times&lt;/em&gt; reporters on Twitter at once, materialized via a satirical website.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tzyA3p"&gt;Meanwhile, the unique blocking mechanics of the audio social network Clubhouse — and their enthusiastic use by the platform’s lead investors — have &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Jessicalessin/status/1356091226093588482"&gt;raised questions&lt;/a&gt; about whether people in positions of power should be blocking to avoid public scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0rKJKu"&gt;Behind all these stories, I think, is a kind of despair over what public social networks have done to public debate. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bonerwizard/status/1358923285480628230?s=21"&gt;Context collapse&lt;/a&gt; — the disorientation that comes from addressing infinite audiences online, each with their own norms and expectations for others’ behavior — is driving more and more conversation away from the public square. And while platforms have gradually begun paying more attention to safety issues, trolling and harassment remains a fact of life for too many people who use social networks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LZlnIo"&gt;Viewed in that light, aggressive use of the block button makes all the sense in the world. By shrinking the size of your audience, even if only one person at a time, you can gradually rebuild context around the audience to whom you are speaking. And when trolls and abusers rear their heads, the block button remains an effective tool we have for preventing them from harassing us in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6W67Wk"&gt;When it comes to Twitter — or to Facebook, or Instagram, or Snapchat — blocking is relatively uncontroversial. And Twitter has added features in recent years that offer users ways to fight context collapse without requiring you to, for example, block 800 reporters. Maybe you want to limit replies to people you follow. Or maybe you don’t want anyone to be able to reply at all. Tools like these remove what my friend Hunter Walk calls the “paper cuts” a product can inflict on a user: small, unpleasant interactions that erode your affection for a tool over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06RxBl"&gt;Clubhouse is a new kind of social network, though, and &lt;a href="https://www.notion.so/Community-Guidelines-461a6860abda41649e17c34dc1dd4b5f"&gt;its approach to blocking&lt;/a&gt; has drawn some scrutiny. What sets it apart is that audience members can effectively prevent other people from joining the audience for public discussions, if at any point that audience member is made a speaker or moderator of the chat. (It’s common for small Clubhouse chats to invite everyone to become a speaker as soon as they enter the room.) If I’m listening to an interesting conversation and raise my hand to speak, and I ask a question, anyone I block will henceforth be unable to enter the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JaLX92"&gt;This phenomenon was most visible during &lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/p/clubhouses-moment-arrives"&gt;Elon Musk’s January 31st appearance on the app&lt;/a&gt;. While the show he appeared on was created by its hosts, Sriram Krishnan and Aarthi Ramamurthy, Andreessen Horowitz co-founder Marc Andreessen was made a speaker — and, as a result, many journalists found themselves shut out of the room. For reasons he has never really explained, Andreessen &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/clubhouse-investor-marc-andreessen-blocking-journalists-2021-2"&gt;has blocked most of the press corps on Twitter&lt;/a&gt; and now on Clubhouse, myself included.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5EdAL5"&gt;“It is one thing to block people from sending you messages,”&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Jessicalessin/status/1356092980122148865"&gt; tweeted Jessica Lessin&lt;/a&gt;, founder of &lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;, in a short thread about the issue, “but listening to public conversations?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="oukQ1W"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;II.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="sBWKew"&gt;As someone who &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/a/verge-2021/marc-andreessen-horowitz-verge-interview"&gt;has interviewed Andreessen before&lt;/a&gt;, and really enjoyed it, I feel this pain acutely. I’d like to know what he’s tweeting about and saying in Clubhouse rooms. And I’d also probably like to listen in on some future Clubhouse conversations where he gets called on to be a speaker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Ciywto"&gt;At the same time, an important aspect of blocking is that the person you block doesn’t get a say in it. If you’ve ever blocked someone yourself, you probably wouldn’t want them to. I wish Andreessen hadn’t blocked me, but I also don’t think I’m entitled to an explanation. Maybe not seeing my dumb tweets has improved his experience of Twitter. That’s fine!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Yu41cR"&gt;I thought of this over the weekend when my friend Taylor Lorenz and other journalists entered a Clubhouse room in which the Andreessen Horowitz founders were discussing r/WallStreetBets, of the recent GameStop stock mania. Some members of that forum refer to themselves using an offensive word, which Horowitz repeated in a question to a guest (“take us through the r***** revolution”). Some people wrongly thought Andreessen had used the word; breakout rooms began to appear in Clubhouse to criticize him over it. Journalists tweeted about it, confusing Andreessen with Horowitz. Tweets were deleted; Lorenz apologized.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NtH0hE"&gt;The whole incident, to me, makes the case for blocking. In offline life, when we worry that our public comments might be misconstrued, we limit the audience for those comments. In online life, when our potential audience is exponentially larger, it makes sense that we would want to limit that audience with extra care.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X1KI57"&gt;It also makes sense not to use offensive words when addressing an audience of thousands in a business context. But context collapse means that once you’re above a certain number of followers, there will always be an audience coming after you about &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nuuzK5"&gt;Ultimately, I think we should support strong blocking tools for the same reason we should support strong encryption: the more that we live our lives online, the more important that private spaces become. And yes, there are trade-offs: the internet makes it easier for bad actors to come together in private spaces, and platforms should take steps to mitigate the harms that they can cause. But a healthy democracy requires both public and private conversations, and platforms ought to facilitate the best of both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="mKq8ag"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;III.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p id="Zc635d"&gt;Okay, sure. But isn’t there something &lt;em&gt;unseemly&lt;/em&gt; about the rich and powerful building private spaces only to exclude journalists from scrutinizing them? I sympathize with Lessin on this point, particularly during a time when the media has been under assault from all quarters. (Andreessen Horowitz’s decision to shun the media extends far beyond social networks, &lt;a href="https://www.newcomer.co/p/the-unauthorized-story-of-andreessen"&gt;as Eric Newcomer recently reported&lt;/a&gt;.) Some of the recent fervor in Silicon Valley to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1264361513990582273?lang=en"&gt;go “direct”&lt;/a&gt; — which is to say, &lt;em&gt;around&lt;/em&gt; the media — has a Trumpist cast to it: &lt;em&gt;reporters are the enemy of the people, and talking to them is beneath us&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="g7cTQ9"&gt;Moreover, if several people you follow on Clubhouse have blocked an account, that profile will display a badge when you visit to warn you. While this likely has some safety benefits, Lorenz told me that it can also be abused by people who mass-block accounts of good citizens on the app just to exclude them from popular conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="astZwU"&gt;All this makes me wonder whether Clubhouse could refine its blocking tools over time to enable private conversations while also being more inclusive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="010SEZ"&gt;I asked Block Party’s Tracy Chou. She reminded me that blocking means something different on every platform, giving each company a chance to reimagine how it might be most effective for its users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="06I0tx"&gt;“On Twitter, blocking someone means they can’t follow you, they can’t see your profile when they’re logged in, and it tells them that they’re blocked, they can’t respond to your tweets and have their replies show up,” Chou told me over direct message. “But there’s no actual reason that those all &lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; to be properties of blocking someone. Clubhouse has designed blocking in a specific way with a different set of permissions and consequences. Just because Twitter block and Clubhouse block are both called ‘block’ doesn’t mean they’re the same at all.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2b8tBj"&gt;If it wanted to, Chou said, Clubhouse could develop other constructs beyond blocking and muting to offer users more fine-grained control. I’d like to see the app consider a “broadcast” mode that eliminated caps on how many people could attend — no more spillover rooms when an Elon Musk or Mark Zuckerberg shows up to chat. Perhaps such a mode could allow everyone to listen, unless the original moderators of the chat (and not someone who was later invited to speak) had blocked them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z9MAoa"&gt;When any new social network becomes popular, reporters will scrutinize how powerful people are using it. That scrutiny is necessary and good. But privacy is necessary and good, too. Blocking is a blunt tool to achieve that end, but it can be refined over time — complemented with tools that achieve similar ends with more inclusive means.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VexeTj"&gt;That could introduce complexity for both developers and for users. But then again, as Chou told me, “the users with the most need will probably try to figure it out.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="HJw29d"&gt;
&lt;p id="jpbv8e"&gt;&lt;em&gt;This column was co-published with &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.platformer.news/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Platformer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, a daily newsletter about Big Tech and democracy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury is the best of Mario in one package</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CSXpwrkwC3Bx5xaRsfvSOCWDbNc=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68797507/Switch_SM3DWBowsersFury_screenshot_28_copy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="7hTsRh"&gt;Ever since the open green fields of &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 64&lt;/em&gt;, Nintendo has experimented with the best way to transport Mario into three dimensions. From the bite-sized planetoids of &lt;em&gt;Galaxy&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/26/16552118/super-mario-odyssey-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;hakoniwa&lt;/em&gt;-inspired worlds of &lt;em&gt;Odyssey&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;,&lt;/em&gt; the Kyoto game maker has never settled on just one formula. Mario’s side-scrolling adventures largely all worked the same, but in 3D, players never knew what to expect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="todHHn"&gt;That’s part of what made &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/11/22/5133098/super-mario-3d-world-review"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; so beloved when it launched on the Wii U in 2013. It took the familiar level-based gameplay of classic two-dimensional &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt; games and fused it with the more expansive 3D gameplay, building off of the portable-only &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D Land&lt;/em&gt;. Plus, it let Mario dress up as an adorable cat for the first time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IXvRSi"&gt;Inevitably, the game is now launching on the Switch. But this week’s rerelease of &lt;em&gt;3D World&lt;/em&gt; is more than just a simple port. The base game remains identical to the original, but Nintendo has packaged it with a brand-new, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22250703/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-nintendo-switch-hands-on-preview"&gt;expansion pack-like adventure called &lt;em&gt;Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. It takes many of the same ideas as &lt;em&gt;3D World&lt;/em&gt; but puts them in a new kind of open world, one filled with constant danger thanks to a kaiju-sized Bowser roaming around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="D4iJ2W"&gt;Put these in the same collection and you end up with the best of both worlds.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/jXp9ZGvhQHLs9hhTv246Mrd8c60=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22293016/Switch_SM3DWBowsersFury_screenshot_21_copy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="ZxjAUv"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D World&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="m0BYOd"&gt;When &lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D World&lt;/em&gt; first launched it was something of a contradiction: it was both a departure &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; a return to the series’ roots. While it’s a 3D game, it doesn’t take place in one large world. Instead, the experience consists of a series of discrete, smaller levels that you access from an overworld map, much like if you were playing &lt;em&gt;Super Mario World&lt;/em&gt; on the SNES.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="40UPNb"&gt;The game strikes a nearly perfect balance between structure and creativity. While it’s full of short levels with a distinct beginning and end, it plays around with the formula with so many interesting ideas, whether that’s stages where you have to track shadows across the walls or chase down Bowser in a fireball-spewing convertible. &lt;em&gt;3D World&lt;/em&gt; also introduced several important ideas to the series. Perhaps the most notable are the cat suit, which lets Mario scamper up walls and slice at goombas with his claws, and the puzzle-oriented side missions starring Captain Toad. (The former even spawned its own spinoff which, like &lt;em&gt;3D World&lt;/em&gt;, eventually made the transition from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/12/1/7303799/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-review"&gt;Wii U&lt;/a&gt; to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/13/17568040/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-nintendo-switch-review"&gt;Switch&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="il64aY"&gt;This was all true eight years ago, and the game remains a delight today. It doesn’t exactly look like a modern game, but the bright, colorful visuals hold up well. More importantly, even with all of the &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt; titles that have come since, &lt;em&gt;3D World&lt;/em&gt;’s particular blending of styles remains distinct. It’s still fun to revisit, but this is also a great opportunity for those who missed out the first time around. (And given the Wii U’s relative failure, that’s probably a large amount of people.) Of course, &lt;em&gt;3D World&lt;/em&gt; also benefits from the shift to the Switch, as its small levels are ideal for playing on the go. The only drawback is the touch controls, which made more sense when you had a clunky Wii U tablet in your hands but can be awkward when playing on the Switch in TV mode where touch is replaced by an on-screen cursor.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sZKYwr"&gt;Essentially, this is an ideal port of one of the best &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt; games to date...&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DRvASMloA4Z-11xgldlzaxjYh44=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22293035/Switch_SM3DWBowsersFury_screenshot_07_copy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;h3 id="2mNRwf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p id="CmcDd4"&gt;...but it’s also a lot more. The other half of the equation, &lt;em&gt;Bowser’s Fury,&lt;/em&gt; is a standalone experience, one you can choose to play right away from the main menu. Mechanically, it’s nearly identical to &lt;em&gt;3D World&lt;/em&gt;. You can still dress up like a kitty and zip around in transparent tubes, though it adds 360-degree camera control, giving it a much more modern feel. Outside of that, there are two main elements that make this expansion interesting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ogqATk"&gt;The first is its structure. &lt;em&gt;Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt; takes place in a large archipelago, with no discrete worlds or levels, just a whole bunch of small islands. The goal, as always, is to collect bright shiny coins, which in turn open up new areas for exploration. Essentially, the whole island chain is one big series of challenges, and it’s your job to find and complete them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OGhUWN"&gt;There’s a huge range of things to do: fight bosses, chase down bunnies, race on the back of a sea creature, climb giant towers, navigate treacherous stretches of molten lava, and a lot more. In true &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt; fashion, some of these tasks are fairly simple, while others — particularly toward the end of the game — are deviously hard challenges with tight time limits. Suffice to say, getting every coin will take some work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7FlWF8"&gt;What makes this structure work particularly well is Bowser himself. The game’s story involves you teaming up with Bowser Jr. — who floats alongside you and can help fight enemies or point out areas of interest — to help restore his dad, who has been blown up to Godzilla-like proportions. His newfound size and powers manifest in two ways. To start, he’s constantly lurking in the background, and every so often he’ll emerge and attack. You’ll know it’s coming: first there’s a bit of wind and rain, and then the whole world turns dark.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uWyYIT"&gt;It’s almost like a twist on the light and dark worlds in a &lt;em&gt;Zelda&lt;/em&gt; game. When Bowser is in Godzilla attack mode, flaming balls rain down and he spews a stream of fire at you. This makes things more dangerous, but it also has its benefits: some areas can only be accessed if Bowser’s flames destroy bricks blocking the way. You have to think strategically during these moments, instead of just staying in survival mode. It gives you a chance to see familiar spaces in a different way.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VQSaDNGhQXTL0cxgP-yJqUI3ju0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22293279/Switch_SM3DWBowsersFury_screenshot_02_copy.jpg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Jszwx6"&gt;And then there are the gigantic boss battles. Normally, you can’t actually attack Bowser. But when you collect enough coins, you’ll unlock the temple, where you can use a massive bell to turn into a giant cat Mario, one that’s able to go toe-to-toe with Bowser. This happens periodically throughout the game — it takes more than a few tries to finally take down Mario’s nemesis — and the battles are thrilling. Each time you take on Bowser he has new abilities and patterns, and just seeing the scale and destruction of these battles is unlike anything I’ve experienced in a &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt; game before. It also gives you something tangible to work toward: you aren’t just collecting coins to get them all, you’re also trying for another shot at Bowser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UfBEfw"&gt;There are two other important things to note about &lt;em&gt;Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt;. One, it’s not a full-scale &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt; game. While it’s a meaty adventure with lots to do and unlock, it’s probably about one-third the size of comparable games in the series. The other thing to note is that, despite its dark themes, &lt;em&gt;Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt; is achingly adorable. The islands you explore appear to have been rendered by the world’s biggest cat fan. Seriously, everything in the game, from the bushes to the goombas to the lighthouses to the pigeons, is cat-themed. At one point, while I was wearing the cat suit, an entire gang of rainbow-hued cats started following me, and when I stopped running away it turned into an impromptu cuddle party.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="MhMqVk"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bowser’s Fury&lt;/em&gt; is essentially a remix of &lt;em&gt;3D World&lt;/em&gt;, one that takes the same basic themes and mechanics but turns them into something that feels both new and familiar at the same time. Really, this package is indicative of 3D &lt;em&gt;Super Mario&lt;/em&gt; games as a whole: it’s a series where you never quite know what to expect with each new release. Sometimes that means a whole new structure or gameplay twist. Other times it means towering monsters and lots of cute cats.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CEj1pY"&gt;&lt;small&gt;Super Mario 3D World + Bowser’s Fury &lt;/small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;launches on February 12th on the Nintendo Switch.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook will test cutting back on political posts in the News Feed</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Q5-kF_sYuPPj6Y-QzPPrBloO1hE=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68797499/acastro_180720_1777_facebook_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="IjfAhA"&gt;Facebook plans to test how people respond to seeing fewer posts about politics in the News Feed. Starting this week, Facebook will “temporarily reduce” political posts for a “small percentage” of people in Canada, Brazil, and Indonesia, with a test in the US following some weeks later. The tests will continue for the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="4c9mTl"&gt;The experiment comes in response to feedback Facebook has (somehow just now) heard that “people don’t want political content to take over their News Feed,” Aastha Gupta, product management director at Facebook, wrote &lt;a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/02/reducing-political-content-in-news-feed/"&gt;in a blog post&lt;/a&gt; this morning. The goal is to improve the News Feed by “finding a new balance of the content people want to see.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="ah6rzM"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Users “don’t want politics and fighting to take over their experience on our services.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="5aVqcW"&gt;Gupta says that political content only makes up about 6 percent of the typical News Feed right now in the US. Nonetheless, that small percentage has clearly had an oversized impact, prompting years of discussions around the polarizing effects of people being served up too-often misleading political stories. Facebook has widely been blamed for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/interface/2020/5/28/21272001/facebook-polarization-wall-street-journal-guy-rosen-platform-integrity-twitter-trump"&gt;stoking polarization&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/14/opinion/facebook-far-right.html"&gt;boosting far-right voices&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z0x1hJ"&gt;In October, Facebook said it would temporarily stop recommending civic and political groups to users in the US, and &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-groups/facebook-says-it-will-permanently-stop-recommending-political-groups-to-users-idUSKBN29X00C"&gt;last month&lt;/a&gt; it said that change would become permanent. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on &lt;a href="https://s21.q4cdn.com/399680738/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/FB-Q4-2020-Conference-Call-Transcript.pdf"&gt;a call&lt;/a&gt; with investors that the goal was to “turn down the temperature and discourage divisive conversations and communities.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="szJWYp"&gt;The tests around reducing political content overall are part of the same initiative. Zuckerberg said Facebook wants to allow political discussions and grassroots organizing to keep happening, but that users “don’t want politics and fighting to take over their experience on our services.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o7XRx3"&gt;Facebook says health agencies and information on COVID-19 from authoritative groups like the WHO will be exempt from the reduced political distribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7bIjyw"&gt;The tests come after years of frustrations, from pretty much all directions, around how Facebook handles political content. Facebook shut down an internal effort in 2018 to make its site less divisive, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-knows-it-encourages-division-top-executives-nixed-solutions-11590507499?mod=hp_lead_pos5"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal &lt;/em&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; last year. At the same time, Facebook was making choices of its own that seemed to up the divisiveness. In 2017, the company pulled back on reductions to political content distribution would have had an outsized impact on right-wing sides, and instead put forward changes that more significantly limited the reach of left-wing sites, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-mark-zuckerberg-learned-politics-11602853200"&gt;the &lt;em&gt;Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; also reported.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Ikea’s huge new gamer gear lineup includes this weird wooden desk hand  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bqKN6iVLBACMpmbJVlTJW07sQfM=/0x0:2400x1600/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68797245/gaming_hand_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Relax, Ikea’s wooden gamer hand is here to take care of your gaming gear.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: Ikea&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="z4u7T2"&gt;In an ideal world, we’d always keep a hand free to protect our precious gaming gear. But for those times when you’re busy, Ikea has released a ¥129.00 (around $20) &lt;a href="https://www.ikea.cn/cn/en/p/lanespelare-accessories-stand-00504067/"&gt;wooden hand&lt;/a&gt; to act as a caretaker — one of dozens of new gaming products just launched in China. As Ikea explains it, the &lt;a href="https://www.ikea.cn/cn/en/p/lanespelare-accessories-stand-00504067/"&gt;Lånespelare accessories stand&lt;/a&gt; (or the Gaming Hand, as we’ll be calling it) “takes care of cables, headsets and other gadgets that you want tidied away, yet still have within reach.” Sounds, uh, &lt;em&gt;handy&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="M3iaVo"&gt;Ikea’s Gaming Hand is part of the company’s recently announced &lt;a href="https://newsroom.inter.ikea.com/news/furniture-that-puts-gaming-first/s/271f0dc7-c22e-4f99-a88a-e397efeb9952"&gt;lineup of gaming furniture and accessories&lt;/a&gt;, which it says was developed in collaboration with Asus’s Republic of Gamers (ROG) brand. There are over 30 products in the range, which include everything from gaming chairs and desks, to mouse mats and a ring light.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tLXMpCZzzS4mHVfEsFfWhgZ6Qb0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22294268/578723.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Behold, gamer drawers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hmlE4RA7Z3nrCCKxLpmjkK8y_3s=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22294269/578709.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gamer chair.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0QJf1iry1Ok2iAdh8cUPh-AvLa4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22294305/lanespelare_neck_pillow__1000503_PE824289_S5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A neck pillow...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WQY8je1k3jMDOP0z3reV2y5Ijsw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22294304/lanespelare_neck_pillow__0984937_PE816455_S5.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;... which doubles as a chair headrest.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="CeVoVP"&gt;The lineup is organized across six product families: Huvudspelare, Utespelare, Matchspel, Gruppspel, Uppspel, and Lånespelare. The &lt;a href="https://www.ikea.cn/cn/en/search/products?q=HUVUDSPELARE"&gt;Huvudspelare &lt;/a&gt;family includes a ¥299.00 (around $46) gaming chair and ¥219.00 (around $34) gaming desk. &lt;a href="https://www.ikea.cn/cn/en/search/products?q=UTESPELARE"&gt;Utespelare &lt;/a&gt;and &lt;a href="https://www.ikea.cn/cn/en/search/products?q=MATCHSPEL"&gt;Matchspel &lt;/a&gt;both also include gaming chairs, but they’re more expensive at ¥699.00 (around $108) and ¥999.00 (around $155) respectively. Meanwhile &lt;a href="https://www.ikea.cn/cn/en/search/products?q=uppspel"&gt;Uppspel &lt;/a&gt;is the product family you want if you’re after a ¥198.00 (around $31) gaming pegboard for organizing all your gaming gear, or a ¥599.00 (around $93) gaming drawer unit. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UGwMJZ"&gt;Finally there’s &lt;a href="https://www.ikea.cn/cn/en/search/products/?q=%20L%C3%85NESPELARE"&gt;Lånespelare&lt;/a&gt;, which includes a variety of accessories like a ¥249.00 (around $39) ring light, and ¥99.00 (around $15) mouse bungee, and even a mug-holder that attaches to the side of your desk. And who could forget this charming “&lt;a href="https://www.ikea.cn/cn/en/p/lanespelare-multi-functional-60504069/"&gt;multi-functional cushion/blanket&lt;/a&gt;” which Ikea says offers everything from “lumbar support” to “a blanket over your shoulders.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="c-image-grid"&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/C2i4DLug0JErnzu9wt20SwkasPs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22294267/578726.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f9jyEXouYb1pJE3rvopiYNJZHXE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22294266/578743.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The ring light comes with a smartphone holder.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="c-image-grid__item"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9KwyTgJWoK6iUeWWM8OCy052xn4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22294284/gaming_hand_with_headphones.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Ikea&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;While the wooden hand is designed to keep your accessories tidy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GVVJ4W"&gt;The nice thing about the new lineup isn’t just the traditional Ikea affordable pricing, it’s that everything is free from the loud branding and RGB lighting that often accompanies “gamer” accessories and furniture. Ikea’s global business leader of workspace, Ewa Rychert, says that’s part of the point of the new lineup.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="s2dWJW"&gt;”The needs of billions of gamers around the globe are very diverse, whereas the existing offer is rather technical and often perceived as masculine design-wise, despite around 46 percent of gamers being female,” Rychert says. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yk1J68"&gt;Ikea’s new gaming lineup is available in China now. It’ll launch in Japan in May, and come to the rest of the world in October.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple reportedly developing next-gen ultra-thin displays for AR devices with TSMC</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NZJmv9uXH2gC3noDKVsG1-RZSvw=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68796964/acastro_180604_1777_apple_wwdc_0004.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="SvqIbn"&gt;Apple is working with TSMC to develop ultra-thin and energy-efficient micro OLED displays for its upcoming augmented reality devices, &lt;a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-partners-with-TSMC-to-develop-ultra-advanced-displays"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nikkei Asia &lt;/em&gt;is reporting&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;. &lt;/em&gt;The R&amp;amp;D project is said to be in a trial production stage, focusing on displays that are smaller than one inch in size and “several years” away from commercialization. Apple is also said to be developing MicroLED displays at the same Apple lab in Taiwan.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IUNHVf"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;, the micro OLED displays in development are able to be so thin and compact because they’re built directly onto chip wafers, rather than glass like traditional OLED or LCD screens. News of the project &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/21/22242131/apple-vr-headset-2022-fabric-design-fan-price-details-rumors"&gt;follows reports&lt;/a&gt; that Apple has both VR and AR headsets in development. It could release its first VR headset (codenamed N301) as early as next year, while a more lightweight pair of AR glasses (codenamed N421) could follow in 2023. N301 reportedly features &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266190/apple-vr-headset-ar-glasses-8k-displays-cameras-hand-tracking-details-report"&gt;two 8K displays&lt;/a&gt; and a fabric exterior to cut down on its weight, while future headsets could eventually use this new panel technology to become slimmer and lighter.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/rEEyykaSpa2_RPdULlxgpgJj3aM=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22280992/3b786602_c662_4696_b68c_21f89e4a4e95.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/new-apple-mixed-reality-headset-details-swappable-headbands-eye-tracking" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Information&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;A mockup showing what Apple’s VR headset could look like.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oz6fxM"&gt;As well as working on micro OLED, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; reports that Apple is also working on MicroLED display technology at the same secretive lab in Taiwan. These self-emissive panels, which use miniature LEDs to remove the need for a traditional backlight, could eventually end up in devices like the Apple Watch, iPad, and MacBooks. Samsung already sells a &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2018/1/7/16861790/samsung-the-wall-microled-modular-tv-announced-ces-2018"&gt;MicroLED TV called The Wall&lt;/a&gt;, though the technology is a long way from being mainstream or affordable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="K4gndZ"&gt;As a sidenote: micro OLED and MicroLED are distinct from Mini-LED, which uses an array of LEDs as a backlight behind a more traditional LCD display. Mini-LED technology is already available in TVs from the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21363318/tcl-2020-5-6-series-4k-tvs-qled-mini-led-backlighting-gaming-ps5-xbox-series-x"&gt;likes of TCL&lt;/a&gt;, and Apple is also reportedly working to bring it to devices like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/23/21452182/ipad-pro-mini-led-display-oled-contrast-burn-in-screen-technology"&gt;iPads&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/3/21163328/apple-macbook-pro-14-inch-imac-ipad-pro-mini-led-ming-chi-kuo"&gt;MacBooks&lt;/a&gt; in the not-too-distant future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EbqklM"&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt;, Apple’s R&amp;amp;D efforts are an attempt to reduce its reliance on other companies, like Samsung, to supply its displays. The iPhone 12’s OLED display is thought to be its second most expensive third-party component behind its Qualcomm 5G modem, for example. While Apple may end up using these technologies in its products, it could also just use its work to acquire technology patents, giving it more control over these next-gen technologies, &lt;em&gt;Nikkei&lt;/em&gt; notes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tX0EC3"&gt;Apple isn’t the only company working to develop these display technologies. Sony Semiconductor Solutions has developed micro OLED displays for AR and VR headsets, while a partnership of BOE, Yunnan North OLiGHTEK Opto-Electronic Technology, and Kopin are also working together on the tech. Meanwhile, Samusung, BOE, and San’an Optoelectronics are also working to commercialize MicroLED displays. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nintendo’s latest Switch Online SNES games are some seriously deep cuts</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Fr3CvUGvgS6QYCPr7AmRBAaejIA=/0x0:1620x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68796344/Psycho_Dream.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="O3RA4q"&gt;Nintendo has &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210209006220/en/Nintendo-News-Nintendo-Switch-Online-Conjures-Four-More-Action-Filled-Adventures/"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; the next SNES and NES games coming to its Switch Online service. Depending on your perspective, the selection shines a light on some underappreciated gems or demonstrates that you probably shouldn’t expect any more big-name third-party titles to appear in the library. Possibly both.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ixi7tM"&gt;Here’s the list of games:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li id="IW7HLe"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Psycho Dream&lt;/em&gt; (1992, SNES, Telenet Japan)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="g37jmf"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Doomsday Warrior &lt;/em&gt;(1992, SNES, Laser Soft)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="9sm7K7"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Prehistorik Man&lt;/em&gt; (1995, SNES, Titus France)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li id="QaV76M"&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Fire ‘n Ice &lt;/em&gt;(1992, NES, Tecmo)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p id="Ri9PCj"&gt;Not exactly big hitters, then: three fairly obscure SNES side-scrollers and an NES puzzle game. &lt;em&gt;Fire ‘n Ice &lt;/em&gt;might be the most recognizable title for many, and only then if you know that it’s the North American name for &lt;em&gt;Solomon’s Key 2&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LIGcfh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Psycho Dream &lt;/em&gt;is a pretty neat addition. It’s a visually impressive action game that was originally meant to be released in the US as &lt;em&gt;Dream Probe, &lt;/em&gt;but for whatever reason the plans fell through and it remained exclusive to Japan. And look at this synopsis:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="wsdfBY"&gt;When Sayaka doesn’t return to reality after entering an immersive virtual world known as a D-Movie, the protagonists, Ryo and Maria, must progress through a terrifying fantasy game called &lt;em&gt;Legend of the Fallen Capital&lt;/em&gt; to rescue her and bring her back to reality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="j5oXmE"&gt;Nintendo has been adding deep cuts to Switch Online for a while now, but the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/7/21316848/donkey-kong-country-switch-online-july-release-date"&gt;last&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21439181/donkey-kong-country-2-nintendo-switch-online-september-games"&gt;three&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/15/22175802/donkey-kong-country-3-nintendo-switch-online-release-date"&gt;rounds&lt;/a&gt; of additions at least included each game in the &lt;em&gt;Donkey Kong Country&lt;/em&gt; trilogy as crowd-pleasers. Personally I like checking out whichever titles unexpectedly show up, but it does seem clear that Nintendo is running out of games that either it owns the rights to or can convince other publishers to include.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HyGQG1"&gt;It might be a good time to start wondering about when other platforms might make their way onto Nintendo Switch Online. Perhaps the delisting of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21438499/super-mario-3d-all-stars-review-nintendo-switch"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Super Mario 3D All-Stars&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; next month could pave the way for Nintendo 64 games at some point. In the meantime, you can check out the latest additions on February 17th if you have a $19.99-a-year Switch Online subscription. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Maps is getting Google and Waze-like accident reporting</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/HtWNC0gQEMm5GcFvR6PL5Xjx2WE=/0x1206:1125x1956/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68796027/IMG_0765.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new reporting interface in Apple Maps.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="q30Uux"&gt;Apple is bringing accident, hazard, and speed check reporting to Apple Maps. The feature is currently only available to users with the iOS 14.5 beta, and is similar to user-reporting features found in Waze and Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gYYTge"&gt;When you’re using the feature, you (or preferably a passenger) can press a new Report button in the bottom tray, and select what type of incident or hazard you’re reporting. You can even do this using Siri: I was also able to say “there’s a speed trap here” or “there’s something on the road.” &lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; shows that &lt;a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/02/09/ios-14-5-apple-maps-crowdsourcing-accidents/"&gt;the interface is available on the CarPlay version of Maps&lt;/a&gt;, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NvL3Zc--eEWePqU07HjNzOa9tIU=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22293645/IMG_0762.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Apple Maps will give you a confirmation that your report has been submitted.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="aCK9Rw"&gt;This user-centric reporting feature is now something that all the major maps app either have, or have in development. While this feature was popularized with Waze, it’s been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/5/18297146/google-maps-incident-reporting-traffic-slowdowns-waze-new-feature-android"&gt;available in Google Maps since April of 2019&lt;/a&gt;, so Apple is playing catch-up here (like it’s also trying to do by &lt;a href="https://9to5mac.com/2020/08/26/apple-maps-reviews-inhouse/"&gt;adding user-generated photos and reviews to Maps&lt;/a&gt;). It is worth noting, though, that Apple’s version has way fewer options as of today — Google’s, shown below, is much more in-depth.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/LfGclGgagmAjS1sjUksREdVZQjs=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22293639/IMG_0764.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Google’s report interface has more options for hazard/incident types.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="Ao9Y7k"&gt;There is one strange thing to point out with Apple’s version, and it has nothing to do with the fact that the feature is in beta. You may have noticed in the Google Maps screenshot that Apple’s and Google’s icons for accidents and speed traps look &lt;em&gt;very &lt;/em&gt;similar. Here are Apple’s again for comparison:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DvjGNqgsx9ASjjnzPAyqPZsNdgw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22293643/IMG_0761.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Screenshot: &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;These are Apple’s icons. See the similarities?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

    <title>Apple will replace these MacBook Pro batteries for free if they don’t charge past one percent</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="macbook pro 2016" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/WYJ6M8zb7G-HS7NcdAjrOQH9BF4=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68795963/vpavic_161031_1256_0264.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1Gf2uC"&gt;Apple has launched &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT212163"&gt;a new, free battery replacement program&lt;/a&gt; for 2016 and 2017 MacBook Pros that won’t charge past one percent. The issue affects “a very small number of customers,” according to Apple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ubATdu"&gt;If your battery is affected, you’ll see a “Service Recommended” message when checking the battery health status. “If the status indicates that your battery is Normal, your battery is not affected by this issue,” Apple says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="nYZEOP"&gt;To get the battery replacement started, &lt;a href="https://getsupport.apple.com/?caller=kbase&amp;amp;PFC=PFC1002&amp;amp;category_id=SC0999&amp;amp;symptom_id=21085"&gt;contact Apple support&lt;/a&gt;. The company will examine your Mac prior to servicing it to “verify that it is eligible for the free battery replacement,” Apple says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6FwcV1"&gt;Earlier on Tuesday, Apple released &lt;a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211896"&gt;macOS Big Sur 11.2.1&lt;/a&gt;, which is also intended to help fix charging issues with some 2016 and 2017 MacBook Pros. Apple recommends updating your computer to that or the macOS Catalina 10.15.7 supplemental update. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66I8GP"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Satechi’s new tiny double-sided wireless charger can top up your Apple Watch or AirPods</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/3I9VG6bzyFFftIUQ3vvIaABic8I=/0x807:2500x2474/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68795913/2021_02_09_IMG3_rev1009.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: Satechi&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="tFqHHt"&gt;Satechi has launched a double-sided charger that can wirelessly charge an Apple Watch or AirPods — but not both at once — while hopefully saving you from the added clutter of extra cables. The Satechi USB-C Watch AirPods Charger features a Qi charging pad shaped like an AirPods Pro charging case on one side, and a charging “puck” for an Apple Watch on the other. The charger is available now, &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FHP862ZM%2FA%2Fsatechi-usb-c-watch-airpods-charger%3Ffnode%3D6f80832709d8a1d4e23e62afc26e6bd967efaf3d026095ef053ef6420d01ba33e0519f86e06da9aae95ef04cdf8b699eb8cff6341b085f4e575fb9594093b692592d28f0091b18020b14c4e610d9eff984ab0c7d7d461aa297c93d0f5530363c70c9b854cdecbca8c4c8def9a47e39bf&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fcircuitbreaker%2F2021%2F2%2F9%2F22275296%2Fsatechi-double-sided-wireless-charger-apple-watch-airpods#donotlink" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;exclusively from Apple for $49.95&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="qYvOCn"&gt;Satechi’s new charger has an aluminum build, white finish, and a small charging indicator light that fits right in with Apple’s minimalist product design. Because of the reversible nature of USB-C, switching between Apple Watch and AirPods charging only requires pulling the charger out, flipping it over, and plugging it back in. It can’t charge both your Watch and AirPods at the same time like some other charging stands or pads, but hopefully the compact size is worth the cost of that added convenience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="UqgCCW"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1-McZg5c9xI?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="NVPC2W"&gt;Having a charger jutting out of your laptop or tablet of course has its own risks — I’d definitely worry about situations where it might snap off. Then again, Apple’s guilty of designing its own ridiculous charging set-ups, like it did with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/9/9295901/apple-ipad-stylus-pen-announced-price-specs-date"&gt;the original Apple Pencil&lt;/a&gt;. Satechi’s not that extreme, and it definitely seems convenient.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;

      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Satechi&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Satechi’s wireless charger can also be plugged into a wall outlet with an adapter.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="N0XWU9"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter’s Jack Dorsey wants to build an app store for social media algorithms</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hiJ9cdau4lD_sBRsmte2Pz0DaH8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68795784/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="vVEbFg"&gt;Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey imagines a future where you get to choose what you see on social media by picking out your favorite recommendation algorithm, rather than relying on a single controlling company to get it exactly right.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1xjsns"&gt;On a call with investors today, Dorsey expanded on his vision of how a decentralized social network might work — and why &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21010856/twitter-jack-dorsey-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-research-moderation"&gt;Twitter would want to create a network&lt;/a&gt; that’s beyond the control of itself or any other company. Dorsey said Twitter would benefit by having access to “a much larger corpus of conversation” from which it can surface relevant content to users. “That’s where we will be competitive,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="3UjSCr"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“That is something that not only we can host but we can participate in.”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="X9iBmv"&gt;Dorsey said Twitter is “excited to build” features that will give people more choice over what they see. “You can imagine an app-store-like view of ranking algorithms that give people ultimate flexibility in terms of” what posts are put in front of them, Dorsey said on the call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wRHlN4"&gt;Twitter could both create its own ranking algorithms for people to choose from and offer a “marketplace” where people select different options. “That is something that not only we can host but we can participate in,” he said. Giving people more choice would “not only help out business, but drive more people into participating in social media in the first place,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="THHaYr"&gt;Dorsey also sees decentralization as a way to “address some of the problems” around Section 230, the law that gives platforms protection from user-created content. The law has &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21273768/section-230-explained-internet-speech-law-definition-guide-free-moderation"&gt;recently been a popular target&lt;/a&gt; for some legislators, and a decentralized network might offer Twitter a way to avoid issues if stricter rules were to be put in place, whether those rules require more moderation or for Twitter to apply a more neutral approach to what content is surfaced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="vdjWRW"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"Section 230 is 25 years old, and it’s never been more important","url":"https://www.theverge.com/22268421/cda-section-230-25th-anniversary-reform-stakes-big-tech-internet"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="0S5cdQ"&gt;Twitter has slowly been working on developing a decentralized social network for more than a year. Dorsey &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/11/21010856/twitter-jack-dorsey-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-research-moderation"&gt;announced the project&lt;/a&gt;, named Bluesky, in December 2019, but the company is just now trying to hire a project manager — so things are clearly a ways off. &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/01/15/twitters-vision-of-decentralization-could-also-be-the-far-rights-internet-endgame/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch &lt;/em&gt;published a deep dive&lt;/a&gt; last month on where the project is headed, and it described Bluesky as “firmly in the research phase.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6v3rU0"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/12/21012553/twitter-bluesky-decentralized-social-network-developers-reaction-mastodon-activitypub"&gt;Decentralized social networks exist already&lt;/a&gt;, though none have had great success (&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/4/15177856/mastodon-social-network-twitter-clone"&gt;remember Mastodon?&lt;/a&gt;). Twitter said the Bluesky team may choose to work with an existing decentralized system, or they may end up building a new one if the team thinks that’s the best approach.&lt;/p&gt;
