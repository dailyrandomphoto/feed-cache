    <title>Spotify will let you filter your liked songs by mood and genre</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DoGcvbJk3ByvYAtwpB7e1bMO8KQ=/0x0:1734x1156/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68874385/spotifyfilters.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Spotify&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="jmwhRb"&gt;Spotify’s making it easier to parse your liked songs. The company is &lt;a href="https://newsroom.spotify.com/2021-02-25/how-to-sort-your-favorite-songs-with-spotifys-new-genre-and-mood-filters/"&gt;rolling out a new feature today&lt;/a&gt; that’ll let users filter their liked songs by genre and mood. This way, you can enjoy more of what you like without compromising on the vibe. I, for example, have songs that would be fun in the club but also folky songs for relaxation time, both of which are under my liked songs umbrella. This new feature would let me decide what mood I’m in and then listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1RElnO"&gt;To access the filters, you have to have at least 30 liked songs. You can then go to your library, tap into liked songs, and select a filter that’s listed across the top. You can remove that filter whenever you like and swap in a new one. These filters will change as you like new songs, Spotify says. For now, they will only be rolling out to English-speaking markets, including the US, Canada, and the UK.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="G1TB0I"&gt;Spotify has made it no secret that it wants to be the app for every kind of audio need, including music and podcasts. Although this feature is small, it’s the kind of update that makes a product more useful for everyday use and could keep people coming back to the app to like songs, which is what Spotify wants. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Mailchimp employees have complained about inequality for years — is anyone listening? </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vzz4scLmEoy58W5HuTrzCeJoFEo=/0x0:2050x1367/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68874375/VRG_ILLO_4446_002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;Behind the claims of sexism and racism at Atlanta’s premier tech startup&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="TB4pqv"&gt;Alejandra Luaces had only worked at Mailchimp for four months when she got a surprising anonymous email. “Oliver* is in an open marriage and is fair game,” the message read, referring to a senior engineering manager. “Serena* also knows so you can ask her to confirm.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IPwMB4"&gt;Luaces was not interested in Oliver. She certainly wasn’t interested in asking a female employee about his marriage. As a product operations manager — and one of the few Latinx women in the engineering org — Luaces was determined to succeed at one of the most prestigious tech companies in Atlanta, according to sources close to the situation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pTB4R7"&gt;The events were confirmed by three former employees as well as internal documents reviewed by &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6oYBSA"&gt;In June 2016, one month after the anonymous email, Luaces and Oliver went to a diversity conference together in New York City. Luaces’ department was going through a reorg, and she was interested in a position on his team. Oliver seemed open to it, even suggesting that he’d speak to the engineering director on her behalf. But he also became increasingly flirtatious, allegedly sending Luaces late-night texts hinting that he wanted to have sex.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="nxwKav"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“The level of toxic masculinity and sexism was unlike anything I experienced in 10+ years in the tech industry”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Iq1pHn"&gt;After they returned to Atlanta, Oliver sent her a message saying he’d thought they were going to hook up on the trip. Luaces responded that she didn’t think it was a good idea. Shortly after, the offer to move to his team seemingly evaporated. Luaces’ role was being eliminated in the reorg, and she was told she could either take a lower-level position or leave the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ePdFvC"&gt;In the offer letter for the new role, Mailchimp managers told Luaces that she would not be eligible for a pay raise for “at least the next year, and maybe a few years.” The letter also said that while Luaces was a hard worker, “the perception is that you will fill your time with non-work related activities if your task list is not full.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s been noted that you’re a hard worker when you have ample tasks assigned to you, but the perception is that you will fill your time with non-work related activities if your task list is not full. You will need to manage your own workload (with the help of your team lead and manager) and also put a real effort into being seen as a contributor who works hard at their job." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PHfvc4_kNbrrjuxyxitoVLW0D54=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328067/offer_letter.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Offer letter Mailchimp sent to Alejandra Luaces for an internal transfer.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hLWkjj"&gt;Luaces’ experience at Mailchimp is now roughly three years old. If her complaint was an isolated incident, there probably wouldn’t be a story. But according to 11 current and former employees, Mailchimp has continued to struggle with instances of sexism, bias, and perceived pay disparities since Luaces left in 2018. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="HPFtAe"&gt;Employees say the company’s position as one of the premier startups in Atlanta allows it to view workers as disposable, as there are fewer tech jobs to choose from than if the company were located in San Francisco or New York City. They also say that because the organization is private and has never taken on outside investment, executives can operate without the specter of more public accountability. Many feel they’ve exhausted every option internally and are only speaking to the press as a last resort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ut6MFk"&gt;In a statement emailed to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, a Mailchimp spokesperson said: “We’ve always wanted Mailchimp to be a place where everyone feels included, respected, and empowered to do their best work. But that hasn’t been the experience for all of our employees. Over the past four years we’ve doubled in size, and while we worked hard to foster an inclusive culture as we grew, we fell short in some important areas.” The company declined to comment on&lt;em&gt; The Verge’s &lt;/em&gt;questions about individual personnel matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mKKPtR"&gt;Stories about Mailchimp’s company culture began circulating on February 17th, 2021, after a principal engineer, Kelly Ellis, &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/justkelly_ok/status/1362158917862625280"&gt;posted a viral tweet thread&lt;/a&gt; about her decision to leave. She said she’d dealt with “sexism and bullying” and was underpaid compared to male colleagues. (Ellis did not respond to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge.&lt;/em&gt;) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zMDnUH"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Welp, I guess it's official: I'm leaving my job. I dealt with sexism and bullying, and found out that I, as the only female principal eng, was paid less than the other (male) principals outside of Atlanta. I would not recommend friends work at Mailchimp, especially women.&lt;/p&gt;— Kelly Ellis (@justkelly_ok) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/justkelly_ok/status/1362158917862625280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;February 17, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dtDIB6"&gt;Mailchimp told employees that it had investigated Ellis’ claims and found them to be unsubstantiated. But CEO Ben Chestnut also said that he knew the company needed to do better. “I’m hearing loud and clear that we have work to do, including needing greater transparency around pay equity and an intentional focus on inclusion,” he wrote in a letter to staffers, &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/mailchimp-ceo-ben-chestnut-email-pay-equity-discrimination-kelly-ellis-2021-2"&gt;which was first reported in &lt;em&gt;Business Insider&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “I want to address these issues head-on, and I know we’ll be stronger for it. I’m asking our leadership team to prioritize these issues and work with me to fix them. What we do needs to match what we say.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DOWakR"&gt;Group chats and Slack groups filled with former Mailchimp employees were set ablaze by the news. Workers began discussing their own experiences with alleged discrimination and unequal pay, wondering whether what they viewed as the open secret of Mailchimp’s company culture would finally be brought into the open. “They’re going to have to acknowledge the problems that are being raised, and respond with something other than, ‘we have investigated ourselves and found we did nothing wrong,’” one said in an alumni Slack. “I wish more people would speak out but I wont for the same reasons (NDA, fear of retaliation),” another responded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BJlERx"&gt;Mariesa Dale, a design manager who joined the company in 2018, left after a year due to what she says was a misogynistic culture. “The level of toxic masculinity and sexism was unlike anything I experienced in 10+ years in the tech industry,” she says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="lbsP5q"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Working at Mailchimp is a status symbol — particularly in Atlanta&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="H8ued2"&gt;Dale remembers that once, a manager shushed her when she responded to a question she’d been asked directly during a meeting with him and another male colleague. He then asked her male counterpart to answer the question. She says that when she went to HR to tell them about the behavior, nothing seemed to change. “Leadership at Mailchimp clearly knows about this and doesn’t do anything about it,” she says.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eutYgx"&gt;In response to this allegation, Mailchimp said no formal HR complaints have been filed against the manager in question. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Q4nnde"&gt;A female leader who left the company in 2019 said she was repeatedly given what she viewed as gendered feedback and promised promotions that never materialized. Once, when she pushed back on a comment her manager made in a review, he said, “Don’t contradict me in front of the kids,” referring to her direct reports. He also would tell her to “be more professional” when she disagreed with him in meetings. The woman says she reported these experiences to HR, but nothing changed. Eventually, she found out she was making roughly $100,000 less than a male colleague just one level above her who did comparable work, and she decided to quit. She asked to remain anonymous due to fear of retaliation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5yfFr8"&gt;A different form of alleged pay disparity is also felt on the support team. According to an employee who recently left, the department is one of the most diverse factions of the company — but it’s also one of the lowest paid. One senior staffer said they made just $48,000 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="txNWCC"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“He needs to be subtler when it comes to voicing his opinion about his compensation”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Ck8agv"&gt;Employees also say it’s difficult to move out of these positions. While most corporate employees work out of the glitzy Ponce City Market — a mixed-use space filled with shops and restaurants — the support team works in an old building two and a half miles away, making it difficult to forge connections with other teams. “The support team was treated like the custodians,” a former staffer says. “Everyone loves and respects the custodian. They’re a friendly face when you walk in the door. But no one has any interest in promoting the custodian.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aXBdbX"&gt;“It feels like you’re the lowest rung on the ladder,” a current employee adds. “When you see people of color, women, LGBTQ people in this department it feels really shitty. We’re hidden away.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sU4Xam"&gt;In response to this assertion, a Mailchimp spokesperson said: “In our view, career progression isn’t about moving out of the Customer department, but growing within it.” Mailchimp also said other departments of the company have more gender diversity than customer service, but it did not comment specifically on racial or LGBTQ diversity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Qr6YjO"&gt;Still, working at Mailchimp is a status symbol — particularly in Atlanta. For many employees in the support department, it’s their first corporate job, and some say they are drawn in by the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine and the Herman Miller chairs. When the pandemic hit and people started working from home, those superficial perks evaporated. “When all those things were taken away I realized I didn’t like this job that much,” the former worker says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="F86s9s"&gt;Given their disparate environment, not all members of the support team were sympathetic to Kelly Ellis’ complaints. After she posted a photo of an expensive Lego set on Twitter, one wrote “can you imagine the cognitive dissonance it takes to spend ~48 hours being upset over pay and then tweeting about an $800 Lego set...while people who make 1/3rd of your pay clean up some mess you made?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DeyvDm"&gt;The story about a white woman getting outsized attention for discrimination in the tech industry isn’t new. In August 2020, Françoise Brougher, former COO of Pinterest, sued the company for gender discrimination, eventually getting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/14/22175043/pinterest-gender-discrimination-lawsuit-settlement-coo-francoise-brougher"&gt;a $22.5 million settlement&lt;/a&gt;. She brought her complaints after &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/07/03/pinterest-race-bias-black-employees/"&gt;two Black women on the policy team&lt;/a&gt; — Ifeoma Ozoma and Aerica Shimizu Banks — spoke out about discrimination at the company. Ozoma and Banks received less than a year’s severance when they left. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bSjdyx"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some would greet him by saying “what’s up gangster” and joke that he was stealing computers&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dz2LPq"&gt;For Angelo Ragin, however, Ellis’ experience was validating. He’d voiced some of the same concerns in 2014 when he’d advocated for a pay raise and was told he was being entitled. His concerns about pay, while old, are echoed by current Mailchimp staffers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VdCp3S"&gt;Ragin was the first Black employee at Mailchimp. He started on the tech support team in 2009 before moving to the IT department. The role fit Ragin’s background: he’d previously worked on the Geek Squad at Best Buy and was an expert in Apple software and products. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YCGCjB"&gt;One of the key metrics on the IT team was how many tickets agents solved. Mailchimp employees would write in with technical issues, and it was up to the team to resolve them as quickly as possible. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UPtHGP"&gt;Ragin says he was often in the top two agents in regard to tickets solved — a claim backed up by ticket count statistics from 2015. He says he was the guy Mailchimp’s founders, Ben Chestnut and Dan Kurzius, would go to when they had technical concerns. So when he found out he was making 14 percent less than his white colleagues, Ragin was shocked. He asked to be bumped up to their level, which the company did, bringing his total compensation to $68,400 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6m0A23"&gt;Still, Ragin felt like the work he was doing warranted more. “I was the go-to guy,” he says. “I would walk in the office and be going 100 percent all day. My goal was to change the perception of IT, because people needed to trust in the IT department so they feel fully equipped and educated about what kind of stuff they have in front of them.” He wanted to make $80,000 a year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="o3Ua37"&gt;In his review in 2014, his manager said that the company had already bumped him up 14 percent, and “with bonuses, company-paid health insurance and other perks the total compensation package easily puts Angelo well on the way, if not already in excess of, his $80K/year long term goal.” He refused to further increase Ragin’s pay. Ragin was then chided for advocating for himself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="“Management definitely recognizes his efforts and successes but these can be overshadowed when he displays what some might perceive as a sense of entitlement. He needs to be subtler when it comes to voicing his opinion about his compensation. It’s great that he’s confident but some people might misread his self-confidence as arrogance or a sense of entitlement.”" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/aKlg9cd6Dz0UaYBSEOVhKRHi5V0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328070/management.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Feedback Angelo Ragin got from a manager in 2014.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJl8i7"&gt;Another manager wrote in the review: “Management definitely recognizes his efforts and successes but these can be overshadowed when he displays what some might perceive as a sense of entitlement. He needs to be subtler when it comes to voicing his opinion about his compensation.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zkxFUv"&gt;The following year, Mailchimp recorded $280 million in revenue, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/06/technology/mailchimp-and-the-un-silicon-valley-way-to-make-it-as-a-start-up.html"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;The&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;New York Times&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xzbjZ5"&gt;Earlier on in his tenure, Ragin had taken a week off due to a difficult situation in his family. When he returned to the office, he says he was called out for not responding to tickets while he was away. “That crushed me,” he says. “I was just like ‘are you serious?’ Especially because I’m your token Black kid, I’m the one you put on a poster when you go to job fairs to say you’re diverse. You’re not diverse, you just have me here.”&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CgYA2gjcptYNabm6Cj3ColdzAyw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328062/MailChimp_Job_Poster.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Angelo Ragin on a Mailchimp recruiting poster.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="6W8ymv"&gt;Ragin was also beginning to tire of small slights that piled up from white colleagues. Some would greet him by saying “what’s up gangster” and joke that he was stealing computers. A few years earlier, he’d started a side business repairing iPhone screens and selling accessories to support his family. One day, another Mailchimp employee began joking about him having the accessories piled in his car and asked if he was hawking toilet paper or paper towels, too. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ids36r"&gt;Ragin decided to send a letter to Mailchimp’s co-founders to voice his concerns. “It’s hard to walk into a company you love and have loved for so long, feeling like you’re going to do your best to have a good day but you’re expecting some sort of uncomfortable comment from someone and you just have to swallow your feelings for the sake of not being labeled as ‘aggressive’ or ‘defensive’ by your peers so you just keep quiet,” he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ppLKCF"&gt;Mailchimp eventually decided to roll out unconscious bias training and enlisted Ragin’s support. He was glad to advise on the curriculum but was not compensated for the extra work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JC9k0M"&gt;While the bias training is now available for all employees, some staffers say the company still has more work to do. On the anonymous forum Blind, some have been discussing a perceived exodus of Black employees in recent years. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt="It’s evident that our beige C suite is too busy counting Calendly’s bag (re: Ben’s gross Slack message about Tope last week) to be bothered that they have been hemorrhaging black talent (#blaxodus) pre-covid or even consider validating the terrible experiences of marginalized employees by implementing anti-racist systems." data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/W9eXvM4GS9j-nMqeUIECQro1HfI=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22328069/screenshot_02.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Comments in Blind, an anonymous employee forum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="U28ex0"&gt;This perception could be related to the growth of Atlanta’s tech scene, which is giving employees more options of where to work. In January, CEO Ben Chestnut sent a Slack message to staff about a company called Calendly that had recently raised $350 million in funding. “It can be easy to look at companies like Calendly and feel like the grass is always greener and the wins come easier,” he wrote. “That’s not the case — we’ve got our phasers set to win and if anyone’s got green, it’s us!” He ended with a rocket emoji. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kOf0HO"&gt;His comments were not meant for Luaces or Ragin. Both had left the company by this point: Luaces to run her own &lt;a href="https://www.hellyeahglutenfree.com/"&gt;bakery called Hell Ya Gluten Free&lt;/a&gt; and Ragin to start his own consulting business. Ragin never got the promotion he was asking for. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="64z7q1"&gt;It’s a reality that even employees speaking out publicly cannot change. However much Mailchimp improves, two people of color who genuinely loved the company when they first arrived are now working outside the tech industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="9dyPQC"&gt;Ragin says that his experience at Mailchimp even prompted him to go to therapy for depression. “I questioned myself, I questioned my work, I questioned my ability, because every time you get to the next level, they move the bar,” he explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr class="p-entry-hr" id="Zk0wtX"&gt;
&lt;p id="daiysG"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*Two names were changed to protect the identities of those involved &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Kfxa6U"&gt;Nvidia’s new RTX 3060 will be available to purchase starting on Thursday, February 25th at 9AM PT / 12PM ET. Unlike other GPUs in the RTX 30 series, Nvidia is not making a Founder’s Edition of the RTX 3060, but other manufacturers like EVGA and Gigabyte are making their own iterations of the RTX 3060. The price is said to be $329, but as has been the case for the past year, it’s unlikely you’ll be able to find it available for that. Retailers that have posted listings are already marking up 3060 cards to $390 or more, which is much closer in price to the step-up 3060 Ti.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mbzG6g"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;’s Sean Hollister &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/22064700"&gt;reviewed EVGA’s iteration of the RTX 3060&lt;/a&gt; and noted in his review that although the GPU’s price makes it more competitive to buy, you’re sacrificing more than a little bit of performance compared to the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/1/21768294/nvidia-rtx-3060-ti-when-where-how-to-buy-gpu"&gt;RTX 3060 Ti&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="LG09Kn"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10360060"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="aSEuLX"&gt;So far, Best Buy and Micro Center are the only retailers that have put listings up for the RTX 3060. We will continue to update the list of cards and retailers selling them as they become available.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Just 10 percent of the new Postal Service fleet will be electric</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wWUPNMfsNBxEt-VvhsyO26Akkg0=/0x427:2560x2134/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68874134/NGDVfrontLeft_scaled.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: USPS&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Yy738L"&gt;Only 10 percent of the United States Postal Service’s new fleet of mail trucks will be battery-powered &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/25/22249237/biden-electric-vehicle-government-fleet-ev"&gt;despite President Biden’s desire to convert the entire government fleet&lt;/a&gt;, USPS head Louis DeJoy &lt;a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/usa-postal-service-vehicles/u-s-postal-chief-commits-to-10-of-new-delivery-vehicles-as-electric-vehicles-idUSL1N2KU2O2"&gt;revealed in Congressional testimony on Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;. The other 90 percent will be gas-powered, though the trucks — which are being built by defense contractor Oshkosh — are supposedly designed to be converted into electric vehicles down the road. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="kg27zW"&gt;When DeJoy was asked why it wasn’t the other way around, he said he was willing to talk to the Biden administration but that the USPS doesn’t “have the 3 or 4 extra billion [dollars] in our plan right now that it would take to do it.” The USPS mail vehicles make up about a third of the entire government fleet. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NeIKaO"&gt;The USPS &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/23/22297823/usps-postal-service-mail-truck-electric-oshkosh-workhorse"&gt;announced the new-generation mail truck on Tuesday&lt;/a&gt; following a yearslong bidding process. It’s paying Oshkosh nearly $500 million to get the vehicles into production by 2023, and the defense contractor is promising to build anywhere between 50,000 and 165,000 of them over the next ten years. They will replace the current mail trucks that have been in service for more than two decades, which were built by defense contractor Grumman. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6I9lMV"&gt;Many of those mail trucks — known as “long life vehicles” or LLVs — are well past their expiration dates and some have even caught fire, which is not only dangerous but has also cost the USPS a lot in repairs and upkeep. Additionally, they’re not equipped with modern amenities like airbags or air conditioning. The new trucks offer those, plus better ergonomics and new safety features.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vyHNot"&gt;Both the USPS and Oshkosh said the deal was for a mix of gas and electric versions of the new vehicle, and that they would be “fuel-efficient” and “low-emission.” But they initially declined to specify what that mix would be or how they defined those terms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="gK8lLl"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Electric vehicles make a lot of sense in short-range delivery settings&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="dl7nOa"&gt;“The [new vehicles] are expected to be more environmentally friendly than the current LLVs due to fewer trips required and better emission controls. These controls will decrease emissions and help improve air quality when compared to the vehicles they are intended to replace,” the USPS told &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “The flexible platform will allow the Postal Service to purchase the [new vehicles] with powertrains that maximize fuel efficiency, reduce operational costs and allow the incorporation of emerging technologies in the future when they become mature and offer operational savings.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="WH58Yn"&gt;Multiple bidding companies proposed all-electric or hybrid options during the six-year search for a new truck, &lt;a href="https://www.trucks.com/2020/08/31/inspector-generals-report-details-new-mail-truck-program-problems/"&gt;which was fraught with problems and delays&lt;/a&gt;. Only one of those companies was still in the running during the final phase, though: commercial EV startup Workhorse. After years of struggling to generate revenue, many industry analysts and experts thought the USPS contract was Workhorse’s best shot at survival. But some thought Workhorse had a decent chance considering it was the only one pitching an EV in the final stage and because electric vehicles make a lot of sense in short-range delivery settings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="idOGgi"&gt;Workhorse said Wednesday that it has requested “additional information from the USPS” about the decision and that it “intends to explore all avenues that are available to non-awarded finalists in a government bidding process.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XmFOJP"&gt;Some environmental groups took aim at DeJoy after the announcement of the new truck. The USPS chief has been under pressure to resign for months following accusations that he was deliberately hampering the Postal Service’s ability to properly function during last year’s election, which saw a record number of people vote by mail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left"&gt;&lt;aside id="8D7Bi8"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Some have accused DeJoy of playing politics, but that may not be what happened here&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xYAH0k"&gt;“From undermining our democracy to delaying climate action, Postmaster General Louis DeJoy continues to fail the United States Postal Service and the American public,” Gina Coplon-Newfield, the director of the Sierra Club’s Clean Transportation for All campaign, said in a statement. “The lack of commitment from the USPS to electrify its fleet directly contradicts the Biden administration’s goals and executive order to clean up pollution from the US government’s vehicles.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JI5Mgv"&gt;But while DeJoy may make a good scapegoat, it’s not clear that politics were at the heart of the decision to go with Oshkosh. The Trump administration certainly spent four years exhibiting a disdain for clean air policies. But it was also quite chummy with the people behind Workhorse. Trump himself cheered on the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18537225/gm-factory-workhorse-ev-electric-vehicle-startup-sale-trump-tweet"&gt;sale of the former General Motors factory in Lordstown, Ohio&lt;/a&gt; to Lordstown Motors, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/8/20954956/gm-lordstown-motors-factory-workhorse-electric-vehicles-trump-ev"&gt;is essentially a spinoff of Workhorse&lt;/a&gt;. Former Vice President Pence &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/25/21302966/lordstown-motors-electric-pickup-truck-ev-endurance-unveiling-pence"&gt;attended the unveiling of Lordstown Motors’ electric pickup truck&lt;/a&gt; (which is based on an original Workhorse design). And the Department of Energy started doing due diligence on Lordstown Motors for a possible &lt;a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/13/2157813/0/en/Lordstown-Motors-Corp-Advances-to-Next-Stage-in-Department-of-Energy-s-Advanced-Technology-Vehicles-Manufacturing-Loan-Program-Application.html"&gt;Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing&lt;/a&gt; loan while Trump was still in office, despite the fact that the ATVM program has been otherwise dormant for nearly a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Get an Oculus Quest 2 at Newegg and score a gift card for up to $20</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4fwctud5ibW7cxuFB_jphI7Wl14=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873771/akrales_200904_4160_0010.0.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="F6f4sw"&gt;The Oculus Quest 2 standalone VR headset has been tough to find throughout the pandemic. Several retailers now have it back in stock, but only at Newegg can you snag one and get a complimentary gift card with your purchase. &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Foculus-quest-2%2Fp%2FN82E16826910017" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;The headset with 64GB of storage &lt;/a&gt;costs $299 and includes a $10 Newegg gift card, &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Foculus-quest-2%2Fp%2FN82E16826910018" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;while the 256GB model is $399&lt;/a&gt; and comes with a $20 gift card. If you’ve considered getting a headset, you might as well buy it from a place that’ll give you a freebie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="KeYdx1"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:10318379"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DvLPQT"&gt;In addition to the headset, Newegg is including gift cards with other accessories made for the Oculus Quest 2. The zip-up carrying case for the headset &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Foculus-301-00369-01-case%2Fp%2FN82E16826910021" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is $50 and includes a $5 gift card&lt;/a&gt;. The Elite strap that dramatically improves the Quest 2’s fit and comfort &lt;a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;amp;mid=44583&amp;amp;u1=verge&amp;amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Foculus-301-00375-01-strap%2Fp%2FN82E16826910020" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is also $50&lt;/a&gt; and comes with a $5 gift card. As a Quest 2 owner myself, I highly recommend both accessories. Once you get your kit, you can follow &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22218827/oculus-quest-2-wireless-pc-vr-games-how-to"&gt;my how-to on streaming VR games like &lt;em&gt;Half-Life: Alyx&lt;/em&gt; to your headset wirelessly&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="JP0w32"&gt;Razer’s first compact 60 percent gaming keyboard, the Huntsman Mini, is $100 at &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08BFF4C7J/?th=1&amp;amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1733306396839425140" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;, which is $20 off its usual price. Both are offering the black-colored model with clicky optical switches. Unfortunately, this deal doesn’t apply to the Razer’s mercury white colorway. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/14/21318516/razer-huntsman-mini-60-percent-keyboard-mechanical-clicky-linear-price-release-date"&gt;You can read more about the keyboard’s features right here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="A5FKf0"&gt;In case you’re hunting for a feature-packed 1440p gaming monitor that doesn’t cost a fortune, Acer’s XV272U is $300 at Amazon and B&amp;amp;H Photo. I wrote about &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/2021/2/16/22286158/acers-nitro-xv272u-gaming-monitor-g-sync-1440p-qhd-amazon-deal-sale"&gt;this deal last week&lt;/a&gt;, so it’s not new, but it’s worth telling you about again in case your search for PC components is still ongoing. This model has a 27-inch QHD IPS panel with G-Sync compatibility and a 144Hz refresh rate, so it ticks a lot of boxes for the price.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Apple Fitness Plus review: easy mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/zedaUNEveL5HlhwlWJ0stnBYtAI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873680/vpavic_210217_4444_0005.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;


  &lt;p&gt;A starter pack for exercise&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="p--has-dropcap p-large-text" id="Kv1B8z"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus has been out for a couple of months now, and a few of us here at &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; have been spending that time running it (and ourselves) through its paces. The $9.99-a-month service offers a decent array of exercise videos with an added bonus: integration with the sensors on an Apple Watch. In fact, an Apple Watch is &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; to use the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="muA3mz"&gt;Since everybody’s exercise routine is a little different, we wanted to get a variety of perspectives on the service. What’s become clear from all of our testing is that Apple has successfully achieved what we think it set out to do: create an exercise service that is accessible to a broad range of people. There are lots of different ways an exercise service like this could get tripped up, but for the most part, Fitness Plus stays on track.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="YPrnZG"&gt;Whether you like the direction that track goes or if it’s long enough to keep your attention for years to come is another matter. It will take more time for Apple to expand its array of options in the service, but it has already added one new kind of exercise — celebrity walk-and-listens — which could bode well for those hoping for future updates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="crjyLA"&gt;But as we always say, never pay for something now in the hopes that it’ll be better in the future. So here’s what we think of Fitness Plus after two months of using the service.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BEBYgzXliQUd7ySaIQvscooBXQE=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327713/vpavic_4444_20210224_0074.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="8SoygW"&gt;The basics of Apple Fitness Plus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="eXAL46"&gt;Fitness Plus’ main selling point is it’s easy to jump into — so long as your own oodles of Apple devices. The app requires an Apple Watch to access the classes, and then you’ll need an iPhone, iPad, or Apple TV to stream the workouts. (Critically, there’s no way to stream from a Mac, which makes no sense and required me to stream from my tiny iPhone display.) But because the app connects to the Watch, your rings show up in the corner of the screen throughout a workout. It serves as a reminder of how hard you’ve worked and how far you have to go to meet your goals for the day. Some people might find this motivational. I did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mO7MNU"&gt;As for equipment, the app offers a variety of cardio workouts, such as cycling, treadmill classes, and rowing, which require special equipment. But it also offers classes like Time to Walk, which Becca will dive into below, and dance classes that require no equipment at all. Most of the strength classes would like you to use dumbbells (which can be hard to find in stock currently), but you could get away with your bodyweight if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="WhZueZ"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s a diverse group of instructors and class formats&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PDGNdjC3auqbnBnx8FaTqXqVvjA=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327683/vpavic_210224_4444_0025.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hSn92D"&gt;There’s no way to filter classes by equipment requirements or even area of focus, so expect to spend time in the app reading descriptions and watching previews to discern whether a class is for you. This is a pain and a hurdle that shouldn’t exist. Filters by workout type and equipment should be table stakes for any fitness app.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KnUvSY"&gt;What Apple lacks in filters, though, it slightly makes up for with a diverse group of instructors and class formats. The instructors vary in age, background, and body type, which I immediately noticed and appreciated. (I would still like to see a fitness app incorporate all body types and not just what we typically think of as “fit.”) The strength classes also offer three different sets of instructions: one for the prescribed exercise, another to make it more advanced, and a third to modify for injuries or anyone who needs to take it easy. This is the type of setup you’d see in classic fitness tapes, but I don’t find as much in on-demand classes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="c6yLCH"&gt;This setup contrasts Apple’s biggest competitor in the space, Peloton, which doesn’t offer modifications during its workouts. As someone who has regularly worked out through Peloton’s classes, this was a nice change and one I’d like to see Peloton take as a cue from Apple. —&lt;em&gt;Ashley Carman&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/wGvrl-fzgg2VUqF0zDUWpqzqs-4=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327714/vpavic_4444_20210224_0076.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="C5YXaV"&gt;Apple Fitness Plus versus Peloton&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="zDxmB7"&gt;Apple and Peloton are similar when it comes to premise and the primary user experience. You can select workouts with different lengths, different playlists, and different instructors in various categories like cycling, treadmill, strength, and yoga, as well as dedicated cooldowns. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2w8qO"&gt;I would say the primary reason to use Apple’s program is its seamless integration with the company’s hardware ecosystem. When I start up a workout on my iPad, the workout shows up on my Watch as well, and my Watch’s metrics appear on the iPad’s screen. It’s great to be able to watch my heart rate and rings in real time on the same screen as my workout without having to manually connect anything. You can even launch Fitness Plus playlists in Apple Music if you take a liking to them. (You can sync an Apple Watch with &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22238974/peloton-bike-plus-review-price-features"&gt;Peloton’s Bike Plus&lt;/a&gt;, but its on-screen metrics are limited to cycling workouts.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v3MlMy"&gt;I also like that when you start a hill in Apple’s cardio workouts, a clock appears counting down to the end of the interval. I watch that clock religiously during the steepest climbs. It’s easier to survive them when I know exactly how long I have left to endure without having to count in my head.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-left c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="xl0YGK"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Most of the Fitness Plus workouts I tried are around the same level of difficulty &lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5fpHK66YG-WhX9nMiZv3WDajC_Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327712/vpavic_4444_20210224_0073.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Photo by Becca Farsace / The Verge&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="hRsrac"&gt;Another unique feature of Apple Fitness Plus is — and I apologize for not having a better term here — the &lt;em&gt;vibes&lt;/em&gt;. Peloton instructors approach their rides with a wide range of attitudes and personalities. And while this is also true of Apple’s instructors to some extent, all of them (at least, the cycling and treadmill folks) have vibrantly positive personas. They’re enthusiastic, they’re full of energy, and they’re so excited to be running or biking with you that it’s infectious. It’s hard not to be excited in turn. There was an emphasis on overall wellness — reaching goals, eliminating stress, that sort of thing. I don’t feel like Apple’s instructors are just trying to get me through a workout; I feel like they’re trying to make me a better person. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="eFEi1g"&gt;But the biggest difference between Apple and Peloton’s libraries is that Apple’s is newer — and that means it just doesn’t have as much &lt;em&gt;stuff&lt;/em&gt; yet. Peloton has a wider variety of music. I’ve done everything from Bon Jovi rides to yacht-music bike rides, where Apple’s playlists are largely more general (“Everything Rock,” “Latest Hits,” “Latin Grooves,” etc.). And as someone who likes longer endurance workouts, I was disappointed that Apple’s cycling and treadmill workouts are capped at 45 minutes. With Peloton, you can ride for up to 90. Peloton also offers a number of live classes where you can interact with fellow riders, while all of Apple’s workouts are pre-recorded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="0hBdTQ"&gt;Another area where Peloton’s ahead is in specific workout hardware integration. Obviously, Apple doesn’t sell a spin bike (yet), and that means the instructors have to be more general about intensity. While Peloton instructors give a specific range (“30 to 50”), Apple instructors speak more generally (“Moderate intensity,” “add a little bit more here,” etc.). This meant I was always kind of guessing where my resistance was supposed to be during Apple’s rides (and I don’t really trust myself to arrive at a legitimately “hard” resistance when asked to find that for myself). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="2Vt8Lj"&gt;Apple instructors can be more specific with treadmill workouts since metrics like speed and incline are universal. Still, I wish Apple could display the current incline or resistance on the iPad screen like Peloton does. There were times when my teacher instructed everyone to change their resistance while I was zoned out or checking my phone or something, and I ended up doing a portion of the workout at the wrong intensity. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wY9Gef"&gt;But I think the biggest thing to consider when choosing between Peloton and Apple Fitness Plus is the difficulty. Most of the Fitness Plus workouts I tried are around the same level: a nice challenge for folks like me who work out a few times a week and aren’t super in shape. Peloton caters to a wider variety of abilities, sorted on a scale of 1–10, and you can sort classes by intensity while browsing. If you’re serious about athletic training (and cycling, in particular), Peloton will have more to offer. —&lt;em&gt;Monica Chin&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/bq3KfwCbGIwu7N_qDYXFPX6DOpg=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327715/vpavic_4444_20210224_0079.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h2 id="PdiGjj"&gt;Time to Walk&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="nPrX7P"&gt;Working out in one space has always been a struggle for me. I get really bored and uninterested when I’m not actively going somewhere or physically achieving something. I usually exercise by doing loops in a park on my bike, going on a run, or slacklining between trees. So Apple Fitness Plus’ at-home workouts were never of interest to me — until a few weeks ago when Apple rolled out the Time to Walk feature. That is something I, in theory, could get behind. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3BNeLV"&gt;Time to Walk pairs inspirational monologues, music, and photos from famous musicians, athletes, and actors with the Apple Watch’s exercise tracking feature to create a more engaging way to take a walk. I take a walk almost every day and use that time to tune in to a new album or one of my favorite podcasts, so Time to Walk slotted into my routine quite nicely. It’s exactly the level of effortlessness I need in workout tech. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;
&lt;aside id="d7VKxz"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Time to Walk slotted into my routine quite nicely&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/pQbdnxFksQHqA4gJYX4UXJLVK7Q=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327738/IMG_8514EA04A825_1.jpeg"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="G365Gy"&gt;There are only a couple of differences between Time to Walk and a more traditional podcast. Most notably, your Watch will buzz about twice an episode, and a photo will show up on the screen that relates to what the host is talking about. It’s cool but not groundbreaking. Secondly, the hosts are either also on a walk or talking about what walking means to them. I appreciated this a bit more. Ruby Bridges’ episode has a slow, calm pace, and you can hear as she strolls through Audubon Park in New Orleans. There are many loud birds and cars driving by in the distance. While Draymond Green’s heavier foot on a gravel path in Malibu is accompanied by the sounds of distant waves. Apple really nailed the soundstage of these walks, and it creates a pleasing experience that actually makes you feel as if you are walking next to someone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sg6kLj"&gt;My only issue with Time to Walk and Apple Fitness Plus at large is the need to live in the Apple ecosystem. You absolutely need an iPhone and Apple Watch to use Fitness Plus, and even outside of that, when you use the Time to Walk feature, your headphones have to be paired to the Apple Watch. If a call comes in on your iPhone and you’re not using Apple or Beats headphones that can switch over automatically, you will have to manually reconnect your headphones to your phone to take the call on them, then manually reconnect your headphones to the Watch to resume the Time to Walk episode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wwJMJA"&gt;For someone who doesn’t use AirPods, this is very annoying. Outside of the usual Apple ecosystem walls, Time to Walk is my favorite feature of Apple Fitness Plus. Every Monday, when a new episode with a new mystery celeb comes out, I look forward to my nightly walk. Unfortunately, this is the only feature I loved within Apple Fitness Plus, and a walking podcast is not worth $9.99 a month for me. —&lt;em&gt;Becca Farsace&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-wide-block"&gt;  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KoJWOTEYvmq9cxlZ5VxwDqOZcxo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22327711/vpavic_4444_20210224_0068.jpg"&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p class="p--has-dropcap" id="SXXQz9"&gt;If there’s a single message to take away from this review, it’s this: Apple Fitness Plus is great for beginners but may not offer the depth you’re looking for if you’re advanced in any specific sport. It’s accessible to anybody who is able to buy into Apple’s whole ecosystem, though. And for me, a person who has struggled to exercise regularly for my entire life, it’s better than a gym membership.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5rvh08"&gt;There is enough variety for me to feel like I won’t have to put videos on repeat, but I’m only using it a couple of times a week right now. My main complaint has nothing to do with the exercise content but instead with the vibe of Apple’s videos. I’m not asking for disaffected ’90s MTV VJs, but the peppy and relentlessly positive chatter is a lot for a Gen-Xer like me. And the vaguely-but-not-actually spiritualistic “mindfulness” that you can’t avoid in the cooldowns also grates. None of this is new to anybody who has used services like this, but for me, it’s a lot. I cringe when a trainer ends a video by trying to get me excited to “close those rings” on the Watch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right c-float-hang"&gt;&lt;aside id="bcBQ2L"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Great for beginners, but maybe not deep enough if you already have an exercise routine&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="kCTRk0"&gt;Still, the best thing I can say about Apple Fitness Plus is, slowly but surely, it is helping me build a habit of actual exercise. There are plenty of days that I end up going outside for a bike ride or a walk instead of turning on an Apple video, but I think doing a couple Fitness Plus videos a week has made it more likely I’ll do that non-Fitness Plus exercise, too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XxZ3wX"&gt;And while the Apple Watch integration occasionally feels motivational, for the most part, it feels unnecessary. Fitness Plus is not a reason to go out and buy an Apple Watch, but it might be a good reason to keep using the one you’ve already got. As with many of Apple’s new services, it’s less about drawing people in than it is about keeping people from leaving. I’ll probably keep using Fitness Plus simply because it’s part of the big Apple One bundle I got so my family could &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21439083/apple-one-music-icloud-tv-plus-arcade-bundle-price-explained-deal-subscription-service"&gt;have an amount of iCloud storage that didn’t feel punitive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class="c-end-para" id="xV2646"&gt;If you’re not an Apple One subscriber, is Fitness Plus worth $9.99 / month on its own? If you’re already in an exercise routine, I’m not sure that Fitness Plus is going to offer you something better. For me, it’s literally better than nothing. —&lt;em&gt;Dieter Bohn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Paramount Plus is proof we’ve hit peak streaming </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9oa2gSlPB8_M4FvvusT5D77g344=/612x0:6282x3780/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873563/Kamp_Koral_SpongeBob_s_Under_Years.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="MoQ4bC"&gt;Something my mom said about the recent streaming landscape stuck with me while watching a three-hour event &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299615/paramount-plus-launch-date-price-cbs-all-access-shows-movies"&gt;for Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wlOt8P"&gt;“I’m sometimes searching on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, [and] HBO when I’m bored, and I often am, and I still can’t figure out what I want to watch,” she said. “Maybe too much choice isn’t always good!”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="v6fR4K"&gt;Companies like ViacomCBS, Disney, Apple, Amazon, NBCUniversal, WarnerMedia, and even Fox would say otherwise. They’re in the midst of pivoting to a streaming-first or streaming-focused strategy, figuring out their way into the world with individual platforms — many of which come with a plus sign at the end. More, the plus sign signals; more, more, more. Paramount Plus is just the latest, and arguably the last, big entry in the space. Has it finally hit the point where there’s too much choice? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="A8piHO"&gt;During its event, ViacomCBS executives announced more than 50 new projects, a combination of shows, documentaries, films, and specials &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299973/frasier-reboot-paramount-plus-streaming-kelsey-grammer"&gt;for Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt;. The titles hail from Nickelodeon, MTV, BET, Showtime, Comedy Central, and others, and all are supposed to get people excited enough to sign up. Over the next four years, ViacomCBS is increasing its spending on streaming to $5 billion and hoping to bring in 65 to 75 million subscribers around the world. The service launches on March 4th for $9.99 a month. A cheaper, ad-supported option will be available in June for $4.99.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="kVN3L5"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Realistically, most of these streaming platforms don’t need to exist&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="9myQnA"&gt;Executives are hopeful that Paramount Plus has the potential to become a major revenue source. The &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; for Paramount Plus to reach incredible heights, the &lt;em&gt;potential &lt;/em&gt;for it to generate a meaningful profit for ViacomCBS, is everything. There’s a glaring problem with &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; equations, with trying to evaluate just how much someone will want to switch over from Netflix or Disney Plus to Paramount Plus — what if the opposite happens and the &lt;em&gt;potential &lt;/em&gt;to lose out actually happens instead? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="JrX3DY"&gt;Realistically, most of these streaming platforms don’t need to exist. To go one step further, a few seem to exist solely to appease internal pressures and demands in the middle of a rapidly accelerating and changing entertainment industry. Companies feel like they have to own the content, and distribution paths, in order to keep their heads above water. In order for a streaming service to really work, it needs to accomplish a few things, but it all boils down to one core idea: it has to fulfill a need. Or, a streaming service has to be a nonnegotiable purchase. People feel like they can’t sacrifice not having it. Two primary examples are Netflix and Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yN4DTI"&gt;Netflix, benefitting by being first and adapting extraordinarily fast when needed, has made it nearly impossible to leave. For $14 a month, there’s a new highly talked-about movie or TV show every week, and a large library to keep people watching. Netflix executives have hedged their licensing bets to keep shows they don’t own but people &lt;em&gt;really &lt;/em&gt;want to watch. This prevents them from canceling. Those they can’t keep are likely easy to replicate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="aVl7wX"&gt;Think of Netflix’s reality and unscripted TV plan, which bears similarities to MTV, Bravo, and Discovery. Like &lt;em&gt;Real Housewives &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Vanderpump Rules&lt;/em&gt;? Netflix has &lt;em&gt;Bling Empire&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Selling Sunset&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;The Real Lives of Bollywood Wives&lt;/em&gt;. As co-CEO Ted Sarandos said on a recent earnings call, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21328481/netflix-franchise-movies-tv-shows-reality-tv-reed-hastings-ted-sarandos"&gt;Netflix wants to be&lt;/a&gt; the place “where [people] come to us for their favorite show.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="5cB0pa"&gt;&lt;q&gt;There’s a good chance Paramount Plus could work&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="AYM2Oj"&gt;On the flip side, there’s Disney Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278874/disney-plus-94-9-million-subscribers-q1-2021-earnings"&gt;closing in on 100 million subscribers&lt;/a&gt; within 14 months of its initial launch. (To put this in perspective, by 2024, ViacomCBS expects to have 65-75 million subscribers across its streaming platforms globally; in the same time frame, Disney is estimating between 300 and 350 million for its services.) Disney’s entire strategy is laid out in every single advertisement: it’s Disney, it’s Pixar, it’s Marvel, it’s &lt;em&gt;Star Wars,&lt;/em&gt; it’s National Geographic. This is Disney and Disney is this, and it’s only on Disney Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hFYZHB"&gt;Brand identity is everything. People know they have to sign up for Disney Plus to watch Marvel movies or shows, while Marvel and &lt;em&gt;Star Wars&lt;/em&gt; stay on top of the conversation through weekly releases of highly anticipated shows that dominate conversation. Paramount Plus has brand power, but it’s not as instantly recognizable. During the event, certain shows were highlighted as reasons to get Paramount Plus. A new &lt;em&gt;iCarly,&lt;/em&gt; new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22297512/avatar-last-airbender-korra-studios-paramount-plus-streaming-netflix"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Avatar: The Last Airbender &lt;/em&gt;or &lt;em&gt;Legend of Korra&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, new &lt;em&gt;Criminal Minds&lt;/em&gt;. All these shows are available to stream on Netflix, where they’ve found a big audience, but it’s unclear how many people associate those series with ViacomCBS or how many people will sign up for Paramount Plus to watch those same series. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="k56bAU"&gt;Launching a streaming service may solve an issue for a company, but asking customers to sign up for another platform and pay for another app — especially when they’re used to having things on Netflix — isn’t consumer friendly. Some folks may begrudgingly say, “Fine, I’ll sign up for Paramount Plus for &lt;em&gt;Criminal Minds&lt;/em&gt;,” but unless there’s a weekly reason to justify that purchase, and leave people feeling excited about it, the process feels like a chore. Other people may decide they can live without &lt;em&gt;Criminal Minds &lt;/em&gt;— perhaps make a one-time purchase on iTunes or Amazon — and stick to the medley of streaming services they already use. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="unWkIf"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The biggest problem Paramount Plus will face is answering &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; someone needs it&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="3vDSKo"&gt;There’s a very good chance Paramount Plus could work. It has one of the biggest libraries of all the streaming services. There’s a live aspect to it combining sports and news. Movies like &lt;em&gt;Mission: Impossible 7 &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;A Quiet Place 2 &lt;/em&gt;will &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/24/22299995/mission-impossible-7-quiet-place-2-paramount-plus-45-days-after-theaters"&gt;debut on Paramount Plus&lt;/a&gt; just 45 days after they’re in theaters. Keep throwing things at the wall, and eventually one of the new shows will likely become something people want to watch and therefore finally sign up for Paramount Plus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="chRvUn"&gt;At the same time, in an era of way, way too much TV, where things get lost on Netflix and Hulu all the time, moving things to Paramount Plus isn’t going to help. &lt;em&gt;Emily in Paris &lt;/em&gt;is a Paramount show that was sold to Netflix. On Netflix, it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/10/2/21498727/emily-in-paris-review-darren-star-netflix"&gt;found an audience&lt;/a&gt;, but would it have found the same audience on Paramount Plus, where there’s 10 percent of the audience base? Things often pop on Netflix simply because they’re on Netflix. It’s easier for 200 million subscribers to turn something into a cultural hit than 19 million.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PtkvGq"&gt;The biggest problem Paramount Plus will face is answering &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; someone needs it. HBO Max and Peacock are facing similar hurdles. Netflix has proven why people need it, and so has Disney Plus. People could argue that customers didn’t &lt;em&gt;need &lt;/em&gt;a Disney Plus, but the company offered new series and old favorites on a platform designed around child safety, with no chance of a kid stumbling upon an R-rated movie. That fulfills a need for parents. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZrvmNb"&gt;Paramount Plus may contain an impressive library and may be home to some of the biggest TV networks and studios in the world, but it doesn’t fix a problem, it creates one. Shows and movies used to be on Netflix, a ubiquitous streaming service. Now they’re not. Not everyone has to be a distributor &lt;em&gt;and &lt;/em&gt;a content producer. Over time, we’ll start to see companies realize that more and more. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ozkxnB"&gt;Last night, I went to bed watching &lt;em&gt;iCarly &lt;/em&gt;on Netflix, a show I loved as a kid but forgot about over time. If, and when, it eventually leaves Netflix, I’m not going to seek it out somewhere else. I’ll just find something else on Netflix. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="vPfjsj"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UUe6eW"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="VvOAmt"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SgMAUC"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="gcYgEI"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DKww2R"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="jKlR5w"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ffoIV8"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OslVCR"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Sun probe surprises NASA with incredible photo of Venus</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NEqWWbbig5vrb1sNAKQ6I2oz5Sk=/0x215:880x802/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873502/wispr_venus_image__1_.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;A photo of the nightside of Venus taken by the Wide-field Imager on Parker Solar Probe. | NASA/Johns Hopkins APL/Naval Research Laboratory/Guillermo Stenborg and Brendan Gallagher&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="LTOSXB"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/4/20993406/nasa-parker-solar-probe-sun-wind-magnetic-field"&gt;Parker Solar Probe, NASA’s closest eye on the Sun&lt;/a&gt;, was whizzing by Venus last summer for a gravity assist when it snapped a striking new image of the planet’s mysterious nightside, revealing a surprisingly clear view of the Venusian surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yHciRz"&gt;The spacecraft, launched in 2018, is in the midst of its seven-year journey to study the Sun from 4 million miles away, the closest any human-made object has gone before. To do this, Parker Solar Probe needs to use the gravity of Venus to help tighten its orbit around the Sun through a series of seven flybys, nudging itself closer to the star with each pass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zYrf7H"&gt;Those scenic passes are valuable opportunities to catch intriguing shots of Venus. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pYOOW5"&gt;The image taken by Parker Solar Probe’s Wide-field Imager (WISPR) came during its third Venus flyby in July 2020, and scientists were shocked. They expected WISPR to capture Venus’ thick, carbon dioxide-rich clouds that usually obstruct views of the surface. But instead, the camera was able see through the clouds and reveal the dark-tinted shape of Aphrodite Terra, an elevated area of Venus near its equator that scientists say is about 85°F cooler than its surroundings. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/E5Q6YnazMTOIvfvp5BozaSbR1Mk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22326870/wispr_venus_annotated.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;NASA / Johns Hopkins APL / Naval Research Laboratory / Guillermo Stenborg and Brendan Gallagher&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;An up-close shot of the nightside of Venus taken by the Parker Solar Probe, with key features annotated by NASA.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="qcZRZJ"&gt;“WISPR effectively captured the thermal emission of the Venusian surface,” Brian Wood, an astrophysicist and WISPR scientist at the US Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, DC, said in a &lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/parker-solar-probe-offers-a-stunning-view-of-venus/"&gt;NASA statement&lt;/a&gt;. Wood noted the image was similar to &lt;a href="https://www.planetary.org/articles/0116-a-new-look-at-venus-with-akatsuki"&gt;those taken by a Japanese Venus probe&lt;/a&gt; currently analyzing Venus that can capture light at near-infrared wavelengths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Y0Gp6r"&gt;The revelation could mean one of two things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UpQ5A3"&gt;WISPR might’ve shown off an unexpected capability for sensing infrared light, which, if true, could unlock a new potential for scientists to study dust circling the Sun. “This surprising observation sent the WISPR team back to the lab to measure the instrument’s sensitivity to infrared light,” Michael Buckley, communications manager at Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, wrote in a NASA blog post. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1wJbLb"&gt;But if that’s not the case, then the appearance of Aphrodite Terra could mean WISPR discovered a previously unknown opening in the thick Venusian clouds, a “window” revealing portions of the planet’s surface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mzIKSd"&gt;To find out, mission teams scheduled more nightside shots of Venus in its latest flyby last weekend. They plan to release more images and an analysis by late April. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dDQiBI"&gt;WISPR’s image revealed other fascinating traits of Venus. It detected a glowing rim in the planet’s upper atmosphere that scientists suspect could be “nightglow.” Exclusive to Venus’ nightside, the faint luminescence might be caused by a clash of oxygen and nitrogen atoms that come from the side of the planet exposed to the Sun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tOgKBK"&gt;Scientists are still studying the exact cause of the wispy streaks of light darting across the image’s frame, the NASA post said. They could be charged particles called &lt;a href="https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/7/16/17690740/cosmic-rays-universe-theory-science"&gt;cosmic rays&lt;/a&gt;, tiny grains of space dust reflecting sunlight or “particles of material expelled from the spacecraft’s structures after impact with those dust grains.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Coinbase reveals $1.2 billion revenue in plans to go public</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ih_0EjBWKos7gvmIJyLtjPoHPkI=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68873439/acastro_181126_1777_bitcoin_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="aR84Ui"&gt;Coinbase has &lt;a href="https://decrypt.co/59347/coinbase-big-profit-for-2020-ahead-of-milestone-ipo-direct-listing"&gt;publicly filed&lt;/a&gt; paperwork to list its stock on the NASDAQ exchange, a huge step forward in the first major public offering for a cryptocurrency company. &lt;a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679788/000162828021003168/coinbaseglobalincs-1.htm#i86a9d9b35e45447ea6eb369e5dcf1e6a_1197"&gt;Coinbase’s S-1&lt;/a&gt; was published on Thursday morning, after being confidentially submitted to the SEC in December.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zUxdzX"&gt;In an attached letter to investors, founder Brian Armstrong presented cryptocurrency as an equalizing force in financial markets — and Coinbase as the company at the forefront of that change. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="obvCre"&gt;&lt;q&gt;“If the world economy ran on a common set of standards... the world would be a more fair and free place”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="QjaIvD"&gt;“The current financial system is rife with high fees, unequal access, and barriers to innovation,” the letter reads. “If the world economy ran on a common set of standards that could not be manipulated by any company or country, the world would be a more fair and free place, and human progress would accelerate.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bGMNe8"&gt;The filing lays out the company’s finances in unprecedented detail, including a surprisingly profitable 2020 driven by a huge spike in the price of bitcoin. Coinbase brought in $1.2 billion in revenue over the course of the year for a profit of $322 million, the first time the company has turned an annual profit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="w9EW8M"&gt;Coinbase boasted 43 million verified users as of the end of 2020, with 2.8 million users making transactions each month and a total of $90 billion of assets held in trust. All told, the company has handled transactions worth $456 billion over its life span as a company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PHrEF3"&gt;Still, the skyrocketing price of bitcoin also has its drawbacks. The filing acknowledges that the volatility of cryptocurrency prices will be a significant risk for Coinbase going forward. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1UDffQ"&gt;“All of our sources of revenue are dependent on crypto assets and the broader cryptoeconomy,” the filing reads. “There is no assurance that any supported crypto asset will maintain its value or that there will be meaningful levels of trading activities. In the event that the price of crypto assets or the demand for trading crypto assets decline, our business, operating results, and financial condition would be adversely affected.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bZeiK8"&gt;Much of Coinbase’s success has been due to its ongoing focus on complying with financial regulations concerning cryptocurrency. Coinbase was one of the first exchanges to embrace conventional know-your-customer finance rules, despite reluctance from the libertarian corners of the cryptocurrency world. As those regulations &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195834/cryptocurrency-fincen-regulations-private-wallets"&gt;continue to tighten&lt;/a&gt;, many of Coinbase’s competitors have been &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/29/16060344/btce-bitcoin-exchange-takedown-mt-gox-theft-law-enforcement"&gt;prosecuted for money laundering&lt;/a&gt;, and the company continues to invest heavily in legal compliance. Kathryn Haun, a former prosecutor who led &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/9/1/9240989/shaun-bridges-silk-road-guilty-carl-mark-force-dread-pirate-roberts"&gt;the Silk Road task force corruption case&lt;/a&gt;, now sits on Coinbase’s board of directors. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TZnYiz"&gt;In a nod to the historic nature of the filing, elusive Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto is listed on the S-1 as an interested party alongside lawyers and investors involved in the deal. As a result, a copy of the filing has been sent to Nakamoto’s bitcoin wallet. The filing also lists the identification of Nakamoto as a potential risk, saying the value of Bitcoin and thus Coinbase might be damaged by “the identification of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous person or persons who developed Bitcoin, or the transfer of Satoshi’s Bitcoins.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5qBrUD"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update 12:01 PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added sentence about Nakamoto’s identification as a risk factor for Coinbase.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
