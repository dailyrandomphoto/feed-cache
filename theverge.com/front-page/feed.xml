    <title>NIU announces its first electric kick scooter starting at $599</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/iQ_6VAu9d8prknMW2CFerPG9_os=/419x0:3301x1921/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69087400/NIU_Kick_Scooter_Regenerative_Braking.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="1O7r5S"&gt;NIU, maker of popular, affordable electric mopeds, showed off its first-ever electric kick scooter. The new two-wheeler will be available starting this summer in China, Europe, and North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LQ4wNq"&gt;The NIU Kick Scooter will come in two variants, Pro and Sport. In the US, the Pro scooter will have a top speed of 19.8mph, while the Sport version will have a top speed of 17.4 mph. In Europe, both versions will have a regulated top speed of 25 km/h (15.5 mph). The Pro will have a range 31 miles (50 km) on a single 7.5-hour charge, while the Sport will have a range of 25 miles (40 km) on a single 5.5-hour charge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="9hhwKo"&gt;&lt;q&gt;The NIU Kick Scooter will come in two variants, Pro and Sport&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Gf3Hui"&gt;For the drivetrain, NIU is offering a 350W motor and 486Wh lithium-ion battery pack for the Pro kick scooter, while the Sport will be powered by a 300W motor and 365Wh battery pack. Both scooters are water resistant, foldable, and come with app connectivity via Bluetooth and regenerative braking. The cheapest version of the scooter will start at $599, though NIU has yet release any more details about pricing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="RqgUrC"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10432850"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="fjF29e"&gt;NIU is mostly known in North America for its popular $2,000 electric mopeds, which have been used by shared mobility companies like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/16/18677586/revel-mopeds-scooter-nyc-review"&gt;Revel&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/27/22248805/lime-electric-moped-scooter-niu-washington-paris"&gt;Lime&lt;/a&gt;. The mopeds are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/6/21051352/china-niu-electric-scooters-mopeds-ces-2020"&gt;available for purchase&lt;/a&gt; in a handful of US cities, including San Francisco, San Diego, Austin, Chicago, Washington, DC, Miami, Fort Lauderdale, and Honolulu.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Fpiabm"&gt;A pre-sale for the kick scooter starts in June 2021, with delivery scheduled in the US and Europe in July 2021. Global retail sales will begin in August 2021, with the scooter able to be purchased online or in any of NIU’s dealerships and stores in Europe and North America.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PUb4Ea"&gt;Electric scooters are plentiful in the US, with models from Segway-Ninebot, Inokim, Acton, Unagi, and others widely available from a number of different retailers. Battery-powered mopeds, however, are a bit harder to come by in North America. Major manufacturers, like Gogoro, tend to focus sales on higher volume markets like China, while the US is left to languish thanks to its car-centric infrastructure. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Pac-Man 99 is a new battle royale game for the Switch</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/b6AUzNPOlkNOWWIs5fLA5BAwGvc=/203x0:2354x1434/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69086990/Screen_Shot_2021_04_07_at_10.32.31.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="nvPKq1"&gt;Nintendo has announced &lt;em&gt;Pac-Man 99&lt;/em&gt;, a new multiplayer game that’ll be included with its Nintendo Switch Online subscription service. Like &lt;em&gt;Tetris 99&lt;/em&gt; and the recently departed &lt;em&gt;Super Mario Bros. 35&lt;/em&gt;, the game pits dozens of players against each other in a battle royale-style fight to the end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="SPcVGU"&gt;The game looks similar to the classic arcade original Pac-Man, but you can make it more difficult for opponents by munching on power pellets, eating ghosts, and sending “Jammer Pac-Man” over to their screens. There are eight different preset strategies you can use to screw with other players, for example by speeding up their game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="ZS5x4p"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;PAC-MAN™ is back in a new 99-PAC-MAN battle royale! PAC-MAN™ 99 goes live 4/7 at 6 PM PST, exclusively for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitchOnline?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#NintendoSwitchOnline&lt;/a&gt; members! &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PACMAN99?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;#PACMAN99&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;    &lt;a href="https://t.co/mnzEYXJnBl"&gt;https://t.co/mnzEYXJnBl&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/1qOsEEvbHD"&gt;pic.twitter.com/1qOsEEvbHD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1379602342744571906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;April 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="iXjguS"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man 99 &lt;/em&gt;also has various themes available for purchase that change up the music and visuals based on other Namco games like &lt;em&gt;Galaga, Xevious,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Dig Dug&lt;/em&gt;. There are 20 in total.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Lg6atT"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pac-Man 99&lt;/em&gt; will be available to download tomorrow, April 7th, and it’ll be free for anyone with a Nintendo Switch Online subscription. The game is exclusive to the Nintendo Switch. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Nvidia’s latency-reducing tech is live for all Overwatch players with the company’s GPUs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Overwatch" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/A1LYkWNsHM1_eD4-ywZ4yeyLbM0=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69086820/OVR_PR_Switch_GameplayShots_XA_031_A_png_jpgcopy.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="YgEkgF"&gt;Nvidia &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Foverwatch-reflex-out-now%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F6%2F22370662%2Fnvidia-latency-reduction-reflex-overwatch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;is launching its latency-reducing tech&lt;/a&gt;, Reflex, for anyone who has a Nvidia graphics card and plays the PC version of &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;. The company tested the feature &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/13/22328366/overwatch-latency-reduction-nvidia-reflex-beta"&gt;in &lt;em&gt;Overwatch’&lt;/em&gt;s PTR servers in March&lt;/a&gt;, but now Reflex is live and theoretically available for competitive play. Nvidia claims Reflex reduces the time between pulling the trigger in &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; and the game rendering the shot on screen by as much as 50 percent, and now you can easily test that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5i9NNy"&gt;Latency can be caused by a variety of things (internet speed can be a big factor in competitive play) but Reflex is focused on reducing latency caused by computer hardware. The longer the delay between a click and the game reacting, the better chance whatever the player was responding to is already out of frame. In this case, Nvidia’s tech isn’t new, and &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt; is just the latest esports title to be fully added to &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Ftechnologies%2Freflex%2Fsupported-products%2F&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F4%2F6%2F22370662%2Fnvidia-latency-reduction-reflex-overwatch" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;the small collection of 15 games&lt;/a&gt; that support Reflex so far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="mvwwqk"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VsFhdr5jGEE?rel=0&amp;amp;%3Bstart=5&amp;amp;start=5" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xmFGPf"&gt;I can’t say how well the feature might actually work without trying it, but if &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsFhdr5jGEE"&gt;Nvidia’s video demonstration&lt;/a&gt; is to be believed, it might only be noticeable to a professional player who can feel the microsecond difference in latency. Nvidia does suggest that in some cases, that small difference could drastically change the result. According to Nvidia’s demo, enabling Reflex could be the difference between a critical hit and missing entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OzqceL"&gt;Your mileage may vary, but if you have a Nvidia graphics card — Reflex works on cards as old as the GTX 900-series — and a G-Sync monitor, you should be able to give the low latency feature a try. Enabling Reflex requires the newest version of Nvidia’s drivers and an updated copy of whatever game you want to use it in. In &lt;em&gt;Overwatch&lt;/em&gt;’s case, if you have an updated game, a supported graphics card, and the new driver, you can enable Reflex in Video Settings. The company has also partnered to create &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/2/21418080/nvidia-g-sync-reflex-360hz-refresh-rate-gaming-monitors-alienware-msi-asus-acer"&gt;specific monitors that include a Reflex Latency Analyzer feature&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Jimmy Fallon played Among Us with streamers and the cast of Stranger Things in Twitch debut</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B5Pupw69-gOXMqis6_aENTeZWoo=/0x15:1016x692/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69084365/image__2_.10.png" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.twitch.tv/jimmyfallon" target="_blank"&gt;JimmyFallon on Twitch&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ZpQzLf"&gt;Jimmy Fallon streamed &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; on Twitch with a star-studded group in his debut on the platform Tuesday evening. The stream lasted about an hour, and near the end, more than 125,000 people were watching live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J5IYuv"&gt;Fallon was joined by The Roots’ Questlove, Tariq Trotter, and Kirk Douglas; &lt;em&gt;Stranger Things &lt;/em&gt;stars Noah Schnapp (who plays Will Byers) and Gaten Matarazzo (who plays Dustin Henderson); streamers Sykkuno and Rachel “Valkyrae” Hofstetter; YouTuber Corpse Husband; and &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt; developer InnerSloth’s community director, Victoria Tran. Parts from the stream will air on &lt;em&gt;The Tonight Show&lt;/em&gt; next week, &lt;a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jimmy-fallon-tonight-show-twitch-among-us-stranger-things"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;IGN&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AnP1pj"&gt;You can catch &lt;a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/978024828?filter=archives&amp;amp;sort=time"&gt;a replay of the stream&lt;/a&gt; on Fallon’s Twitch channel:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="zGLcyk"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=978024828&amp;amp;autoplay=false&amp;amp;parent=www.theverge.com&amp;amp;parent=iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=iframely.com&amp;amp;parent=cdn.iframe.ly&amp;amp;parent=if-cdn.com" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="B819Hy"&gt;Fallon also raised money for &lt;a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/"&gt;Feeding America&lt;/a&gt; during the stream. Donations from viewers totaled more than $17,000, and Fallon said he’d cover the rest of the donations to reach the $25,000 goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AQyg5p"&gt;The group played on &lt;em&gt;Among Us&lt;/em&gt;’ classic Skeld map and the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/1/22362177/among-us-airship-update-map-sneaky-crewmate-imposter"&gt;huge new Airship map&lt;/a&gt;, which &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/18/22338782/among-us-airship-map-accounts-update-innersloth"&gt;was released on March 31st&lt;/a&gt;. (The game also now &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/26/22353088/among-us-airship-update-poop-hat-chocolate-ice-cream"&gt;has a poop hat&lt;/a&gt;, which I didn’t see anyone wearing.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6A0SKh"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update April 6th, 7:53PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Fallon’s stream has ended, so we have made adjustments to the headline and article.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google seemingly reveals Pixel Buds A in marketing email</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vx1ENvvEjC0bBWBN8dp7lDYS51Q=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69086220/acastro_180427_1777_0001.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="CUGdoW"&gt;As we approach Google I/O 2021, the rumor mill has started pointing to new hardware, including a Pixel 5A and Pixel Buds A, a lower-cost set of true wireless earbuds that would slot in below the company’s main pair. Google seems to have gotten ahead of itself, however, as, &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/06/google-email-inadvertently-leaks-green-pixel-buds-a/"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a new email contains an image of olive green Pixel Buds that aren’t part of the current lineup. The interior of the case is also color-matched to the buds, which isn’t the case with the second-gen Pixel Buds. Another clue that these are new is that the inside-facing part of the earbuds is also the same green. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NIJubi"&gt;So with those things considered, we’re likely seeing the upcoming Pixel Buds A in this image. They look practically identical to the regular Pixel Buds, though the second LED inside the charging case is either gone or just not visible in this shot. There’s always the chance that someone went off and messed with the color tint here so it better matches the Pixel 5, but that’d be a little unusual.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/__V-r-jemnA7PQf1AEoKlZbHuis=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22425253/067497D5_C6AF_4CCF_89AF_33FDF8D18F5E.jpeg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://9to5google.com/2021/04/06/google-email-inadvertently-leaks-green-pixel-buds-a/" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/cite&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="p1EBPS"&gt;A &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/03/23/new-google-pixel-buds-incoming-fcc/"&gt;recent filing at the Federal Communications Commission&lt;/a&gt; is likely for these earbuds. We’ll have to wait for Google’s eventual announcement to see which features have been cut if the company indeed plans to sell these at a notably lower price than the standard Pixel Buds. With those going for $179, maybe Google will aim to hit a $99 or $129 price point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XIjFpX"&gt;Google’s second-gen Pixel Buds had some connection stability issues when they first shipped, which the company tried to address over the course of several firmware updates. But some customers continue to encounter issues like dropouts and other bugs, so hopefully Google will say a thing or two about connection strength when it does get around to announcing these Pixel Buds A.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Gazelle brings back its phone trade-in program two months after discontinuing it</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="The iPhone 12, in blue." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0wTxK49NyoGux2ayro6iaVNjl9U=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69086084/vpavic_4243_20201018_0121.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Vjeran Pavic / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="hj8AnD"&gt;Trade-in provider Gazelle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22206779/gazelle-smartphone-used-trade-in-program-shut-down"&gt;exited the online trade-in business&lt;/a&gt; back in February, and now the company says it’s changing its mind. Gazelle is back to accepting online trade-ins of iPhones, Samsung phones, Google Pixel devices, and iPads and other tablets on its website, the company confirms to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. The program resumed accepting new offers on April 5th, a Gazelle representative clarified. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oDePCQ"&gt;“Earlier this year, we announced that we will no longer be offering our trade-in option on Gazelle. After careful consideration, including feedback from customers like you, we have decided to keep Gazelle Trade-In going. Today, we are happy to say, ‘We’re back, baby!’” reads an email Gazelle sent to prospective customers and shared with &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “Gazelle Trade-In is a pioneer of the electronics trade-in space and we are happy to continue building on our legacy by offering a simple process and immediate payouts for those unwanted devices.”  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Bk0Fcj"&gt;Gazelle emerged as one of the leading trade-in providers of the smartphone era. But its business model didn’t fare as well when the US mobile phone business underwent major shifts away from two-year contracts and outright device purchases and toward phone leasing and carrier and device maker trade-in programs like Apple’s. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="8v5QVq"&gt;Gazelle &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22206779/gazelle-smartphone-used-trade-in-program-shut-down"&gt;announced&lt;/a&gt; back in December of last year it would end its online phone trade-in program on February 1st, 2021, though the company said at the time it would continue to operate its in-person trade-in kiosks through parent company ecoATM. Gazelle did confirm in the email sent to customers that it will not be bringing back its rewards program. “We will continue to evaluate the market conditions and will inform you if this changes,” the email reads. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s new gaming phone looks like a Transformer sandwich</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hCm38ReLQr5oa9S-kYJneqenSng=/0x60:1440x1020/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69085854/thescarylenovophone.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not a big fan of the design of this rumored Lenovo gaming phone, to be honest. Kind of looks like a Transformer in disguise. &lt;/em&gt; | Image: Weibo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="f3E0yE"&gt;Lenovo’s next gaming phone has leaked, with a design that looks like a Michael Bay Transformer and a gaming PC merged together. It’s unlike anything I have ever seen on a phone before. I’m not sure if I like it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BkmBqj"&gt;&lt;a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/4622920313473303"&gt;Pictures of what appears to be the phone&lt;/a&gt; were shown on the social media service Weibo recently, and I am speechless. Specifically, the dual-camera setup is located at the dead center of the phone, and there’s a built-in active cooling fan. It reminds me a lot of a Transformer, as you can see from the photo below. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="EQEFJx"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="gallery:10432513"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Y3M4Ub"&gt;Now, Lenovo is not the first company to stick a cooling fan in a gaming smartphone. In 2019, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/29/18522625/nubia-red-magic-3-gaming-phone-release-date-cooling-price-specs-features"&gt;Nubia’s Red Magic 3&lt;/a&gt; had a cooling fan placed inside of the device. The &lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fglobal.blackshark.com%2Fproducts%2Ffuncooler-pro&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Ftldr%2F2021%2F4%2F6%2F22370308%2Flenovo-phone-2-pro-release-date-price-design-leaked" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;Black Shark FunCooler Pro&lt;/a&gt; is an external cooling fan designed for people who game on their phones. Not to mention Asus’ &lt;a href="https://rog.asus.com/us/power-protection-gadgets/docks-dongles-and-cables/aeroactive-cooler-5-model/"&gt;AeroActive Cooler 5&lt;/a&gt;, an external fan designed to cool down its &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321496/asus-rog-phone-5-ultimate-review-gaming-phone-snapdragon-888-ram-specs-features"&gt;ROG Phone 5 Ultimate&lt;/a&gt; gaming phone. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pdKVLA"&gt;But the biggest concern I have for the recent images of the rumored Lenovo phone (which is rumored to be called the Legion Phone 2 Pro) is that gaming phones may continue to include more ridiculous designs. Lenovo’s first gaming phone, which launched last year, already had &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/22/21333138/lenovo-legion-duel-pro-gaming-phone-pop-up-selfie-cam-side-landscape"&gt;an absurd design by placing a pop-up camera on the side of the phone&lt;/a&gt;. But new model looks to escalate things even further. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sjCF6J"&gt;According to the leaks, Lenovo’s Legion Phone 2 Pro is rumored to launch on April 8th in China first, but it's unclear if the phone will release anywhere else. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>eBay’s app will soon be able to scan Pokémon cards to sell them more easily</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OcJxFl5d1MbZRrS0JIF8IOznhD8=/9x0:1991x1321/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69085848/Image_Listing_2.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;eBay Inc.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="V0NuaD"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ebay-cuts-listing-time-in-half-for-trading-card-sellers-with-new-feature-coming-april-2021-301254869.html"&gt;eBay has announced&lt;/a&gt; a new addition coming to its mobile app: soon, you’ll be able to scan trading cards from popular games like Pokémon, Magic: The Gathering, and Yu-Gi-Oh! to more easily sell them on the online auction site. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="z4hOQF"&gt;The new card scanning feature is set to arrive at the end of April, but it’ll only support Magic: The Gathering when it launches. Pokémon and Yu-Gi-Oh! are planned to be added in May, with sports cards and “other collectible card games” on the docket for later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="7NYeBd"&gt;Using the new scanning option, sellers will be able to just scan a card, at which point eBay will use the card’s details to help automatically build the listing. Sellers will still have to add additional information, like photos of the actual card, its condition, the price they wish to sell it for, and any other details. But the automatic identification process should make it easier for sellers to create their listings. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="zLjrxB"&gt;In addition to the new scanning feature, eBay is adding a few other improvements to the trading card purchasing process for both sellers and buyers. Sellers will no longer have to offer the option to return purchases in order to qualify for eBay’s Top Rated seller program. And the company is working on “reviewing its buyer protection policy for trading cards” to better both sellers and buyers in the current market. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="p9uU14"&gt;Trading cards — specifically, Pokémon cards — &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/10/22276531/pokemon-card-game-company-reprinting-high-demand"&gt;are in high demand these days&lt;/a&gt;. And the number of people looking to cash in is skyrocketing — to the point where appraisal company Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA) has been &lt;a href="https://www.polygon.com/22360269/pokemon-card-psa-rating-services-halted"&gt;forced to suspend submissions&lt;/a&gt; while it &lt;a href="https://www.psacard.com/articles/articleview/10367/psa-customer-update-april-2021"&gt;works through its backlog&lt;/a&gt;. And given that popularity, it’s not a surprise that eBay is looking to make it easier for sellers to use the platform to list their cards. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Alphabet shareholder pushes Google for better whistleblower protections  </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kOQwpOMovPBsVYRIFcDi5Tyzww8=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69085546/acastro_191014_1777_google_pixel_0005.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="pj0c1h"&gt;Alphabet shareholder Trillium Asset Management is pushing Google to adopt better whistleblower protections in light of the firing of prominent AI ethics researcher Timnit Gebru. The $3.5 billion sustainable investment firm has &lt;a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/57693891579fb3ab7149f04b/t/6041152193eaa01f724c5ffb/1614877985824/Alphabet+Whistleblower+Resolution+2021.pdf"&gt;filed a shareholder resolution&lt;/a&gt; asking the board of directors for a third-party review of current policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AO1SWF"&gt;“Reporting suggests that many Google employees who have resigned or been fired … publicly report retaliation after voicing human rights implications of company practices, including systemic workplace racism and sexism,” the resolution reads. “These red flags suggest the potential for culture, ethics, and/or human rights problems internally.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QtJf8x"&gt;Trillium owns 63,078 Alphabet shares— a stake currently worth roughly $140 million. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PFSbMw"&gt;Gebru was fired late last year while working on a paper about the dangers of large language models. Two months later, her co-lead Margaret Mitchell was also terminated after using a script to search her emails for evidence of discrimination against Gebru. Google claims she violated its security policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IB8IhG"&gt;Open MIC, a nonprofit that works with shareholders to advocate for greater corporate accountability and is helping to organize the proposal, says Mitchell’s firing may have been retaliatory. “The justification they use is ‘this person violated our data security work,’” says associate director Hannah Lucal. “It’s important to lift that up because they use trade secrets and data policy as an excuse for retaliating against worker organizers.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="a3Kw3x"&gt;The sentiment is echoed by the Alphabet Workers Union, &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/04/technology/google-employees-union.html"&gt;which launched in January&lt;/a&gt; in part to protect employees and contractors from retaliation. “We want to know that if a project goes off the rails our coworkers who know about it can tell us,” says Andrew Gainer-Dewar, a Google software engineer and union member. “That’s why the safety of whistleblowing is so important. And that’s what we’re trying to build with the union.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yqMENp"&gt;The new proposal is based on the still-radical idea that whistleblowers are good for business. “Whistleblowers protect investors, not management,” says Jonas Kron, chief advocacy officer at Trillium. “You naturally expect management not to be supportive of whistleblower protections because it’s not in their narrow personal interest. Whistleblowers are always an embarrassment to management and always a way for investors to protect the long term value of the company.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XYHPjW"&gt;While Trillium and Open MIC are hoping to get more Google shareholders on board with the proposal, their larger goal is making company leaders aware of the problem. “The threshold for success is open to discussion,” says Michael Connor, executive director of Open MIC. “Directors of a company are aware of every issue on the ballot. If you get 20 percent of the vote the company is aware of the issues and oftentimes the biggest shareholders will call them up and talk to them about it.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xBGeK0"&gt;Trillium and Open MIC organized a similar proposal in 2020 but were shot down. At the time, the board said it believed Google’s current policies were adequate. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="E60IzU"&gt;“Our argument this year is basically the proof is in the pudding,” says Kron. “A year ago you said everything was hunky dory and in the meantime we‘ve seen what happened with Dr. Gebru and ongoing protests by Google employees, which suggests that things aren’t working well, that there are these red flags that indicate something needs to change.”&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Google AI manager resigns following controversial firings of two top researchers</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/QzzIrTKTfgQ0QegbEs-_fJQrnsk=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/69085524/acastro_180130_1777_0003.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="oG79Di"&gt;A Google researcher manager has resigned following the controversial firings of two female leaders in his organization. Samy Bengio, who oversaw the ethical AI team prior to &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/18/22289264/google-restructuring-ethical-ai-team-timnit-gebru-firing"&gt;a reorganization in February&lt;/a&gt;, is leaving to pursue other opportunities, &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-06/google-ai-research-manager-samy-bengio-resigns-in-email-to-staff?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. His last day will be April 28th.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N2ptkY"&gt;Bengio was a strong advocate of star AI ethics researchers Timnit Gebru and Margaret Mitchell, who previously co-led the ethical AI team. Gebru was fired in December while working on a paper about the dangers of large language models. Mitchell was terminated in February after using a script to search her emails for evidence of discrimination against Gebru. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mhCAte"&gt;&lt;a href="https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=3469738016467233&amp;amp;id=100002932057665&amp;amp;comment_id=3470470943060607&amp;amp;notif_t=mentions_comment&amp;amp;notif_id=1607192244022022&amp;amp;ref=m_notif"&gt;In a statement on Facebook&lt;/a&gt; in the wake of the firing, Bengio said he was “stunned” by what happened to Gebru. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="POUJ5e"&gt;The terminations sparked outrage across the tech industry, leading multiple researchers to &lt;a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/24/tech/google-ai-ethics-reputation/index.html"&gt;decline funding&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/HadasKressGazit/status/1370432606882381829"&gt;other opportunities&lt;/a&gt; from Google. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/4/22266513/google-engineers-quit-timnit-gebru-ethical-ai-april-christina-curley-firing"&gt;Two Google engineers also quit the company in protest&lt;/a&gt;, citing Gebru’s firing as a primary reason for their resignations. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TsAAvX"&gt;After Gebru’s departure, Google reorganized its research department, slotting the ethical AI team under Marian Croak, a leader in the engineering department. The move cut Bengio’s responsibilities, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="6vRLRG"&gt;In his farewell letter to staff, Bengio reportedly said that while he was looking forward to his next challenge, leaving Google Brain was difficult. “I learned so much with all of you, in terms of machine learning research of course, but also on how difficult yet important it is to organize a large team of researchers so as to promote long term ambitious research, exploration, rigor, diversity and inclusion,” he wrote. He did not mention the firings of Gebru or Mitchell. &lt;/p&gt;
