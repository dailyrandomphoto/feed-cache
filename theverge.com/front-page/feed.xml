    <title>Apple’s new M1 Max MacBook Pro may get a virtual turbo button for High Power Mode</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/krArQY3jBfR0B6ySC0B94G31n3w=/147x0:1761x1076/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70029214/lcimg_2d0f1c7f_4824_4e90_b501_7d917bcd4ae2.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="NUm69G"&gt;Apple wants you to think of its new &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22733328/apple-macbook-pro-ports-professional-specs"&gt;M1 Max MacBook Pro&lt;/a&gt; as a beast of a machine — &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tobL8U7dQo"&gt;it actually calls it a “beast” in the ad&lt;/a&gt; — but it seems the upcoming macOS Monterey, which ships alongside the new Macs, will unleash its full potential. &lt;em&gt;MacRumors &lt;/em&gt;contributor Steve Moser has discovered a new “High Power Mode” in the operating system’s recent beta release that can “optimize performance to better support resource intensive tasks,” and apparently, spin up the fan to compensate for that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="828eeI"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;Found more information on the high power power mode in the macOS RC: “Your Mac will optimize performance to better support resource-intensive tasks. This may result in louder fan noise.” &lt;a href="https://t.co/4q3zlbyLnf"&gt;https://t.co/4q3zlbyLnf&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://t.co/0mKVekGa0M"&gt;pic.twitter.com/0mKVekGa0M&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Steve Moser (@SteveMoser) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/SteveMoser/status/1450272709787766793?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 19, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="cWiJkc"&gt;Remember when some powerful laptops came with a physical turbo button or slider? Sounds like Apple does! (Though you can certainly emulate this sort of thing by playing with power modes and fan curves on many Windows machines as well.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hRrP1S"&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacRumors&lt;/em&gt; says the new feature is exclusive to the 16-inch MacBook Pro with M1 Max, even though it’s possible to configure a 14-inch MacBook Pro with that chip as well. It also apparently won’t work with the M1 Pro or original M1 models, so you’re looking at laptops with a starting price of $3,099 and up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AReM2A"&gt;It’ll be interesting to see whether this High Power Mode unlocks additional performance, or whether it’s actually required to see the kinds of results the company claimed on stage for prolonged periods of time. Apple’s had occasional issues with thermal throttling in the past, such as in 2018 when a Core i9 MacBook Pros wound up slower than the Core i7 version under sustained loads, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/24/17605652/macbook-pro-thermal-throttling-apple-software-fix"&gt;though Apple said that particular issue was down to a bug&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/25/17611266/apple-macbook-pro-review-2018-core-i9-15-inch"&gt;fixed it with an update&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="b336qd"&gt;Apple’s paying a lot of attention to thermals these days. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/10/21559228/apple-new-macbook-air-pro-difference-arm-m1-fan-thermal-performance"&gt;The single biggest difference between the 2020 M1 MacBook Air and 2020 M1 MacBook Pro was a fan&lt;/a&gt;, and it was a meaningful difference, because the extra thermal headroom meant the Pro could sustain peak performance for longer. That’s why I won’t be surprised if this high power mode is exclusive to the 16-inch model.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>iFixit took a peek underneath the Apple Watch Series 7’s larger display</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Apple Watch Series 7 teardown" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/UQtiqu6CTaHpkru5HduODV1SUKA=/0x245:5843x4140/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70029041/Apple_Watch_S7_21_guide_1.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple Watch Series 7 teardown | Image: &lt;a class="ql-link" href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/53688/three-former-apple-engineers-helped-us-tear-down-apple-watch-series-7" target="_blank"&gt;iFixit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dYGSz2"&gt;In &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22722533/apple-watch-series-7-review-screen-watchos-features"&gt;our review of the Apple Watch Series 7&lt;/a&gt;, Dieter Bohn called it the best smartwatch while noting the new model’s changes as “smaller iterations” year-over-year than we previously expected. Even those small improvements required some reengineering. To appreciate those efforts, the folks from&lt;a href="https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;amp;xs=1&amp;amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2FNews%2F53688%2Fthree-former-apple-engineers-helped-us-tear-down-apple-watch-series-7&amp;amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F10%2F21%2F22738876%2Fapple-watch-series-7-teardown-ifixit-diagnostic" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt; iFixit teamed up with former Apple engineers to investigate the new parts&lt;/a&gt; and get some insight into how the changes came to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="fJoxT4"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2lD2llGLJzk?rel=0" style="top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; border: 0;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture;"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="JmSg7r"&gt;Ex-Apple product designer Tobias is now with &lt;a href="https://instrumental.com/about?utm_medium=Network&amp;amp;utm_source=Partner%20Referral&amp;amp;utm_campaign=Content&amp;amp;utm_group=ifixit&amp;amp;utm_subgroup="&gt;Instrumental&lt;/a&gt;. He points out &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2lD2llGLJzk"&gt;in a video&lt;/a&gt; that by looking at the back of the display, we can see that for the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/4/22708611/apple-watch-7-release-date-price-preorder"&gt;Series 7&lt;/a&gt;, Apple removed a ribbon cable, combining touch and display signals into one cable instead of two. That helped shrink the device’s bezels, but Tobias says in a video that he’s “fairly certain” the complexity of that change and how it rippled through the supply chain is the reason why this Watch was slightly delayed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="CYGtzD"&gt;A more surprising moment is when they found out that the Apple Watch Series 6 battery fits in, and works with, the newer model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="uDSNXT"&gt;Of course, another element of the teardown is what’s not inside the new Apple Watch — an old diagnostic port. Since the earliest versions, it had been hiding inside the watch’s wristband groove, but &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690061/apple-watch-series-7-wireless-dock-data-transfer-port-free"&gt;now Apple has replaced it with wireless technology&lt;/a&gt;. Is this a hint at an iPhone without ports? We can’t tell yet, but the teardown will show you how everything came together to make the device less susceptible to cracking, better at resisting dust and water, and just that tiny bit better than the Series 6.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Twitter is finally letting everyone create Spaces</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Twitter’s blue bird silhouette logo on a black background." src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZSDllvvyyCq-i1Yd3T07YWkQc0M=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70028642/acastro_180827_1777_0002.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ziSlaK"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/17/22187490/twitter-spaces-test-voice-chat-rooms"&gt;Twitter first launched Spaces in November 2020&lt;/a&gt; as an attempt to eclipse Clubhouse’s success with its own version of audio-centric chatrooms — but the ability to actually host a Space was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/3/22413033/twitter-spaces-android-ios-ticket-schedule-clubhouse-captions"&gt;limited to Twitter users with 600 followers or more&lt;/a&gt;. Now, almost one year later, Twitter is finally giving all of its users the ability to host a Space, which is a privilege that arguably should’ve been granted long ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="chGhyV"&gt;Twitter is a bit behind on its own schedule, considering it &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/10/22323767/twitter-spaces-april-release-date-plan"&gt;promised that everyone would be able to start up a Space back in April&lt;/a&gt;. The Spaces team sent out a tweet to announce the change, noting that users on both Android and iOS will now be able to host Spaces. It also offers a GIF that briefly refreshes users on how to host a Space, in case you’ve forgotten after all these months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="b3cTwz"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;the time has arrived -- we’re now rolling out the ability for everyone on iOS and Android to host a Space&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;if this is your first time hosting, welcome! here’s a refresher on how &lt;a href="https://t.co/cLH8z0bocy"&gt;pic.twitter.com/cLH8z0bocy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Spaces (@TwitterSpaces) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/TwitterSpaces/status/1451239134798942208?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;October 21, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="xaOCiW"&gt;Twitter has been getting ahead of itself over the entire year, releasing a slew of new features for Spaces, like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/5/22611609/twitter-spaces-co-host-feature-moderate-manage-social-audio-rooms"&gt;the ability to add co-hosts&lt;/a&gt; and up to 10 speakers. It created a fund for Spaces creators &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724450/twitter-spaces-accelerator-spark-clubhouse-creators"&gt;called the Spark Program&lt;/a&gt; and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/27/22644283/twitter-ticketed-spaces-live-audio-test"&gt;piloted Ticketed Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, otherwise known as audio rooms that require you to pay for entry. This is all without giving all users the most vital ability of all: the option to host their own rooms.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1W134b"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/21/22586845/clubhouse-open-beta-invite-access-android-ios"&gt;Clubhouse came out of an invite-only state in July&lt;/a&gt;, and mobile users have been able to play around with the app ever since. With Twitter only lifting restrictions on hosting privileges now, it might’ve missed an important window to get users interested in using the feature. As Spaces grows, will it hasten Clubhouse’s demise, or will it end up as &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/2/22605888/please-post-twitter-fleets-last-day-final-moments"&gt;an abandoned feature like the Stories-like Fleets&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Rare Apple VideoPad prototype scrapped by Steve Jobs set to be auctioned</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="An open Apple VideoPad in front of a blank background" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f_b6YXjP-hLqffBgOqs-LLAImHY=/0x63:960x703/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70028461/AppleVideoPad.0.jpeg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Apple VideoPad 2 | Photo: Bonhams&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dv50OY"&gt;The long-lost Apple VideoPad 2 prototype is &lt;a href="https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/26897/lot/55/"&gt;going up for auction in November&lt;/a&gt; as part of a &lt;a href="https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/26897/"&gt;History of Science and Technology auction&lt;/a&gt; by Bonhams, an international auction house, in Los Angeles. The VideoPad will be auctioned alongside other Apple prototypes and Steve Jobs memorabilia and is estimated to sell between $8,000 and $12,000. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Z2lwN2"&gt;Developed between 1993 and 1995 with VideoPad 1 and 3 (the only two examples shown to the public), this only surviving PDA prototype was Apple’s next attempt after the Newton Message Pad. Unlike the Newton Message Pad, the fold-up screen apparently included a built-in camera for video conferencing. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TNNu9o"&gt;Despite being designed to be ahead of its time, it was canceled along with Newton OS after Jobs’ return to the company in 1997. &lt;a href="https://www.bonhams.com/auctions/26897/lot/55/"&gt;According to Bonhams&lt;/a&gt;, that was after Jobs realized the technology was not yet at the level required for a positive user experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="J09er5"&gt;The device was produced from conceptual design sketches drawn by former CEO John Sculley. The design never made it to the public, but it was a super early vision for a tablet, and if you squint, you can see a line drawn between it and successful devices like &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/27/21083369/apple-ipad-10-years-launch-steve-jobs-tablet-market"&gt;the iPhone and iPad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Microsoft fixes Windows 11 AMD CPU performance issues with new update</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/qTBFbgNKMLy32uOMd4YmxPQVl5U=/100x0:1180x720/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70028206/windows11darkmode.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="EWvRsv"&gt;Microsoft is releasing a new Windows 11 update today that fixes some of the AMD CPU performance issues. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713310/windows-11-amd-ryzen-processors-performance-issues-software-update-october"&gt;AMD and Microsoft found two issues&lt;/a&gt; with Windows 11 on Ryzen processors at launch, with one causing L3 cache latency to triple and slowing performance by up to 15 percent in certain games. Microsoft is now &lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/october-21-2021-kb5006746-os-build-22000-282-preview-03190705-0960-4ba4-9ee8-af40bef057d3"&gt;fixing this particular issue with Windows 11 Build 22000.282&lt;/a&gt;, available to all Windows 11 users today as an optional update in Windows Update.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QaefpY"&gt;While the last Windows 11 update &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22723998/windows-11-update-amd-ryzen-cpu-performance-worse"&gt;made these issues worse&lt;/a&gt;, today’s patch should fix them for good on the L3 cache latency side. The second outstanding issue affects AMD’s preferred core technology, which shifts threads over to the fastest core on a processor. AMD says this second bug could impact performance on CPU-reliant tasks, and AMD has &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/faq/pa-400"&gt;already released a new chipset driver to address it&lt;/a&gt;,  under version &lt;a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support/kb/release-notes/rn-ryzen-chipset-3-10-08-506"&gt;3.10.08.506&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QvkCEW"&gt;This new Windows 11 update also includes a large amount of fixes, including one to solve an issue that prevents the Start menu from opening after your OS upgrade, and fixes to input delays for certain Bluetooth mice and keyboards. You can find the full list of fixes that are part of this patch over at &lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/10/15/releasing-windows-11-build-22000-282-to-beta-and-release-preview-channels/"&gt;Microsof&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/october-21-2021-kb5006746-os-build-22000-282-preview-03190705-0960-4ba4-9ee8-af40bef057d3"&gt;t&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/10/15/releasing-windows-11-build-22000-282-to-beta-and-release-preview-channels/"&gt;’s site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="N0fibV"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update October 21st, 5:31PM ET:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt; Added information about AMD updates.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="sJFTHu"&gt;The ongoing global chip shortage is going to be a problem for a lot longer, according to Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger, who reiterated today ahead of the &lt;a href="https://www.intc.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1505/intel-reports-third-quarter-2021-financial-results"&gt;company’s Q3 earnings&lt;/a&gt; that he expects the shortage to extend until at least 2023. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n123dc"&gt;“We’re in the worst of it now; every quarter next year, we’ll get incrementally better, but they’re not going to have supply-demand balance until 2023,” &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/21/intel-intc-earnings-q3-2021.html"&gt;Gelsinger told &lt;em&gt;CNBC&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="h1hib1"&gt;Intel rival AMD seemed to have more optimistic expectations, with AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su commenting &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/27/22697339/amd-crypto-mining-ceo-lisa-su-gpu-code-conference"&gt;at the 2021 Code Conference&lt;/a&gt; that while supply would be “likely tight” for the near future, “it’ll get better in 2022” as production capacity continues to ramp. “It gets better next year, not immediately, but it’ll gradually get better as more plants come up.” Nvidia, on the other hand, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/19/22632047/nvidia-gpu-supply-rtx-30-series-constraints-2022"&gt;shared a similar expectation of supply issues&lt;/a&gt; throughout 2022 for its GPUs. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="342Qm8"&gt;Intel’s less-than-cheerful outlook comes as the company announced a 2-percent dip in revenue for the Client Computing Group that produces its desktop and laptop chips, led by a 5-percent drop in notebook sales that Intel attributed to “notebook ecosystem constraints” — meaning that laptop companies just don’t have enough parts to go around. It’s a pattern we’ve already seen in other reports, with analysts already highlighting component shortages as a key factor in recently slowed laptop sales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside id="hqvAOq"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="readmore" data-anthem-component-data='{"stories":[{"title":"US PC market declines due to supply issues just as Windows 11 launches","url":"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/12/22722151/us-pc-market-decline-supply-issues-windows-11-launch"}]}'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;p id="XTrHgW"&gt;Part of the problem isn’t always shortages in chips specifically, but rather with combinations of parts. “We call it match sets, where we may have the CPU, but you don’t have the LCD, or you don’t have the Wi-Fi. Data centers are particularly struggling with some of the power chips and some of the networking or ethernet chips,” Gelsinger explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OCqwG7"&gt;Some of that dip was offset by growth in desktop PCs, where Intel saw revenue gains of 20 percent for the category, but those weren’t enough to compensate for the drop in notebook sales. PC sales had been on a downward track for roughly a decade, before the pandemic — and the shift for millions to remote work and school — &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575037/pc-market-q2-growth-slowing-chip-shortage-covid-demand"&gt;caused sales to skyrocket again&lt;/a&gt;. But with people starting to return to offices and in-person education, that growth was &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/13/22575037/pc-market-q2-growth-slowing-chip-shortage-covid-demand"&gt;already starting to slow down earlier this year&lt;/a&gt;, an issue that’s been compounded by recent component shortages. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="wf4zp7"&gt;Despite the dip in laptop revenue, Intel still saw its total revenue rise by 5 percent year-over-year to $18.1 billion, thanks to big growths in its data center, internet-of-things, and Mobileye groups, although Intel missed its July guidance by $0.1 billion. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Snapchat ‘family center’ might let parents know who is in their teens’ DMs</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dTb2vh"&gt;While Instagram and Facebook face increased &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22737081/facebook-instagram-mark-zuckerberg-testify-senate-child-safety-frances-haugen"&gt;scrutiny&lt;/a&gt; on how they manage their teenage audience, Snap is taking steps to ensure a safer experience for its youngest users by working on a set of family safety tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OEq9CX"&gt;In an &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/snap-ceo-evan-spiegel-says-regulation-isnt-a-cure-for-social-media-ills-11634684965"&gt;interview this week&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;em&gt;WSJ Tech Live &lt;/em&gt;(via &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/10/20/snapchat-to-introduce-family-safety-tools-to-protect-minors-using-its-app/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;TechCrunch&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), CEO Evan Spiegel spoke of his vision for allowing parents to hold their teens’ hands while the kids are navigating Snapchat. “One of the goals with the product is to open up a dialogue between parents and their children about their experiences on the app,” said Spiegel, hoping to align with parents in a time where similar platforms are &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22675130/facebook-instagram-teens-mental-health-damage-internal-research"&gt;negatively affecting&lt;/a&gt; young teens. During this interview, Spiegel also mentioned that there is an in-house parental control system in the works called the “Family Center.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ASTkI0"&gt;While the company is not ready to share details on those expanded parental controls yet, a statement given to &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt; says “the parental tools we are developing are meant to give parents better insights to help protect their kids, in ways that don’t compromise their privacy or data security, are legally compliant and offered at no charge to families within Snapchat.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Rw9WwH"&gt;Last month, Snap announced hiring a “Global Head of Platform Safety,” who will be in charge of keeping the company’s safety strategy organized and proactive. In a statement, a spokesperson says “Our overall goal is to help educate and empower young people to make the right choices to enhance their online safety and to help parents be partners with their kids in navigating the digital world.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="fsnhgk"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Evan Spiegel: “...regulators are always going to be playing catch-up”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="t2UvKi"&gt;Current parental tools for Snapchat exist but they aren’t as invasive or in-depth as third-party services such as Bark&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;or the systems proposed recently by Apple for iMessage. Still, third-party tools currently have limitations on popular devices such as iPhones, and that isn’t the only drawback.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="DdbCtd"&gt;Allowing a third party to collect information on teens in the name of child safety sets dangerous precedents for privacy and the security placed on that collected information. The potential for advanced monitoring to eat away at overall privacy and security was a key factor in the September &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/3/22655644/apple-delays-controversial-child-protection-features-csam-privacy"&gt;delay&lt;/a&gt; of Apple’s CSAM scanning tech in iOS 15. If Snapchat ends up allowing other users (parents) to see what their kids are doing remotely, a privacy hole gets punched somewhere that could have additional consequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="tcXs6F"&gt;While parents would find it beneficial to have more options to monitor their children, Spiegel is correct in stating parents should open up conversations about the technology kids are using and learn how to navigate disconcerting communications on these platforms. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="9lEa4C"&gt;Spiegel also spoke positively about the company’s human factor and how companies should do more to help regulators: “Unless businesses are proactively, you know, promoting the health and wellbeing of their community, regulators are always going to be playing catch-up.” In May, the company was hit with a lawsuit due to the death of a teenager who succumbed to cyberbullying. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/12/22431883/snap-inc-snapchat-anonymous-messaging-qa-lawsuit-teenager-death"&gt;At the time&lt;/a&gt;, the company responded by yanking API access from two anonymous messaging applications; although allowing them seems like an oversight for a company that houses communications for minors. Family Center, Spiegel hopes, will bring Snapchat into parents’ good graces and protect teens without compromising everyone’s privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5Mf3Ui"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Stardew Valley creator reveals next game, Haunted Chocolatier</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hJj8l8_d8GgPKr1V0-yvZ3bxazE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70028065/02_3f2jo.0.png" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="N7GyoS"&gt;Stardew Valley creator Eric Barone — better known as ConcernedApe — has announced his second game: &lt;a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;ConcernedApe’s Haunted Chocolatier&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which looks to expand on the &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; formula with a more fantastical setting and “magical haunted ghost chocolate.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="I2mQV4"&gt;“In this game, you will play as a chocolatier living in a haunted castle. In order to thrive in your new role, you will have to gather rare ingredients, make delicious chocolates, and sell them in a chocolate shop,” the game’s website explains. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dJQ7sk"&gt;The new title looks similar to &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt; in many respects, with Barone’s meticulous pixel art and animations (at least at this stage of development) appearing virtually identical to his previous title. Barone isn’t saying whether the new title is intended as a sequel to Stardew Valley or if it’s set in the same world at this point, though. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/0CtPagVvnsmLAABqDX_KR8zjwtk=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945691/27_246Fsdfh.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="9BNuvl"&gt;In an FAQ on the games website, Barone explains how &lt;em&gt;Haunted Chocolatier&lt;/em&gt; is both similar to and different from his previous game, describing the new title as “more of an action-RPG.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p id="skUuS8"&gt;Like &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Haunted Chocolatier&lt;/em&gt; is another “town game”, where you move to a new town and try your hand at a new way of living. You’ll get to know the townspeople, achieve your goals and make progress in many ways. All of that is similar to Stardew Valley. However, the core gameplay and theming are quite a bit different. Haunted Chocolatier is more of an action-RPG compared to Stardew Valley. And instead of a farm being the focal point of your endeavors, it’s a chocolate shop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p id="PDG4lN"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Haunted Chocolatier &lt;/em&gt;has been in development for about a year, and Barone isn’t willing to commit to a release date or even a release window yet. He does note that the title is currently single-player, with no plans for multiplayer, and that the only platform he’s “100 percent certain about” is PC, although he has “every intention of bringing it to the other major platforms as well.” Additionally, like the initial development of &lt;em&gt;Stardew Valley&lt;/em&gt;, Barone is making &lt;em&gt;Haunted Chocolatier&lt;/em&gt; single-handedly, with plans to self-publish the title. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="X2FuuS"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Tesla offers a glimpse of a future without Elon Musk</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Tesla boss visits factory construction site in Grünheide" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hKuE7XN2MzTZ4FAkOY8Ob_tGMTs=/0x0:5320x3547/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70028035/1232949449.0.jpg" /&gt;

    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="zxQUAN"&gt;Elon Musk may seem inseparable from Tesla, but on Wednesday night, the company offered the first real taste of what it might look like without its billionaire CEO.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="IvcZSO"&gt;Tesla held a regularly scheduled conference call to discuss its quarterly financial results, but — as he’d &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-26/musk-says-he-may-skip-future-tesla-earnings-calls?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;previously teased&lt;/a&gt; — Musk did not attend. His absence took what’s normally a venue for his rants and ramblings, dismissals of Wall Street, and attacks on the press and turned it into a coherent (if scripted) presentation of the company’s recent progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XGZfZg"&gt;There were fewer sideshows and a more measured tone, though the executives who spoke in Musk’s place still made some contradictions. If Musk were to leave his post atop the company, it’s likely that Tesla would look and sound a lot like how the company was presented on Wednesday night’s call.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XI79oJ"&gt;Musk has talked about stepping down from Tesla for a few years, especially after the Model 3 and Model Y helped the company find some financial stability. Perhaps most notably, in July, Musk &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-12/elon-musk-tells-court-tesla-s-solarcity-deal-wasn-t-a-bailout?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;testified in court&lt;/a&gt; that he had “tried hard not to be the CEO at Tesla, but I had to or it would die.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="8HtAPL"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Musk once said he “tried hard not to be the CEO at Tesla”&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="DTeFTD"&gt;He wasn’t kidding — he once said that the &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/11/25/elon-musk-tesla-had-single-digit-weeks-before-it-would-die.html"&gt;company was “single-digit weeks” away from collapse&lt;/a&gt; during the first big push to mass-produce the Model 3. It was around that time in 2018 that he got himself (and Tesla) &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/26/18484751/elon-musk-sec-fraud-tesla-tweets-contempt-agreement"&gt;sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission&lt;/a&gt;. The company also started facing some of the most intense waves of scrutiny about its Autopilot software. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bR0Wls"&gt;Facing all that pressure, an admittedly &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-sleep-deprivation-damage-2018-8"&gt;sleep-deprived&lt;/a&gt; Musk often used the quarterly earnings call to blow off steam. In late 2017, he yelled “shame” at journalists and their editors for &lt;a href="https://jalopnik.com/elon-musk-just-yelled-shame-at-a-bunch-of-journalists-1820059349"&gt;writing about the company’s layoffs&lt;/a&gt;. In early 2018, he cut off Wall Street analysts &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/05/03/608103257/elon-musk-to-analysts-stop-with-the-boring-bonehead-questions-on-tesla"&gt;for asking “boring, bonehead” questions&lt;/a&gt; and started the practice of fielding inquiries from retail shareholders. Three months after that, he &lt;a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/02/highlights-from-elon-musk-on-teslas-earnings-call.html"&gt;apologized to those same analysts&lt;/a&gt;. In April 2020, he said that &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/29/21242102/elon-musk-coronavirus-fascist-shelter-in-place-tesla-covid-19-safety-science"&gt;the shelter-in-place orders meant to stop the spread of COVID-19&lt;/a&gt; were “fascist.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bHJidv"&gt;There was none of that Wednesday night. Taking Musk’s place was Tesla’s chief financial officer Zachary Kirkhorn, along with vice presidents Lars Moravy and Drew Baglino. The trio bounded through pre-submitted questions from shareholders as well as live ones from the bankers. When asked about the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22724171/nhtsa-tesla-letters-fsd-beta-autopilot-recall-emergency-vehicles"&gt;investigations into Autopilot&lt;/a&gt;, they gave diplomatic answers about how they “embrace the scrutiny of [Tesla’s] products,” and preached cooperation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OtkqSR"&gt;They still massaged some things, though. Tesla is not just cooperating with NHTSA, it’s “partnering” with the safety agency on the “journey to the transition to a software-oriented vehicle,” Kirkhorn said. Tesla is being “extremely transparent” about the ongoing test of the Full Self-Driving beta software, they claimed, despite &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699361/elon-musk-tesla-full-self-driving-beta-nda-footage"&gt;making owners sign nondisclosure agreements&lt;/a&gt; until very recently.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="nVcypT"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Fewer diversions, but Musk’s big goals are still front and center&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="jqbTeB"&gt;The vibe certainly changed, but Kirkhorn and crew still obsessed over growth, much like Musk. Kirkhorn recommitted to the company’s goal of increasing the number of vehicles it builds each year by 50 percent. The Model Y is “poised to be the bestselling vehicle in the world,” Moravy said. Musk has imbued Tesla with a ton of momentum, and the executives who’ve remained with him clearly won’t slow that down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Nr6YQU"&gt;If — or when — Musk steps down as Tesla’s CEO, the company will likely resemble the one on Wednesday’s call. What’s unknowable is how Tesla would respond to Musk’s use of Twitter if he occupies a different perch. Right now, when he tweets about making changes to Tesla’s products, the people who work at the company have a pretty explicit obligation to make those changes happen. If he’s in a reduced role, or removed from the company entirely (perhaps to focus more on SpaceX’s growing operations in Texas), will Tesla’s executives give those tweets the same kind of weight? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RAUxdL"&gt;Perhaps when Musk isn’t CEO, his public proclamations will have less of an effect on the company’s sky-high stock price. Musk even said at one point that he believed the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/1/22463920/elon-musk-stock-price-tweets-sec"&gt;share price was too high&lt;/a&gt; — though that was billions of dollars worth of valuation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/11/21364073/tesla-five-way-stock-split-august-21-plan-approved-shares-accessible-cheaper"&gt;and a stock split ago&lt;/a&gt;, so the market has proven its willingness to ignore him before. (For what it’s worth, Tesla’s stock price closed higher than ever on Thursday.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="ZJsDO2"&gt;Tesla has now turned a profit in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/20/22736859/tesla-q3-earnings-profit-chip-shortage-sales-elon-musk"&gt;nine straight quarters&lt;/a&gt;, and 11 of the last 13. It’s still got its fair share of challenges ahead as it continues to build up factories in new places around the globe. But the company appears to be in the kind of shape Musk has said is required before he’d consider leaving. Maybe we’ll get a chance to evaluate his influence on Tesla from something other than the CEO role sooner than later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="TCip58"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sVNlM3"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>AT&amp;T is white-labeling Google Stadia to give you free Batman game streaming</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Batman Arkham Knight" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/SiLmkRgx4hYWZlBxSCG8_rfA-5g=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/70027946/533ca3dcc5607.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dhvWOn"&gt;Months after &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/22260994/google-stadia-platform-white-label-option"&gt;we predicted that Stadia would soon become a white-label cloud-gaming service&lt;/a&gt;, AT&amp;amp;T appears to be taking Google up on the idea. AT&amp;amp;T is offering a free browser-based version of &lt;em&gt;Batman: Arkham Knight&lt;/em&gt; exclusively for wireless customers that makes use of Stadia’s technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="sxzk2P"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;confirmed that its new game streaming experience runs on Google Stadia’s tech (via &lt;a href="https://9to5google.com/2021/10/21/att-confirms-stadia-arkham-knight-teases-cloud-gaming-ambitions/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;9to5Google&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Google announced &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/1/22260803/google-stadia-game-development-studio-shut-down-jade-raymond"&gt;the shutdown of its internal Stadia game studio&lt;/a&gt; in February. While Stadia is still available and supported by Google, the studio shutdown means Google is relying on third parties to provide all the games, and it opens up the potential for Google’s partners to use the tech.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;img alt="A screenshot of Arkham Knight demo" data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KCBJ3yKyUQMVFgIpO9PSUrP-fDw=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22945285/batman_arkham_knight_att.png"&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="WssIXv"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T is apparently the first of those partners — it released &lt;a href="https://more.att.com/play/batman/"&gt;a browser-based demo of &lt;em&gt;Batman: Arkham Knight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. “This is being powered by the Stadia technology,” an AT&amp;amp;T representative tells &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;. “For this demo AT&amp;amp;T created a front end experience to enable gamers to play &lt;em&gt;Batman Arkham Knight &lt;/em&gt;directly from their own website and the game is playable on virtually any computer or laptop.” Although AT&amp;amp;T calls it a “demo,” there’s no mention of length, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXnYZsmf-Ao"&gt;as shown in a short walkthrough of the experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="5AUFYd"&gt;AT&amp;amp;T also adds that you can stream &lt;em&gt;Arkham Knight&lt;/em&gt; at up to 1080p and 60fps, which is the same performance you’ll get if you use Stadia for free. Paid Stadia Pro subscribers have the ability to stream up to 4K at 60fps, for which AT&amp;amp;T doesn’t offer an option. On the &lt;em&gt;Arkham Knight&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;page, AT&amp;amp;T notes that the game will be “available for a limited time.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="UWT634"&gt;We also asked AT&amp;amp;T whether the company would be working on similar Stadia-powered games in the future or if it planned on establishing a game streaming service for customers. AT&amp;amp;T wasn’t able to share any additional details, but its dip into Stadia technology may open the door for other companies to follow suit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dOpuzK"&gt;Will other companies &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to partner with Stadia? Stadia’s servers may be in need of a hardware upgrade soon, and there’s no word on when that will happen. Currently, &lt;a href="https://stadia.dev/about/"&gt;the hardware in Stadia’s servers is still the same&lt;/a&gt; as when the service first launched in 2019, consisting of a custom 2.7GHz x86 processor, a custom AMD GPU offering up to 10.7 teraflops of processing power, and 16GB of RAM. In theory, this should promise powerful performance, however, that didn’t really pan out in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20970297/google-stadia-review-gaming-streaming-cloud-price-specs-features-chrome-pixel"&gt;our Stadia review&lt;/a&gt; — we discovered that 4K looked closer to 1080p.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="1tCt3I"&gt;Meanwhile, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738006/nvidia-rtx-3080-geforce-now-features-price-release-date-streaming-option"&gt;Nvidia just announced that it plans on equipping its GeForce Now servers with hardware equivalent to the RTX 3080&lt;/a&gt; by the end of this year. &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/22/22546139/xbox-xcloud-series-x-hardware-games-servers-datacenters"&gt;Microsoft even upgraded its xCloud servers&lt;/a&gt; with Xbox Series X hardware in June. Stadia will need a plan to upgrade its own hardware if it wants to keep up.&lt;/p&gt;
