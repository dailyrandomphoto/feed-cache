    <title>YouTube says it will punish Trump and other channels that continue to spread election lies</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;

        &lt;figcaption&gt;Joshua Roberts/Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="TfS9fz"&gt;YouTube will temporarily restrict channels that post videos containing widespread misinformation about the 2020 election results — potentially including the channel of President Donald Trump. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="66dVUc"&gt;Instead of simply removing videos that spread misinformation, any channel that posts videos with false claims about the election will now receive a strike, temporarily preventing them from uploading videos. This includes Trump’s channel. A YouTube spokesperson did not say how long the suspension would last. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="pXcjyh"&gt;In December, YouTube &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/9/22165355/youtube-biden-election-victory-misinformation-rules-remove-content-oan"&gt;issued a new policy&lt;/a&gt; prohibiting any content designed to spread misinformation about the outcome of the 2020 election by promoting false theories about fraudulent votes or other unverified claims. Since then, the company has removed thousands of videos, according to a company spokesperson. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dpGZkN"&gt;Prior to yesterday’s events, a grace period was in place allowing YouTube to remove videos without applying strikes to channels. This often happens when YouTube institutes new policies and it’s designed as an effort to be fair to creators while they adjust to the new rules. The grace period was set to expire on January 21st, following Inauguration Day, according to YouTube. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="Ln7kLF"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Prior to yesterday, YouTube was removing videos without applying strikes to channels as a temporary measure&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="MknGIJ"&gt;YouTube’s teams made the decision following “the extraordinary events that transpired yesterday, and given that the election results have been certified&lt;em&gt;,” &lt;/em&gt;according to a YouTube spokesperson. The company removed one of Trump’s videos that addressed a mob attack on the Capitol and also contained widespread misinformation &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217743/trump-capitol-attack-youtube-video-removed-twitter-facebook-moderation"&gt;about the election results&lt;/a&gt;. Additionally, any channel that receives three strikes within a 90 day period will be terminated in accordance with YouTube policies. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="n3XW1v"&gt;This means that channels spreading misinformation about the election results will see strikes applied to their channels if they continue. For example, channels like OANN, a right-wing news organization &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/4/21550180/youtube-oann-video-election-trump-misinformation-voting-final-results-facebook-twitter"&gt;that has perpetuated statements&lt;/a&gt; made by the president that he won the election, could receive a strike on top of having videos deleted if it were to continue uploading similar statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="y5bogF"&gt;Over the last 24 hours, several companies have taken a stricter stance against the president’s content. Twitter suspended &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;Trump’s account for 12 hours&lt;/a&gt;, threatening to ban the president outright if he posted another tweet violating the company’s policies or inciting violence. Facebook initially prevented Trump from posting to Facebook and Instagram for 24 hours, before &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced even stricter measures&lt;/a&gt; on Thursday morning that include indefinitely suspending his account for at least the next couple of weeks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="q9bf4f"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hKrBBH"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Shopify takes down Trump’s campaign store</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Shopify" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PHyNEiTgT7MgD0kNDuW8Ffh_l1Q=/0x7:4870x3254/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68632900/1211910116.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="ALcRuF"&gt;Shopify has taken down e-commerce sites from the Trump Organization and Trump campaign in response to Wednesday’s violence at the US Capitol building, &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/shopify-takes-trumpstore-com-offline-in-response-to-riot-11610035673"&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wall Street Journal&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; reported.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="KPVH7n"&gt;Both &lt;a href="http://trumpstore.com/"&gt;TrumpStore.com&lt;/a&gt; and the Trump campaign’s &lt;a href="http://shop.donaldjtrump.com/"&gt;Shop.DonaldJTrump.com&lt;/a&gt;, which sold Make America Great Again hats and other merchandise, were both offline Thursday morning. Shopify didn’t immediately reply to a request for comment from &lt;em&gt;The Verge&lt;/em&gt;, but a spokesperson told the &lt;em&gt;WSJ&lt;/em&gt; that the company’s trust and safety team had determined the president had violated company policy against promoting or supporting violence in his Wednesday comments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="XV1GJ6"&gt;“Shopify does not tolerate actions that incite violence,” the company said in a &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/DaveLeeFT/status/1347222086511546369"&gt;statement&lt;/a&gt;. Actions by the president “violate our Acceptable Use Policy, which prohibits promotion or support of organizations, platforms or people that threaten or condone violence. As a result, we have terminated stores affiliated with President Trump.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Zb03Xb"&gt;Shopify is the latest platform to block or remove the president after he incited a mob attack on the US Congress. Following the attack, Trump continued to tweet false claims about the November presidential election and told the rioters who attacked the Capitol building to “go home,” while also calling them “special people.” &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;Twitter implemented a 12-hour ban&lt;/a&gt; late Wednesday, and on Thursday, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/7/22218725/facebook-trump-ban-extended-capitol-riot-insurrection-block"&gt;Facebook expanded&lt;/a&gt; what was originally a 24-hour ban into a two-week suspension that could become permanent. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Esco57"&gt;Ottawa-based Shopify, which helps merchants set up e-commerce operations, saw huge growth during the coronavirus pandemic. On &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195719/amazon-antitrust-wsj-investigation-competition-marketplace-sellers"&gt;Black Friday, it had more than $5 billion&lt;/a&gt; in aggregate sales. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="AWkJiL"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 7th 12:06PM ET&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;: Adds statement from Shopify&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Why Google’s union is a big deal </title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Bt25TvgVqNtxp2OrCzD_1858bDE=/150x0:1770x1080/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68632784/GooglesUnion_Textless.0.jpg" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="kQORpX"&gt;On January 4th, 2021, Google workers and contractors announced they were forming a union with the Communications Workers of America. It’s the latest move in an ongoing fight between Google workers and management, and it could have big implications for the future of the tech industry. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="cJvaNG"&gt;But we didn’t get here overnight. Google workers have been standing up against executives for years. They’ve protested &lt;a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/03/06/google-is-quietly-providing-ai-technology-for-drone-strike-targeting-project/"&gt;Google’s decision to work with the Pentagon on targeted drone strikes&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/google-s-project-dragonfly-censored-search-engine-triggers-protests-n960121"&gt;build a censored search engine for China&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/technology/google-sexual-harassment-andy-rubin.html?action=click&amp;amp;module=inline&amp;amp;pgtype=Homepage"&gt;pay Android founder Andy Rubin $90 million in severance&lt;/a&gt; after he was accused of sexual harassment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="NJiQ9m"&gt;Now, the union hopes to create a structure for all of those demonstrations. Crucially, it wants to unite the interests of Google contractors with those of full-time employees. To really understand how this came together and what it could mean for the future of tech, we have to look at the big picture. &lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Facebook bans Trump ‘indefinitely’</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/krija0kzMxGSmYTLSgX3JLwWdv0=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68632641/acastro_180828_1777_facebook_0001.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="r7tiOB"&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10112681480907401"&gt;In a blog post Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that Facebook would ban President Donald Trump from its platforms “indefinitely” following a pro-Trump attack on the US Capitol this week. The ban will not be lifted before Inauguration Day, according to  Zuckerberg.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OiELAB"&gt;“The shocking events of the last 24 hours clearly demonstrate that President Donald Trump intends to use his remaining time in office to undermine the peaceful and lawful transition of power to his elected successor, Joe Biden,” said Zuckerberg. “We are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks until the peaceful transition of power is complete.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="yiLzNu"&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet"&gt;
&lt;p lang="en" dir="ltr"&gt;We believe the risks of allowing President Trump to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great, so we are extending the block we have placed on his Facebook and Instagram accounts indefinitely and for at least the next two weeks. &lt;a href="https://t.co/JkyGOTYB1Z"&gt;pic.twitter.com/JkyGOTYB1Z&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;— Facebook Newsroom (@fbnewsroom) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/fbnewsroom/status/1347211647245578241?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;January 7, 2021&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async="" src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="pca6Hr"&gt;Facebook’s decision to ban Trump is an unprecedented escalation in the platform’s approach to moderating the president’s posts. As rioters stormed the Capitol Wednesday, Facebook removed a video from Trump responding to the violence. In it, Trump made false claims about the 2020 election results, and told rioters to “go home” hours after the initial invasion began. Facebook cycled through &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217788/facebook-remove-trump-video-emergency-situation-mob-violence"&gt;three different labels&lt;/a&gt; on the video before the platform decided to remove it outright around an hour after it was posted. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="dG208K"&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/guyro/status/1346950532372393985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1346950532372393985%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2021%2F1%2F6%2F22217788%2Ffacebook-remove-trump-video-emergency-situation-mob-violence"&gt;In a statement Wednesday&lt;/a&gt;, Facebook’s vice president of integrity, Guy Rosen, declared the Capitol riot as “an emergency situation.” He continued, “We removed [Trump’s video] because on balance we believe it contributes to rather than diminishes the risk of ongoing violence.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="RMcnjM"&gt;Twitter locked Trump’s account Wednesday evening, but has not issued any longterm ban on the outgoing president. In a tweet thread Wednesday, Twitter &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/6/22217686/trump-twitter-account-locked-capitol-hill-riot-tweets-policy-violations"&gt;announced the block&lt;/a&gt; as a response to three tweets that violated its policies. Once Trump removed those tweets, the 12 hour lockout period began. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="mOYdy7"&gt;“Future violations of the Twitter Rules... will result in permanent suspension of the @realDonaldTrump account,” said Twitter’s policy account after putting the block in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="OqcFtl"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Elon Musk passes Jeff Bezos to become the richest person on Earth</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="Elon Musk Awarded With Axel Springer Award In Berlin" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gsH4hZV_o_h3jTpGSEWAl2cbTQo=/0x19:5333x3574/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68632580/1229892934.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Britta Pedersen / Pool / Getty Images&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="HzofYK"&gt;Elon Musk has become the wealthiest person on the planet, surpassing Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, thanks to the continued rise in Tesla’s stock price. Musk is now worth around $188 billion, according to &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg’s Billionaires Index&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="3OBk7f"&gt;“How strange,” Musk &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1347204459147902978?s=21"&gt;tweeted&lt;/a&gt; Thursday. “Well, back to work ...” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="PbxEyt"&gt;Musk eclipsing Bezos’ own extravagant personal wealth of around $187 billion marks the latest development in a years-long rivalry between the two tech magnates — one that often centers on the accomplishments of their respective businesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="hXBtHJ"&gt;Bezos was reportedly so envious of Musk’s success in &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/8/10937076/tesla-gigafactory-battery-factory-nevada-tax-deal-elon-musk"&gt;securing a $1.3 billion incentive package&lt;/a&gt; for Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada that it served as the genesis for Amazon’s &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-02-03/amazon-s-hq2-fiasco-was-driven-by-bezos-envy-of-elon-musk?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;beauty pageant-style search for its second headquarters&lt;/a&gt;. Bezos has a spaceflight company in Blue Origin much like Musk does with SpaceX. The two men have &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/21/10641840/jeff-bezos-congratulatory-rocket-landing-tweet-spacex-clinical-shade"&gt;traded&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/669194136248041472?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"&gt;barbs&lt;/a&gt; about their rockets and even &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/24/4553652/jeff-bezos-and-elon-musk-battle-for-nasa-space-shuttle-launchpad"&gt;fought over hallowed NASA real estate&lt;/a&gt;. (SpaceX won that fight and is the only of the two companies to successfully reach orbit.) &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="c-float-right"&gt;&lt;aside id="vB1L0R"&gt;&lt;q&gt;Musk and Bezos have been rivals of sorts for years&lt;/q&gt;&lt;/aside&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Dmq9YQ"&gt;Musk &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/24/21612410/elon-musk-overtakes-bill-gates-to-become-worlds-second-richest-person-behind-jeff-bezos"&gt;only just passed Bill Gates&lt;/a&gt; in November to become the second-richest person in the world. The Tesla CEO saw his personal wealth skyrocket in 2020 to the tune of more than $150 billion, in large part because Musk owns a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of Tesla stock — about 20 percent of the company, in fact. And Tesla’s stock has grown incredibly valuable over the last year or so, too, as Musk pulled the company out of so-called “production hell” and dramatically increased sales of its electric vehicles, thanks to the more affordable Model 3 sedan and Model Y SUV. That coincided with an &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-07/retail-investors-pocket-gains-with-eye-toward-bumpy-year-end?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;incredible rise of retail investors&lt;/a&gt; who were &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2020-12-24/bloomberg-wealth-the-investors-who-became-millionaires-with-just-one-stock?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;more willing to fully buy into Tesla’s story&lt;/a&gt; than many on Wall Street once were. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="719ZIv"&gt;The billionaire CEO’s stock stash continues to grow, especially after he signed a major &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/21/17147678/elon-musk-tesla-ceo-compensation-award-plan"&gt;10-year compensation package&lt;/a&gt; with the company in 2018 that further tied his earnings to Tesla’s stock price and revenue goals. He is awarded a raft of company stock options every time a new milestone is hit; the first tranche, which he received earlier this year, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21273882/elon-musk-tesla-compensation-plan-stock-award-dollars"&gt;was worth some $800 million&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="QqpqS6"&gt;Like most billionaires, Musk has only seen his overall wealth increase during the coronavirus pandemic. But unlike that peer group, Musk claimed in court to be “&lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-techs-cash-poor-billionaire-11588967043"&gt;cash poor&lt;/a&gt;” and “financially illiquid” in 2019 and said last year that he would sell “&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1256239554148724737"&gt;almost all physical possessions&lt;/a&gt;,” including his mansions. He takes loans against the stock that makes him so wealthy and plows that money back into his companies, like when he dumped &lt;a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-04-16/musk-s-boring-co-raises-113-million-for-tunnels-and-hyperloop?sref=ExbtjcSG"&gt;around $100 million into The Boring Company in 2018&lt;/a&gt;. Musk has a long history of using his own personal wealth to fund new endeavors, too, as he funded Tesla and SpaceX after becoming a millionaire running Zip2 and PayPal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="r1ORIj"&gt;Musk may now be the richest man on Earth by the standards of money-focused outlets like &lt;em&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;, though they tend to focus on calculating knowable assets. However, authoritarian leaders like Vladimir Putin and Mohammed bin Salman are both extremely personally wealthy in &lt;a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/how-putin-spends-his-mysterious-fortune-2017-6"&gt;ways that are harder to calculate&lt;/a&gt; and also have unchallengeable access to the vast wealth of their nations.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p id="ATNSTs"&gt;&lt;a href="https://news.harman.com/releases/experience-3d-surround-sound-with-the-jblR-bar-5-0-multibeamtm-soundbar"&gt;JBL’s Bar 5.0 Multibeam&lt;/a&gt; is a new soundbar which is its first to offer Virtual Dolby Atmos thanks to its Multibeam technology. It will be available for $399.95 (£349.99) starting later this spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="l1YkGS"&gt;The announcement of the JBL Bar 5.0 comes a year after the company announced its first Dolby Atmos soundbar, the &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/1/6/21051720/jbl-soundbar-speakers-bar-9-1-dolby-atmos-detachable-rear-ces-2020"&gt;JBL Bar 9.1&lt;/a&gt;. The previous Atmos soundbar used upward-firing drivers to bounce sound off the ceiling to give the impression of it coming from above. In contrast, the new JBL Bar 5.0, which costs less than half the price of its predecessor, uses virtualization to achieve what JBL claims is a similar effect. It’s unlikely to sound as convincing, but the result is a much more affordable soundbar.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1Crms9FMyZc4qYFK0cgvii0qrEo=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217436/JBL_BAR_5.0_MULTIBEAM_DETAIL_1_0047_x1.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: JBL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The soundbar packs in five drivers and four passive radiators.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oqlWwh"&gt;The JBL Bar 5.0 uses five drivers (three forward-facing and two side-facing), and four passive radiators to create its sound. It supports streaming via Bluetooth, Alexa (including multiroom audio), Apple AirPlay 2, and has Chromecast support built in. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bN6nfI"&gt;The JBL Bar 5.0 isn’t the only new device the company is announcing today. There’s also the &lt;a href="https://news.harman.com/releases/play-endlessly-with-the-jblR-charge-5-portable-bluetooth-speaker"&gt;JBL Charge 5&lt;/a&gt;, which is a new Bluetooth speaker costing $179.95 (£159.99) that will be available beginning in March. It offers 20 hours of playback and contains a 7,500mAh battery that can be used to charge external devices.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gSAw61Zofp50CIvkLdqd-5FhVT0=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22217449/JBL_Charge_5_Marina_Charging.png"&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The JBL Charge 5 has a 7,500mAh battery and can charge external devices.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="n522sE"&gt;Finally, JBL also has a &lt;a href="https://news.harman.com/releases/jblR-expands-live-series-with-four-new-headphones-designed-to-elevate-lifes-experiences"&gt;collection&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href="https://news.harman.com/releases/jblR-launches-tour-headphone-series-designed-for-business-professionals"&gt;headphones&lt;/a&gt; to announce. There’s the $129.95 (£119.99) JBL Live 460NC noise-canceling on-ear headphones that have up to 50 hours of battery life and will be available from March. The &lt;a href="https://news.harman.com/releases/jblR-bolsters-its-reflect-series-with-the-new-reflect-mini-nc-tws"&gt;JBL Reflect Mini NC&lt;/a&gt; true wireless earbuds are also releasing in the US this spring, where they’ll cost $149.95. The JBL Live Pro Plus noise-canceling true wireless earbuds cost $179.95 (£169.99) and will go on sale in April. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="I5lJGR"&gt;Next are the over-ear JBL Live 660NC noise-canceling headphones that feature up to 50 hours of battery life and will cost $199.95 (£159.99) when they go on sale in March. The JBL Tour Pro Plus noise-canceling, true wireless earbuds will also cost $199.95 (or £179.99 in the UK) and release in May. JBL has also announced US pricing and a March 14th release date for &lt;a href="https://news.harman.com/releases/jblR-tune-series-enhances-everyday-experiences-with-four-new-headphones"&gt;four headphones in its Tune series&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="wfOOcA"&gt;Finally, the most expensive new headphones being announced today are the $299.95 (£279.99) JBL Tour One noise-canceling over-ear headphones that feature up to 50 hours of playback. They’ll go on sale starting in May. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="xkL7E0"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update January 7th, 11:09AM ET: &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Updated with additional headphones announced by JBL today.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>JBL snuck modern streaming tech into a gorgeous retro stereo amp</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/xBqZ86xp0JFVLMRpwM9CSoVgdzA=/0x0:6600x4400/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68632507/JBL_SA750_uncropped.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The SA750 looks straight out of the 70s.&lt;/em&gt; | Image: JBL&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JnS8XF"&gt;The &lt;a href="https://news.harman.com/releases/releases-20210105"&gt;JBL SA750&lt;/a&gt; is a new stereo amplifier pairing modern streaming technologies like Airplay 2 and Google Chromecast with a design that wouldn’t look out of place in a hi-fi rack from the ‘60s or ‘70s. It’s got a set of reassuringly chunky-looking dials and switches as physical controls, an understated display, and its sides are covered with wood veneers. The amplifier, whose release coincides with JBL’s 75th anniversary, will cost $3,000 when it goes on sale beginning this May.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="15SqjD"&gt;Alongside its wireless connectivity, which includes support for UPnP alongside Apple and Google’s protocols, the JBL SA750 has all the wired inputs you’d expect. There are six pairs of analog RCA inputs, a 3.5mm aux in, and two optical and two coaxial digital inputs alongside USB and Ethernet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/m9QXi-XnL619S0S7NOtlA4Y4c-U=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22219616/JBL_L100_Classic_75.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: JBL&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The JBL L100 Classic 75 speakers have a similar retro design.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="D1af3w"&gt;As a standalone stereo amplifier, you’ll need to plug in a separate set of speakers to listen to the JBL SA750. To that end it’s got two pairs of binding-post speaker connectors, and it can output up to 220W of power per channel. We’re sure JBL would love to sell you a pair of its new &lt;a href="https://news.harman.com/releases/still-blown-away-after-all-these-years-jbl-launches-75th-anniversary-edition-of-l100-loudspeaker"&gt;L100 Classic 75&lt;/a&gt; loudspeakers to use alongside it, but at $5,500 a pair, they’re far from an economical choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="bMMYgN"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Here’s what Hitman 3 will look like in virtual reality</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/hyxcrh8p014SAIrxFePbGMbop70=/40x0:480x293/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68632454/HITMAN_3___SANDBOX_VR_PSVR.0.gif" /&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="JolEDl"&gt;IO Interactive &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6_9kxRX0mk"&gt;released a trailer&lt;/a&gt; that shows off what the VR mode in &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt; actually looks like. In short, it’s probably like what you imagined if you’ve played the recent games — which means it looks like a lot of fun. The hands-on look shows Agent 47 doing a lot of shooting and trap-setting, as well as an array of mundane tasks used to stay disguised during missions. There appear to be a few immersive moments created just for the virtual reality component, like tapping an enemy on the shoulder and quickly getting out of sight to fool them. And just like the base game, there seems to be a load of interactable objects, which should translate well to virtual reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="BR5fGZ"&gt;One thing I’m curious about with this VR mode is its difficulty. &lt;em&gt;Hitman&lt;/em&gt; is a notoriously tough game, especially if you want to complete every objective without alerting enemies. There are usually enemies coming at you from all angles, and there’s just a lot to pay attention to. Though, like all trailers, this one released today makes the VR mode seem even more like an action romp. Not being able to see Agent 47’s shiny, barcode-laden noggin makes it look like a proper James Bond game, which, ironically, &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/19/21575090/james-bond-game-origin-io-interactive-007-project-hitman"&gt;is the studio’s next project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="kqtGSA"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N6_9kxRX0mk?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="Cb65Me"&gt;As the developer promised when the mode was announced in 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.ioi.dk/hitman-vr/"&gt;every location from the recent &lt;em&gt;Hitman &lt;/em&gt;titles will &lt;/a&gt;be playable in virtual reality via PlayStation VR. To be clear, you’ll need to already own &lt;em&gt;Hitman&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Hitman 2&lt;/em&gt; to play those levels in VR, and &lt;em&gt;Hitman 3&lt;/em&gt; will offer a way to import those environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="LluisB"&gt;For now, this mode is coming only to the PS4 and PS5 versions of the game via a PlayStation VR headset. But since the game is releasing on PC, it’s possible that we’ll see this mode make its way at some point to other platforms, like Steam VR or Oculus. The base game will also release on January 20th for the systems mentioned above as well as Xbox One, Xbox Series S and X, Google Stadia. It’s also coming to the Nintendo Switch via cloud streaming tech.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>The 44mm Apple Watch SE is $40 off at Amazon</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dQ0BT9Zy3KUblKrv-NwFor20Plo=/0x0:2040x1360/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68632180/dseifert_200930_4218_0010.0.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;Photo by Dan Seifert / The Verge&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="Xqsrgx"&gt;Amazon is offering a good deal on the 44mm-sized &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21496928/apple-watch-se-review-smartwatch-wearos-price-specs-features"&gt;Apple Watch SE&lt;/a&gt; (GPS). Normally $309, it’s $270 for the model built with space gray aluminum that comes with a black sport band. For now, this puts both the 40mm and larger 44mm Apple Watch SE at the same price. If you’re wondering where the SE sits among all of Apple’s recent smartwatches in terms of specs, it has the same processor as the Apple Watch 5, but it notably lacks its ECG capability and the ability to have an always-on display. No other retailers are currently offering this deal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id="q5AgAe"&gt;&lt;div data-anthem-component="productcard:9514947"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id="Xo5RQZ"&gt;&lt;div style="left: 0; width: 100%; height: 0; position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%;"&gt;&lt;iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D3BnS8qUfTo?rel=0" style="border: 0; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute;" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="encrypted-media; accelerometer; clipboard-write; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p id="GIfrF3"&gt;If you bought a PS5 or received one as a gift over the holidays, you can add &lt;em&gt;Godfall &lt;/em&gt;to your lineup of games today for less than it usually costs. The third-person game normally costs a full $70, &lt;a href="https://shop-links.co/1728753977509596763" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank"&gt;but the disc version is $40 today only at Best Buy&lt;/a&gt;. I haven’t played this title, but I’ve heard that you’re most likely to enjoy it if you like games like &lt;em&gt;Warframe &lt;/em&gt;and &lt;em&gt;Destiny&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;with nonstop action encounters that only end to let you collect a lot of loot for your character.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p id="jirPH4"&gt;Sam’s Club members can still take advantage of the best deal I’ve seen yet for &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/21262459/razer-opus-review-wireless-noise-canceling-headphones-thx-over-ear-price-specs"&gt;Razer’s Opus&lt;/a&gt; noise-canceling headphones. These usually cost $200 (with the lowest previous price at $150), but you can snag them at Sam’s Club for just $80 for one more day. The Opus justify their full price, but at $80 I think you really should just get yourself a set. The noise cancellation effect, sound quality, battery life, and overall design are surprisingly good for a relatively budget-friendly set of over-ear headphones. The biggest barrier to getting these is the paid Sam’s Club membership.&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Lenovo’s new Yoga all-in-one has a rotating display for better TikTok videos and Twitter scrolling</title>
    <content type="html">  

    &lt;figure&gt;
      &lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/AOQSvxaucEbXzCvV-uOqoONvsTM=/0x0:1200x800/1310x873/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/68632136/lenovo.0.jpg" /&gt;
        &lt;figcaption&gt;The Yoga AIO 7 in its rotated configuration | Image: Lenovo&lt;/figcaption&gt;
    &lt;/figure&gt;

  &lt;p id="dtEIpt"&gt;Lenovo has a new Yoga computer out, but it’s not a laptop — it’s the new Yoga AIO 7 desktop. But while it may look like a standard all-in-one desktop, like its more portable cousins, the Yoga AIO 7 does have a display trick up its sleeve: the entire screen can rotate around, transforming the 27-inch landscape monitor into a vertical form factor. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="oM9v9D"&gt;Of course, the ability to rotate a display isn’t a wholly new idea. Standalone desktop monitors have offered the feature for years, making it easier for users to display content that’s better suited to a taller panel like Twitter feeds, long documents, or TikTok videos. But it’s far rarer to see the concept on an all-in-one computer. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class="e-image"&gt;
        &lt;img alt=" " data-mask-text="false" src="https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/boRyXvu-QEsXyIU96Vz9bI6z_9Y=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22219478/lenovo2.jpg"&gt;
      &lt;cite&gt;Image: Lenovo&lt;/cite&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Yoga AIO 7 in its standard mode.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p id="oPwHVa"&gt;The idea is reminiscent of &lt;a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/5/21050604/samsung-sero-tv-rotate-vertical-video-tiktok-ces-2020"&gt;Samsung’s Sero TV from last year&lt;/a&gt;, a similarly rotating product that scaled up the idea to a full-sized 43-inch television in response to the popularity of vertical video formats from apps like Instagram and TikTok (which, in turn is directly due to the ubiquity of smartphones with video cameras). Lenovo seems aware of the potential for a vertical TV, promising a future software update that will effectively let the AIO 7 double as a full-fledged 4K smart TV.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="Wqxj1Q"&gt;As for the specs, the Yoga AIO 7 offers a choice between two 27-inch 4K panels (one regular and one that meets Adobe RGB and DCI-P3 color standards); a choice between AMD’s Ryzen 7 4800H and Ryzen 5 4500H CPUs; Nvidia’s integrated RTX 2060 GPU; either 16GB or 32GB of RAM; and a mix of PCIe and HDD storage options (topping out at a 1TB SSD and a 2TB hard drive, respectively).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="yZhDjm"&gt;Of particular note is how Lenovo is taking advantage of USB-C with the Yoga AIO 7. Plug in your laptop with a USB-C cable, and you’ll be able to use the Yoga AIO 7’s hardware — including the display, speakers, mouse and keyboard, power supply, and even the integrated hard drive — directly with your laptop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p id="EXdoPX"&gt;The Yoga AIO 7 is already available in China (where its called the Yoga 27), but it’ll be out in “select markets” in February starting at $1,599. &lt;/p&gt;
